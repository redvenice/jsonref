They are taking unprecedented steps to safeguard airport staff and operations, which could include in some cases considering shutting down for a period of time. This could have major impacts for UK communities and businesses.’The AOA has demanded a support package including extending business rate relief to airports and deferring all aviation taxes.Airlines such as easyJet and Ryanair have grounded their entire fleet, while bigger carriers such as BA and Virgin Atlantic have cut schedules by up to 90 per cent.

The Treasury said: ‘We are willing to consider the situation of inidual firms, so long as all other Government schemes have been explored and all commercial options exhausted.’In the United States, airlines have been warned that any government bailouts would require improvements in emissions standards. Andrew Murphy of campaign group Transport \u0026amp Environment said he wants airlines using more low-carbon fuel and pay tax on kerosene and international ticket sales. He said: \u0027Airlines calling for public support in bad times should accept they need to start paying taxes in good times.\u0027Democrats on Capitol Hill have proposed requiring airlines to cut emissions by 25 per cent within 15 years and 50 per cent by 2050 in return for a $40billion grant.  In Australia, any Qantas rescue would likely require faster progress on carbon, sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.The coronavirus shutdown is likely to result in a full-year decline in emissions from aviation and other industries.

We are in regular contact with the aviation sector, doing everything that we can to help. There are ... contacts going on as we speak, he added.UK airlines such as easyJet, IAG-owned British Airways and Virgin Atlantic have almost no revenue coming in after demand for air travel came to a standstill, forcing them to ground hundreds of planes and putting thousands of jobs and the future of the sector at risk.The British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA) said on Wednesday the suggestion that the government would not provide financial backing for airlines was misleading.It said discussions about unique measures for inidual airlines were ongoing and called on the government to protect jobs in the sector.‘It is unhelpful that correspondence is leaked out of the context of discussions. It gives rise to the erroneous conclusion that there is no chance of any government help for UK airlines. I\u0027ve said before that there is no \u0027one size fits all\u0027 solution,’ BALPA General Secretary Brian Strutton said.‘The government will be looking at areas such as the airline\u0027s financial state, whether it could raise the cash in other ways, or if it\u0027s crucial to the UK transport system.

An owl once nearly knocked him out when it flew at him and hit his head in one ruined church.But, undeterred, Cameron — in his mid-50s — has pressed doggedly towards his goal.         Mr Newham (pictured at Weston Church, Otley, Yorkshire) is out from dawn to dusk, in rain, sun, hail and biting winds, fulfilling his quest          The photographer (at All Saints\u0027 Church in Otley, Yorkshire) has now ticked off more than 9,000 churches          Pictured: The ruins of Old Church at Colston Bassett, Nottinghamshire, which was taken by Mr Newham in June 2016He has now ticked off more than 9,000 churches and developed a smartphone app, Keyholder For Parish Churches, to make churches more accessible, both in person — providing all possible information for visitors — but also online, with thousands of amazing photographs, particularly useful right now, with everyone stuck at home.After 23 years, he is more committed than ever. \u0027This is my gift to the future.\u0027I expect these pictures will still be available in 500, maybe 1,000 years,\u0027 he says. \u0027I will be the modern Pevsner.\u0027On paper, Cameron isn\u0027t the obvious candidate to provide single-handedly a photographic record of the Anglican Church\u0027s rural heritage. He hails from Perth, Australia, loathed history at school, isn\u0027t remotely religious — and he isn\u0027t even a professional photographer.But he is passionate about our parish churches. \u0027They\u0027re the best buildings in their communities but they are taken for granted,\u0027 he says.              While visiting Holy Trinity Church in Norfolk, the photographer took a picture of the wax funeral effigy of Sarah Hare (left) and inside St.Michaels Church in Ashton, Devon, he was able to capture a painted panel (right)         Mr Newham visited Long Compton Parish Church in Warwickshire (pictured) in 1997              The photographer has also visited St.Michaels Church (left) in Littlecotes, Lincolnshire, and St Mary, St Katharine \u0026amp All Saints (right) in Edington, Wiltshire         While visiting St.Cuthberts Church in Elsdon, Northumberland, Mr Newham was able to capture the horse skulls kept inside a cabinet\u0027People should use them more and remember that they house most of the best sculptures, paintings and monuments in this country.\u0027It all started in 1996 when Cameron moved to London to work as an IT consultant. Finding weekends in the suburb of Pinner rather dreary, and inspired by Pevsner\u0027s books, he decided to photograph some of the structures featured, but not pictured.The first church he photographed was St Peter \u0026amp St Paul in Long Compton, Warwickshire. To start with, it was all nice and simple. He had a compact camera and took just three pictures at each place.But when he upgraded to a digital camera, the project grew and he decided to focus on parish churches.         Meanwhile in St.Peters Church, Low Toynton, Lincolnshire, the photographer was able to capture the ruins               Mr Newham has photographed a holy water font (left) at St.Mary the Virgin Church in Thorpe Arnold, Leicstershire, and effigies of Sir Thomas Hewar and his wife inside St.Edmunds church in Emneth, Norfolk (right)\u0027It just sort of expanded,\u0027 he says. \u0027The first county I \u0027did\u0027 was Berkshire — I just knocked it off in bits, one by one. Then things rapidly ramped up. I never really foresaw the scale.\u0027Or, presumably, the hundreds of thousands of hours it would absorb. His commitment and stamina are extraordinary.On a summer\u0027s day, and if all key holders are obliging, he can get through up to eight churches in a 12-hour shift, followed by a couple more hours typing up his notes and transferring hundreds of photographs back at his home, now near Bradford, West Yorks.Often, he doesn\u0027t even take a packed lunch, only pausing for a snack. He has spent pretty much every day off from his job on the project.A couple of years ago, he took 18 months off work to photograph all 847 of Devon and Cornwall\u0027s rural churches — even moving to Plymouth.              Also in the photographer\u0027s album in All Saints Church in Hessle, East Yorkshire (left), and St.Mary the Virgin Church in Isles Abbotts, Somerset (right)         Mr Newham was able to photograph a holy water font inside Holy Cross Church, Greenford, London, in 2018Together, we visit All Saints church in Weston, Yorkshire. It is a small Grade I listed building built in the 11th century. The interior is relatively simple, with whitewashed walls and box pews.Cameron strides about with his trusty Canon, admiring the stained glass, coats of arms and hatchments and talks me through various photographic challenges. \u0027Clear glass windows and dark pews — my worst photography nightmare,\u0027 he says. Church clutter is another bête noire. He still can\u0027t explain the vanishing couple in Bucklebury. \u0027I said \u0027hello\u0027 several times and they did not reply, which I thought was very rude,\u0027 he says. So he waited in the chancel for them but they disappeared.So far, he has only twice woken up and thought, \u0027Oh no, not today\u0027. He went anyway.He still walks into every new church with excitement, never consults Pevsner beforehand for fear of spoiling the surprise and can remember every church he\u0027s visited. \u0027They all have very different personalities — some are simple, others are ornate.\u0027And sometimes I really like the smell,\u0027 he says. \u0027You can\u0027t possibly compare them.\u0027Surprisingly, Cameron\u0027s least favourite church is one overflowing with architectural treasures.          While inside St.Michaels Church in Ashton, Devon, Mr Newham photographed its painted panels His ideal job is a \u0027nice Victorian box with nothing in it. That\u0027s a ten-minute job\u0027. So far, the Parish Church Photographic Survey project has cost him about £150,000 in fuel and accommodation, nothing compared to the millions it would cost a professional photographer.\u0027This is a serious piece of work,\u0027 he explains. \u0027It is not some dalliance. For many churches, these will be the best shots possible and it\u0027s also propagating me into the future. I\u0027m not married and I don\u0027t have children so it is my legacy. So it is important to finish it.\u0027To which end, he is militarily organised. Each year he produces an extremely detailed Annual Report of his progress and any beauties he\u0027s come across in his travels.He has also appointed a group of trustees to make sure that if, God forbid, something should happen to him, the tens of thousands of hours he has spent are not in vain.\u0027There are people to look after it and money to pay for it be finished,\u0027 he says. \u0027I can\u0027t risk losing it at this stage.\u0027 While gruelling, the project is not as solitary as it sounds.He has had to conquer his natural shyness to liaise with countless church wardens and vicars, has met thousands of lovely people and made many friends through church appreciation groups.And if a church is locked, he does not despair. First, he\u0027ll use the Diocesan Directory, then he\u0027ll try the achurchnearyou.com website and, finally, he\u0027ll pull out his magic trick.\u0027Knock on the door of any house near the church with neatly tended flower pots and hanging baskets,\u0027 he explains. \u0027Because chances are, it will belong to a little old lady and if she doesn\u0027t have the key, she will know who does.\u0027 Happily, more and more churches are open today than ever before, but attendance continues to fall and many are in decline.Now the end is in sight for his epic project, Cameron says friends who once thought him bonkers are some of his strongest supporters.But progress seems slower than ever. By his calculations, it should take him between two and three years to photograph the last couple of thousand.\u0027If I had been really committed, I would probably have been finished years ago\u0027, he says. \u0027I\u0027m quite lax about the project actually.\u0027Lax? Surely not. He is breathtakingly organised and a total perfectionist — already fretting about some of his earlier work.\u0027I often find myself popping back to redo a church,\u0027 he says. \u0027And I would like to do Warwickshire and Berkshire again, at better resolution.\u0027 Surely that will add on another two years? \u0027Well, perhaps just the churches with interesting things in them,\u0027 he concedes.I am beginning to suspect he doesn\u0027t want it to end. What will he do when, finally, his 12,000th church is photographed? Will there be a big celebration?\u0027Maybe a nice pub lunch with friends, like I did on the 20th anniversary,\u0027 he says. \u0027And we\u0027ll probably take some pictures outside a church as well.\u0027And what will he do with all those spare weekends, all that freedom?\u0027Oh but this is only part one,\u0027 he says, looking utterly delighted. \u0027This is just the field work. Part two is putting it all together. At a leisurely pace that will take me at least another seven to 10 years.\u0027 For more information, download Cameron\u0027s Key Holder For Parish Churches app or visit explorechurches.org "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3dedb9bf6435bc7a4a09334848ea41d31cd0caa/0_169_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c915b5fc24aeb4193cd34ec1a286fd6","title":"10 coronavirus covid busting designs","story":"Companies the world over are directing their ingenuity at the fight against the coronavirus. Here are the front-runners, from sanitising robots to a 3D-printed hospital wardDesigners, engineers and programmers have heard the klaxon call. The last few weeks have seen a wave of ingenuity unleashed, with both garden-shed tinkerers and high-tech manufacturers scrambling to develop things that will combat the spread of Covid-19.Many of their innovations raise as many questions as they answer, though. Could 3D printing now finally come into its own, with access to open-source, downloadable designs for medical parts? If so, will intellectual property infringements be waived, or will altruistic hacktivists still face costly lawsuits? Could mobile phone tracking map the spread of infection like never before, keeping people away from virus hotspots? If so, might governments use the pandemic as an excuse to ramp up surveillance measures post-crisis?From 3D-printed respirator valves to UV-sanitising robots, here are 10 inventions that the battle against coronavirus has spawned so far.Biochemists at Manchester University have developed a snood with “germ trap” technology. The result of a 10-year project with biotech firm Virustatic, the snood has now been hurried into production. Its creators say the fabric coating has a similar formation to the carbohydrate structures on the surfaces of the cells that cover the oesophagus. They created the technology by attaching glycoproteins to carbon cloth, then to other cheaper materials such as cotton.Our Robocop future just got one alarming step closer thanks to Chinese tech firm Kuang-Chi Technologies. The Shenzhen-based company has developed a smart helmet that can detect people with a fever up to five metres away, sounding an alarm when anyone with a high temperature comes close.The headset, which is already used by police in Shenzhen, Chengdu and Shanghai, features an infrared temperature detector, an augmented-reality visor, a camera that can read QR codes, plus wifi, Bluetooth and 5G so it can beam data to the nearest hospital. Equipped with facial recognition technology, the helmet can also display the subject’s name on the AR visor, as well as their medical history.According to the developer, it would only take officers two minutes to scan a queue of more than 100 people with the help of the helmets, while one big hospital would only need 10 such helmets to cover every corner of its site. Reassuring in a pandemic, perhaps, but a terrifying prospect the rest of the time.An Italian company came to the rescue after a hospital ran out of crucial valves for its ventilators. The hospital in Chiari, in the Brescia area of northern Italy hit hard by the virus, had 250 coronavirus patients in intensive care, and was short of venturi valves – which connect the ventilator to a patient’s face mask, and need to be replaced for each patient.After the original supplier was unable to provide new valves quickly enough, the hospital put out a call for help. Isinnova contacted the manufacturer, Intersurgical, but was unable to obtain a digital model of the part, so its team decided to reverse-engineer its structure themselves. The first prototype was ready within six hours, with 100 working valves printed and supplied to the hospital within a day.South Korea has been leading the way in testing its citizens for Covid-19, with nearly 20,000 people tested every day, more people per capita than anywhere else in the world. As well as pioneering drive-through centres, where people with symptoms can check their health status, one hospital in Seoul has introduced new testing booths that allow medical staff to examine patients from behind the safety of a plastic panel.The phone box-like cubicles use negative air pressure to prevent harmful particles from escaping outside. Each patient steps into the booth for a rapid consultation via an intercom, while samples can be safely taken by swabbing their nose and throat using arm-length rubber gloves built into the panel. The whole process takes about seven minutes and the booth is then disinfected and ventilated.“We used to collect samples inside a large negative-pressure room,” says Kim Sang-il, president of the H Plus Yang hospital where the booths are in use. “It took a long time to disinfect the place. We used to take eight to nine samples per day, but we can now take 70 to 80.”Tired of pulling your sleeve over your hand to touch the door handle? Belgian 3D printing company Materialise has designed a hands-free door handle attachment. Under the slogan “Do less harm, use your arm!”, the design, which has been made available to download for free, consists of two simple parts that can be screwed either side of a handle, allowing you to use your arm or elbow to turn the handle.“Door handles are said to be among the most contagious places in a building,” says the company’s CEO, Fried Vancraen. “We call upon everyone who has access to a 3D printer to print the part and make it available to their local community.”Looking like a cluster of lightsabers on wheels, a sterilising robot has been developed by a Danish company. It can kill virus cells and sanitise hospital wards without the need for chemicals. The eight bulbs on each roaming robot emit concentrated UV-C ultraviolet light, which destroys bacteria, viruses and other harmful microbes by damaging their DNA and RNA, so they can’t multiply.This could reduce dependency on chemical-based disinfectants such as hydrogen peroxide, which require rooms to be left empty for several hours during sterilisation, making them impractical for many parts of hospitals.The robot was launched in early 2019, following six years of collaboration between parent firm, Blue Ocean Robotics and Odense University Hospital, but recent demand has seen production accelerate, so it now takes less than a day to make one robot.A similar device has been developed by Chinese firm YouiBot, which took its existing robot base and added thermal camera and UV-C bulbs. It has supplied factories, offices and an airport, and a hospital in Wuhan. “It’s running right now in the luggage hall,” says YouiBot’s Keyman Guan, “checking body temperature in the day, and it goes virus killing during the night.”Chinese company Winsun has deployed its rapid 3D-printing powers on an architectural scale, manufacturing 15 coronavirus isolation wards in a single day. The little concrete cabins were originally designed to be used as holiday homes, but the company ramped up production to cope with demand from overcrowded Chinese hospitals at the height of the epidemic.The buildings, which have showers and eco-toilets, were printed through an extrusion process, with a robotic arm mounted on rails, gradually depositing layers of concrete to build the walls. The company says it uses recycled construction rubble in the process and claims its structures are twice as strong as a conventional concrete construction.Coders have joined the battle against coronavirus, racing to develop apps. In South Korea, virus-tracking apps make up six of the most popular 15 downloaded apps, by far the most popular being Corona 100m. Using the wealth of data collected by the government’s testing programme, the app alerts users when they come within 100 metres of a location visited by an infected person.It also allows people to see the date a coronavirus patient was confirmed to have the disease, along with that patient’s nationality, gender, age and the places the patient visited. Launched on 11 February, the app had a million downloads in its first 17 days.Other initiatives include the Coronamap website, which shows the travel histories of confirmed Covid-19 patients and Coronaita, which functions like a search engine for information on coronavirus-hit areas. Other states, including Singapore and Israel, have also deployed apps that can help the authorities track who users have come into contact with, to help model the spread of the virus, while Taiwan has introduced an “electronic fence” system that alerts the local police if a quarantined user leaves their home.Discussions are under way about a tracking app in the UK, sparking a debate about privacy. An open letter from a group of “responsible technologists” highlighted concerns “that data collected to fight coronavirus could be stored indefinitely or for a disproportionate amount of time, or will be used for unrelated purposes”. They added: “These are testing times, but they do not call for untested new technologies.”Czech company Prusa, which claims to have the largest 3D printing farm in the world, with more than 500 printers, has started mass-producing protective face shields, used by medics. It is manufacturing over 800 a day, and has donated 10,000 to the Czech ministry of health.“The materials required to manufacture one unit are less than $1 and that is without any quantity discounts when buying,” says the company’s founder, Josef Průša. “We literally got materials around Prague during one afternoon.”ChileanUS company Copper3D developed a 3D-printed N95 mask called NanoHack, designed to filter out airborne particles that could carry the virus, with plans available to download online.Another firm, Stratasys, has also developed a 3D-printed face shield and masks. According to its CEO, Yoav Zeif: “The strengths of 3D printing, be anywhere, print virtually anything, adapt on the fly, make it capable for helping address shortages of parts related to shields, masks, and ventilators, among other things.”In a world where we are forbidden from leaving the house, it looks like drones might finally come into their own. In China, the world leader in drone manufacturing, the mini choppers have been mobilised for everything from fever detection in crowds to disinfecting public spaces, to delivering supplies to far-flung locations.Agricultural drones, designed to spread fertiliser, have been repurposed to spray disinfectant across pavements and public squares, as well as deliver groceries to remote island communities. Drones have also been used to deliver test samples, dramatically cutting journey times.In France, the police have started using drones to help enforce its lockdown, monitoring parks and public spaces to make sure people are not leaving their homes for non-essential trips, while, in the UK, Northamptonshire police are planning to increase their fleet of drones, which will be equipped with speakers to transmit public information messages and tell people to get back indoors. No nipping out to get those non-essential items, now – the drones are watching."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24f361682dc2154a09a9c06c47de2698b0fb3115/0_1754_8353_5012/master/8353.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3f37f86781cfab3b04c821733244676","title":"sacha alexis pazoumian life in earths deepest deep freeze in pictures","story":"It is one of chilliest spots on the planet.

Dystopian tales are also selling well, particularly Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale, George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four and Brave New World by Aldous Huxley.Nielsen BookScan, the UK’s official book sales monitor, also reported nationwide increases in sales for War and Peace, The Lord of the Rings and the first instalment of Marcel Proust’s In Search of Lost Time.“Our bestseller is Hilary Mantel – those 900 pages aren’t going to seem daunting any more and it’s doing really well,” said Waterstones’ Bea Carvalho. “And we’ve seen really good sales for the classics – those bucket list books, the ‘I’ve always wanted to read it’ type things such as Infinite Jest.”“The sales data suggests that the UK population has indeed been preparing for long periods of isolation,” said Philip Stone at Nielsen.Authors have reported that they are also attempting classic novels for the first time, including Stephen King, who announced on Twitter he had “finally got around” to James Joyce’s notoriously challenging Ulysses. “I understand it better than I expected, but I have to say it’s really fucking Irish,” the horror novelist wrote.Lockdowns around the world have lead to the creation of many digital reading groups. Blackwell’s bookshop in Oxford has launched an “I Always Meant to Read That” reading group on Facebook, where followers will be meeting every Monday to discuss classic fiction, starting with Pride and Prejudice. Publisher Dialogue Books has started a reading group, with participants able to put questions to the authors directly on a weekly Instagram Live broadcast. And author Yiyun Li, with non-profit quarterly A Public Space, has launched a virtual book club tackling War and Peace. Using the estimate that it would take people 30 minutes to read 12-15 pages, Li suggested that everyone in the group could finish it in three months, “just in time for summer, and with our spirits restored”.“I have found that the more uncertain life is, the more solidity and structure Tolstoy’s novels provide.

She said she would meet with the business secretary to request better guidance.The warnings come amid widespread confusion among businesses about how to respond to the coronavirus lockdown after Boris Johnson ordered the closure of “non-essential” shops on Monday to limit the spread of the disease. In one of the most high-profile examples, Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct retail chain had intended to remain open but was forced to backtrack after a public outcry.Frances O’Grady, the director general of the TUC, said the government needed to crack down on non-essential companies making staff attend work, telling ministers they needed to directly intervene if employers flouted the rules.“Companies like Sports Direct shouldn’t be putting their profits before people’s lives. No one in non-essential services should be forced to go to work. And no one should be sacked for following official instructions and staying home,” she said.It is understood that many business leaders are privately furious with ministers for allowing confusion to fester, while workers have also vented anger over their health being put at risk.Employees at several call centres run by Capita got in touch with the  to raise concerns that the the company was not taking their safety seriously.One member of staff at a call centre in Runcorn ran by the outsourcing firm Capita said people were still taking calls for the mobile operator O2 involving retention of customers threatening to quit.“Part of the building sectioned off for deep clean but employees still expected to work,” they said. “The building is filthy desks are never cleaned cleaners only come in to hoover, advisers are to clean the desks. Sanitiser stations are empty, toilets are dirty.”They said they were concerned about catching the virus and giving it to family members with underlying health conditions and were too scared to speak out as they could be fired. “The way we are being treated is horrendous,” they added.Capita said it had increased cleaning at sites, staff were working from home where possible and it had no policy to sack people who complain on social media: “The top priority of Capita at this very difficult time is the wellbeing of our people.”Rachel Reeves, the Labour chair of the Commons business select committee, said the committee received more than 600 messages from concerned workers, including office-based staff, furniture manufacturers, travel agents, estate agents, law firms and TV engineers.Writing in a letter to the business secretary, Alok Sharma, she said: “It’s vital the government comes forward with immediate clarification.”An engineer for Sky TV said that the company was still sending him and colleagues into people’s homes, despite the risk of them spreading the disease. He said that the company suspended visits on Tuesday but later told workers they would still make visits to do home moves, installations and servicing.“I didn’t visit my own mum on mother’s day, yet we are being told to go into the homes of other people’s mothers and grandmothers,” the engineer said.A spokesperson for Sky said it was taking steps to protect staff, who have been designated as key workers, as well as customers. They said engineers could also refuse a visit if they did not feel safe.A worker at a BT office in Glasgow said the firm’s call centre could “hold more people than a nightclub” with roughly 350 workers on one floor, but that no social distancing plan was in action.“The company are telling us they are following government guideline which they clearly are not. Alarmingly they are offering an incentive of an extra £5 per hour for people doing overtime in these crowded, non-essential centres,” he added.BT said measures were in place to protect staff and workers were providing a vital service to people who needed to communicate during the crisis.Affinity, a trade union representing TSB employees, said staff at the bank’s Sunderland call centre were worried by a lack of action after two workers’ family members contracted Covid-19.“Instead of closing the site and instigating a deep clean, TSB has done nothing,” Affinity said. “Staff who raised their concerns have been ignored and been told to carry on as if nothing had happened. That’s unacceptable”TSB said it followed government guidelines, had told non-key staff to work from home and that those in the office had been spread out.Construction workers have also continued on site at some projects. Housebuilders Berkeley and Crest Nicholson and the construction firm Balfour Beatty said they were keeping sites open, while Redrow bowed to public pressure to close.A spokesperson for Berkeley said measures to reduce risks were being taken: “The government has confirmed that home building sites can continue to operate while implementing social distancing guidance.”Additional reporting by Kalyeena Makortoff and Julia Kollewe"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a7a5fb31bfab093f06d2a61246b47be12dc20f2/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7140b0f4ad2ff9a7cb7d2bed125134ed","title":"jd wetherspoon refuses pay suppliers until uk coronavirus lockdown ends","story":"Chairman of UK pubs chain faces fresh backlash but backs down over staff payJD Wetherspoon has told its suppliers it will not pay them until pubs reopen after the coronavirus lockdown, but promised staff will get their wages beyond Friday provided the government agrees a reimbursement scheme fast enough.As a backlash grows against its behaviour during the crisis, the pub chain confirmed that it had told firms supplying food, drinks and other services that they would not be paid until its 874 pubs were allowed to reopen.Tim Martin, the company’s founder and chairman, had already told its 43,000 staff that could not afford to pay them after Friday.People in the UK will only be allowed to leave their home for the following purposes:Police will have the powers to enforce the rules, including through fines and dispersing gatherings. To ensure compliance with the instruction to stay at home, the government will:Parks will remain open for exercise, but gatherings will be dispersed.The company now says staff will get paid on 3 April, as long as the government backs its interpretation of the reimbursement scheme set out by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak.JD Wetherspoon will top up the wages of employees whose pay exceeds the cap, but it will not offer holiday pay. It also said that while ongoing parental or adoption leave would continue as usual, the position of staff about to go on leave was not clear.Hours that the company’s staff work for other businesses in the meantime are likely to be deducted from their furlough pay.JD Wetherspoon has also told its suppliers: “We are asking for a moratorium on payments, until the pubs reopen, at which point we intend to clear outstanding payments, within a short timeframe.”The email, first published by the sustainability website Footprint, continued: “We understand that this puts significant pressure on our suppliers, but we are kindly asking for your assistance during this very difficult period.”Sean Upson, a partner at Stewarts law firm, said the company may seek to use a “force majeure” clause to free itself of contractual obligations.But he said: “Force majeure is not a ‘get out of jail free’ card.

Sainsbury’s said it expected to begin contacting people next week and was also working on ways to secure details for vulnerable people living in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.Sainsbury’s has already used information from its Nectar loyalty scheme to try to prioritise elderly shoppers online, proactively contacting 270,000 people. It also has a helpline which vulnerable shoppers can ring for help in booking delivery slots. However, shoppers told the  that accessing the helpline was difficult because of very high demand. Sainsbury’s admitted that its customer careline had been inundated with requests from elderly and vulnerable customers, with one year’s worth of contacts in two weeks.It said it had already booked delivery slots for 115,000 elderly, disabled and vulnerable customers this week.The retailer is also closing about 10 smaller local stores, mostly in locations such as train stations, to prioritise busier outlets and online.While many supermarkets have set aside special shopping periods in store for the vulnerable and elderly, the latest advice to stay at home has stepped up the need for delivery services.The government is also teaming up with food service providers Brakes and Bidfood to put together an emergency food parcel scheme that could provide essentials to 300,000 of the most vulnerable of 1.5 million people identified as needing assistance by the government.The scheme, which could launch as early as next week, is expected to link up the delivery networks of the food service companies – which usually supply catering businesses and restaurants – with local volunteers and charities.One industry source said that the government had initially approached supermarkets to support the scheme but it had quickly become apparent that food service firms had more capacity to cope because of lost orders from their usual clients, most of which have been forced to close under the government’s measures to control the spread of the virus.Morrisons said it had already delivered 10,000 boxes of essential groceries after beginning tests on a new scheme this week which operates using couriers rather than via its Morrisons network. The retailer expects to ramp up production of two £30 boxes of essentials in the coming week.Morrisons is also extending its Morrisons and quick delivery service via Amazon’s Prime Now subscription option by taking on thousands of staff to pick, pack and deliver groceries from 100 more stores in the coming month.Marks \u0026amp Spencer is launching a service with takeaway courier firm Deliveroo in which it will deliver bread, milk and other essentials from franchise outlets on BP forecourts.Tesco is bringing in 8,000 new drivers to help with deliveries and said it had already appointed 12,500 new staff out of a total of 20,000 required.Tesco said it would be joining other supermarkets by installing protective screens for staff, marking out safe distances for queueing and creating separate entrances and exits for shoppers.New rules announced on Monday night stipulate that retailers remaining open during the high street lockdown, such as supermarkets, must ensure there is a 2-metre distance between customers and staff and that shoppers enter in small groups, so that spaces do not become crowded. The government has also ordered retailers to manage queues outside their stores."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9285e8a76c3328ba10746308a699c5764a822f04/0_70_6031_3620/master/6031.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72516aad6d333181d5d4454dd6562cd4","title":"us stimulus package may be massive but it wont be enough","story":"$2tn coronavirus rescue deal dwarfs 2008 bailout but there will still be painThe precise details of the US stimulus package are still to be revealed but some things are already clear: it will be massive, it will hit many of the right targets and it won’t be enough.But with that sort of fiscal injection, you can afford to spread the money around, which is what the package does. If the advance reports are right, there will be a $1,200 cheque posted to American adults on a middle income or below, with an extra $500 for each child. On top of that, there will be more generous support for those losing their jobs, through the extension of unemployment insurance by 13 weeks and a four-month enhancement of benefits.Together, these mean Americans would get their full salaries for a guaranteed period if forced out of work by Covid-19.A quarter of the stimulus is aimed at business. There will be direct financial help for some sectors, such as airlines and airports, but the bulk of the corporate support comes in the form of loans and grants to businesses of all sizes. The US Treasury will put aside a sizeable sum to indemnify the Federal Reserve against losses it might incur from extending credit to struggling companies.Donald Trump is desperate to get the stimulus signed into law, which has allowed Democrats in Congress to extract some important concessions. The cash payments go in full to anyone earning less than $75,000 a year, and will then be tapered and not paid at all to anybody paid more than $99,000.The Democrats have also taken steps to avoid company bosses enriching themselves at the expense of the government. There will be a ban on share buybacks – a traditional form of enrichment for US CEOs – for the duration of any loan plus one year. Trump himself will not be able to benefit and there will be a new inspector general and oversight board to check that the aid is being properly spent.The size and the comprehensive nature of the package will limit the amount of pain that the US is going to suffer as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic but it is not going to eradicate it entirely.Wall Street is awaiting the weekly jobs report due out on Thursday with trepidation. Before the crisis broke, about 200,000 Americans a week were filing jobless claims. The lowest estimates for the latest week are 2 million and some are double that. The pain from a likely tripling of unemployment will be colossal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e45a3500f991c98af212c9f6779f9b3f8b92bb86/0_121_3998_2399/master/3998.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2cc2e887067b8c0da18d040394a656f2","title":"banks and business caught out by emergency measures","story":"The regulators have urged all action necessary to get coronavirus cash to firms, with a veiled a warning if lenders don’t hurry upGet a bloody move on. That was not, obviously, the wording of the exhortation to banks in Wednesday’s joint letter from the chancellor, the governor of the Bank of England and head of the Financial Conduct Authority. But the gist was clear. The authorities are worried that their emergency measures are not being implemented on the ground by lenders – or, at least, not fast enough.The regulatory trio said they want to see “all action necessary” and “a willingness to maintain and extend lending”, with the aim of ensuring that “firms whose business models were viable before this crisis remain viable once it is over”.The language may have been formally polite, but consider the context. It was as recently as Monday this week that the governor and the chairs of six big banks issued a joint “we’re here to help” statement. Relations seemed harmonious at that point not now.What’s happened since? It seems the Treasury and the Bank have been bombarded by phone calls from irate business owners and executives who have heard about the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme, and suchlike, but say they can’t get their hands on the promised cash.For their part, the banks (or some of them) resent the idea that they’re not working flat out to get money out of the door. The scheme, they point out, came with eligibility criteria and not every applicant will qualify. They’re also meant to be lending only to businesses that would be viable under normal conditions.There’s also an under-appreciated gap in the Treasury’s initiatives, say lenders. The scheme is for companies with an annual turnover of less than £45m, but not all firms above that threshold have a credit rating that would allow easy access to the equivalent commercial paper scheme for larger companies. Then there are problems created by self-isolating staff being absent in branches and call centres.From the outside, it’s hard to tell how serious these tensions are. The Treasury is bound to want instant implementation lenders will inevitably say the process of distributing loans is not like turning on a tap. The picture could improve.Yet “monitoring the situation closely” is standard regulatory-speak for a heavy warning. The verbal rocket may be justified. Alternatively, the government wants someone to blame if companies go bust in their droves. Neither interpretation is good.Tim Martin’s campaign to make himself the most unpopular business person in the country is going splendidly. In his latest move, the JD Wetherspoon founder has told suppliers they won’t be paid until pubs reopen.One can – just about – see how Martin might rationalise his hardball stance. If Wetherspoon is not allowed to sell the goods it has ordered, it should be given more time to pay, he may reason.Yet such a literal-minded view ignores a few business realities. Wetherspoon is a large company with a strong balance sheet and ready access to bank loans. Not all its suppliers are in the same position. Big brewers can look out for themselves, but a cashflow crisis could spin out of control for the smaller food and drink crew. This is a moment for the strong to look out for the weak.He presumably calculates that customers don’t care enough to change their drinking and eating habits when the doors re-open. He may be right, but one wonders.But will the monthly CPI measure even be helpful in the next few months? How will the statisticians get a handle on the price of an airline ticket or a meal in a restaurant when planes are grounded and eateries are closed? The “typical shopping basket” approach to measuring inflation is not designed for current times."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48b259ebff6c0c08eb3587626f963342fd622049/0_288_5749_3450/master/5749.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=348eee14d8f58d92f25e47cad4810369","title":"i was born anxious so why am i not panicking about coronavirus","story":"As a teenager I had chronic hypochondria. Yet in the face of a global pandemic I am surprisingly calm. Maybe it’s because we are all in this togetherI have noticed something odd about my anxiety at this time: I am not as anxious as I should be. I have been anxious for as long as I can remember: man, boy, child, baby and, for all I know, foetus. It just seems to be in my nature. I have a physical manifestation of it in the shape of a long furrow right across the middle of my brow. If I pull the skin on my forehead right back to stretch away this crevice, a white streak appears in its place. For this troubled trench is so deep that no sunlight finds a way to its depths.When I was a kid, I worried about everything. I worried whether my friends liked me, whether girls liked me and, most of all, whether West Brom would win their next game. I worried about my grandparents dying and my parents dying. And, logically enough, by the time I got to my teens I started to worry about dying myself. This manifested itself in chronic hypochondria. I was convinced I had pretty much everything at some time or other, but the main focus of my concern was my testicles. To be fair, I had nearly lost them when I was 11 in a bicycle crash at my nan’s house on the day of the 1978 cup final, but that’s another story.In my late teens, when I was away at university, I was sure that I had testicular cancer. I was checking them several times a day, invariably finding lumps and bumps and various inconsistencies. My own doctor got fed up with it, so I started presenting myself, as a visiting patient, at several different GPs. I went to them on a rota, so they didn’t get fed up, too. They never found anything but I remained in a right old state for years. And then one evening, in an Indian restaurant, my dad lost patience with my whimpering. He flung his naan bread down in irritation and said: “Look Ade, you’re fine. You’re not going to die of ball-rot or anything else.” The idea of ball-rot as a disease was absurd enough to snap me out of it. So that crisis passed, only to be replaced by another, and another.So, I am a worrier. I have therapy for it I swallow pills for it. I lie with my legs up against a wall, deep-breathing, with monks chanting on Spotify for it. But now, amid a global pandemic for God’s sake, I just can’t seem to worry enough. It turns out that the key component of my lifetime’s anxiety has been paranoia: a conviction that I would be singled out for especially bad treatment. I would get ill and die of ball-rot younger than anyone else my career would end in dismal failure while others succeeded my football team would lose more than any other.But with this, as it is the whole planet, my stupid head is less anxious than normal. I mean, I am still anxious about the end of civilisation, the looming economic depression and the deaths of people we love. But it hasn’t sent me crazy like it’s sending some friends over the edge. Perhaps it is just that everyone else is now as anxious as the anxious are all time. Or perhaps it is just knowing that we’re all in this together."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed19d222b8d89155a49a00afde584c625d417f05/0_63_6595_3957/master/6595.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=27545f72757d11f23d98d51f494f1ce8","title":"mass covid 19 testing is vital but the data must be localised","story":"The 15-minute coronavirus tests may provide a semblance of normality as UK regions track the spread of coronavirus• Anthony Costello is a former director of maternal and child health at the World Health OrganizationSince the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) has emphasised the crucial importance of testing. Speed is of the essence, and three things are crucial: tracking down cases with symptoms identifying their household cluster and tracing people they’ve contacted and quarantining them until they are no longer infectious. Testing is the basis of public health detective work to shut down an epidemic. “You can’t fight a virus if you don’t know where it is,” said the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, recently. “Find, isolate, test and treat every case, to break the chains of transmission. Every case we find and treat limits the expansion of the disease.”Physical distancing is another strategy, but it’s less effective than testing. In the early stages of an epidemic, when clusters are few and far between, one needs a huge population distancing effort to stop their spread. At that point, most people won’t grasp the scale of the threat and will resist restrictive orders. So testing, contact tracing and quarantining people with symptoms is crucial. As the epidemic becomes rampant, as in London, the policy must switch to intensive testing to protect health workers.Large-scale testing is about more than identifying and isolating cases. Information about the virus is power. Testing can help protect health workers and measure the progression of an epidemic. It can also provide evidence about regional variation and how the virus affects people of different ages and genders. Virologists can use information about cases to monitor the nature of the virus and any mutations. And data can show social and behavioural scientists whether their physical-distancing measures are working.Testing for the virus across the general population, in other words, can tell us whether our assumptions about coronavirus are correct. A new model from Prof Sunetra Gupta and a team of researchers at Oxford University, published yesterday, reaches conclusions that are very different from the Imperial College models. Crucially, the Oxford model is not peer reviewed – so we can’t be assured that its findings are correct – but Gupta suggests that “only a very small proportion of the population is at risk of hospitalisable illness” and that more than half the population have already been exposed to the virus, largely without symptoms. If this were true, we could expect a big surge of hospitalisations and deaths over the next six weeks, but then the epidemic would recede, probably with no second wave. But to know whether this is actually the case, we urgently need immunity tests that will show whether people have had the virus.By 10 March, the rates of reported Covid-19 virus tests were one for every 243 people in South Korea, 995 in Italy, 2,585 in the UK, and 38,695 in the USA. On 12 March, the UK government announced it would stop all community virus detection tests, and focus just on health worker protection. By 16 March, when it realised the NHS faced a potential meltdown if the epidemic went unchecked, the government reversed its policy rather than mitigating the virus, it returned to a strategy of suppression.Public Health England is now reportedly increasing national laboratory testing capacity in Milton Keynes, but up until now the UK has still only been testing 5,000 specimens per day. In contrast, the Irish government has set up 41 mobile test centres which are processing 100,000 samples per week for a population of 4.9 million (the UK’s population is an estimated 66.4 million).Every UK medical school and most large hospitals have labs with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) machines. These can amplify tiny genetic pieces of the virus from nasal swabs to indicate a positive test. Batches of 200 tests can be completed in a few hours. We don’t yet have commercially standardised “primers” (tools used to find the viral genetic pieces) but, with authorisation from government, labs could develop their own to provide an adequate service for now. If power is devolved to local labs, our local authority outbreak teams could rapidly escalate testing.The announcement of mass home testing in the UK is welcome. Around the world, companies are working frantically to develop diagnostic machines where people swabbing themselves can post samples to a lab. Others are using the Crispr-Cas9 genome editor to create a simple colour change on a test strip within 30 minutes. Either would be a game changer if they could be adopted at scale. People with symptoms would be able to self-isolate, identify contacts, report online to a national database, and the problem of mapping and rapidly quarantining those with coronavirus would be largely solved.Sadly, home testing won’t prevent the deluge of cases facing the NHS in the next few weeks. But if the Imperial modellers are right and the epidemic returns after we achieve suppression, local authorities, using evidence from tests, could better control outbreaks and loosen the restrictions on our economy and our lives.• Anthony Costello is professor of global health and sustainable development at UCL and a former director of maternal and child health at the WHO"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f26c5711a6e166c4ba7dca80e146aa490fa5794/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da061dd321d72de8f31a8fd1cd01a127","title":"new virus china covid 19 food markets","story":"Viruses such as Covid-19 wouldn’t emerge in food markets if it wasn’t for factory farming, globalised industry and rapid urbanisationWhen I get stressed, a patch of annoying red eczema appears on the inside of my upper right arm. The doctor gives me some cream to rub on it, but I also know that to stop it coming back I have to deal with the underlying problem.Too much information, you’re thinking, but let me make the analogy. The reason we shouldn’t call the Sars-CoV-2 virus causing global misery the “Chinese virus” is the same reason I shouldn’t blame my eczema on my upper arm: there is clearly a superficial weakness there, but the real cause lies elsewhere.All the evidence gathered to date suggests that the now notorious Chinese “wet markets” – places selling live and dead animals for human consumption – provide an opportunity for coronaviruses to jump easily from animals to people. It happened with the Sars-CoV virus in 2002-3 – which was contained before it caused a pandemic – and it has happened again with its close relative, Sars-CoV-2.But to understand why the emergence of such zoonoses – human infections of animal origin – has accelerated in recent decades, you have to understand the forces putting those viruses in our path. They are political and economic. They have to do with the rise of industrial-scale farming concerns in China and the resulting marginalisation of millions of smallholder farmers. In order to survive, those farmers have moved into the production of more exotic species – animals that were once eaten only for subsistence. But the bigger operations have pushed the farmers out geographically too, as they have taken up more prime farming land. The smallholders have been forced closer to uncultivable zones such as forests, where bats – reservoirs for coronaviruses – lurk. The stars have aligned, and not in a good way, to channel bat viruses through intermediate mammalian hosts such as pangolins, and into humans.Even so, to play devil’s advocate for a moment, the problem could still be regarded as uniquely Chinese. But there are two reasons why that’s not true. First, with the opening up of China, its agribusiness has ceased to be wholly Chinese-owned. It is a big recipient of foreign direct investment. Second, as the American pandemic expert, David Morens, and his colleagues pointed out last month in the New England Journal of Medicine, we’ve been watching a similar drama unfold over a much longer timescale with influenza – the disease that has caused more pandemics in the history of humanity than any other.Flu viruses that infect animals, including poultry and pigs, have periodically spilled over into humans ever since we domesticated those animals millennia ago. But the factory farms that produce our food today ratchet up the virulence of those flu viruses just before they spill over. This ratcheting up has been documented in Europe, Australia and the US more than it has in poor or emerging economies, and it’s what gave rise to the last flu pandemic in 2009. The first cases of that pandemic were recorded in California, but nobody calls it the American flu – and it’s right that they don’t, if only because American farms aren’t wholly American-owned either. China, for one, has invested in them.It’s not just the industries that produce our food that are creating the conditions in which new zoonoses emerge. Logging, mining, road-building and rapid urbanisation are also contributing, and the profits from those are shared internationally too. “We have created a global, human-dominated ecosystem that serves as a playground for the emergence and host-switching of animal viruses,” wrote Morens et al. The resulting diseases are suffered locally at first, as is reflected in their names – Ebola and Zika virus diseases and Bolivian hemorrhagic fever, to name just three – but the irony is that some of them, such as HIV and Covid-19, go on to become global. It’s hard not to see a terrible natural justice in that.In 2015, the World Health Organization issued guidelines on how to name diseases, which stipulated that such names should not single out particular human populations, places, animals or food. Names that commit those sins often turn out to be wrong anyway, but by the time that becomes clear the damage has already been done. Gay-related immune deficiency or Grid, the first name given to Aids, stigmatised the gay community while stymying research into how the disease affected other groups. President Trump’s labelling of Sars-CoV-2 as the “Chinese virus” is also unhelpful. At a time when the main centres of Covid-19 infection are outside China, and Americans and Europeans could be learning valuable lessons from the Chinese, he is exchanging insults with Chinese politicians who have accused him of racism and hinted – just as preposterously – that the US military brought the virus to China. The slanging match suits Trump, distracting from his mishandling of the epidemic at home, but it does the rest of us no favours.That doesn’t mean China shouldn’t be held accountable for its shortcomings. Americans know where their weak points are – they include agricultural fairs, where pigs and humans come together – and they police them ferociously. Their infectious disease experts can detect a virus circulating in a herd and generate a vaccine to it within hours. The Chinese have got better at this lately. They now vaccinate their poultry flocks against a dangerous flu virus, H7N9, which first infected humans in 2013, for example. But nearly 20 years after Sars-CoV spilled over in a wet market, those places still appear to be a liability.Controlling that animal-human interface is obviously important, but it shouldn’t blind us to the bigger problem, which is those globalised industries. Economists use the term “tragedy of the commons” to describe a shared resource – common grazing land, say – that is spoiled by iniduals acting in their own self-interest. It has been applied to the climate crisis, but as University of British Columbia geographer Luke Bergmann and his colleagues have pointed out, it doesn’t quite fit what has happened here. In the case of these industries, it would be more accurate to say that they have excluded the nearly 8 billion of us who depend on the commons from participating in their governance. Yet we are bearing the costs of their industrial exploitation, in the form of pandemic disease.We have our share of responsibility, as iniduals, in the foods we choose to eat and the lifestyle choices we make generally. There are a lot of us on this planet and sustaining us is costly. But as has become increasingly clear, these industries have decoupled themselves from consumer choice they’re driving it rather than responding to it.It’s time we took back the commons, which means voting for politicians who will hold those industries accountable, rather than ones who deflect the blame. We need leaders who understand that the treatment for this particular eruption cannot only be topical, it has to be systemic too.• Laura Spinney is a science journalist, novelist and author of Pale Rider: The Spanish Flu of 1918 and How it Changed the World"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6698010185839ae6560b248b3a785ee1e3f0099b/125_0_3349_2010/master/3349.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=032cd5febad2cf3d6c59af4f9c7e54b2","title":"shock coronavirus split europe nations share burden","story":"European governments still seem destined to repeat the mistakes made in the financial crisis During the 2008 financial crisis, many observers predicted the imminent collapse of the European currency project. They were wrong. The euro held together. Yet what the last crisis did not do, Covid-19 might yet bring about: the breakup of the eurozone.The architecture of the currency union was ill prepared for the global banking crisis just over a decade ago. Yet in many ways, the situation is even worse today. Not only is the economic shock likely to be more severe, the coronavirus crisis is also, first and foremost, a fiscal rather than monetary challenge. As a result, it strikes at the central weakness of the eurozone.Back in 2008, the banking sector was the centre of the crisis. The European Central Bank (ECB) could fight the fire by providing liquidity to financial markets and supporting the banks. Monetary tools provided the most important line of defence. But faced with coronavirus, the ECB cannot build hospitals, produce ventilators and masks, or organise income support for businesses and their employees. This remains the domain of national fiscal policy.The economic fallout of Covid-19 hits all members of the currency bloc. But no mechanism exists that allows the governments of the eurozone to respond jointly to such a shock. The result is that the policy reactions to the pandemic are so far overwhelmingly national – accentuating differences rather than bringing Europe together in a time of crisis. Even in the face of a symmetric shock, the eurozone responds asymmetrically.The existing differences in each nation’s fiscal condition are already causing a sharp ergence in the policy response. The longer the crisis lasts, the more visible these differences will become. Not all countries will be able to maintain life support for their economies on the same scale. Over time, this will trigger a political dynamic that could push the eurozone to the brink again.The writing is on the wall: without solidarity from its fellow eurozone members, Italy will not be able to respond to the crisis in the same way that other countries can. It is at risk of an economic depression on top of a humanitarian catastrophe.The eurozone now risks repeating the same mistakes that were made just over a decade ago. The timid and delayed responses of the European national governments at the height of the last crisis have cost the economy dearly. Policy actions were typically taken only when the house was already on fire. And when the ECB intervened to buy time, the extra time was often wasted in European capitals.A similar dynamic was visible last week. After some initial wobbles in its response to the crisis, the ECB announced a dramatic new programme of asset purchases to stabilise European markets. Yet the reaction in European capitals was predictable: once the markets were calmed, and bond spreads narrowed between countries, the perceived need for joint fiscal action evaporated. Each country turned its attention back to national rescue packages.Europe needs a joint fiscal response to the Covid-19 crisis. All countries in the currency union must be able to do whatever is necessary to respond to the public health catastrophe. Two different options are on the table.The best solution would the joint issue of one-off bonds with long maturities. The creation of such eurobonds would send a strong signal of solidarity in the face of a crisis for which no nation can be blamed. There is even historical precedent for such a move: the European Community issued bonds in the 1970s to jointly combat the economic shock of the oil crisis.Another option, but a distant second best, would be to use the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) – the institution that was created to deal with the last crisis. Inidual countries could apply for ESM loans, subject to light conditionality. Yet only countries at the risk of losing market access will accept the conditions, and the domestic political costs of these deals could be prohibitively large. The design of the ESM embodies concerns from the last crisis about moral hazard and fiscal prudence. It is not the right institution for an emergency that is nobody’s fault.What is needed is an unambiguous signal of mutual trust and burden-sharing within the European family. Nine heads of government, from Belgium, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain, have today called for the issue of “a common debt instrument” – a bond, in other words – to raise funds to fight the pandemic. This is the right path. This is a time for European solidarity. If the continent does not stand together now, the European project might never recover.• Adam Tooze is a professor of history at Columbia University and the director of its European Institute.

A recession – a short-term, temporary fall in GDP – need not, and indeed normally does not, reduce life expectancy. Indeed, counterintuitively, the weight of the evidence is that recessions actually lead to people living longer. Suicides do indeed go up, but other causes of death, such as road accidents and alcohol-related disease, fall.So at the most basic level, this argument ignores what the evidence says. But perhaps more importantly, the idea that the way to minimise the economic damage is to remove the restrictions before they’ve done their job – definitively suppressing the spread of the virus – is a terrible one.Does anyone believe that, whatever the government said, we could get back to “normal”, or something close to it, any time soon? If we were all allowed to return to work, many or most of us would, quite rationally, choose not to, for fear of catching the virus. And if, as the scientists predict, the result of loosening the restrictions was an acceleration in infections, then pretty soon many firms would simply stop functioning, as workers became sick, or had to stay at home to look after family members.More broadly, restoring the economy to normal requires, above all, confidence. Amid continuing uncertainty both about their own finances and the wider economy, households won’t spend and businesses won’t invest. And that simply isn’t going to happen until the spread of the diseases has been contained.So there is no tradeoff here. Health and economic considerations point in exactly the same direction in the short term. Do whatever it takes – and whatever it costs – and do it now, in the interests both of our health and our collective wealth.But what comes next? It is entirely reasonable to point out that serious damage to the economy, if it persists over the longer term, will reduce our welfare and maybe even – as austerity and its aftermath have done – life expectancy. The last 10 days have seen universal credit claims rise more than five-fold, to half a million, while YouGov data suggests that 2 million people may have lost their job. The recession is already here.But this need not, and should not, be permanent. The risk here is that we allow the inevitable fall in GDP that results from shutting down the economy to drive firms out of business and workers into long-term unemployment. And there is nothing inevitable at all about this.Of course this is very different – that won’t happen automatically with Covid-19. The impacts are more widespread and long-lasting – and we don’t know how long – than an enforced extra holiday. But rapid and appropriate action by government can go a long way. Keeping workers in jobs and firms in business needs to be the priority. In the circumstances, the government’s made a good start, although there’s lots more to do.So what we should be worried about – both from an economic and a health perspective – is not how much GDP falls. It’s going to fall by a lot, and that’s a good thing. If it didn’t – if people were still going to work despite being told not to – then the lockdown wouldn’t be working and we’d still see economic consequences further down the line. It’s what happens to GDP in a year or 18 months that matters.And the long-term consequences? It wasn’t the sharp fall in GDP in 2008-9 that reduced, over the course of the next decade, life expectancy for the poorest in our society. It was how the government chose to address the economic fallout of the global financial crisis – by underfunding and understaffing the NHS and social care, and by eroding the basic welfare safety net that people depend on when times are hard. As we are now discovering, these were false economies that left us less, not more, prepared for this crisis.Similarly, if we allow Covid-19 to permanently damage our economic and social fabric, it will be our own fault, not that of the virus. This time we can, and must, do better.• Jonathan Portes is professor of economics and public policy at King’s College London and a former senior civil servant"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f340c112b0e6bd0e30e9bd62e45a5bb1eb5fe17/0_0_941_573/master/941.jpg?width=685\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1cd04a37095fadb6af853c2301aec0cd 685w","title":"adele keith flint gil scott heron and me richard russell the xl records midas","story":"He discovered the Prodigy, signed the White Stripes – and launched Tottenham’s mega-selling superstar. And it all started with a novelty rave tune about a bouncerFrom the outside, Richard Russell’s studio looks like any other house in Notting Hill. But inside, there’s a plethora of vintage synthesisers and something that looks like a work of science fiction: a large black pyramid covered in multicoloured switches. It’s a synthesiser too, explains Russell, or sort of. “The illustrator Pete Fowler drew it for a video the Horrors were doing,” he says. “I thought: ‘I have to get somebody to make that.’”Getting someone to build a giant synthesiser based on a cartoon is the kind of thing you can do if you’re the man behind one of the most successful independent record labels in the world. XL Recordings has proven such a creative force over the past three decades that Russell, now 49, has written an autobiography, Liberation Through Hearing, that details how it happened.Until recently, XL had on its roster the biggest artist of the 21st century, Adele, although her success, Russell insists, is down to the label leaving her alone to do what she wanted: “Does anyone achieve that kind of thing because of anybody else? You can give them support, but if someone’s going to achieve stuff on that level, it’s their destiny. From the first time I met her, she had a unique kind of self-possession, like she knew where she was going with it.”On the walls, there are photos of artists Russell has worked with who have died: Gil Scott-Heron glowers the Prodigy’s Keith Flint offers a sweet, shy smile, a million miles from his Firestarter public image. That’s what he was like, says Russell. “Incredibly funny, full of life. I was aware he had a troubled side.”Flint’s childhood was unhappy: he had depression and was addicted to painkillers. “But I don’t think anyone doesn’t have that side. It’s more a question of: ‘What are you doing about it?’ But Keith was doing 10k runs, he had horses.” He sighs. “When someone kills themselves, can’t help but feel – what if he’d waited 20 minutes? Or something else had happened?”After Flint’s death, Russell saw a documentary about the soul singer Teddy Pendergrass, who was left feeling suicidal after being paralysed in a car crash. His therapist staged a mock funeral, allowing Pendergrass to hear his friends and family’s eulogies. Realising how much he meant to them, Pendergrass decided to live. “I thought: ‘Fucking hell, I could imagine that working.’ If Keith could have witnessed what people said after his death, how they expressed themselves at his funeral, I think that would have had a huge impact on him.”Sometimes Russell sounds a lot less like a record industry mogul than an archetypical middle-age music geek, enthusing about old school hip-hop, still able to remember the names and locations of raves he went to 30 years ago. “Look,” he says happily, showing me the sleeve of the second album he’s made under the name Everything Is Recorded, “Penny Rimbaud from Crass and Ghostface Killah, two heroes of mine in every sense of the word, on the same album.”Better still, he says, it samples an old track mixed by disco legend Larry Levan, Man Friday’s Love Honey, Love Heartache, that was released by Vinylmania, a label based in a New York record store where Russell worked as a teenager, abandoning his middle-class Jewish upbringing in 1980s Edgware, London.Moving to New York seems a very confident move. “Certainly slightly reckless,” he nods. “I didn’t know anyone there. I stayed in a flophouse uptown – the shared bathroom stank. But I went there because I loved hip-hop. I thought, ‘I have to be part of that.’”Back in Britain, he was swept along by the hardcore rave scene: effectively acid house’s snottier, spottier, breakbeat-driven kid brother. “It had a touch of the pub about it. It sounded suburban, like it came from Essex, which a lot of hardcore labels like Suburban Base did. It was very entrepreneurial, everyone was a DJ, producer, doing a label.”Russell went from DJing and working for XL, then a nascent hardcore label, to making music with XL’s co-founder Nick Halkes. They had no musical skill and two ideas: a beat from a Marley Marl hip-hop track that Russell thought would work speeded up, and a cassette recording of a friend pretending to be a bouncer, knocking people back who claimed to be on the guest list.The Bouncer, released under the name Kicks Like a Mule, went to No 7 and Russell ended up on Top of the Pops, but his career was short-lived: the track got lumped in with a glut of novelty rave hits that sampled the themes from kids’ TV shows, or Blockbusters contestants saying “I’ll have an E please, Bob” – and that was pretty much that.But ironically, the band that inadvertently kickstarted the novelty rave trend by sampling an old public information film would turn out to be the most important discovery of Russell’s life. He says he knew from the start that the Prodigy were going to be huge. Something about them made him think of the Specials: the multi-racial line up, the way they connected with kids – and then there was the band’s co-founder and leader Liam Howlett.“He was just a better producer than anyone else. His drums were better, bigger, harder. The dancers weren’t just add-ons, they manifested the music. Keith was untethered, so if you saw him onstage at a rave, you were seeing yourself, but a completely free version of it, no self-consciousness. He could completely give himself to the audience.”Initially reviled by the press, the Prodigy became the biggest dance act of the 1990s. The Fat of the Land, released in 1997, went to No 1 on both sides of the Atlantic, an unprecedented feat. By then, Russell was running XL, but he says its success almost did for him and the label alike: “It’s the usual story, late 20s male, very driven, you get the thing you really want and then what have you got? I lost a bit of the plot. I was over-gassed by the success. I was a bit of a dick in that period.”He thinks he had a breakdown, leaving the label in the hands of old friend Nick Worthington, who signed the Streets and Basement Jaxx “while I was sort of picking myself back off the kitchen floor”. But when he returned, Russell displayed precisely the kind of intuitive big thinking that led him to realise the Prodigy would be huge. He signed Dizzee Rascal after hearing his single I Luv U, then told him to hurry up making his debut album because he wanted to enter it for the Mercury prize. Russell thought it might win, an impressive leap of faith given the futuristic racket the rapper was concocting.“I’ve never been good at guessing what’s really going to sell,” says Russell, “but what I can sometimes see is a stop on the map. I wanted people to recognise how great Dizzee was. I wanted him to create an opening, which he did, and look at how many people have piled in.”He also parlayed XL’s increasing success – they signed the White Stripes, MIA and Radiohead, after the latter departed EMI – into pet projects of his own. He decided to track down Gil Scott-Heron, undeterred by the fact that their first meeting took place in Rikers Island prison in New York, where the singer-songwriter was serving a sentence for cocaine possession.“It’s hard to talk about without sounding outrageously woo-woo,” says Russell. “But when I laid eyes on him, the first thing he said was, ‘There you are.’ He had this incredible empathy for people, this unbelievable emotional intuition, intelligence on a completely different level. Whoever he was talking to, if there was any bullshit, he would be straight on to them. “People had told me horror stories, but I just thought, ‘If he doesn’t want to do it, he won’t do it – and if he does, it’ll be something special.’ And I made myself quite vulnerable by saying: ‘We’re doing this together.’ He once said: ‘All the dreams you show up in are not your own’ – he knew it was my dream, not his, he would have been equally happy not doing it, but he did.”The resulting album, I’m New Here, was critically acclaimed and would be Scott-Heron’s last. Russell went on to pull off a similar feat with Bobby Womack’s The Bravest Man in the Universe. “Never in my 50 years have I had the president of a record company come in and play with me,” Womack told me shortly before his death. “Normally, you got to fight them for every goddam song.” Russell then produced Damon Albarn’s solo album Everyday Robots and embarked on his own Everything Is Recorded project.Some time ago, he says, he implemented a rule that XL can only release five albums a year. “It’s total resistance to the idea that business has to be discussed in world growth, all that shit. XL puts out a small number of records every year and hopefully they’re good – and even better than that, maybe they push things forward and they can bend the edges of the culture a bit. If they can do that, it’s great. That’s what it’s there to do.”And then the music geek reappears and he starts enthusing about a Tottenham grime MC called CASisDEAD, who always performs in a mask, so no one knows his identity. Oh and there’s a book he’s just seen, about 70s Italian prog rock.• Liberation Through Hearing: Rap, Rave and the Rise of XL Recordings by Richard Russell is published on 2 April by White Rabbit (£20).

In the movies, that has given us the work of Haifaa Al Mansour, the first woman to make a Saudi Arabian feature film with her widely admired 2012 debut, Wadjda, about a 10-year-old girl who enters a Koran-reading competition so she can buy a bike with the cash prize.Now Al Mansour has directed and co-written this assured and watchable picture, which premiered last year in Venice: a political drama about a woman who runs for office quasi-accidentally, in the time-honoured style, and then finds her campaign gaining an unexpected momentum. No one in this film actually calls her the “perfect” candidate an alternative title would have been just “The Candidate”, like Robert Redford in Michael Ritchie’s 1972 film, who is allowed to take a shot at political power because the powers-that-be are confident he hasn’t got a hope.Mila Al Zahrani plays Maryam, a young doctor in a Saudi Arabian hospital who is routinely patronised by her male supervisors: when a grumpy old man with an arm injury refuses to be examined by her, rebuffing her polite insistence and demanding a male doctor, Maryam’s colleague simply sides with the patient. At home, she lives with her sisters, Selma (Dae Al Hilali) and Sara (Nora Al Awadh), and they are all worried about their widowed dad, Abdulaziz (Khalid Abdulraheem), a much-respected musician, who has not got over the death of his wife she was a wedding singer whose beautiful voice haunts his memory.Partly in denial about his emotional devastation, Abdulaziz goes on a national tour with his ensemble, and Maryam shrewdly takes advantage of his absence, attempting to fly abroad for a medical conference in Dubai where she can pitch for a prestigious new job. But her father has forgotten to sign off on her travel permit the official who could rectify this happens to be her cousin, but his implacable secretary tells Maryam she can only get an appointment to see him on short notice if she wishes to stand for office as a local councillor – the authorities having decided to pay solemn lip service to female eligibility. In a mood of pure exasperation, Maryam signs up. And so Al Mansour gives her audience a fine lesson in some key ingredients of political life in Saudi or anywhere else: nepotism, cynicism, sexism and chaos.That scene at the airport when Maryam is turned back (with no guarantee of any ticket refund) is a crystallising moment of patriarchal arrogance: there was a similar moment in Soheil Beiraghi’s film Permission (2018), based on the true story of an Iranian female footballer who couldn’t attend an international fixture because her husband wouldn’t give her permission to leave the country. To most western audiences, it is a staggering infantilisation and humiliation to women in Saudi Arabia and Iran, it is a fact of life. Here is the triggering moment for change, albeit ironic and accidental.Al Mansour cleverly shows that Maryam’s family connections in the world of being a wedding singer have given her some crucial experience in public performance and addressing large assemblies of people, including men, in that rare context that permits the public acceptability of women. There is an interesting juxtaposition of scenes showing the audio channel for the microphone breaking down, and the difficulty involved in fixing it, if it means a woman invading a male space, or a man intruding on a female space. There is a colossal gender ide, whose purpose is always to make women inaudible and invisible.As for Maryam herself, she shows a natural political shrewdness in making her stump speech all about fixing the damaged road outside her hospital – nothing to do with women’s rights. And so her political career takes off, leaving this film’s audience to ponder the outcome: is Maryam going to win, or lose in such a way as to Corbynishly “win the argument”? The second possibility depends on how explicitly she wants to risk making that argument. But then: she is the argument.The Perfect Candidate is the sort of film I can imagine getting a remake in contemporary America or Britain, with not as many changes as we might assume.• The Perfect Candidate is available on Curzon Home Cinema, the BFI Player and Modern Films from 27 March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0307bef74c32547fa1e1f429644c3edfa1b01f01/37_122_2153_1291/master/2153.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0245cb8aefd52e989dec2c4e5669be35","title":"the shining ive never seen kubrick","story":"In the first of a new series, one of our writers finally catches up with the cinematic classic they’ve somehow missed. Today, Ammar Kalia watches Kubrick’s masterpieceI can’t sit through a horror film. Or, I can sit, I just watch through clammy fingers, anticipating each jump scare while trying not to squeal and wondering why I can’t just be watching an instantly forgettable romcom instead.I have long tried to overcome the fear of horror – there was Paranormal Activity, Get Out, The Witch (for an unfathomable reason) – but there is one horror I have lied about seeing on multiple occasions: The Shining. Whether on dates, with friends, or to strangers, I have used my viewing of The Simpsons’ parody of the Kubrick classic to feign knowledge, pretending that I, too, am a part of “the culture”.I have seen other Kubricks, but The Shining had always eluded me. If The Simpsons was anything to go by, I knew I would not like seeing apparitions of mute child-twins in a hotel corridor or Homer, sorry Jack Nicholson, axing his way through a closed door and repetitively writing the same thing over and over (the content of many an anxiety dream anyway). But perhaps it is time to rip off the plaster – it surely couldn’t be that bad?It was bad. Good, in a “cinematic appreciation” way, but bad in a sitting at home alone during a nationwide quarantine way. No one had mentioned the music to me before the score undulating from fluttering strings to thundering synths and that shrill whistle tone making those long tracking shots especially heart-palpitating. In fact, Kubrick’s penchant for lengthy, silent takes makes perfect sense now, elongating observation into its own sense of anticipatory fear. And this gels so well with the evolution of Nicholson’s face throughout morphing from smug and clean-shaven to craggy and wide-eyed, broken only by his terrifying rictus grin – a perfect foil to Shelley Duvall’s incredulity. Although, reading up afterwards, it seems much of this performance was manifested by Kubrick’s on-set bullying and exhaustive tactics.Kubrick masterfully develops so many horror tropes though – the lone, ghostly bartender, the eerie locked room, the creepy kid who should really just be in intensive therapy, foreboding flashbacksflashforwards – and at least his lone black character (Scatman Crothers) lasts throughout the majority of the film, although he does of course die first.Really, though, isn’t this just an allegory for the attendant traumas of the writing process, especially when undertaken under an enforced quarantine, with nothing for company apart from your own imagination and your increasingly unnerving surroundings? One thing is certain, I did not sleep well after watching The Shining and before writing this. Turns out all social isolation and no play makes this film very relatable indeed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86ab959b9ba8a014ddf0dc2a0fbf2a0e01a51433/0_306_6192_3712/master/6192.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64780f3193862ccd4969c0c583e4ded3","title":"how to cook the perfect vegetable tagine recipe","story":"How to make the most succulent vegetarian version of this quintessential Moroccan stew The idea of there being a single perfect formula for vegetable tagine is as absurd as there being just one way to make a good chicken casserole. A tagine is simply the name of the cooking pot in which the stews are traditionally made, rather than the name of a specific recipe (though these days, I’m assured, a saucepan or pressure cooker are more common in Moroccan homes).And, as Nargisse Benkabbou explains in her book Casablanca, there are four popular styles, regardless of whether the main ingredient is goat, sardines or artichokes. These are mqualli cooked with olive oil, turmeric, ginger and saffron mhammer made with butter, cumin and paprika mchermel cooked with chermoula, a zingy herb paste and one made with tomato, cumin and paprika. Each, Benkabbou says, “can be customised with seasonal vegetables, dried fruit, preserved lemons, olives and nuts”.“The making of a good tagine is a state of mind, rather than a culinary art. Once you have grasped the basic principles of seasoning, balance and contrast, the opportunity is there to have fun creating your own. Have a play.”All, I can confirm, are good candidates for the tagine treatment, even parsnips, much as I dislike them – whatever you go for, though, aim for a range of textures and flavours. Some sweetness, in the form of squash or sweet potato, is often welcome, and I’m going to balance that with the slight bitterness and more robust texture of turnips. Both are best in bite-sized pieces, as most recipes recommend Hart’s 5cm chunks are a bit unwieldy, and take for ever to cook through. I also wouldn’t bother to peel the turnips, unless they’re huge.Jones bulks out her stew with chickpeas, while Hart uses “inauthentic” puy lentils both help turn what can seem like a light side dish into a satisfying main event. Chickpeas feel a better fit, though they make for a less pretty result, the deep green of the puy setting off the vivid orange of the squash to quite beautiful effect.Some sort of onion seems to be mandatory in these tagines – Butcher keeps her shallots whole, but I prefer to cut my onions thinly and allow them to melt down into the sauce, where their savoury flavour is most welcome. If you’d like the dish to be even sweeter, consider, like Gregory-Smith, going for red onions, especially if you choose to eschew the fruit. I like Butcher and Benkabbou’s prunes, however along with the customary honey, they give the dish an intensity of flavour that makes the contrast with Hart’s salty preserved lemons particularly pleasing, though if you’re not a fan, you could also use dates or Jones’ dried apricots.Instead of adding them to the dish as it’s cooking, Benkabbou boils the fruit up with some of the gravy, a spoonful of honey and a cinnamon stick to make a thick, intensely sweet sauce that she then pours over the top of the tagine. If you’re serving the tagine in smaller, more elegant quantities, as a side dish perhaps, or simply prefer less sauce, then this is a good way to go.Gregory-Smith and Jones are the only ones to opt for a tomato base, which works particularly well with the starchy blandness of potatoes, but less so, to my and my testers’ minds, with sweeter vegetables and dried fruit a simple vegetable stock allows them to shine.Cinnamon, ginger and saffron are the most popular spices, with Gregory-Smith, Hart and Butcher adding earthy cumin, Benkabbou vivid turmeric and Jones zesty coriander. Paprika is also common in tomato-based sauces. I’ll be sticking to the classic mqualli combination of ginger, saffron and turmeric, but adding cinnamon, too, because it works so well with the prunes.Jones makes a deliciously punchy “herb smash” to go with her tagine, while Gregory-Smith mixes up harissa, lemon juice and oil to serve alongside his both are excellent accompaniments. Keeping things simpler, I’m sold on the combination of Hart’s salty green olives with sweet prunes, while her buttery blanched almonds bring some much-needed crunch. A final scattering of coriander leaves isn’t just for show: the clean flavour seems to lift the entire dish. Serve with bread for dipping, and plenty of harissa.2 tbsp olive oil2 large onions, peeled and thinly sliced4 garlic cloves , peeled and thinly sliced1½ tsp ground ginger1 tsp turmeric powder1 cinnamon stick¼ tsp saffron threads 600g winter squash or sweet potato, peeled and cut into bite-sized pieces400g baby turnips, quartered or halved if on the large side500ml vegetable stock300g soft prunes1 preserved lemon, skin only, finely chopped1 tbsp butter50g blanched almonds2 tbsp honey50g green olives, pitted1 x 400g tin chickpeas, drained 1 small bunch fresh corianderHarissa, to serveHeat the oil in a large, heavy-based pan for which you have a lid over a medium heat, then fry the onions until soft and translucent.

The League One promotion chasers had ordered 48 of their players and staff to test for Covid‑19 last Tuesday, in the wake of the club’s FA Cup meeting with Arsenal on 2 March. The Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, was diagnosed with the virus on 12 March, and that was really the moment when everything unravelled in English football, leading to the suspension of action.And so, to quote Gallen again, there was “a bit of a wait for everyone”. He was in the first batch to find out last Thursday, along with nine others. Everybody was clear. But the situation darkened from Friday as the next set produced three positives, Saturday one more and Tuesday yet another. The club have said they are waiting on one last result for a member of the backroom team.All five of the Portsmouth personnel to test positive have been players – Sean Raggett, James Bolton, Ross McCrorie, Haji Mnoga and Andy Cannon – and it means the club have become the first in British football to confirm multiple members of their squad have the virus.There is a sliver of good news, and goodness knows we need it. Gallen says the players, who are in isolation, are not suffering. “They are all feeling reasonably good,” he says. “One of them said that he’d lost his sense of smell, which has been mentioned now as a symptom, and two of the others … you could call them as having a cold or a cough. They were all surprised to hear they had it – very surprised. Symptoms-wise, there weren’t many flowing around our squad at all.”It is nevertheless impossible to shake the slightly unreal feeling that has enveloped the club. Two weeks ago they were in the thick of it, having just played their 50th game of the season – the 2-2 home draw with Fleetwood in the league. It was their sixth match in 18 days and left them fourth in the ision, two points off automatic promotion.After a slow start to the season – Portsmouth were fourth from bottom at the end of September – they have won 16 of 30 league games, drawing six – and also reached the EFL Trophy final for the second season in succession. They won it last time when they beat Sunderland. The run to the fifth round of the FA Cup and that tie against Arsenal, which they lost 2-0, was a further source of pride. But now the virus has gripped and uncertainty reigns.“When we were told we were going to shut down on 13 March, it was a huge disappointment,” Gallen says. “But after a bit of sober reflection, you do start to think that football does seem a bit irrelevant. It’s such a difference to wanting to be successful and win to, oh, hang on a minute, there’s other things going on that are miles more important.”When will Portsmouth train again? Gallen does not know. But what does look increasingly clear to him is that the proposed return-to-competition date of 1 May is fanciful. How can it be anything else when Boris Johnson announced at least three weeks of lockdown on Monday?“Everyone is thinking that’s not going to be the date,” Gallen says. “If it is, then we’ll prepare accordingly, but I’m pretty sure that we won’t be playing games on that date.”Gallen’s thoughts have turned towards his players’ fitness and their readiness to resume after the hiatus. He believes it would not take them as long as many people think.There is the caveat of match fitness. “Most coaches, managers and players would say that if we were to do 10 days of fitness work, on that first game, most players would be blowing out of their proverbials after 20 minutes,” he says. “The only way to get match fit is to play competitive matches. It’s pretty obvious but you’d be amazed how some people think it’s anything but that.”Football faces tough choices and one of them could be whether to attempt to finish the season with games behind closed doors. Gallen says it would be a nightmare for supporters but, if the alternative were to be voiding the leagues, he would give it his blessing.“If this season doesn’t restart and Liverpool don’t get the Premier League trophy, that would be heartbreaking,” Gallen says. “If there was any opportunity to get the season done and dusted, that would be better than just leaving it and I’d say that with a heavy heart if the fans were not allowed to attend. It would stop a lot of arguments, a lot of lawyers.“The thing I would also say is if we all do right by the government and follow their instructions, we’ll be able to get our football season back quicker than if we don’t. If everyone just carries on going about their business, it’s going to be longer.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/226ae3d47a2e18ee60ec3a76424591efb01df640/0_241_5127_3077/master/5127.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ddb15d7fd48120c3e27b0cfdf8ba1cd","title":"from giant snakes and ladders to toddler pong five minute mums survival guide to lockdown with kids","story":"If imaginary cups of tea make you question your life choices, these simple games for under-fives are fun, educational and encourage independent playEven if you are a trained professional (I’m an ex-teaching assistant) and have survived six years of being a stay-at-home parent, the thought of having little kids at home full-time is a lot. Forget loo roll, I am stocking up on Cadbury’s Creme Eggs to get me through the coming weeks.Children learn through play, but my own forcing me to drink a pretend cup of tea for the 85th time made me seriously question my life choices. So I decided to start thinking up easy games that I could enjoy, too. I could fully engage with the kids while we played, and then allow them to play independently afterwards, knowing I had done my bit for a while.I have just one rule for every single game we play: always let the kids come to the game. If they come, great. If they don’t? Leave the activity out if you can. They might approach it later. They might not. It doesn’t matter.In April 2018, I set up my Five Minute Mum blog, sharing activities that used stuff from around the house. I now have more than 150 games on my website and in my book, including the selection below, and I will be using them to get through the weeks and months ahead. Along with the chocolate, of course.I love dice. There are so many games you can play with them, and counting the dots from one to six is such a great early skill. This game came to me right when the kids were driving me bonkers and I was fed up with muttering “FFS” to myself.You will needA load of books or cushions (about 25)A length of string (or more if you want more snakes)Masking tapeA diceTo set up1. Scatter the books or cushions across a room in a rough, wiggly line – these are your board-game squares.2. Between two of your squares, lay down a wiggly line of string – this is your snake. You can have one or more snakes.3. Between another two squares, stick down some masking tape – this is your ladder. It doesn’t have to look like a ladder it can be just a line. But you can make rungs, if you’re feeling fancy. Again, you can have one or more ladders.To play1. Err ... it’s pretty self-explanatory. Just take it in turns to throw the dice and jump across the corresponding number of board squares. (You are the counters!)2. If you land on a snake, you go back to the square at the end of the snake.3. If you land on a ladder, you go forward to the square at the top of the ladder.4. The first player to reach the finishing line wins.For those learning to read, add some additional squares with bits of paper that say things such as “Hop 5 times” or “Go back 3 steps”.Giant cardboard boxes are the best. You can quite literally throw one in the direction of small children and go and make a cup of tea. Once they have run out of things to do with it, cut it down and lay it flat and you have got yourself an instant racetrack.You will needA large cardboard boxA penA toy car for each playerTo set up1. Write your child’s name in the style of a road along the flattened-out box.2. Leave the cars nearby.To play1. Each player chooses a car and drives it along the letter roads. Tell your child the letters you are driving along. See if they want to join in.2. You could also write your name alongside your child’s and have a race.3. Or perhaps try taping a pen to the back of your child’s car, then see if they can draw around the racetrack with it.If you don’t have a box, an old wallpaper roll works well.This is probably my most popular game it seems to set the kids’ imaginations running wild – the way playtime should. Plus, it gets them to practise writing numbers without realising that’s what they are doing. You will need quite a few bits and bobs for this one, but hopefully it’s stuff you already have at home.You will needA small toy your child likes – we use Dennis the DinosaurA little basket or boxPlay-dough or Blu-Tack3 differently shaped keysA pencil and some paperA diceTo set up1. Put the toy under the upside-down basket or box.2. Make three balls out of the play-dough or Blu-Tack, then press a key into each one to make an impression. Put the three key impressions on top of the basket or box.3. At the top of one bit of paper, trace round one of the keys with the pencil. Draw three boxes below it. Then repeat for the remaining two keys.4. Leave the dice near the basket or box.5. Finally, hide the keys around the room.To play1. Tell your child that their toy has been trapped inside a cage and they need to set the toy free. In order to do this, they have to find the keys to the cage – and the keys are hidden somewhere in the room.2. When they find a key, they must match the key to its outline on one of the bits of paper. Let them find the correct bit of paper by matching the key shape.3. Before they can use the key to unlock the cage, they must roll three numbers on the dice to get the code. They then write the code on the piece of paper. Let them roll the dice, recognise the number and write it in a box.4. Once they have written down the complete code, they can put the key in its play-dough impression.5. Repeat with the remaining two keys.6. When they complete the third key, the cage is unlocked and the toy is released. They will also have written out nine numbers, and hopefully laughed their little socks off.My hen do was full of brilliant games, including “prosecco pong”, which ended with everyone crying with laughter. When I arrived home in a bedraggled state, I discovered a ping-pong ball in my handbag and I thought the kids might like a go, minus the prosecco.You will needSome cupsA pen and some paperScissorsA ping-pong ball or bouncy ballTo set up1. Pop the cups on the floor. They can be dotted about randomly, in a line or in a triangle.2. Write on a piece of paper something you would like your child to practise, then cut it out and put it in a cup. For example, if they are learning particular letters or numbers, write them down. Do this for all the cups.3. Put the ball nearby.To play1. Explain to your little one that the idea is to bounce the ball and try to get it to land in one of the cups. (Take turns if you are playing with more than one child.)2. When a player gets the ball into a cup, they can take out the bit of paper and see what it is. Help them to read it out loud, then remove that cup.3. Keep playing until all the cups are gone.To practise colour recognition, use different coloured cups or put different-coloured items inside each cup. This is good for ages one to three.In my experience, simple is always best. If my kids and I can play a game with just a pen and paper, it makes my day. No big clean-up and I get five minutes of feeling that I am nailing parenting because my kids have the biggest grins on their faces. Whenever I hear them say: “Can we play it again?”, it’s music to my ears! (Well, not always, but, you know, if I’m in the mood for it.) And speaking of music …You will need10 bits of paperA penSomething to play music onTo set up1. On each piece of paper, write a different letter. It could be the letters of your child’s name, phonics sounds or even words. I tend to mix it up, including a few letters my kids are confident with and a few that are new or that they get stuck on.2. Spread the letters out on the floor.3. Put the music on standby.To play1. Explain that when the music plays, they can dance or run around between the letters. Then, when the music stops, they have to jump on a letter and shout it out. You jump on a letter, too, and shout it out.2. Remove the letters that get jumped on, then start the music again.3. Keep going until there is only one letter left to win, or until all the letters are gone.If you want to make things more competitive, stop the music and shout out a letter for children to find – and race them to it.Give Me Five by Daisy Upton AKA Five Minute Mum is published by Penguin.

According to the scientists’ calculations, if Usain Bolt mastered the contraption, his top speed would rocket from 27.8mph to nearly 50mph.“We wanted to see what physics allows and then explore it further by developing a device,” said David Braun, an engineer who works on human augmentation at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee.“This shows us how far we can push the boundaries and what key features we should focus on to develop the new technology.”Braun hit on the idea after studying the mechanics of running and cycling. While the fastest human running speed on the flat is close to 28mph, the equivalent top cycling speed is nearer 50mph. Much of the difference is due to bicycles being in contact with the ground the whole time and the pedalling mechanism which allows the rider to power along constantly.What is needed, he reports in Science Advances, is a way for runners to do work when their feet are off the ground.Braun and his colleagues used computer models to test a number of theoretical devices that took into account air resistance, the power limit of the human leg and the energy that is lost when the foot impacts the ground. They concluded that a spring-powered device that attached to the legs could give runners the boost they sought.The principle behind the device is to store energy by compressing a spring when the runner lifts and bends their trailing leg before they swing it forwards. When the leg moves forward, the spring is locked and remains compressed until the foot hits the ground. Only then is the energy released to power the runner forwards.“This allows runners to do work during the aerial phase of the running motion,” Braun said. “It’s the key to borrowing the benefits of cycling and using them in running.”A second requirement is for the springs to be “programmable” so that the stiffness can be increased as the runner picks up speed. This can be done with a mechanism that steadily shortens how much of the spring can be compressed, since shorter springs are stiffer than longer ones.The effect, Braun said, is comparable to the gears on a bike that are switched up as the cyclist rides faster.Just as ice-skating and cycling take time to grasp, so might the final contraption take some mastering, the researchers admit.And while Braun hopes to have a demonstration model finished in a year, it may take several more years of development to reach its full potential.“At the early stage, it will look like an exoskeleton, but in the later stages we hope it will look like a shoe,” he said. “It’s one thing to build a prototype but quite another to miniaturise it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95e22bc091ed758ee41035e517dbb0fd1ed6d189/329_519_2892_1735/master/2892.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35ad3395c69f4f7f869416d9aabce7e8","title":"cork racecourse coronavirus testing centre","story":"• Tom Kerr: ‘We have been left with no other choice’• Cork racecourse becomes coronavirus testing centre The Racing Post, the sport’s trade newspaper, will “temporarily suspend” publication of its print edition from Friday, leaving a number of its journalists “temporarily stood down” while the operation’s news service continues online.The Racing Post launched in April 1986 and has been the sport’s only daily newspaper for most of the 22 years since the closure of the Sporting Life in 1998. It also produces a separate print edition for display on the walls of Britain’s 7,000 betting shops. The closure of all shops earlier this week as a result of measures to stop the spread of coronavirus, along with the end of racing behind closed doors in Ireland, appear to be behind the decision to suspend print operations.In a letter to readers in Thursday’s edition, which was published online on Wednesday evening, Tom Kerr, the Post’s editor, says that “unfortunately, with racing in Britain and Ireland halted, betting shops closed and our governments urging everyone to stay at home as much as possible to slow the spread of coronavirus, we have been left with no other choice.”The Racing Post does not report its circulation figures to the Audit Bureau of Circulations, which compiles national newspaper circulation data, but filings of accounts at Companies House suggest its print circulation declined from a daily average of 66,000 in 2008 to just under 35,000 in 2017. This daily figure is certain to vary significantly because of seasonal and other factors, with a much higher sale expected on Saturdays and during major festivals such as Cheltenham and Royal Ascot.The Post, which has a cover price of £3.50, also operates an online subscription service, with packages allowing full access to its extensive form database and race replays available for £19.95month and £34.95month, although early access to the print edition is a key selling point of the premium package.“I know many of you will share our enormous disappointment that this is the last edition of the Racing Post for a while,” Kerr says in his letter to readers.“However, we will continue to publish on racingpost and on the Racing Post mobile app, ensuring that racing professionals, punters and fans of the sport are informed and entertained for however long this shutdown might last. Racing might be suspended but we know your passion for the sport and need for accurate information continues. We’re still here to serve you.“At some point in the coming weeks or months, when the worst of this disease has passed, horse racing will resume. When racing is back, the Racing Post newspaper will be back as well, filled with all the wit, wisdom, data and analysis that you expect from us.”Few racing professionals would ever be without their daily Post. While the suspension of print operations may have been inevitable with most of the global racing programme and all other domestic sporting action suspended, the sudden loss of the paper edition will still come as a shock in racing centres across the country.With a long suspension of racing also casting a shadow over the future of many betting shops, there will be a real fear in the industry that Thursday’s print edition of the Racing Post could yet prove to be the last.Cork racecourse will become a testing centre for coronavirus from Thursday morning as Irish racing lends its support to government efforts to stop the spread of the virus, following the suspension of all racing in Ireland until at least 19 April.Horse Racing Ireland, which was forced to abandon its programme of staging race meetings behind closed doors on Tuesday by new restrictions on sporting events, also said in a statement on Wednesday that it is “working … to identify other elements of racing’s personnel and infrastructure that could be used in the co-ordinated reaction to the crisis.”HRI also warned of the “potentially catastrophic impact of a sustained period without racing on all sectors of the industry” and suggested it will look to return to racing behind closed doors at the earliest opportunity.Cork racecourse, near the town of Mallow, is about 30 miles from Cork City, Ireland’s second-largest city after Dublin with a population of nearly 200,000. Croke Park in Dublin, the 82,000-seat headquarters of the Gaelic Athletic Association, opened a Covid-19 testing centre last week and more tracks seems likely to follow Cork’s lead in a country which has the highest number of racecourses per head of population in the world.“What is most important is that as a country, we do all we can inidually and collectively to fight the transmission of Covid-19 and focus on our health,” Nicky Hartery, the HRI chairman, said after a meeting of the organisation’s board, “ensuring that resources such as medical facilities and personnel are allocated where the need is most.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f799550de868e6bfeed2eaf2b4bb46bdd63c6909/0_0_5194_3117/master/5194.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ef2a8e8c90b95f871eea24154f3544d","title":"ioc hopes to agree new tokyo olympics date as soon as possible","story":"The International Olympic Committee president has confirmed a cherry blossom Games in the spring of 2021 is under active consideration for the rescheduled Tokyo Olympics.Thomas Bach said an IOC taskforce called “Here We Go” would start talks with 33 international sports federations about setting new dates for the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics on Thursday. But he warned: “It’s a huge jigsaw puzzle and every piece has to fit. If one piece is taken out it can destroy it. The Games have never been postponed before. There is no blueprint.”An IOC coordination commission that has been overseeing preparations will now work towards determining a date for next year amid a chaotic sports calendar, which has been severely disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic.“The agreement is that we want to organise these Games at the latest in the summer 2021,” Bach said. “This is not restricted just to the summer months. All the options are on the table including the summer 2021.”Hosting the Tokyo Games in the spring would have at least one major advantage – it would be far cooler than in the summer. But Dai Greene, the former world 400m hurdles champion, warned it would give athletes less chances to qualify, especially if coronavirus leads to the 2020 summer of sport being cancelled.“When do we get the chance to compete and qualify for a spring Games?” Greene wrote on Twitter. “This summer will be sparse at best. Someone have a word.”The chief executive of British Rowing, Andy Parkinson, said rowers would prefer a summer Games. “The IOC decision to postpone the Games was very welcome – although it was clear over a week that training was being compromised and that our rowers’ ability to achieve their own dreams was becoming less and less likely.“We understand the IOC needs to have lots of conversations with broadcasters, with the organising committee and sports, and it is not simple to rearrange. But whatever the IOC decides, rowing needs to decide the implications for qualification and how we select our team. So early 2021 is not preferable for us.”On Tuesday the IOC agreed with Japan to the first peace-time postponement in the Olympics’ 124-year history, although many have questioned why a seemingly inevitable decision took so long to make. Bach, who insisted he had no intention of resigning, said the “dynamic” spread of the virus had led to the ramping up of discussions around a postponement.“We had at the very beginning of this crisis a clear focus on the development in Japan, where we had always to evaluate whether it would be in a position to offer a safe environment for every participant,” he said. “This focus then shifted more and more to the international world.”Japan remained “very confident” it could successfully host the Games right up to the weekend, Bach added, but the picture began to change on Sunday when the IOC saw the spread of the virus in Africa and other parts of the world.“On Sunday morning I called an emergency meeting of the IOC executive board with the aim to open a discussion with our Japanese hosts and partners and friends about the postponement of the Games,” Bach said. “We could not manage such a postponement without the support of Japan.”The IOC president said one problem that needed addressing was ensuring the athletes’ village would be fully accessible next year, although families are not due to move into their apartments until 2023. “This is one of the questions of many thousands this taskforce will have to address,” he said. “This is an unprecedented situation and challenge. This will need sacrifices and compromises by stakeholders.”Parkinson said British Rowing would be working with each member of the squad to make sure they were safe and not stressing about training or the delay in the Olympics.“We are in daily contact but as everyone knows this is a much bigger crisis than just sport,” he said. “There’s also a lot of uncertainty. Some of our athletes have got commitments in 2021 so going through to the Games is now not a possibility – including a member of our team who has already deferred a university place for a year.”It is unclear how UK Sport will fund British athletes and sports for the next year, given funding for the Tokyo 2020 cycle runs out shortly. Parkinson expects the problem to be resolved. “There is a real understanding on the financial impact this may have on national governing bodies, some of whom have less cash liquidity than others and less sustainable financial models than others,” he said.“I’ve been encouraged by UK Sport’s stance – as well as that of Sport England when it comes to grassroot sport.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/daf8f53f5bcb7d5ba0b8dcbc712eeffb8d0a7fd3/305_152_5263_3158/master/5263.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9f1f37c4a72cddb007c3d3418f61030","title":"rugby league clubs consider putting players on unpaid leave","story":"The Super League chief executive, Robert Elstone, is confident all 12 top-flight clubs will survive the financial uncertainty which has engulfed rugby league during the coronavirus crisis but concedes both the competition and clubs will have to seriously consider the possibility of furloughing.Domestic rugby league is on hold for an indefinite period following a meeting of the sport’s senior figures earlier this week. It is unclear when the season will resume, and with many clubs ordinarily struggling financially, the lack of regular income has left many fearing for their future.Elstone promised that all Super League clubs will be given the best possible chance of surviving. “We have added complications of French and Canadian teams but our big priority right now is economic survival for ourselves and our clubs,” he said. “We’re looking at what government support is offered to make sure we can access it as quickly as we can and that’s gratefully received by clubs. We’re looking at a specific request which is much-needed which the RFL is working on.“We’ve spent a week looking at every single line in the budget to save money and ensure we distribute funds to our clubs every month to protect them for as long as we can. That is very much our priority.”“Furloughing was a welcoming initiative the government put on the table which every club is looking at,” Elstone said. “We’ve spent time looking at our staff base and furloughing is an option for a large number of our employees.“We’ve got to respect the fact we have to work that through, communicate with our staff and do it professionally and sympathetically. A solid request for funding has been submitted. In the intervening period there have been things like furloughing and additional benefits put on the table by government and we need to reflect that in a revised submission.“Super League are actively involved in what that number was but I spoke to Ralph (Rimmer, RFL chief executive) late last night in terms of revising and updating that. We’re very keen to be involved to ensure what we put in front of government is as good as it can be.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb4bcb4ca4ab37c90de096f7146641128ce730c2/0_148_1483_889/master/1483.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=844281ec73b92d370a6fbf0d08ca89ce","title":"terrence mcnally tributes","story":"F Murray Abraham, Paula Vogel, Ken Ludwig and Jeremy O Harris remember the great US playwrightThere was a closed audition for Terrence’s play Where Has Tommy Flowers Gone? in 1971. I showed up anyway. They said we’re not seeing anyone without an appointment. I said I’ll wait – maybe you’ll change your mind. At the end of a long day, Terrence said: “Well, let’s give him a break.” I did an audition and Terrence said to me: “Where have you been all my life?” And that began our friendship – I’ve done more of his plays than any other actor.He and his husband lived two blocks away from me. We were very close. He grew up in Texas, like me. To be queer there in the 1950s must have been really hard. But he overcame all that crap. He was from another planet. Where he got the courage and the strength to overcome it and insist on dignity for queer culture is a mystery. I imagine his idea was that writing was the best way to accomplish what he wanted. His sense of humour kept him afloat. He was quick, funny, delightful. One of his favourite lines from Shakespeare was “Where the bee sucks, there suck I.” He was really puckish. Terrence was young for ever. And he was always forgiving – considering some of the shit I pulled, he still forgave me. And he wrote a play for me: Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune.The one word that rises to everyone’s lips when we talk about Terrence McNally is “kind”. He was remarkably kind, in a field that runs on adrenaline. I was intimidated by his achievements and his writing when I first met him but with one gaze from his eyes I felt, as did we all, remarkably at home. Terrence was a role model: interested in younger artists, curious about innovations in theatre, voracious in his encouragement to us. In the years that followed, as I went through a metal detector to support his play Corpus Christi in the face of death threats, and sat in packed theatres watching Kiss of the Spider Woman, and Ragtime and Master Class, I couldn’t believe my good luck to know him. Terrence McNally was the first in our field to hold the door to the boys’ club of theatre and open it wide for the girls. We’ve lost a giant with the kindest eyes.I adored Terrence for lots of reasons. He was a model for me as I grew up in the theatre. He gave me thrill after thrill as I watched his masterworks on the stage. And he was unfailingly kind to me every time I met him. The last time was on the street in Cape May, New Jersey, where we were both teaching young theatre students, a day each, at the Cape May playhouse. He went first, and at the end of his day, he was as spruce and jaunty as ever. He made me laugh aloud about the joys of living at a beach resort in a classy bed and breakfast (“We’re getting paid for this?”) and, as always, he brightened my existence. He will be deeply missed, always revered and remembered with love.When I met Terrence McNally, he led with a smile of such unadulterated geniality I felt the fire-cracklin’ warmth of a southern upbringing before he even opened his mouth. It’s a warmth that many of his collaborators – it feels as though most of the New York theatre community worked with him in some way – have articulated they were met with as well. After reading of his passing I decided that I wanted to reacquaint myself with that warmth and perhaps share it with some who had never experienced by hosting a digital screening of 1997’s Love! Valour! Compassion!When thinking of McNally I think of Hestia, the greek goddess of the hearth, so married is his work to the construction of the theatre as a home for gay men. In McNally’s theatre, home meant harsh truths and discomfiting reversals of fate, yet it also meant the warmth of bodies nearby soaking in the warmth of the fire he had stoked.Last night, while soaking in that warmth with a new generation, I felt the walls of the home Terrence had built start to form around us. I felt each of us, socially isolated across the globe, leaning closer to our screens and closer to each other, warming ourselves in the glow of the fire he had built. ​"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39c510d50227249488bfe3b804fd0c732d43c17d/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d9697bf85fcdc8d9a01396b869a633b","title":"the breadwinners of barishal how women in bangladesh are starting their own businesses","story":"Women in this flood-hit area are supporting their families through small businesses backed by the British Red Cross. From tailoring to tea making, the success of these enterprises is inspiring other young women to follow suitby  Thaslima Begum in BarishalIn the sprawling urban slums of Barishal, where monsoons and flooding are inescapable, life for women is hard. They are more likely to miss out on getting an education, and without the proper knowledge and skill set, many struggle to make a living. As they are more likely to live in poverty, they are more affected by disasters. But despite these challenges, with the help of livelihood grants from the Red Cross, many women in Barishal are finding innovative ways to eke out a living.Rina, 37, from Palashpur, wakes up early every day to start preparing for work. From a side road of a small slum with heavy foot traffic, she has been running a successful tea stall for the last two years. Brightly coloured crisp packets hang like a banner across her shopfront, where Rina sells roughly 160 cups of tea a day at 5 taka (under 5p) a cup.She uses the money to pay for her children’s education and managed to save enough to buy a small TV, which kept her busy during the World Cup. “Everyone here loves football, so I thought it would be a good investment,” she says proudly. “Not everyone in the slums owns a TV, so when they stop to watch, they also buy tea.”Married at 12, Rina now has five children and is the sole breadwinner of her family. Her husband suffered a stroke seven years ago and is no longer able to work. “I had no money to feed my children. I’d already taken out loans and was worried about our financial situation.” But in 2018, she received a small grant, which enabled her to kickstart her own business.Rina’s customers are mostly men labourers who come to drink chai during their breaks and catch up with their friends. Though they don’t speak to Rina much, she has learned a lot from listening in on their conversations. “They discuss everything – sports, politics, economics and the weather – information I never had access to while sitting at home.”Knowledge about the weather is particularly important for Rina as flooding hampers her business. “When the water comes in, people aren’t interested in sitting around drinking tea.”As she buys her tea wholesale, grown in north-eastern districts such as Sylhet, it’s important for Rina to know of incoming natural disasters that might affect her supply, so that she can plan ahead.Mahmuda, 36, has just had a baby and is making plans on how to balance her tailoring business with motherhood. After receiving a small business loan, Mahmuda was able to establish her tailoring business, which has been going from strength to strength. Dressed in a traditional shalwar kameez she made herself, Mahmuda gently rocks baby Diya back and forth.After going into labour early and losing a lot of blood, the doctors thought both mother and baby wouldn’t make it. Mahmuda was able to use the money she generated from her business to pay for hospital fees and basic necessities for her premature baby.“My business is slowly expanding, and I am able to feed my children,” she says. Mahmuda buys materials and sews clothes for the women in her community. She recently bought a wardrobe to safely store her clothing and protect it from flooding and the smell of the draining system outside her home.Mahmuda lives with her baby and two young sons, sick husband and elderly mother – all of whom she supports financially. Her father left when she was small, so Mahmuda’s mother raised her on her own. She is happy to now be able to take care of her in return. “I am also able to maintain my sons’ educational expenses, which I couldn’t do before – it was a real struggle to pay their tuition fees every month.”Every morning, before the sun rises, Mukhal, 28, sets off on a small dinghy to the local fish market. Dressed in a black burka and face veil so as not to draw attention, Mukhal is one of the few women who can be found in a market mostly dominated by men. Over time she has been able to develop her negotiation skills, so she gets a better price for the catch. She then fills her basket and carries it back to her village, where she sells the fish to her neighbours.Mukhal has led a difficult life. Forced into marriage at the age of 12 when her father died, she became pregnant at 15, and was beaten then abandoned by her husband who took another wife. Her home is on the banks of the river and prone to flooding. “Everything I do is for my son. My only hope is to be the best mother that I can be. I don’t want my son to live this kind of life – I want him to be educated and to have a good job. He wants to be an engineer! I work hard to pay for his education, so he doesn’t have to struggle like me.”Also driven by a strong desire to help her family, Chompa, 15, currently works in an electronics factory. Her father was a rickshaw puller, but because of his old age and the flooding from heavy rain, such arduous work has become difficult. So Chompa is now the main breadwinner in her family, spending all day at a factory where she uses her small hands to put together electronic goods destined for faraway places worlds she catches brief glimpses of through the TV screens that she helps assemble.Chompa earns approximately 4,000 taka (£36.30) a month, which she puts towards rent, food and her parents’ medicines. But a few months ago, while building a fan, it suddenly switched on and the blades sliced off three of her fingers. “There was blood everywhere,” she says. “After a few seconds, I passed out.” Though the factory covered her hospital bill, and at this time she is still receiving her monthly salary, a future without able hands feels uncertain – she says she is likely to be downgraded or dismissed from her role.“What can I expect from this life?” she asks. “I have many dreams, but there are no opportunities.” She wishes she could attend school, but like many young girls from Barishal, this isn’t always an option. One day, when she is old enough, Chompa wants to own a business. She has seen the examples of other women in her community achieving success providing her with glimmers of hope that another reality is not only possible, it is within reach."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d71d20b05f7502215e0057e08765c15c2c14cff2/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91fac71b4d7a256d09937f6d3c64f2bc","title":"destination to revisit in future win 200 pounds sawdays stay coronavirus readers tips travel","story":"Tell us about a destination full of memories for you – that you’d love to return to once the Covid-19 crisis is overFirst of all, many apologies to readers who contributed to last week’s assignment on wildlife reserves, but we’ve had to postpone its publication given the Covid-19 crisis and government warnings on social distancing and travel.

Experts reveal what’s out there, where to look – and how to get competitive about it• Share your sightings in the commentsI saw the falcon – a peregrine or a hobby? – gliding high, silhouetted against the glare of a late summer afternoon. Behind me, small birds chattered obliviously in their favoured thicket. The falcon dipped and disappeared. I wondered where it had gone, then sensed a movement where no movement should be and, suddenly, for a fraction of a second, I was face to face with a hobby at full throttle – hurtling at the unsuspecting sparrows behind me. There was a rush of disturbed air against my ear and I caught the ferocious intent in its yellow eyes and it was past me, rearing up over the shrub and ing beyond it as a dozen small birds scattered.This didn’t take place in an RSPB reserve or on a moor. It was right in front of my house in Catford, south-east London, as I cycled back from Tesco, and was a reminder that genuinely exciting wildlife drama can happen right on your doorstep.This is what seasoned birdwatchers and the mildly curious will be clinging on to as the nation shuts down over the coming weeks. After all, yoga on Zoom isn’t for everybody.Some of us have always scrutinised the skies above our homes and gardens but the Covid-19 crisis has turned this activity into something of a movement, sparked by Matteo Toller of Udine in north-east Italy who recently set up #BWKM0 (birdwatching at zero km) on Twitter to help people record their sightings, share knowledge and show solidarity during the country’s lockdown. Matteo himself recorded 51 species from his windows in 12 hours earlier this month, including brambling, black stork, goshawk and the first house martins migrating north.London’s David Lindo, AKA the Urban Birder, is currently quarantined in Spain from where he is tweeting sightings from a rooftop in Mérida and hosting live birding streams on Facebook. David’s enthusiasm is undimmed by his confinement: “The sky is a great arena, anything can fly past and, at the very least, it will give you peace. My message is simple: keep looking up,” he tells viewers on day eight of his vigil.Expert birder Steve Gale’s personal garden list in a Surrey-London suburb extends to 92 species and includes spoonbill and honey buzzards. “That’s phenomenal,” I tell him, astonished.“It isn’t phenomenal,” he says. “It’s just that most birdwatchers don’t systematically observe birds at home. If you start learning the calls and how bird movements relate to flight lines, which use local landmarks, such as rivers and railways and habitats, you can quickly start adding to your list.”Steve’s blog, North Downs and Beyond, based around his “uber patch” where suburbs meet farms and woods, is a treasure trove of flora and fauna observations and a virtual meeting place for likeminded people from all over the country.He too has responded to the Covid-19 threat with a gently competitive birding challenge, inviting people to record sightings from their windows.He advises that the coming month, when many birds are on the wing for thousands of miles, is one of the best to start studying your “patch”, whether you have a garden or just a neighbouring tree and area of sky to study. This is because migration times are when birders expect to see most activity. Birds on the move can often be seen overhead and sometimes even stop by for a rest or meal in your garden or street, he says.“We once had a black redstart turn up in late March that stayed a week in our garden. It found food and hung around for a rest. They come from North Africa or southern Europe at the end of winter.” And, within the next week or two, swallows, house martins and swifts will begin to arrive from sub-Saharan Africa the latter will make urban skies a little noisier – and their screeching calls will be easier to hear as the whine of jets has almost vanished.The same goes for autumn, says Steve, who is also a bird-counting specialist. “There are days when my suburban garden can be better for observing migrating thrush than famous RSPB reserves. I’ve had 4,000 redwing pass over on days when Dungeness has had barely 20.”April is also a great time for wader passage, by night and day. Steve has heard relatively rare birds – such as bar-tailed godwit and whimbrel – passing overhead on journeys to and from the north of Scotland and the Arctic Circle. Why they’ve chosen to fly over the London suburbs as opposed to sticking to the coasts is unknown.“People are starting to buy microphones to use at night to hear calls. They are finding out a lot of new things about what flies at night … sea ducks like common scoter cuts across land we’ve now found.“What this quarantinesuppression of movement can do is to make people realise there is so much more to see at home. But it can be difficult – sometimes nothing happens, you’ve got to be prepared for that,” says Steve.I telephone Dave Woods, a birder who lives in one of the large Medway towns. I’m shocked when he tells me that he and his family have had mild symptoms of Covid-19 over the past week. I ask him whether he is well enough to take an interest in garden sightings (he’s built up a list of 77 species). He says: “No, absolutely not.” He pauses: “Though I did open a window yesterday for a puff of fresh air and heard my first blackcap this spring.”Among his favourite records was a brambling that decided his garden was a good place to build up strength before setting off for its summer breeding grounds in Scandinavia or Russia.He advises observers to keep a keen watch in severe weather: “In response to storms, unexpected birds can turn up in gardens or fly over urban areas as they try to reorientate … even gannets may be seen over inland gardens after bad conditions at sea. And particularly in north-easterly winds, clusters of waxwings sometimes show up in gardens, car parks and petrol stations where they’ll eat hawthorn, cotoneaster and pyracantha berries and any fruit left on trees, particularly when berries aren’t plentiful back home in their Nordic, Russian and Baltic breeding grounds.”My encounter with the hobby last summer may seem a moment of great luck but the sighting was typical of the wildlife drama playing out all around us all the time.

Production by  Matt FidlerFrom the south London streets of Southwark, Crouch End in the north, and around the City and West End, to Ramsbottom in Greater Manchester, the Forth Bridge and central Glasgow, the story was a similiar one. An eerily beautiful sunny day, quiet on the streets, with people not really sure how to pass the time.The day started with images on social media of busy underground trains as the reduced service resulted in a familiar crowding of the carriages, but this was not a normal day in the capital. Non-essential shops were closed, but the list of key workers is long, and London appeared overwhelmingly quiet on the deserted streets of Waterloo that David Levene photographed early in the day.Jill Mead discovered her local street market was busy in Southwark. The combination of spring weather, worries about supplies and unease about the government lockdown made for a strange atmosphere.Graeme Robertson found people observing physical distancing rules in the parks of north London in Highgate, masks and hats in Crouch End – and stillness on the quiet suburban streets of Archway.Sean Smith found a rather deserted square mile area, with a lone Domino’s Pizza delivery rider, before heading to the West End, where he came across the last performance artist working in Leicester Square – and met a tourist who had just arrived from Mexico and was trying to get to Germany.A woman taking the sunshine on a balcony, an ambulance passing through the streets – these were the sights of Ramsbottom in Manchester, where Christopher Thomond spent the day.Murdo MacLeod found the rush-hour traffic much thinner than the usual gridlock after the government’s lockdown in response to the coronavirus outbreak.The city centre of Glasgow was quiet, with shops and cafes all closed – and the railway station was deserted.Ryan Bowman is the proprietor of Mezcal Mexican restaurant. After being forced to close the premises, he decided to put the perishable food to good use, by donating it to NHS staff and hospital workers.

Seventy thousand of the claims were from those asking for an advance, suggesting people began to struggle with money as soon the virus began to spread more widely.“We made a decision that managing claims and making payments is a number one priority for DWP. Operationally we can deprioritise other things,” he said.Disability benefits will no longer be assessed in job centres, ending face-to-face assessments which he said meant they are “extending existing awards” and no longer re-assessing personal independence payment claimants.The department has so far redeployed 1,500 members of staff to help with the sharp rise in universal credit claims, and is to increase this to 3,900 by the end of the week.Within weeks 10,000 employees working in functional jobs such as finance and on longer-term programmes within the department will be brought into the universal credit team.Schofield said: “The first people will start arriving in London job centres today from corporate centre type roles across DWP.”He claimed the online system to apply for the benefit was so far working well but admitted there had been problems with the online verification stage.“It’s still too early days to know whether people are getting through those in the time that I would expect them to. I suspect there are more people so far who are finding verification is holding them up,” he said.Asked by committee chair, Labour MP Stephen Timms, if it was acceptable to tell the half a million people who applied for universal credit that they will have to wait five weeks for their first regular benefit payment.Coffey said: “Advances can be made to people pretty quickly.”She said they will be “sticking with” the advance system and technically it is difficult to make changes to universal credit structure that people have been asking for.Turning the advance into a non-repayable grant, as has been suggested by some MPs, is “operationally not feasible” in the short-term, she said.She was backed by Schofield, who said the department would stick with the existing policies and frameworks relating to the benefits system so it kept functioning.Of the 230,000 people who applied for universal credit last week, 70,000 asked for an advance to deal with immediate cashflow problems, which Timms suggested put them into debt to the DWP at the start of the coronavirus crisis.Coffey said: “I don’t see it as being in debt. I see it as about spreading effectively an annual payment into 13 payments, rather than 12. Then people can chose early on what level of advance they get.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97a581e651b9ac1ce0d9cdbc6d7c45ac82984497/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5110db2d33b32de8db46861fd73d440f","title":"brazil rio gangs coronavirus","story":"Drug traffickers in one of Rio de Janeiro’s best-known favelas have imposed a coronavirus curfew, amid growing fears over the impact the virus could have on some of Brazil’s poorest citizens.In recent days, as Brazil’s coronavirus death toll has climbed to 46, gang members have been circulating in the Cidade de Deus (City of God) favela in western Rio ordering residents to remain indoors after 8pm.Last weekend the low-income community – made famous by Fernando Meirelles’ 2002 blockbuster of the same name – became the first such area to record a case of coronavirus.And in an apparent attempt to prevent further infections the Red Command gang leaders who control the favela have ordered residents to stay at home.A video apparently recorded in the City of God circulated on social media this week showing a loudspeaker broadcasting the alert: “Anyone found messing or walking around outside will be punished.”“The traffickers are doing this because the government is absent. The authorities are blind to us,” one resident told the .City of God’s gangsters are not the only outlaws attacking coronavirus in Rio’s densely populated favelas, which are home to about 2 of the city’s 7 million residents.In the Morro dos Prazeres, gang members have told residents only circulate in groups of two while in Rocinha, one of Latin America’s biggest favelas, traffickers have also decreed a curfew.“The gangsters have said that after 8.30pm everybody must stay indoors and if they don’t there will be reprisals,” said a street hawker who lives there. “I’m staying at home – filled with fear and smothered in hand sanitizer,” the man joked.In Santa Marta, a favela that sits in the shadow of Rio’s Christ the Redeemer statue, traffickers have been handing out soap and have placed signs near a public water fountain at the community’s entrance that say: “Please wash your hands before entering the favela.”Meanwhile, in some sections of the Complexo da Maré, a sprawling favela near Rio’s international airport, traffickers have told shops and churches to reduce their operating hours.“Only the bakery stays open until later – until 11pm,” said one mother who lives in Parque União, one of 16 communities that make up the Complexo. “Nobody wants to go outside – first of all for fear of coronavirus and now because of this order.”In another of the Complexo’s communities, Nova Holanda, evangelical prayer sessions are now taking place outside the church.“We sing our songs of praise to God from the windows of our homes, at pre-arranged times,” one resident said.Other favelas in which curfews have been imposed include Pavão-Pavãozinho in Copacabana, Cantagalo in Ipanema, and Vidigal, further along the beach past the upper-class neighbourhood of Leblon.Edmund Ruge, a Rio-based editor for the RioOnWatch news site which covers the favelas, said the imposition of curfews in some areas spoke to the Brazilian state’s longstanding neglect of such areas, which often lack even basic sanitation.“Favela activists have been scrambling very effectively” to respond to the impending coronavirus crisis with donation and awareness campaigns across Brazil, Ruge said, pointing to projects such as #COVID19NasFavelas.“It has been really impressive. The question is whether or not it is going to be enough.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ad9c10c7c0eeea9f1a601249c3583ce77ac22a4/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5adbb09506dbf9e4f0cb0b012488046","title":"coronavirus key questions answers everything you need to know covid 19","story":"From how to tell if you have Covid-19 to how to protect others - our experts answer the questions that really matterCovid-19 is the illness caused by a novel member of the coronavirus family that has transferred from animals to humans. The most common symptoms are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea.Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for 20 seconds each time, and use hand sanitiser gel. Catch coughs and sneezes with a disposable tissue and bin the tissue. If you don’t have a tissue available, cough and sneeze into the crook of your arm. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.Different countries have set different rules, but broadly speaking, if you live alone and develop a new continuous cough or a high temperature it is recommended to stay at home for seven days after symptoms began. If you live with others, everyone in the house must stay at home and not leave for 14 days. Studies show that people have the coronavirus without symptoms for five days on average.The infection may spread from person to person in shared houses. If anyone else starts to show symptoms while already in isolation, they must stay at home for seven days from the moment their own symptoms start, regardless of where they are in the 14-day isolation period. Check with your local medical authorities for specific advice that may be applied in your area.Many authorities are asking people to practise social and physical distancing. To reduce the spread of the virus, you should avoid meeting up with friends and family who don’t live with you. If you need to see the doctor or other essential services, use the phone, internet or social media if possible. In some places, you can go out for a walk for exercise and to buy essentials, but stay two metres apart from others. Check with local authorities for specific rules that may be applied in your area.Keep the patient rested and comfortable in loose-fitting clothing, keep the room where they are well ventilated, and ensure they drink plenty of water. Over-the counter pain relief may be helpful – but paracetamol (Tylenol) is recommended rather than non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines such as ibuprofen (Advil).To prevent the coronavirus spreading within the household, if possible keep the patient in their own separate room and using a separate bathroom. They should have separate cutlery, crockery, bedding and towels, and preferably wear a mask. Regularly clean and disinfect high-frequency touch surfaces in the home such as door handles, toilets, kitchen counters and tabletops. Everybody in the house should be washing their hands frequently. People with diabetes or heart disease are known to be at greater risk from coronavirus. The over-70s and pregnant women are also considered to be at higher risk.The coronavirus has spread to more than 150 countries. See the global map of confirmed cases or how many confirmed cases there are in your area in the UK.Many countries have imposed travel bans, closed schools and introduced curfews and lockdown conditions to try to halt the spread of the disease.In the UK there is a set of lockdown conditions to limit the movement of people. Schools are closed except to the children of a defined government list of key workers. All non-essential travel is discouraged, and there are a list of government travel warnings about visiting the rest of the world.There is no test to tell. Scientists are developing antibody tests to check for a prior infection, but those aren’t ready for clinical use. The only definitive way to know that you’ve had it is to test positive for it while you have it.To some extent, yes, but not completely. Masks are effective at capturing droplets, a main transmission route of coronavirus. If you are likely to be in close contact with someone infected, a mask cuts the chance of the disease being passed on. If you’re showing symptoms of coronavirus or have been diagnosed, wearing a mask can also protect others. However, masks will probably make little difference if you’re just walking around town, and are no guarantee of protection. Medical staff working with Covid-19 patients have been catching the virus despite all the protective equipment they have at their disposal.Reassuringly for parents, the disease has generally been milder in children, though they can spread it without displaying any symptoms. There are many unknowns, and research is continuing.With many children around the world suddenly taken out of school, it can be a worrying and bewildering time for them.The cough and fever is a result of the infection reaching the air passages that conduct air between the lungs and the outside. The lining of the air passages become injured, causing inflammation. The inflammation can spread throughout the lungs, causing them to fill with liquid, making breathing difficult. The lungs are then unable to get enough oxygen to the bloodstream, which can cause death.The first recorded case of the coronavirus is believed to have emerged in November 2019 in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province, China. Many of those first affected had worked in or visited the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the city of 11 million people.Yes. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) were both caused by coronaviruses that made the leap from animals to humans. In 2002, Sars spread virtually unchecked to 37 countries, causing global panic, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing more than 750.A pandemic is declared by WHO when a new disease for which people do not have immunity spreads in multiple countries simultaneously. Declaring a pandemic has nothing to do with changes to the characteristics of the disease or how dangerous it is.Currently there is no cure or vaccine for the coronavirus. Human trials are under way – but even if they go well and a cure is found, there are many barriers before global immunisation is feasible. A commercially available vaccine within a year would be considered quick.There’s little evidence that domestic pets can catch the coronavirus, but contact between them and an infected person may help transmit the virus. It is recommended to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water after coming into contact with any animal.People are being bombarded with new information at a time of heightened stress and it’s playing damaging games with our decision making. So how do we decide what’s good information and what isn’t?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e48474b0dd292449be1ab1aa9c86d33c8fd829f7/0_164_3494_2097/master/3494.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7542d09677912030d129efe6197e377c","title":"coronavirus symptoms what are they should i call doctor covid 19","story":"What are the symptoms caused by the Covid-19 virus, how does it spread, and should you see a doctor?It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has transferred to humans from animals. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.No. In the UK, the NHS advice is now that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. This applies to everyone, regardless of whether they have travelled abroad.In the UK, you should look on the dedicated coronavirus NHS 111 website for information. If you get worse or your symptoms last longer than seven days, you should call NHS 111. People will no longer be tested for the virus unless they are in hospital.Many countries have imposed travel bans and lockdown conditions in order to try and halt the spread of the virus. You should check with your local authorities for the latest advice on seeking medical assistance.People in the UK will only be allowed to leave their home for the following purposes:Police will have the powers to enforce the rules, including through fines and dispersing gatherings. To ensure compliance with the instruction to stay at home, the government will:Parks will remain open for exercise, but gatherings will be dispersed.China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January.As of 25 March, more than 425,000 people have been infected in more than 150 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.There have been over 18,000 deaths globally. Just over 3,000 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China, where the coronavirus was first recorded in the city of Wuhan. Italy has been hardest hit, though, with over 6,800 fatalities. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.More than 108,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6dee53ed3a9f5ab0dac3511d8dd5300f66faf65/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6545e252bfa8f09bf05d37da87ef68ec","title":"coronavirus uk how many confirmed cases are in your area","story":"Latest figures from public health authorities on the spread of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom.

He signalled that diplomatic flights were being arranged where commercial carriers could not operate.The developments come as the first rescue plane arrived in Peru as part of the mission to repatriate more than 600 British and Irish travellers. Peru is one of several countries to tighten its travel restrictions in response to the coronavirus pandemic, with the government closing all airports and insisting only government-organised flights, flying out of military airbases, will be permitted to leave the country.Stranded travellers in India said they had been pleading with UK embassies for help for days. An NHS doctor is among those stuck in India. Vaishnavi Kashyap, 27, said her return flights were cancelled and the situation had worsened since the lockdown announced by the prime minister, Narendra Modi, on Tuesday.She said her colleagues had requested her to return to work as soon as possible to help deal with a huge influx of coronavirus patients. “I can see my team at the Royal London hospital already struggling,” she said.“I am trying my best to get back to the UK so I can help my NHS colleagues and would really appreciate and want maximum support from the UK government to repatriate us to the UK in a timely manner.”Another of those stranded is a 77-year-old British man in hospital in Goa. Ivor Gunton, from Bristol, had been in hospital since the end of February after undergoing a life-saving colon operation.He was due to return to the UK this week via air ambulance to continue his treatment at Bristol Royal Infirmary. In the past 48 hours Gunton has been told he has contracted an infection and possible sepsis, his family said.His wife, Geraldine Davies, 72, flew back from India last week on the understanding that her husband would follow on an air ambulance three days later.However, Indian authorities revoked permission for it to land, meaning he is stuck in hospital without family or friends. Davies said she had tried to contact the high commission in Delhi. “It’s the most horrendous situation and I really do need to get him home.”Chris Linford, 56, from Hayfield in Derbyshire, said he and his wife, 53, and sister-in-law, 60, could not find anywhere to stay in Delhi as all the hotels were full. Indian police found them places in a backpackers’ lodge.Linford, a cafe owner, said he had seen Russian, German, Bulgarian and Italian citizens all repatriated by their governments in the last 48 hours but the UK embassy had been “no help whatsoever”. “In this hostel, every other country has left,” he said. “We’re totally stuck: we can’t leave Delhi, we can’t stay in Delhi. All the Foreign Office say is: ‘Be patient’. It’s ridiculous.”A Foreign Office spokeswoman said its staff were working tirelessly to help the group. She said its officials had “secured fast-tracked testing, raised the issue of standards with the most senior ministers in the region, and continue to lobby for their choice of hospital to make them as comfortable as possible.”She added: “In addition UK ministers have personally raised the matter with the chief minister there and we will continue to do everything we can to support them. We recognise this is a difficult time for many Brits. We are prioritising those who are vulnerable and are supporting them to return to the UK when they can.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f85302c178811064904f95b10f4b3f9d83e36181/0_51_3350_2011/master/3350.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bcbe9fcc011bb227b21f1571e3c2fca6","title":"mobile phone industry explores worldwide tracking of users coronavirus","story":"Talks about global data-sharing to counter coronavirus will raise privacy concernsThe mobile phone industry has explored the creation of a global data-sharing system that could track iniduals around the world, as part of an effort to curb the spread of Covid-19. has learned that a senior official at GSMA, an international standard-setting body for the mobile phone industry, held discussions with at least one company that is capable of tracking iniduals globally through their mobile devices, and discussed the possible creation of a global data-sharing system.Any move to create such a global tracking system would represent a major escalation in efforts to use mobile phone location data to help stem the pandemic, and would be likely to raise concerns among privacy and security experts.Until now the use of mobile phone tracking in the fight against Covid-19 has been restricted to national governments, which are either monitoring data within their borders or in discussions with mobile operators and technology companies about doing so.They include the US, India, Iran, Poland, Singapore, Israel and South Korea. The British government is engaged in talks with BT, the owner of the UK mobile operator EE, about using phone location and usage data to determine the efficacy of isolation orders.The concept of an international mobile tracing scheme would go further, enabling authorities to monitor movements and potentially track the spread of the disease across borders. The GSMA represents the interests of 750 mobile phone operators and vendors across the world and helps set international standards for companies.A person familiar with its exploratory talks said they were at an early stage and that decisions had not yet been made about whether to move ahead with the plan. The aim of such a global network would be to enact “contact tracing”, enabling authorities to use mobile location data to track who a person infected with Covid-19 may have come in contact with.A spokesperson for GSMA strenuously denied it was currently involved in any project to create a global tracking system. “We are not involved in a project of this nature,” the GSMA spokesperson said. However the GSMA also said it would not comment on discussions that had taken place or ideas that were being explored.“In this emergency situation, the GSMA and its members are doing everything they can to help the global fight against Covid-19,” Mats Granryd, the director of the GSMA, said in a statement emailed to the . “We are engaging with operators, policymakers and international organisations around the world to explore viable mobile big data and AI solutions to fight this pandemic while adhering to principles of privacy and ethics.”Advocates of using mobile phone technology in medical emergencies say accurate and up-to-date information can be a vital tool.The Washington Post reported last week that the US government was in active talks with Facebook, Google and other tech companies and health experts about how location data from Americans’ phones could be used to fight the pandemic. The report suggested public health experts were interested in anonymous aggregate data that could help map the spread of the virus.The emergency measures approved by the Israeli government last week go further, enabling authorities to track inidual people suspected or confirmed to have been infected to notify iniduals who may have come into contact with them. They also allow phones to be used to enforce strict quarantine rules.The proposed UK scheme would involve anonymised mobile phone data being used to monitor whether coronavirus limitation measures such as asking the public to stay at home are working. It could also be used to send health alerts. While the information provided on geographical movement would be delayed by 12 to 24 hours, British privacy campaigners have raised concerns over the scheme, calling for “radical transparency” in the way the government uses mobile data.One telecommunications expert, who spoke to the  on the condition of anonymity, said GSMA would be capable of creating a global data-sharing network if mobile operators around the world agreed to share usage information. That data would then be used to help authorities visualise the spread of the disease, or to track inidual subscribers to perform “contact tracing”, using an inidual’s location to detect how the disease might spread.David Kaye, a UN special rapporteur on freedom of expression, said it was not necessarily a bad thing for governments to use technology as a means to help control the virus. But he said there were important rule of law standards that had to be taken into account if emergency measures were put in place, including the possible tracking of iniduals by mobile phone companies.He said these included alerting iniduals whose data was being tracked, being fully transparent about the data collection and subjecting any such initiatives to judicial oversight. He also said there should be sunset provisions in place and continuously reviewed so that emergency measures did not become permanent.“When I think about how these tools can be helpful, making sure they are adhering to basic standards is really important,” Kaye said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5792e06fa8984f79c76646672ca69ec664d07a3/0_168_4898_2938/master/4898.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25834e5be28c53f1ff72105b086d242e","title":"shop shuts belgian half over covid 19 but keeps dutch half open","story":"Clothing store on Belgium-Netherlands border takes unique approach to crisisThe owners of a clothing store straddling the border between Belgium and the Netherlands have been forced to close half of their shop and cordon it off to halt the spread of the coronavirus – while cheerfully keeping the part on Dutch territory open for business.The Zeeman store in the municipality of Baarle-Nassau, where the border splits streets in half, took the unique approach after the Belgian federal government ordered the shuttering of all non-essential stores.None of the clothes on the Belgian side of the shop are available for purchase but the half of the store in the Netherlands continues to welcome customers as the Dutch government has only called for physical distancing.A cordon has been erected within the shop to ensure that customers respect the respective national measures.Marjon De Hoon, the mayor of the Dutch municipality of Baarle-Nassau, told the Flemish broadcaster VRT: “The square metres in Belgium just follow the Belgian measures. The square metres in the Netherlands follow the Dutch measures.”Symptoms are defined by the NHS as either:NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u0026nbspstay at home for at least 7 days.If you live with other people,\u0026nbspthey should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine.

A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.Staying at home means you should:You can use your garden, if you have one.

It is definitely not ideal, but we are happy that we can now provide customers with the necessary things.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43fd0f66457e478f71b2d73ca15ba8d0faafaacb/0_50_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=975eb76d0b6b2312b34bc8a6bb05a8d4","title":"stay at home plea from woman who may have spread covid 19","story":"Sarah Ashley self-isolated with a cough but then her friend was taken to an ICUWhen she woke up on Monday morning the week before last, Sarah Ashley thought she was suffering from a hangover. When it dragged into the following day, the 38-year-old thought it was a lingering symptom of her weekend away.“I was just so exhausted and thought I just needed some early nights,” she remembers. “I was in bed both those nights by 9.30pm, which is not me.”Her cough began on Wednesday, a dry bark from deep in the lungs, and on Thursday she decided to work from home. That day the government asked people with a new continuous cough to self-isolate. “I spoke to my mum … I was like: that’s you, that’s me.”Ashley, from Bedford, could not get through to her GP she left messages but no one called back. She called 111 and was told to stay at home. She was not offered a test. By Saturday her chest was tight. “It felt like someone was standing on it.” Ashley’s friends began to suffer similar symptoms and on Sunday, her best friend’s sister, a mother of one, aged 25, was struggling to breathe.Self-isolating at home with her five-year-old son, Ashley had no choice but to soldier on. “I was taking some paracetamol and trying to get on with it really,” she remembers. “It felt like there was something in there . All the time my body was feeling that it was fighting something off but I didn’t know what.”Her symptoms came and went, she lost her appetite, but things were never so severe that she felt unable to cope. Even with her son to look after, she was able to continue working from home.In any other year, Ashley might have written off such an illness as a seasonal bug – were it not for her friend’s condition. “It made me think: shit, that’s probably what I’ve had over the last week, without it being confirmed.” As the week wore on and Ashley recovered, her friend – who asked not to be named – deteriorated. On Monday she was moved to intensive care. Seven days after she was swabbed, her coronavirus test came back positive.What is most troubling for Ashley is the thought that she might have spread the virus. “It’s horrible, it’s a horrible thought, which is why I isolated immediately. It’s been horrible thinking I have potentially given that to my friend and she’s in the ICU – and also who else have I given it to? I don’t know.”Ashley works with families on the edge of care. She uses public transport, she is in and out of people’s homes, she works in schools. In the week she first began to suffer symptoms, she had been in a GP’s surgery waiting room supporting a young person. She doesn’t know where she caught it nor, more crucially, where she may have spread it.Last week, as the UK authorities issued ever more urgent advice to begin social distancing and take care over hygiene, Ashley – following developments from her self-quarantine – was furious to see people flouting the rules. She recorded a video and posted it to Facebook to urge friends to follow the advice.“It’s crazy. It’s absolutely terrifying,” she says. “Have they not seen what’s going on in Italy? Stop fucking about and stay at home.”On Tuesday night, Ashley’s friend was moved out of intensive care. She is now beginning to recover."},{"url":null,"title":"uk coronavirus lockdown rules what you can and cannot do","story":"Everything we know about the rules and restrictions so farBritain is now in lockdown, and all non-essential businesses must close.But many questions remain after Monday night’s historic broadcast by the prime minister with many people unsure what they can and cannot do, or which businesses are essential and non-essential.

The government later took a more cautious line, saying that the tests would not be available so quickly.The UK government has bought 3.5m tests – which reveal whether someone has had the virus and is therefore thought to have some immunity – and is ordering millions more, it has said.At the prime minister’s daily press conference on Wednesday, the government’s medical and scientific advisers said they needed to be certain the tests worked before they could be made available.“The key thing for us to do is evaluate – are these tests accurate enough to be used by the general public?” said Chris Whitty, chief medical officer. “If they are incredibly accurate, we will work out the quickest way to release them. If they are not accurate, we will not release any of them.”The tests would, he said, “completely transform what we can do” – but were not as important as the antigen tests which are used to diagnose Covid-19 in sick hospital patients.Boris Johnson said they would make the antibody tests available when they could. “We will do it as soon as possible,” he said. “We are massively ramping up our testing programme.”The home test, which looks like a pregnancy test, involves pricking a finger to produce a drop of blood, which is then analysed by the device. “Several million tests have been purchased for use. These are brand new products. We have to be clear they work as they are claimed to do,” Peacock said. “Once they have been tested this week and the bulk of tests arrive, they will be distributed into the community.”Amazon has agreed to carry out distribution and the tests are also set to go on sale in chemist shops.Symptoms are defined by the NHS as either:NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u0026nbspstay at home for at least 7 days.If you live with other people,\u0026nbspthey should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine.

You can also leave the house to exercise – but stay at least 2 metres away from other people.If you have symptoms of coronavirus, use the\u0026nbspNHS 111 coronavirus service\u0026nbspto find out what to do.Asked if they would be available in days rather than weeks or months, Peacock said: “Yes, absolutely.” If there was a charge for them, she thought it would be minimal, she added.Widespread availability of a fingerprick test that produces results in 10 to 15 minutes would be a game-changer. NHS doctors and nurses with symptoms would know immediately whether they have had Covid-19, enabling them to get back to work sooner.NHS workers or anyone else would be able to know if they have had the virus and are therefore immune, which means they could resume their normal lives, no longer having to work from home or keep their distance from other people. It is widely thought that having had Covid-19 makes people immune to the disease. There have been cases of apparent reinfection, though they are rare.The test detects the presence of IGM, an antibody that arises very early on in the infection, and IGG, which is increased in the body’s response to the virus. The results of some of the tests on order can be read by anyone, but others would need to be interpreted by healthcare professionals.The UK is not the only country ordering the antibody tests. “Tests are being ordered across Europe and elsewhere and purchased in south-east Asia. This is widespread practice. We are not alone in doing this,” said Peacock.Amazon had agreed to deliver the home tests, Peacock told the committee. There was no suggestion from her that the Royal Mail might be given the contract.The antibody home tests are part of a programme of increased testing, she said. The number of nasal swab tests, which are currently being used in hospitals to find out whether very sick patients have Covid-19, will be increased within the next couple of days.The government has promised that these tests, for current viral infection, will reach 25,000. Last week, the numbers tested topped 8,000 but since then have fallen to a low of 5,522, recovering yesterday to 6,491.Peacock reiterated that they would get to 25,000 a day. It is understood that a deal has been struck with the pharmaceutical giant Roche to increase the numbers to that level.Peacock said there were also plans to be able to test up to 100,000 key workers a day. “There is urgent work going on,” she said. A test processing centre that has just been opened in Milton Keynes would allow a much bigger laboratory of these standard PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests. The home-based test kits would be the third plank of the testing programme. The fourth was seroprevalence testing – blood tests to establish how widespread the virus was in the country.A Boots spokesperson said: “We are keen to work with the government to explore opportunities to support Covid-19 testing and to support the NHS in any way we can. However we do not have any type of Covid-19 tests in our stores. Customers should not make a trip to a Boots store or pharmacy for this purpose.”• This article and its headline were amended several hours after publication after the government’s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, contradicted earlier evidence to a select committee from Prof Sharon Peacock, the director of the national infection service at Public Health England, about when the tests would be introduced."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fea22048e02c73a04a9c3f245bce37f204a7fc79/239_0_2886_1731/master/2886.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=374ca50e6f853a190ac76745c8d7311d","title":"uk government set to pay self employed workers 80 of earnings","story":"Rishi Sunak pressured into measures amid fears coronavirus will trigger unemployment crisisSunak has been under growing pressure to do more for the UK’s 5 million self-employed after announcing an unprecedented job retention scheme for employees last Friday, that will see thousands paid to stay at home.It comes as Covid-19 claimed the life of a 21-year-old woman from Buckinghamshire, according to her family, and Britain’s deputy ambassador to Hungary, who was 37. It was announced on Wednesday night that the number of confirmed UK cases stood at 9,529 people and the death toll had risen by 41 to 463.The prime minister promised on Wednesday that the government was preparing to “put its arms around every worker.” He said the self-employed would be offered “parity” with employees – though Whitehall sources cautioned that did not mean the two schemes would be identical.It could be subject to a lower cap than the £2,500 in monthly pre-tax income available in that scheme, however – because the self-employed tend to pay less tax. Some groups, including those already claiming universal credit, could be excluded.Speaking at the daily Downing Street press conference, the prime minister said: “I genuinely don’t think there’s been a time in our history in the last century, certainly, when the government of this country has put its arms around so many people to get us through a very tough time. We will get through it, and we will get through it together.”Sunak significantly increased the generosity of universal credit as part of last week’s package, and made it available to more self-employed workers.A sharp surge in claims for universal credit has underlined the severe economic toll the coronavirus is already taking on Britain’s workforce.The work and pensions secretary, Thérèse Coffey, revealed on Wednesday that 477,000 people had applied for the benefit in the past nine days. That is more than during any entire month of the 2008-09 financial crisis.“We don’t know if they’re self-employed or at different stages, and I want to assure people that help, even if it’s not currently the level of help they would like, is there to help them through the safety net of the welfare state,” she said.Karl Handscomb, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: “The unprecedented surge in new universal credit claims shows that the UK is already in the midst of an unemployment crisis. The increase in claims is putting huge pressure on our social security system, and is driven by a huge hit to family incomes.“The government was right to increase the generosity of the benefits system last week. It now needs to ensure the resources are there so that claims are processed quickly, and people receive support as soon as possible.”The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) is redeploying 10,000 staff to help process the extraordinary upsurge in new applications, making it the department’s main focus in the weeks ahead.Its permanent secretary, Peter Schofield, said: “We made a decision that managing claims and making payments is a number one priority for DWP. Operationally we can deprioritise other things.”The department has so far redeployed 1,500 members of staff to help with the sharp rise in universal credit claims, and is to increase this to 3,900 by the end of the week.The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, who will return to the backbenches in ten days’ time when a new Labour leader takes over, used what is likely to be one of his final speeches from the frontbench to call for the government to announce details of its scheme for supporting self-employed workers urgently.“If people claim fraudulently while still working, they will rightly be prosecuted. But right now millions of cabbies, childminders, plumbers, electricians, painters and decorators and actors have all lost work or closed down their businesses. As have builders, designated as the self-employed under the construction industry scheme and they have no income. They need a solution, now,” he said.Meanwhile businesses continued to demand clarity about who can keep travelling to work, as firms called for workers to come in despite Monday’s plea by the prime minister for the nation to “stay at home”.Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI, tweeted: “It’s clear that many firms do not know whether to stay open or to close.” She said she would meet the business secretary and request better guidance.The warnings come amid widespread confusion among businesses about how to respond to the lockdown. Halfords, the car parts, bike and servicing group, is reopening some of its stores this week after being designated an essential service. It had closed its shops on Monday night as Johnson addressed the nation.Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct retail chain had intended to remain open but was forced to backtrack after a public outcry.Frances O’Grady, the director general of the TUC, said the government needed to crack down on non-essential companies making staff attend work, telling ministers they needed to directly intervene if employers flouted the rules.“Companies like Sports Direct shouldn’t be putting their profits before people’s lives. No one in non-essential services should be forced to go to work. And no one should be sacked for following official instructions and staying home,” she said.Off-licences and other shops licensed to sell alcohol are now allowed to stay open, after an 11th-hour change, while several companies are lobbying ministers to be allowed special treatment.The mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, called for tough enforcement action against companies forcing their staff to travel to work in non-essential jobs during the lockdown.“This is wrong. It’s risking the health of workers, their families and wider society. In the absence of a clear government instruction to end non-essential work I am taking legal advice about whether Greater Manchester police or other agencies can take enforcement action against companies which are exposing their employees in this way.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b926e96eda37965c6e170d77d6f9d2442a0ff028/155_349_4859_2915/master/4859.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f4df4bb26714c05367f5419ccd16e9c","title":"uk towns lose local newspapers as impact of coronavirus deepens","story":"Many self-isolating older people left without trusted news source as presses stop rollingMajor towns including Milton Keynes have lost their only print newspaper, as the economic impact of the coronavirus starts to destroy parts of the struggling media industry.JPI Media, which owns dozens of titles, told staff on Wednesday that all of its free newspapers delivered door-to-door would temporarily stop printing due to the logistical challenges of arranging delivery, alongside the catastrophic collapse in the local advertising market.It will leave hundreds of thousands of people without their only local print newspaper, cutting off many self-isolating older readers from a key trusted source of news during the crisis.The government has made clear that it considers reporters and print newspaper distribution staff as key workers during the crisis, due to the importance of getting accurate information to people’s homes. Last week many of the same newspapers ran front pages pledging to support their communities during the pandemic and provide accurate information, but the financial and logistical challenges have become too much.Newspapers that will cease print publication from next week include the Bedfordshire Times \u0026amp Citizen, the MK Citizen, the Luton Herald \u0026amp Post, Northumberland’s News Post Leader, the Brighton \u0026amp Hove Independent, North Tyneside’s News , and the Mid Sussex Gazette. They were collectively distributed to hundreds of thousands of homes and in many cases were the only remaining newspapers in their respective areas.The West Sussex Gazette, Crawley Observer, Hemel Gazette, and Buckingham Advertiser will drastically cut their circulations as part of the plan.JPI Media said it intended to retain journalists at the non-printing outlets to run websites. But the decision to cease printing raises questions about how long this can sustained, given that sources have suggested digital advertising revenue was already minimal at many of these outlets. Instead they relied heavily on income from print advertising, which has been cut heavily as small businesses cut spending.Staff were told that JPI was “carefully exploring how we can use the various government schemes available to support both the business and our staff”.It intends to continue to produce its paid-for print newspapers that can be sold at supermarkets and newsagents during the crisis. These often cover larger areas and cities and include titles such as the Yorkshire Post, Blackpool Gazette, and the Scotsman.The impact on the already financially struggling local news industry has been swift. Free newspapers relying on print advertising are particularly badly hit. London’s City AM has ceased print publication and the Evening Standard has resorted to door-to-door delivery in the absence of commuters.On Tuesday, Newsquest, another of the UK’s biggest local newspaper groups, told its staff they would all be having an immediate pay cut and said manywould be obliged to take unpaid leave.Newsquest – which owns more than a hundred titles include Glasgow’s the Herald, the Brighton Argus, and the Northern Echo – told staff that severe cuts were on the way. They said they had already seen “very significant declines in our revenue, particularly from advertising, as many of our customers cancel or put their plans on hold”, forcing the company to make cuts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59fb0ceecd4657be811de9aaac02cd38f15c5136/0_164_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=722b0b0ea3f8ae90dda4f28108ac4496","title":"you dont want people judging your decor hosting tv news at home","story":"Presenters aware viewers will be scrutinising their bookshelves and wallpaper as well as their coverageJournalists presenting major news broadcasts from their homes ensures programmes remain on air throughout the coronavirus pandemic, but it also offers nosey viewers a chance to indulge one of Britain’s major obsessions: snooping around other people’s houses.Krishnan Guru-Murthy, who has been co-presenting Channel 4 News from his home in recent days, is aware that people will be scrutinising what they can see in the background closely: “Obviously you don’t want to show very much of your house because you don’t want everyone judging your home decor. You need to create a corner that doesn’t cause too much offence or give away too many of the cracks in your wallpaper.”Channel 4 News and other news programmes have attracted record audiences since the coronavirus outbreak, and the image of a journalist or guest expert broadcasting to the nation in front of a well-stocked bookshelf in a Victorian house has become a well-established trope.“I spent some time the night before rearranging my front room to hide books because I knew that everyone would just want to see the bookshelves,” said Guru-Murthy. “If they’d seen my bookshelf they’d have seen a strange mix of Charlie and Lola, the Beastie Boys book and Ansel Adams.”The presenter is currently accompanied by a single camera operator, with the rest of his family banished from a room usually used by his children to play video games. The hope is that he will soon be able to co-host an entire evening news bulletin without any technicians, as broadcasters reduce staffing levels to the bare minimum required to stay on air in the expectation of widespread illness.Matt Baker, the co-host of the One Show, is contributing to the consumer programme from his sofa at home while isolating after a family member displayed potential Coronavirus symptoms. He has broadcast to millions of viewers using a MacBook propped up on an ironing board, with a book shoved underneath the computer to keep the shot level. Lighting was provided by a couple of table lamps and a powerful garage light. Baker has accepted that for many viewers “the star of the show” was his sheepdog Bob, who made an appearance with him on his sofa.Technological advances mean reliable television-quality broadcasts can be created by patching together a home broadband connection with a device that combines six 4G sim cards to produce a consistent and stable signal. With the country in lockdown, television guest bookers also say it has never been easier to find people to appear on programmes, drawn by large audiences and lack of other commitments.Other presenters appearing remotely include Susanna Reid, the co-host of ITV’s Good Morning Britain, who has been presenting on the programme from her home after going into precautionary self-isolation, which means she can no longer sit in the studio next to Piers Morgan. She has appeared in front of a blank grey wall, avoiding the risk of showing too much of her home.National radio programmes are increasingly being presented from their hosts’ homes, with the only major difference often being with the slight echo that comes from being sat in a house rather than an expensively soundproofed studio.Various Today programme presenters are contributing from home, and BBC Radio 4’s The World At One bulletin has tested doing so over an ISDN connection from Sarah Montague’s kitchen table. She was equipped with a couple of laptops, a microphone, some headphones and a basic audio mixer, but said the programme was going to be presented from BBC broadcasting house in the short term. “It was easy for me but more challenging for producers so putting it off until essential and systems improved,” she said.Guru-Murthy said his main tips for television presenters preparing to broadcast to millions of people from their homes was to disconnect devices that could make noise and tell family members to stay away, ensuring there is no recreation of the moment when Professor Robert Kelly was interrupted by his toddler on BBC News in 2017.“The biggest risk now is the neighbours know what’s going on,” said Guru-Murthy. “Having warned people I would be doing it, I have a couple of friends who would think it very funny to ring the doorbell.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c3503426875ecac8614c1ddb0a46742","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:The number of people known to have been infected with the virus increased to at least 466,955, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. In addition, 21,162 people have died and 113,770 people have recovered since the outbreak began.Latest figures from the public health authorities in the UK’s constituent nations put the death toll at 465 people. In England, 414 people have died, while Scotland and Wales have both seen 22 deaths and seven further lives have been claimed in Northern Ireland.The country’s Department of Health and Social Care said that, as of 9am on Wednesday (GMT), 9,529 people have tested positive an increase of 1,452 on the same time on Tuesday.Greek health authorities reported a rise in the death toll, saying 22 people – the vast majority men – had succumbed to the virus.The health ministry’s spokesman and infectious diseases expert, Prof Sotiris Tsiodras, announced that another 78 people have tested positive, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 821. Although 36 patients have recovered, 134 people are being treated in hospital, with 54 in intensive care.The economic downturn and job losses caused by the pandemic are likely to be worse than the 2008 recession, according to World Trade Organization projections. Its director general, Roberto Azevêdo, said: “Recent projections predict an economic downturn and job losses that are worse than the global financial crisis a dozen years ago.” He added that concrete forecasts were not yet available but its in-house economists expects “a very sharp decline in trade”.As many as 50,000 Americans may need their government’s help in getting home, the US state department says a huge increase on its previous estimate of only about 13,500.

Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill Ireland’s only boarding school for children aged between seven and 13 years of age has closed after more than 70 years due to financial challenges that have been exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. Headfort School in Kells, Co Meath had more than 100 children attending as day pupils and borders, as well as a Montessori school for three to seven year olds. About 25 staff were employed at the school.Neville Wilkinson, senior master at Headfort, said the school had been struggling financially for years and the Government’s decision to close schools to help contain the Covid-19 threat was the “final nail in the coffin”.“We have always danced a fine line . . . The board was trying to raise money and to persuade donors but when it really kicked in, we realised that the amounts were going to be too large. Liquidation was the best of the bad options,” he said.“I think the staff are, on the whole, pretty sad about the loss of the place sadness is the overwhelming emotion.”Cllr Sean Drew described the news as the “end of an era” and a loss to the local economy.“People are shocked and saddened all over the town by the breaking news. I’m sure past pupils have great memories of their time there and the teaching staff were a huge bonus to the local community.”TV documentaryThe school, based in a Georgian mansion dating back to the 1760s, was the subject of a film and TV documentary in recent years.Fees at the school were up to €18,000 a year for boarders and just under €15,000 for under-10s. Class sizes were, on average, between 12 and 15 students.Pupils were offered a wide variety of subject choices including Latin, scripture and computer studies. The activities offered included hockey, rugby, cricket, horse-riding, tennis and swimming.It is understood the decision to close was made by the school board which rents the building from the Headfort Trust.Another education source said Headfort’s ineligibility for State funding meant it was especially financially vulnerable.“Boarding for children of that age has been going out of fashion. Schools like it in the UK are also under financial pressure and have been struggling to survive. The coronavirus closures are tipping some over the edge,” the source said.The school traditionally had strong links with the UK, with many children progressing to second-level education in England. More recently these links have been diluted and many boarders have gone to St Columba’s College, a boarding and day school in Whitechurch, Co Dublin.Mr Wilkinson, a former pupil at Headfort, said the teaching community there helped to create a special atmosphere which parents, students and staff valued.“You don’t come to work at Headfort to get rich. You sort of get sucked in by the place, and staff felt like a family. The children were an extension of that. “We often found that kids would come back and the sort of kids who gave out about us, giving out to them or punishing them, came back and realised how much freedom we were actually giving them when they went on to secondary school.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4212115.1585157336!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"leaving cert students could sit deferred exams and start college in mid autumn","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar said there is a ‘very good chance’ Leaving Cert exams will go ahead and urged students to continue studying.Leaving Cert students could end up sitting deferred exams and starting college as late as October or November under contingency plans being discussed by senior education sources. The Department of Education has been engaging with a range of education stakeholders over alternative plans for the Leaving Cert in the event that the exams do not begin in June as planned.While senior figures have emphasised that discussions are at an early stage, several sources have confirmed that the option of deferring exams until late summer and starting a new third level academic year in the autumn are being “seriously examined”.Some higher education institutions have signalled that they would be in a position to delay the start of a new academic year for first-year students by up to two months if necessary.On Tuesday, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said there is a “very good chance” Leaving Cert exams will go ahead and urged students to continue studying.He said he was was hopeful schools might be able to come back in May and June and to “have the Leaving Cert in the normal way”.However, if this did not happen, he said the Minister for Education was working on contingency plans to allow the Leaving Cert to go ahead.Well-placed sources say that while a number of contingencies are being explored, a deferral of exams until later in the summer is emerging as a realistic option.“There are multiple conversations going on and everything is on the table - whatever happens, the system will need to ensure equity, be transparent and immune to corruption,” said one senior source.“There is a strong preference to have a Leaving Cert if at all possible. Our sense is that is very likely to be delayed, it just depends on how long,” said another. “As we saw with the Rebecca Carter ruling, the system has been able to speed up the correcting process and there was less than a month last year between results and first years going to college.”Senior figures say they expect a decision will be made within the next fortnight on contingency plans for the exams. Most sources say they expect Junior Cert exams will either be cancelled or deferred.“Much of what happens will depend on the public health situation and how that unfolds - and no one can say for sure what will happen,” the source said.Other options which have been discussed by education partners - though which are regarded as less likely - include allowing students to progress to their chosen course without an exam and having a selection process at the end of the first year college exams.A similar system is used in jurisdictions such as Italy, however, there are doubts whether the Irish system would have the capacity for such a move.Another option which has been discussed is running dramatically slimmed-down Leaving Cert with just maths and English exams, for example.This on the basis that results in these exams are typically a strong predictor of academic performance at third level. However, a number of sources say the process could be unfair to many students and would struggle to win over public acceptance.Another option which has been explored in the event that exams are cancelled is matriculation or US-style SAT exam or online assessment by third level colleges themselves.However, senior higher education sources say there is a strong preference for using the existing Leaving Cert and CAO system. Another concerns is whether all students would have access to broadband.In the UK, education authorities announced last week that A-level and GCSE exams have been cancelled and replaced with teacher-assessed grades based on students’prior performance.Education sources say such a move is highly unlikely here as there is less cultural acceptance of teacher-assessed grades. This has also emerged as a major flashpoint with teachers’ unions in the past."},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Nick BradshawThe second raft of measures announced by the Government in an attempt to curb the spread of coronavirus represent a considered and proportionate response to a challenge that is growing by the day.The measures, set out on Tuesday, will only add to the economic misery already heaped upon citizens by Covid-19, and have failed to satisfy those voices calling for a complete lockdown of society.However, the fact that they fall around the centre line of what might have been done does not mean they amount to a fudge. Throughout this crisis, Ireland has taken a measured, consistent and evidence-led approach to the challenge involved.Where countries on either side of us have flip-flopped and changed tack with astonishing rapidity, the Irish authorities have followed a graduated approach based on the best available international and local advice.In other countries, some politicians have played politics with the pandemic, but in the State the lead has been taken by scientific experts, with the Government effectively playing a support role that has demanded the provision of large sums of money. Policy mistakesIn common with other countries, Ireland has made mistakes along the way. There was a failure to clamp down on travel from problem areas, notably Italy, quickly enough. Ireland also seems to be behind the curve on the provision of personal protective equipment for health staff and on testing.This was apparent again over the past 24 hours when the criteria for testing were altered again, effectively meaning people with only one Covid-19 symptom will not be tested. It is hard not to see this as a change designed to cut the demand for testing, which was running out of all proportion to the system’s ability to provide the service. It now seems the official approach is the same as that of the World Health Organisation – “test, test, test” – but with the rider “though not just yet”.At Tuesday’s briefing by the National Public Health Emergency Team, chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan freely accepted that public health officials had “cast their net too widely” when loosening their criteria a fortnight ago.At the time, the focus was on the removal of travel from overseas as a criterion for being tested for the virus. However, it was the decision to test people with just one symptom that really opened the floodgates.The resulting 20,000 people a day who sought testing included people with other ailments, including flu, as well as a good proportion of the “worried well”. Lost among the numbers were the real priority cases, such as healthcare workers and, at times, the more severely ill.Now Ireland is adopting the World Health Organisation (WHO) case definition for Covid-19, which requires two signs – fever and a respiratory symptom such as a cough or breathlessness.This begs the question why didn’t we adopt the WHO rules in the first place? Clogged systemThere are uncomfortable echoes of the cervical cancer controversy here – where an offer of free repeat smears to the wider population of women ended up clogging up the system and creating months of delay in the screening programme.In the current situation, too many patients are waiting too long to be tested or too long to get their results. Hopefully, this is only a short-term problem and the backlog will be cleared, as a prelude to wider testing in the population.Still, in this calm-before-the-surge moment, there are some encouraging signs. There is widespread adherence to social distancing the number of contacts of confirmed cases is dropping and the number of diagnosed cases is growing slightly more slowly than expected – though this may be due to the seven-day time lag caused by testing delays.It is still too early to know whether the measures adopted in Ireland will work, but at least the hands on the tiller seem to know where we are headed.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4212302.1585177442!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus ireland could be quickly overwhelmed by new cases","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeople wear face masks as  they walk past shops in Dublin on Wednesday. Photograph: Paul FaithAFP via Getty ImagesIreland’s ability to treat coronavirus patients in intensive care could be the quickest to be overwhelmed in the EU, according to a new report.The warning from the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) comes as two more patients with Covid-19 died on Wednesday, bringing to nine the total number of deaths in the Republic from the disease.The two deaths were of a woman in the east of the country, who had an underlying health condition, and a man, also in the east.Some 235 new cases were also reported by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), the highest daily total since Ireland recorded its first case almost a month ago. The total number of cases is now 1,564.Ireland’s intensive care facilities can cope with just 5.6 people in every 100,000 needing to be hospitalised, the lowest level in Europe, according to the ECDC.Its estimate is based on a scenario of 18 per cent of hospitalised patients needing ICU care, as happened in Lombardy during Italy’s outbreak. The next-most vulnerable country is the United Kingdom, which can cope with up to\u0026nbsp6.7 cases per 100,000.Increased capacityThe ECDC’s modelling is based on official figures for ICU capacity in Ireland, and does not take account of actions taken to increase this capacity in recent weeks.Asked on Wednesday night about the provision of intensive care facilities, HSE chief clinical officer Dr Colm Henry said “extensive preparations” had been made for increasing ICU provision. Baseline capacity of 220 beds had been increased to about 500 and further capacity was available through the provision of “ICU-type” care outside acute hospitals, including in private hospitals.Dr Henry also said personal protective equipment for medical staff would be flown to Ireland from China in 50-60 flights, beginning on Sunday.The ECDC says that if the pandemic remains on its current course without strong countermeasures and surge capacity enacted, there is a “high probability” many EUEEA countries will experience demands that far exceed currently available ICU capacity.“If this trend continues, it is likely that in days or a small number of weeks, prevalence similar to Hubei province and Italy will be observed in most EUEEA countries,” the EU agency warned on Wednesday in its latest update on the pandemic.NPHET on Wednesday night defended the change in case definition that ruled out sending people with only one symptom of Covid-19 for testing, as previously applied. GPs around the country reported being inundated with calls from patients seeking clarification or wanting to be reassessed on Wednesday following the change.PositiveChief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan pointed out that only 6 per cent of tests carried out so far had come back as positive. If Ireland performed a test on everyone who had sought one it would be going beyond what any country in the world has done, he said.British health officials said a 15-minute test for the virus may be made available through pharmacies and online delivery services. The UK government said it had bought 3.5 million antibody test kits.Asked whether Irish authorities might do the same, Dr Holohan said NPHET would like to have a “reliable” serological test available but was “not at this point yet”.NPHET is to meet on Thursday to consider whether Covid-19-specific hospitals should be established during the surge of cases expected in the coming weeks. Wards and other segregated areas have already been designated in many hospitals but Thursday’s meeting will also consider whether to designate some hospitals, particularly in Dublin, for this purpose.Also on Thursday, legislation allowing a new wage subsidy scheme to come into effect is due before the Dáil.The scheme to help workers through the pandemic and keep them connected with their employers will involve €410 being paid a week for all qualifying employees over the coming weeks as the Government moves to push cash out as quickly as possible.This will allow companies to support wages and initially simplify the scheme before the more complex graduated subsidy system from next month.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"EU warning comes as two more patients with Covid-19 die, and 235 new cases reported\u0026lsquoIt could be ready in 12 to 18 months.

Photograph:  Kevin DugganLittle more than a week ago, Co Mayo native Amy Brett was gearing up for the busiest time of the year at the Bailey Pub near Wall Street as St Patrick’s Day dawned. Today, she is back in Cavan, quarantining in a holiday home before returning to her family.Along with four fellow Irish bartenders who have returned from New York, she is in a 14-day self-imposed quarantine at the holiday home until they are able to return to their families.For the past five years, Brett has worked in New York bars, which have been brought to a standstill by the outbreak of coronavirus.Rumours of a closure order by New York mayor, Bill de Blasio floated after organisers postponed the St Patrick’s Day parade down Fifth Avenue for the first time in 258 years.On March 16th, the mayoral order finally hit.Together with the four fellow Irish bartenders, Brett immediately made plans to head for Ireland: “I panicked and I thought the best thing to do was to come home. God forbid you’re stuck here,” she said.The business curbs have devastated bars and restaurants. Already, one prominent company, the Union Hospitality Group has laid off 2,000 employees – about 80 per cent of its workforce – according to a report by the food blog Eater.A Co Sligo man on a year-long J-1 visa decided to cut his losses and leave his Manhattan bar job: “I could have lasted maybe a month or two, but I would have been out of pocket pretty quickly,” he said.Unable to be identified because his visa did not allow him work, he came back to Ireland: “I came home and there’s no hugging, it’s all touch elbows and keep your distance. It’s quite a strange way to come back.”He and many others have had to abandon their apartments, with New York Irish Facebook groups filling up with dozens of listings for rooms in popular Irish neighbourhoods across Brooklyn and Queens in the past week.The decision of whether to stick out the pandemic, or return home faces many Irish in New York and other places, according to Chicago-based Irish-American immigration attorney Fiona McEntee.“It’s a pretty scary time and some people just want to be surrounded by their family,” she said, though she cautioned that “the last thing” anyone potentially exposed to the virus should be doing is “to jump on a flight”.Freelance workers are being particularly affected, says Edelle Kenny, a New York-based producer who works on reality TV shows for American stations like the Discovery Channel and TLC.“I just had two major contracts dropped, which would be the equivalent of a year’s wage,” she said.She does not get health and unemployment benefits because she is self-employed: “We’re kind of left in the lurch.”“You come over here and you start building a life for yourself. Six years is a long time to be here and now you’re thinking, will this just throw everything off, by no fault of your own or anyone’s fault.”Ms Kenny is also on an interim work permit due to expire in May, while she transitions from a two-year Green Card to a 10-year one and she’s concerned that her immigration case could get caught in a backlog and delays with the authorities.Some Irish people, however, are stuck in the US because they will not be able to get back in if they leave now: “If you’re not a Green Card holder or a US citizen you do need to think about the immigration aspects of this, especially with the travel ban,” said Fiona McEntee.For now, Amy Brett and her friends plan to return to New York once it is safe to do so but she said if the situation persists for several months, many more Irish will pack up and leave the city.“If New York bars don’t reopen by May, you’ll see a lot of people move home to Ireland,” she said.“But we’re pure anxious, it’s just not knowing when we’re going to go back.

Doctors’ organisations have said they are seeking clarity on this.You may have seen and heard a lot of commentary this morning around the criteria for getting tested for Covid-19. This comes on top of several days of discussions around testing numbers and backlogs. There is a huge amount of information circulating about testing, so many will feel confused. Here’s what you need to know:What just happened?The Department of Health has changed what’s called the “case definition” for Covid-19 testing. Case definition is the set of symptoms that a patient has to be exhibiting to become eligible for the test. It’s the second time they’ve made a major adjustment. Before March 12th, you had to be symptomatic and either be a close contact of a confirmed case of Covid-19 or to have travelled from an affected area.Between that date and now, the testing criteria were significantly looser as the health services ramped up their strategy of “community testing”. All you needed to become eligible for testing was to display one symptom. Now they have changed the criteria again.What are the new criteria?There is now a two step process to qualify. Firstly, the list of symptoms has changed. Patients now have to have a fever and a symptom of respiratory disease, i.e. a cough or shortness of breath. Testing will also be carried out on those with respiratory symptoms who have been in contact with a confirmed or probable Covid-19 case in the days before symptoms onset.If that bar is met, you must then fall into a list of priority categories, which include being a close contact of a confirmed case, a healthcare worker, an at risk group (those with diabetes, chronic lung disease, et cetera), household contacts of those at-risk groups, staff or residents in long-term care facilities, prison staff and inmates where self-isolation may be difficult and pregnant women. If you meet both those criteria, you will be tested. Otherwise, you will be told to stay at home and self-isolate. Why did it happen?The immediate impetus for this change comes from Ireland adopting the World Health Organisation case definition for Covid-19,which stipulates that a patient with fever must have at least one symptom of respitatory disease.However, the immediate Irish context cannot be forgotten. After the last change in case criteria, there was an absolutely enormous surge in the numbers of people seeking tests - some 20,000 per day. Even with extra capacity being built into the Irish testing system, and a goal of delivering some 15,000 test results per day in the next four weeks, this surge combined with a shortage of testing equipment to cause a massive backlog which threatened to swamp the system entirely. The new criteria, doctors say, will massively cut the percentage of the population eligible for testing. “There has been a significant change in criteria for testing as of today, which will significantly reduce the amount of testing that we are doing,” says Dublin GP Maitiu O Tuathail. What does it mean for me?The most important thing to remember, no matter whether you are eligible for a test or not, or awaiting results or not, is that self-isolation is still the most important strategy for everyone who is displaying symptoms. This is the case if you have one symptom, two symptoms, if you’re eligible for a test, or not. Once you’re sufficiently symptomatic to get in touch with your GP, you should be self-isolating at home for 14 days from the onset of symptoms, and the last five of those must be fever-free. Household contacts of those self-isolating should reduce their movements for 14 days.If you are already in the testing system, the impact of this change depends on how far down that particular path you were.If you have been swabbed your sample will be processed and tested. If you have been referred for testing, but not swabbed or given a test date for swabbing, then you will not be tested. Patients in this category are advised to get in touch with their GP again and see if their symptoms and status qualify them for testing.There is uncertainty around those who have been given a testing time and date but have not yet been swabbed. Doctors’ organisations have said they are seeking clarity on this.Where things were relatively simple, a lot of complexity has been introduced overnight. “It is understandably going to lead to confusion amongst the public, so we need a strong information campaign to inform the public of these changes,” Dr O Tuathail said. What does it mean for the testing system?“The national testing issue is a major work in progress and clearly does not have the capacity to cope with yesterday’s criteria,” according to Meath GP Dr Stephen Murphy. In order to respond to this, the health service has dramatically reduced the numbers of people eligible for testing.Such a big change, of course, raises questions about the impact on the efficacy of Ireland’s testing system. Infectious disease experts, however, say there is merit to the reforms. Pointing to Ireland’s positive test rate of just six per cent, amid a global shortage of testing supplies, Prof Mary Horgan said: “Test, test, test is important but it’s also important to identify those who are positive.”“It’s using a precious resource wisely at this point in time,” she said. The changes should be borne in mind when reading data on Ireland’s number of cases however, said Dr Eavan Muldoon, a consultant in Infectious Diseases and a member of the Infectious Diseases Society of Ireland. “When you look back at the data, if you see a shift, you have to understand there was a change (in testing policy), you have to be aware of that, and it’s an important thing.” A reduction, or increase, in the number of cases needs to be looked at through this frame. Dr Muldoon believes the new system will speed up processing for hospital workers and the very ill who are in hospital.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4212285.1585170339!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"creches look for clarity on zappone financial assistance scheme","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tKatherine Zappone has been told that her ‘proposal will immediately result in the termination of employment for a significant number of staff’. File photograph: The Creche groups have written to Minister for Children Katherine Zappone seeking further clarity on her bailout of the sector, which will mean the State effectively nationalises the wage bill for creches in exchange for waiving of fees charged to parents for the next three months. Early Childhood Ireland (ECI) has raised several queries with the Department of Children, including whether operators will have a choice about signing the new emergency Covid-19 contract.They have also asked for clarity on issues concerning holiday pay, maternity leave and how owners who do not pay themselves a salary will be treated. While ECI welcomed the proposal, some creche groups have objected to the scheme, according to correspondence seen by The . In a letter to Ms Zappone, the Federation of Early Childhood Providers argued that in the absence of the subsidies, while wages will be covered, significant cash-flow issues will emerge. “Your proposal of yesterday will result in services not being able to meet their overheads or fund the payment of staff as we will have considerable cash flow issues. Your proposal will immediately result in the termination of employment for a significant number of staff, running into the tens of thousands, and the closure of a vast number of services nationwide.”Under a scheme announced by the Government on Tuesday, the department will pay 30 per cent of wages up to a level of €38,000 per year for the next three months, on top of the Government’s wider scheme to cover 70 per cent of wages up to this level.Due to the relatively low average salary in the sector, this will cover the majority of the wage bill across the sector. However, the department is suspending other subsidies it usually pays to creches during this period and replacing them with this single payment.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4212190.1585163540!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"it s like 28 days later coronavirus turns dublin into a ghost town","story":"After recent coronavirus restrictions only a handful of retail outlets are now open on Ireland\u0027s premier shopping street, Grafton Street, Dublin.

On Wednesday, the warmest and sunniest day of the year so far, it was deserted.The birds had the ponds, the grass and paths to themselves. The handful of people who had come through the wrought-iron gates sat alone on benches, staring stony-faced at flowers newly in bloom.A Grafton Street jeweller had been stripped of its window displays by staff anxious to protect valuables. The clothes shop next door was boarded up, as if prepared for a hurricane.Many pubs were not just closed, but shuttered, too. A Luas set off for Cabra with just three passengers. Two wore surgical masks. The driver wore bright yellow rubber gloves. In any other time it would have been comical.A small group of young men approached the gates of the green, their voices among the only to be heard. “This is what the zombie apocalypse must be like,” one said loudly.Following Leo Varadkar’s Tuesday restrictions, most people seemed to have heeded the Taoiseach’s plea to “stay home if at all possible”.Leaning on his cane, an older man who identified himself as Kevin O’Malley said, from a distance of more than 2m, “It’s a different world now”.“Do you know what this reminds me of? It reminds me of a film I saw more than 50 years ago. On the Beach, it was called,” he said, referring to a 1950s post-apocalyptic film starring Gregory Peck and Fred Astaire.“There is a scene in the film when the crew of a submarine come to the surface after the nuclear war and when they look around there is just nothing there. That’s what I am reminded of today.“I suppose the real worry is how long will it all last. But you know what, we will get through this, of course we will. This country is nothing if not resilient.”Cigarette tradeSome shops remained open. Mark Halligan was at work in one of them, the Bus Stop newsagent at the top of Grafton Street. He was in the shop alone, dispensing coffee, selling newspapers and face masks.“What people want to buy mainly are cigarettes,” he said. “They are coming in and buying hundreds of them. I don’t know why really. We are going to stay open. It’s like the film 28 Days Later, isn’t it?”A homeless man, Michael, came into the shop. Asked how he was getting on, he told of how the pattern of his day on the streets had changed.“Every morning I would get up at 7.30 and get a cup of coffee in Starbucks. I can’t do that now, it’s closed. Everything is closed. There is nothing open and nothing for me to do and no one for me to talk to.“I’ve been on the streets for more than four years and I had a routine,” he said, “Now I am just trying to figure out the days ahead and how I will get by.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4210749.1585041793!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"plan to bring home irish people stranded in peru awaiting green light from lima","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t A Peruvian soldier patrols during the COVID-19 restrictions in Lima, Peru. Photograph: Paolo AguilarEPAThe Government’s plan to bring home 135 Irish people stranded in Peru by the country’s coronavirus lockdown is awaiting the green light from the government in Lima.An email to those stranded sent on Monday morning by the Irish embassy in Chile said the timing of the proposed charter flight out of Lima “will depend on how soon our aircraft can be accommodated by the Peruvian authorities”.Tánaiste Simon Coveney told RTÉ on Sunday an agreement has been reached between British Airways and Aer Lingus to charter a flight from Lima “in the next few days”. As well as Irish nationals dependants who are entitled to live in Ireland can also take the flight.The embassy email also said Irish authorities “will confirm details in due course for bus transfers within Peru from agreed locations to the military airport in Lima”. Only an estimated half of the 135 Irish, most of whom are backpackers, are currently in Lima with local travel restrictions preventing the rest making their own way to the capital.Repatriation will cost each traveller €400 but they will not be required to pay the fare in advance. Anyone diagnosed or showing symptoms of coronavirus, also know as Covid-19, will not be able to travel. At least six people have died of the virus in Peru with another 363 people confirmed infected.‘Not straightforward’Mr Coveney told RTÉ that organising the flight out of Peru “is not straighforward”. France and Israel are among the countries that have already sent planes to bring their nationals home. But thousands of other foreigner are still stranded in one of South America’s most popular tourist destinations.Peru has all but shut its land air and sea frontiers in response to the global pandemic. It announced a strict 15-day stay-in-doors quarantine on March 16th giving foreigners just 24 hours to leave the country. Many were left stranded and have since been reliant on their respective government to come up with a solution to get them out.On Sunday authorities closed fully the international airport in Lima. Now only flights bringing home Peruvian citizens or coming to evacuate foreign nationals can fly into the country and must land at the capital’s military airbase. Travellers stranded at the international airport were forced to make their way to the base in the hope of their governments sending planes to rescue them.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4207973.1584717019!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the science behind the race to develop a coronavirus vaccine","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe target proteins for a coronavirus vaccine are  the spikes that give the virus its crown-like appearance, hence the name coronavirus. Photograph:  Getty ImagesA vaccine for Covid-19 is soon to be injected into healthy volunteers in Seattle, US. The National Institutes of Health in the US will run these tests with a vaccine made by\u0026nbspbiotech firm Moderna.“This was reputedly prepared and ready for testing in 42 days, which is an incredibly rapid response,” says Prof Kingston Mills, immunologist at Trinity College Dublin. “Under normal circumstances to make a vaccine and have it approved for use could take 10 to 15 years.”Traditional vaccines are often made from live weakened viruses or viral proteins manufactured in cells. A big advantage with the new vaccine is that it is made from RNA, a simple biomolecule that is easier and faster to synthesise.The RNA is placed inside a minuscule lipid particle. RNA is the code that the coronavirus inserts into our cells. Normally DNA is copied into messenger RNA in our cells, which is the blueprint to make proteins. The coronavirus hacks into this system to manufacture new coronaviruses.The RNA inside lipid is injected and gobbled up by patrolling immune cells in our bodies. These chop up and stick pieces of virus protein on their surface to alert and teach other immune cells about the virus.German company CureVac is also advancing a RNA vaccine for Covid-19. CEO Ingmar Hoerr says they will make 10-gram batches of RNA, which is enough for thousands of vaccine doses. He says with more funding there is nothing to stop them making millions or even billions of doses.However, there is no RNA vaccine approved for any disease yet. CureVac had an RNA vaccine for rabies in clinical trial, but is refocusing now on the coronavirus. It is expected that drug regulators will fast-forward approval for a pandemic vaccine.“It could be ready in 12 to 18 months from now. That is great if it happens,” says Prof Mills.SpikesThere are also DNA and protein vaccines. The target proteins are invariably the spikes that give the virus a crown-like appearance under an electron microscope – hence their name coronavirus.Remarkably, Chinese scientists released the entire RNA sequence of the Covid-19 virus by early January. Scientists around the world then raced to copy the blueprint of all or some of the spike protein to make vaccine.The spike is what the virus uses to harpoon on to a receptor (ACE2) on cells in our mouth, throat, lungs and gut. The immune cells and antibodies of a vaccinated person would be expected to spot the spike protein and neutralise the virus. Moderna’s vaccine encodes the entire spike protein.Prof Robin Shattock at Imperial College London is now testing his own RNA vaccine based on the spike protein in lab animals. “With the right funding we hope to do first-in-human studies this summer to see if it induces the right antibody response in people,” he says.What will take time is people testing. “The science of what will make a good vaccine will happen very fast,” predicts Prof Michael Farzan at the Scripps Institute in Florida – the scientist who first reported that SARS hooked on to ACE2 receptors in lung cells. “The problem is that production, distribution and testing can take a year or more.”Three stepsTesting happens in three steps. The first sees a small number of healthy adults given the vaccine to ensure it is safe, which may last two months. The Seattle trial will enrol 45 adults. Phase II trials test safety in a larger group of people and look for expected effects in the body.Then comes the big one. “The stringent testing is in phase III. You are normally talking about tens of thousands of people being tested,” says Prof Mills. “They may change the rules when there’s a pandemic.”It will be in the hands of the European Medicines Agency in Europe and the Food and Drug Administration in the US to decide if the vaccine can be licensed. This might be based on more limited safety and efficacy testing than normally required for a new vaccine.While regulators might speed up decision-making, Prof Mills is adamant they will not bend the rules. “They will not regulate a vaccine unless happy it is safe and effective.”He acknowledges frustration among the public that they cannot get a drug such an an antiviral or a vaccine. “But if you put something on the market that doesn’t work or causes side effects then you lose the confidence of the public,” says Prof Mills. “It has to be tested appropriately.”Drug trials involve thousands of patients partly because small groups of people may turn out to be at risk of rare side effects, perhaps because of their age, or genetic makeup or underlying health conditions.On the upside, the SARS-CoV-2 virus is not expected to change much. It has a very large genome and “a better proof reader” than other RNA viruses, such as influenza, which tends to make lots of mistakes (ie mutations).“It tends to evolve slower than other RNA viruses,” says Prof Farzan. “So we should be in reasonable shape with vaccines based on early versions of the spike protein.”Flu mutates so much that a new vaccine is needed every winter, and even then it is a best guess as to the dominant strains.“I would say HIV is the hardest, flu is intermediate, and something like this coronavirus is relatively straightforward to develop a vaccine for,” Prof Farzan adds.It may even be possible to make a vaccine against many of the coronaviruses in bats that might again jump to people and threaten another pandemic.Immune responseAsked if a vaccine for just older people might be feasible, Prof Shattock at Imperial College London says this is unlikely. It could take longer to show a vaccine is effective in those aged over 65 as their immune response is not as strong.“That said, vaccination of care givers and medical staff would do a lot to prevent exposure to the more vulnerable.”Prof Mills does not think that a vaccine will be available by summer. There may be value to having a vaccine by 2021. We don’t know if this coronavirus will be seasonal like the flu, meaning that infections drop off during the summer when the weather warms up. “If it behaves like the flu then there is risk that it might come back in the autumn,” Mills notes.There may be a vaccine available for the winter of 2021. There are plenty of intense efforts to generate one.Inovio is a US biotech company developing a DNA vaccine for Covid-19. The DNA begets viral RNA and viral proteins. A group in Australia is developing stable viral protein as parts of its vaccine, and Novavax is working on a protein vaccine. All are funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which also supports CureVac and a group at Oxford University.CEPI was established in 2017 to speed vaccine development for new diseases. It was funded by governments in Germany, Japan and Norway, as well as the Bill \u0026amp Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust. Its sense of emergency about the risk of a global pandemic caused by flu or a novel coronavirus has proven to be entirely justified.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4210273.1584994639!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus france hoping unorthodox virologist can save world","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tProfessor Didier Raoult, the maverick virologist who says chloroquine cures coronavirusWe could know within two weeks whether Professor Didier Raoult, the French virologist who heads the Mediterranean infectious and tropical disease institute in Marseille, will go down in history as the man who saved the world from Covid-19, or will be dismissed as an arrogant, misguided scientist who raised false hopes.Raoult administered a cocktail of hydroxycloroquine, a less toxic derivative of chloroquine, used to treat malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, and azithromycin, an antibiotic used against bacterial pneumonia, to 24 Covid-19 patients.After receiving 600mg of Plaquenil (one of the commercial names for chloroquine) and 250mg of azithromycin for six days, three-quarters of patients tested negative for the virus, while 90 per cent of the control group who did not take the drugs still tested positive.On February 25th, Raoult spoke of Chinese experiments with hydroxycloroquine in a video titled “Coronavirus: endgame!” He hastily conducted his own clinical study and revealed the results in a second video on March 16th.US president Donald Trump apparently learned of Raoult’s experiment through a Twitter post by the billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk. On March 20th, Trump wrongly claimed in a White House press briefing that the US Food and Drug Administration had approved what he called “the very powerful” drug chloroquine to treat Covid-19.Trump was corrected by Dr Anthony Fauci, a top expert on infectious disease and a pillar of the fight against coronavirus. But Trump persisted, tweeting the following day that “HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE \u0026amp AZITHROMYCIN, taken together, have a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine.”Pharmacies in west Africa, where chloroquine has been used for decades to treat malaria, saw a run on the drug. The government of Morocco purchased the entire stock of chloroquine produced by the French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi in Casablanca. Some French hospitals are administering Plaquenil out of “compassion” for the families of Covid-19 patients.Christian Estrosi, the mayor of Nice who has tested positive for Covid-19, “wants to trust” Raoult. Conservative senator Bruno Retailleau is exhorting the government to prescribe it more widely in French hospitals. Petitions supporting Raoult are circulating on the internet.The scientific community is ided. Raoult tested the drugs on a very small number of patients.“For the moment, there is no proof of the efficacy of this molecule on the disease, either for prevention or as treatment,” Dr Thierry Vial, head of a pharmacological centre in Lyon told, Le Figaro. “We have only preliminary data, which is encouraging and should be followed up, but is insufficient for systematic treatment of the illness.”Solid base“One cannot administer treatment without a solid basis, especially not chloroquine, which is not an ordinary medicine,” said Bernard Bégaud, professor of pharmacology at the University of Bordeaux.Pressure on the French government is such that health minister Olivier Véran announced at the weekend that chloroquine will be tested, with three other drugs, on 3,200 patients in the EU’s scientific programme Discovery, which is seeking a cure for Covid-19.Véran said he wants to know if Raoult’s study “can be repeated on a bigger scale in other hospitals, by independent teams”. This was necessary, Véran said, because “Never has any country in the world given authorisation for treatment on the basis of a study like this”.Véran also warned the public not to get their hopes up.“The history of viral disease is strewn with false good news, disappointments and reckless risks,” Véran said.Wariness of Raoult derives from his unconventional appearance, and from his reputation as a maverick. The television channel LCI described the hirsute professor as looking like “a druid in the Astérix comic books”.Raoult, age 68, was born in Senegal, where his father was a French military doctor. He moved to Marseille at age nine, joined the merchant navy at age 18, earned a literary baccalaureat at 20 and then went to medical school.Raoult shares a certain arrogance with Trump and Bolsonaro.“In my field, I am a star, worldwide,” he boasted to La Provence newspaper.“I don’t give a damn what others think. I am not an outsider. I’m streaks ahead of the others.”Like Trump and Bolsonaro, he is also a climate change denier.Yet millions of people are placing huge hopes in Raoult’s study. A high-ranking French civil servant, now retired, who is following the story closely, believes professional rivalry is interfering with the search for a cure.Raoult “is unanimously recognised by leading professors” but “annoys the establishment”, the source says. The fact that Raoult forced the French government to include chloroquine in European clinical tests “proves the strength of his de-Gaulle-like conviction”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4206213.1584564281!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu sets out proposals for close uk ties after brexit talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and the British prime minister’s Europe adviser David Frost in Brussels on March 2nd.

This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4212224.1585165072!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"moving food and medicine the view from a truck driver s seat","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFreight lorries queue at the Port of Dover on March 20th as EU leaders agreed to restrict most travel into the continent. Photograph: Luke MacGregorBloombergJohn Fischer left Ireland for Scandinavia with a truck full of lamb in the early hours of Saturday. By Thursday, he expects to be back on the island, having returned with a load of hotdogs for Ikea. The bald and burly 47-year old from Denmark is an international freight driver, and one of the few people in Europe still able to cross the continent as nations close their borders.The supply of food and medicines rely on Fischer and his fellow hauliers. They are increasingly lone voyagers, with a rare international perspective on a continent under lockdown.“We see a lot when we are on the road,” Fischer says.The second thing is disobedience of social distancing rules. “You see cars on the road that are definitely not out there for work... you see people socialising in big groups,” he says. “I think a lot of the restrictions coming in now are because people don’t listen. If they had just done what they said at the beginning, they wouldn’t have to close down so much as they have to now.”Fischer is speaking over the phone from his ferry cabin. Each round trip he makes between Ireland and Denmark has four such sea journeys: across the Irish Sea, and between England and the continent. In all it takes five to six days.Usually on the ferries, drivers who know each other gather to share meals and talk. But there is an increasing awareness of the risk of infection – one driver was spotted on the Netherlands to England crossing in a full mask and gloves. Cruise ships have been infamous incubators of the virus, and drivers are concerned that the crossings could be a risk.\u0026nbspFood provision has been scaled back buffets are totally out. Staff rush from table to table with disinfectant.“I don’t use masks, I don’t use gloves, but I wash my hands a lot when I’m on the ferry,” says Fischer. He now eats alone in his cabin.Europe’s truck drivers are an aging workforce. The industry has been plagued with staff shortages for years as drivers retire, a phenomenon that has caused delivery bottlenecks in the past. The pandemic hit the industry with a double blow of sudden long traffic jams at borders and consumers stocking up causing a run on supplies.“It’s almost like a war or something,” said Seamus Leheny of the Freight Transport Association (FTA). “The job has to be done, and we’ll do it. Because without us...” he trailed off. “What we don’t want is the virus getting into our workforce, affecting drivers.”Driving limitsTo keep the supply chains going, EU driving hours limits – normally considered essential to prevent accidents caused by tiredness – have been relaxed. Truckers can now drive up to 11 hours a day, 60 in a week, and 96 in a fortnight, with shorter and less frequent mandatory rest periods.On some borders, drivers face health screenings. In the frenzy of the initial closures, some were told to quarantine or were turned back due to their nationality. Drivers told The  of delays on the Danish and Italian borders, and between the Netherlands to Belgium, where authorities have reduced traffic to a single lane so they can check all cars.But the worst traffic in the EU has been on the borders of Poland. Initial jams were days-long, and it still took five hours to cross the German-Polish border on Monday, according to the European Transport Workers’ Federation.\u0026nbspThe queues make the trucks more vulnerable to theft, and to stowaways, such as on the approach to Calais, where people hoping to cross to Britain often try to hide among cargo. The jams also increase costs for consumers: the FTA estimates running costs for the largest vehicles to be €1.10 a minute.The drivers are both feared as a source of infection, and concerned about catching the virus themselves. In some places, sanitiser has become mandatory.In a pinch, Fischer can buy instant meals from a supermarket and heat them, because he has a microwave in his truck. “I can survive anyway,” he jokes.Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4211096.1585071291!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus leading irish medic in us castigates lunatic in charge over delays","story":"March 20th, 2020: US president Donald Trump threw a tantrum over a question on peoples fears of Covid-19 at a White House press briefing. Video: The White House\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tProf Garret FitzGerald: ‘The irony is Trump supporters paid the price for his mistakes.’ Photograph: Eric LukeThe United States is showing every indication it will outstrip China in coronavirus cases, and is already “not far behind them”, according to one of its leading medics Prof Garret FitzGerald.The US is about to experience a surge in cases in a scenario where President Donald Trump delayed taking decisive action, and squandered early advantage he had secured by default, added the University of Pennsylvania professor of pharmacology and therapeutics.Referring to Trump as “the lunatic in charge”, FitzGerald said that by restricting travel from China for largely xenophobic reasons he may have bought time, but subsequent delays on testing and restrictions undermined this. “He continues to send mixed messages,” FitzGerald said.Trump’s failure meant the most effective strategic response came at state level, with key governors dictating necessary pace. FitzGerald cited New York Times analysis showing that awareness was behind in other states, a disparity between red (Republican) and blue (Democrat) states, with the latter scaling up action. “The irony is Trump supporters paid the price for his mistakes.”DeathsHe questioned how many extra deaths would be due to delays and misinformation. The president has continued to describe chloroquine drugs used to treat malaria and other conditions, as “game changers” in the fight against coronavirus, also known as Covid-19, when there was no proper study to show they work, noted FitzGerald, who is originally from Ireland.In response to misleading advice from the French health minister Olivier Véran, FitzGerald has a letter in the latest issue of the research journal Science, highlighting how he wrongly issued a warning on painkillers – notably nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on which he is a global authority.His letter had gone viral through social media channels. “So that is good. It was a silly thing to say at several levels,” he said, “In a sense, it was like Trump’s ignorance of science.”Véran confused matters by claiming on Twitter that anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen or cortisone could aggravate coronavirus infection – when people taking NSAIDs for other reasons should not stop doing so for fear of increasing their coronavirus risk.He advised people to take paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead to treat a fever but this only added to confusion, given it is also an NSAID.Flawed advice was being compounded by fake news and irresponsible behaviour, FitzGerald said, citing reports that four young people taking NSAIDs for sports injuries were in ICU in Cork.It added up to “a fusion of unreality” and was a wake-up call for the public on “why pervasive ignorance of science comes at a price. Trump is the ultimate metaphor as far as that is concerned.”Healthcare workers were displaying remarkable dedication and bravery in a similar way to Ireland, while the scientific community had been mobilised on rapid development of vaccines new drugs and apps to monitor and advise people. But there were specific dangers in the US scenario.There were long delays before rigorous separation was implemented. Its health system was fragmented, varying between best healthcare and none. There was rowback on Obamacare in a system where too many had no health insurance and “uneven sick pay”, motivating many people to go work.FitzGerald said there was a lot less social cohesion in the US compared to Ireland but stressed he was outlining a worst-case scenario.He is scaling down research at his facility while helping a national effort to ramp up coronavirus-related research and share vast amounts of data in a harmonised way – all done remotely.This will involve work on hundreds of thousands of patients post-infection, to identify key contributing factors to spread and infection. This had to be done in a safe way not to impair front-line clinical work.As he is in a higher risk age group he will not be on the front line but expected to be “called up” to deal with patients “back from the front line”.He added: “We’re very fortunate. We see what’s coming. We can work remotely, and have sick pay and health insurance. We’re at the elite end of the vulnerability spectrum.”Those most at risk were vast numbers of people with no health insurance – separate to those who were homeless.FitzGerald feared Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US expert on infectious disease who is helping to lead the national response, would be fired by Trump.Republican business interests were pressurising the president to allow people go back to work. “Fauci won’t accept that. We will see.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons march 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178How long will the UK coronavirus lockdown last?

This is going to be a close-run thing, we all know that. Anybody who looks around the world can see this is going to be difficult for every health system, he said.But the measures that have been announced for the general public - which all of us have to do if the NHS is to get through this without exceeding its capacity - and the fantastic work by the NHS - to increase supply, that is the way we will narrow this gap to the smallest possible gap over the next three weeks.If everybody stuck to the rules on limiting social interaction this gap will be probably manageable by the NHS, he said, adding: But we cannot guarantee that and nobody who is sensible would wish to guarantee that.Chris Hopson, Chief Executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals said: It\u0027s evident that a number of hospitals are on a trajectory where their critical care capacity will become full within a few days.Infectious diseases expert Prof Neil Ferguson said the lockdown should mean the NHS would be able to cope. Extra beds are being created at the ExCel exhibition centre in London, which is being turned into a makeshift, temporary hospital.Prof Ferguson, an Imperial College scientist, and author of Government modelling on the pandemic, said keeping people inside and increasing the levels of NHS staffing and beds would prevent intensive care units (ICUs) from being overwhelmed nationally.There could still be some difficulties at a local level, he told the Government\u0027s science and technology committee.But there was now a reasonable degree of certainty the Government measures would put the epidemic into decline.This current strategy being adopted now - we think that in some areas of the country ICUs will get very close to capacity but it won\u0027t be breached at a national level, Prof Ferguson said.  More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"middle classes have rushed judge others less fortunate shocking","story":"The advance of coronavirus has upended our lifestyles with astonishing speed and intensity. Almost as quickly, a tide of moralism has swept the nation.Some commentators – in lieu of outdoor activities, perhaps – seem to delight in judging others lambasting their fellow citizens who are still forced to use public transport to get to work, fuming over photographs of groups in nearby parks or wheeling groaning trolleys around supermarkets.London Mayor Sadiq Khan took to the airwaves to criticise Tube passengers, after photos emerged of packed trains at rush hour. Khan’s hand-wringing is hypocritical in the extreme. Transport for London’s decision to cut down rail journeys had the predictable consequence of putting the remaining services under extra pressure when millions are still needed at work.The NHS alone employs hundreds of thousands in the capital, before you include the army of street-sweepers, electricians, builders, teachers, couriers and other workers required to keep the cogs of the city in motion. Listening to the moralists of Twitter, however, you’d be forgiven for thinking they were travelling solely for their own amusement.Class isions drive much of this outrage. The elites of Islington and Stoke Newington evidently have little idea of what the poor look like, how they live – or that the coronavirus lockdown bears relatively lightly on the privileged middle classes.Many can work from home, stockpile wine in their cellars, plant their neat vegetable gardens, and pack their multiple chest freezers with mounds of food. Yet blue-collar work – by definition – cannot be done remotely, while poorer consumers, lacking storage space, must shop more. Garden-owners have urged the closure of public parks, apparently unaware of the crucial role these spaces play in the lives of those who lack green acres of their own.The self-employed face a singularly agonising choice, between practising social distancing or losing their income. Many without substantial savings are facing ruin, thanks to the abrupt termination of every gig in their portfolio. Then there are all those people who rely on cash-in-hand work. For white-collar workers to insist on total subjugation from the most precarious sections of the economy has more than a ring of apocryphal Marie Antoinette (“Let them work from home”).George Orwell identified a similar trend in The Road to Wigan Pier, in his portrayal of the unthinking middle classes unable to compute why their working-class counterparts insisted on eating tasty but less healthy meals. “Would it not be better if they spent more money on wholesome things like oranges and wholemeal bread?” asked one critic. Today’s well-intentioned bourgeoisie shows a similar disregard for the trade-offs which inform their fellow citizens’ choices.I am not arguing for a world devoid of moral judgments – shame is an important tool in changing behaviour. But the speed with which so many keyboard warriors have rushed to judgment on people whose lives are far less secure than their own is shocking. Perhaps our unforgiving “cancel culture”, the digital lynch mob permanently poised to ruin lives, has left Britain ill-equipped to cope humanely with the cultural impact of the coronavirus.Scratch below the surface of movements rooted in shame and you will often encounter the hectoring middle classes from the Victorian temperance brigades to the sanctimonious Edwardian ladies proffering the white feather of cowardice to apparently able-bodied men in times of war. Occasionally, they would mistakenly hand out feathers to injured servicemen, failing to note the amputee’s wooden leg.There are lessons in this today – we simply don’t know who we may be judging. One colleague is “stockpiling” on behalf of five households – a total of 15 people, all either vulnerable or isolating, on top of her own family unit.Lives will not be the only casualties in the tough months ahead. The economy will be stalled as we accrue wartime levels of debt and enter a global recession. Personal liberty will – rightly – be curtailed as we endure sacrifices that, a few months ago, would have seemed unthinkable. Losing so much that we hold dear, it is crucial that we retain our basic decency.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Listen to the campaign of shame being mounted against all those people apparently defying the lockdown and the answer is surely yes. In parks up and down the land people are recklessly congregating with friends. Workplaces are packed with employees wheezing their way into the office in defiance of that pesky cough. On every front, conscientious objectors in the corona war are undermining our national defence. Or so we are told.All the evidence suggests that this is an absurd caricature. And, worse than merely painting us in a bad light, talking Britons down in this way is only likely to make the efforts to defeat coronavirus tougher.If a recent YouGov poll showing that 93 per cent of people back the Government’s strategy is to be believed then those wilfully defying the rules are nothing but a tiny minority. It would be wrong to accept uncritically such an extraordinary figure, but it doesn’t seem wildly out of kilter with what is happening.I know of nobody whose job can reasonably be done from home who has insisted on going in anyway. More tellingly, I know plenty who have lost jobs as businesses accept their (hopefully temporary) fate and shut down. That such closures have been mandated with virtually no backlash, all in the name of a virus that seems to afflict many people mildly, is to my mind both astonishing and laudable. No less astonishing has been the reaction of business owners. For every Tim Martin, Mike Ashley or Richard Branson whose actions have amounted to a PR disaster, there have been countless companies – from corner shops to multinationals – that have made real sacrifices to provide for their staff and support their communities. All of this stands as evidence of a nation pulling together from top to bottom. For every delinquent deliberately coughing on a police officer, think of all the grandparents who celebrated Mothering Sunday at the end of a phone. For every small gathering in a park, think of the commitment of somebody like Scott Sneddon, who went viral after moving out of his house because his daughter has cancer and is at risk.Choosing to overlook these eminent success stories – as both ministers and armchair hand-wringers have done – in favour of lazily heaping opprobrium on the tiny number of rebels risks seriously backfiring. At the moment, the challenge for the Government is communicating the new rules and encouraging people to start following them. But as the days turn into weeks, the difficulty will be getting us to stick with it. To achieve that, it is vital that we all feel like we’re in it together.We humans are happiest, by and large, when we’re going along with the crowd. It is uncomfortable being the odd one out even the contrarians among us have experienced it. Just think of any time you’ve turned down a beer at lunch because everybody else at the table chose a soft drink.That impulse has been backed up in various ways by social scientists. In one classic experiment from the 1950s, a very high proportion of participants were willing to give the wrong answer to a simple question if it meant agreeing with a set of stooges who had deliberately answered it incorrectly before them. More recently, studies have shown that one especially effective way of influencing behaviour is to tell people that a large percentage of those around them are already doing something similar. Think back on that poll I quoted earlier. If only 30 per cent of Brits supported the Government, how would that make you feel about staying indoors all day?Herein lies the great mistake with the shaming strategy. A 100 per cent lockdown is too impractical ever to be enforced fully. Given that some dissenters are inevitable, fixating on them only makes them seem more significant. Let the idea take hold that everybody else is out on a jolly and those of us at home feel like fools. The bullying nature of this approach also risks triggering our instinct to kick back. The state of lockdown sits uneasily with the British people. The more we feel forced into it, the greater the temptation to stick two fingers up to the “little Hitlers” in charge. It would be far better to focus on the at-home majority and how together we are making a real difference. The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Just a day earlier, the mayor of Moscow became the first senior official to suggest that poor testing for Covid-19 could be hiding the real scale of the epidemic. This global map still shows Russia with a relatively low infection rate compared to other countries:Mr Putin did not say, however, how the private sector, battered by business closures and a low demand, is supposed to pay its employees next week but unveiled a raft of government measures to support families and businesses which have taken a beating from the crisis.The outbreak of Covid-19 has coincided with a busy political season in Russia after President Putin in January floated constitutional changes aimed to overhaul the country’s political system.A few weeks later, Mr Putin shocked the nation by taking up on a lawmaker’s offer to let him run for president again in 2024. An amendment for the Constitution potentially allowing him to stay in power until 2036 breezed through parliament earlier this month and was expected to come up for a public vote next month.Although he officially set the vote for April 22, Mr Putin on Wednesday postponed it to a later day, citing concerns about coronavirus.“People’s health, lives and security are an absolute priority for us,” he said.In a bid to reassure the nation Mr Putin said on Wednesday that the measures that the government has taken will work, but “only if we pull together and recognise the complexity of the situation.”Mr Putin in his speech, which did not appear any more dramatic than his recent appearances, came across as more laid-back than some other Russian officials including the mayor of Moscow.Earlier on Wednesday, Mayor Sergei Sobyanin, who has ordered a citywide lockdown for people over 65, warned that the epidemic is getting worse and urged for more social distancing in the Russian capital.Opposition figures have criticised the president for failing to call a nationwide emergency or to be assertive about spelling out the danger of the disease.“A large number of people are not aware yet of how serious the situation is, and a surprise holiday can, unfortunately, lead to an increase, not a drop, in social interaction,” opposition activist Leonid Volkov said in his blog.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"worlds wind power capacity fifth record year thanks boom offshore","story":"The world\u0027s wind power grew by almost a fifth last year after a boom in offshore projects.The global wind power industry had a record year in 2019 as The Global Wind Energy Council found that wind power capacity grew by 60.4 gigawatts, or 19 per cent, compared with 2018.Offshore wind capabilities were a driving force behind this, as new projects were completed, and it now makes up a tenth of all projects.The annual report found that some countries are still expanding their onshore wind at growing rates.The US and China are the world\u0027s biggest markets for onshore wind, and together make up almost two-thirds of global growth in wind power.Earlier this year, the UK government announced that it was ending what was an effective ban on onshore wind in order to enable the country\u0027s green energy sector to grow.David Cameron’s government fulfilled an election promise to end subsidies for “unsightly” wind farms in 2016, after calls from more than 100 mostly Conservative MPs.These subsidies have now been reinstated as the government is under pressure to deliver on its legally binding promise to reach net zero by 2050, particularly as it hosts the COP26 international climate summit in November this year.The impact of the end to subsidies was revealed last year in figures that showed only 23 wind farms started generating electricity, compared with 405 in 2014.Secretary of State for Business and Energy Alok Sharma said at the time: “Ending our contribution to climate change means making the UK a world leader in renewable energy.”While many worry about the cosmetic impact of onshore wind, scientists have said the offshore alternative can be deadly for seabirds.Wind farms built on their migration routes can harm birds including puffins because collision with the blades can cause death as they try to fly to their feeding spots. Even the birds which wisely dodge the structures are harmed they are forced to take large detours, putting chicks at risk of starvation as they wait for their parents to return.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/01/27/17/bitcoin-price-coronavirus.jpg","title":"bitcoin price coronavirus cryptocurrency market latest","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.\u0027This is the first time the world has faced an economic crisis when there has been an alternative financial system,\u0027 one analyst saysBitcoin has experienced wild price swings in recent days as cryptocurrency markets respond to the global economic uncertainty sparked by the\u0026nbspcoronavirus epidemic.The cryptocurrency has swung between highs of $9,000 and lows of 4,000 since the start of March, representing the most severe price volatility since the market explosion and subsequent crash in late 2017.Over the last week the value of one bitcoin has risen by more than $1,000 to its current price of $6,600.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe latest price rise came after the US Federal Reserve announced unlimited quantitative easing measures to help reduce the economic impact of coronavirus.This follows similar announcements from other central banks like the Reserve Bank of Australia and the European Central Bank to artificially increase the money supply.Can Norwegian waterfalls stop bitcoin from destroying the planet?Such drastic economic policy is seen by some analysts as a potential opportunity for investors, who may consider bitcoin as a safe-haven asset due to its decentralised nature.The limited supply of bitcoin – only 21 million will ever exist – means it is also immune to quantitative easing and other emergency monetary measures that fiat currencies are susceptible to.“The US Federal Reserve’s announcement effectively pumps billions of dollars into the market, so some investors may be weary that the dollar will lose its value, and are moving back into bitcoin to hedge against inflation,” Simon Peters, a cryptocurrency analyst at the online trading platform eToro, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.“Because the amount of new bitcoin that comes on to the market decreases over time, it is by design a deflationary asset when compared with a fiat currency like the US dollar. In theory the value per bitcoin should increase over time.”Other major cryptocurrencies continue to experience similar fluctuations, though the full extent of the impact the coronavirus outbreak has had on markets is yet to be fully realised.Created with Sketch.Bitcoin\u0027s volatile history in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Satoshi Nakamoto creates the first bitcoin block in 2009On 3 January, 2009, the genesis block of bitcoin appeared.

The mother of one employee told The Independent she was concerned that Dexters\u0027 approach could put the health of her family and the wider public at unnecessary risk.The estate agent\u0027s founder and chairman Jeff Doble said he believed the criticism was unfair and that much of the work Dexters does cannot be carried out from home.He said Dexters was in the process of winding downon Tuesday but pointed to the fact that the government\u0027s lockdown announcement was only yesterday giving little time for firms to prepare.On Monday night, the prime minister told people not to go out apart from in very limited circumstances including attending medical appointments and buying food.\u0026nbspThe latest intensification of social distancing measures means people should only go out for work where this absolutely cannot be done from home.Anyone caught breaking the rules faces a fine of up to £1,000 from Thursday, when a bill containing the new legislation to deal with coronavirus is expected to become law.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The company had claimed it was “uniquely well-placed to help keep the UK as fit and healthy as possible during this crisis”.“Thus our Sports Direct and Evans Cycles stores will remain open where possible to allow us to do this (in accordance with the government’s current social distancing guidance),” finance chief Chris Wooton told staff in a letter.However, the company said on Tuesday morning its shops would close their doors.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

However, her contract did not guarantee any hours each week.The job was her sole source of income, as it was for a number of now unemployed colleagues. The university had decided that all “non-essential parts of its business” would be closed down, the message informed them.The university says it\u0026nbsphas received “assurances” from Aramark that all staff will continue to be paid through the Covid-19 closure. Aramark promised to pass on further information when it could, but a week later nothing has materialised. Aramark did not respond to requests for comment.The situation highlights a lacuna in the government’s jobs support package. Last week, the chancellor said the government would, for the first time in Britain’s history, step in to pay private sector wages. The move means state grants will cover up to 80 per cent of salaries for workers “furloughed” –\u0026nbspon a company’s payroll but temporarily not needed for work.The idea is that once Covid-19 is under control and trade picks up again, those employees can start working without having to go out and find a new job.It has been welcomed by unions and workers but the scheme only applies where companies decide to take it up.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailRishi Sunak said on Friday that workers on zero-hours contracts would be covered, as long as they were paid through PAYE. But many of these workers have simply been let go en masse in any case. Self-employed workers, who are not on PAYE, are not covered at all and will have to claim benefits if their work dries up and no new government measures are enacted.Powell says she will not be able to pay rent this month, nor will several former colleagues.“I’ve applied for universal credit but it’s a five-week wait at the outset. They’re trying to make it faster but I don’t know if that’s likely to happen given the entire hospitality industry is probably knocking on their door right now.“I’m feeling pretty grim about it. It’s a bit dismaying. The silver lining that’s come out of it is that we’ve all really come together as a workforce, everyone who works at the bar.“We’ve got nothing to lose now so we’re all ready to fight to be paid through the closure.”They are taking the fight to the University with the help of the Independent Workers\u0027 Union of Great Britain (IWGB) to demand they are paid throughout the shutdown for the hours they\u0027ve been working over the past three months.More details on government support for zero-hours workers will be revealed “shortly”, the chancellor said last week. Further support is also expected to be forthcoming for the self-employed. For Powell and others in her position, the clarification cannot come soon enough.Coronavirus poses a slightly different, but no less daunting, problem for Sandra Tochez, a cleaner at University of London.Until Friday, she cleaned the university’s Senate House building for three hours every weekday morning. In the afternoon, she made her way over to the halls fo residence to clean. Then she was told not to come in.She says that the outsourcing company that employs her, Cordant, told her and several other cleaners that they would only be paid for their “contracted” hours.For Tochez, that meant just the three hours in the morning, so her pay had more than halved. If Tochez had been furloughed under the government’s scheme, she would have received 80 per cent of her pay for three months.She had been fighting for two years to have the four hours she works every afternoon to be recognised on her contract rather than classified as “overtime”. She says Cordant has refused.Cordant disputes Tochez’s account and\u0026nbspsays: “All staff across our business will continue to be paid for their contractual hours as well as any overtime worked.”This gives little comfort to Tochez and the other cleaners.“We are all extremely worried as we all have debts to pay and this money is not going to be enough to make the payments,” she says.“We are all thinking, ‘how are we going to manage, how are we going to pay rent?’”“It’s just not acceptable that they do this to people who have been working there for such a long time.”Millions of self-employed and gig economy workers who at present have even less financial support if they can\u0027t work during the pandemic.Greg Howard, a rider for food delivery service Deliveroo, says his recent decision to self-isolate cost him around £400 a week.\u0026nbspIt is stressful. I don\u0027t know how long this situation is going to go on for, nobody does. It does put a bit of fear and a bit of trepidation in me, says Howard.Deliveroo has set up a hardship fund for its riders who cannot work but there have been problems accessing it because riders must provide a doctor\u0027s note. The government announced in the Budget that workers could obtain one via the NHS\u0027 111 helpline but this service is not yet available.With millions of people now in enforced isolation, drivers involved in food distribution are recognised as crucial for the functioning of the economy but many feel they do not have the support they need.Courier services often do not employ staff directly but treat them as independent contractors, leaving the onus on the inidual to ensure they are safe, well and not at risk of spreading the virus.\u0026nbspRiders are doing all they can to protect themselves and others but they are being put in a difficult position, as Howard explains: Deliveroo have announced they will fund up to £20 the purchase of hand sanitisers, hand gels, soap, that kind of thing. We can\u0027t get hold of that, nobody can get hold of that.He believes that Deliveroo has been better at helping riders through the coronavirus crisis so far than some other gig economy companies, but there is much more to do.Alex Marshall, 35, couriers \u0026amp logistics branch chair of the IWGB union, is pushing for firms to cover riders\u0027 pay if they can\u0027t work.He adds: These companies need to take some responsibilities for workers that really could be integral to society to keep moving forward in these really troubling times.They can\u0027t continue to just say that these people are self-employed and totally in control of their own sanitising and everything. That responsibility is too much for one guy on his motorbike with a box on the back.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The company had claimed it was “uniquely well-placed to help keep the UK as fit and healthy as possible during this crisis”.“Thus our Sports Direct and Evans Cycles stores will remain open where possible to allow us to do this (in accordance with the government’s current social distancing guidance),” finance chief Chris Wooton told staff in a letter.However, the company said on Tuesday morning its shops would close their doors.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Upload data spiked on Mothering Sunday as many families held video calls with loved ones.The number and length of landline calls have also increased in the last week, the company said.However, Virgin Media said the current traffic increases has still not pushed up demand to the levels seen during recent computer game releases or when multiple Premier League games were streamed simultaneously.Despite increased data use on our network, we\u0027re not at capacity and are continuing to provide our customers with the ultrafast and reliable services they expect, Ms York said.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

However, her contract did not guarantee any hours each week.The job was her sole source of income, as it was for a number of now unemployed colleagues. The university had decided that all “non-essential parts of its business” would be closed down, the message informed them.The university says it\u0026nbsphas received “assurances” from Aramark that all staff will continue to be paid through the Covid-19 closure. Aramark promised to pass on further information when it could, but a week later nothing has materialised. Aramark did not respond to requests for comment.The situation highlights a lacuna in the government’s jobs support package. Last week, the chancellor said the government would, for the first time in Britain’s history, step in to pay private sector wages. The move means state grants will cover up to 80 per cent of salaries for workers “furloughed” –\u0026nbspon a company’s payroll but temporarily not needed for work.The idea is that once Covid-19 is under control and trade picks up again, those employees can start working without having to go out and find a new job.It has been welcomed by unions and workers but the scheme only applies where companies decide to take it up.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailRishi Sunak said on Friday that workers on zero-hours contracts would be covered, as long as they were paid through PAYE. But many of these workers have simply been let go en masse in any case. Self-employed workers, who are not on PAYE, are not covered at all and will have to claim benefits if their work dries up and no new government measures are enacted.Powell says she will not be able to pay rent this month, nor will several former colleagues.“I’ve applied for universal credit but it’s a five-week wait at the outset. They’re trying to make it faster but I don’t know if that’s likely to happen given the entire hospitality industry is probably knocking on their door right now.“I’m feeling pretty grim about it. It’s a bit dismaying. The silver lining that’s come out of it is that we’ve all really come together as a workforce, everyone who works at the bar.“We’ve got nothing to lose now so we’re all ready to fight to be paid through the closure.”They are taking the fight to the University with the help of the Independent Workers\u0027 Union of Great Britain (IWGB) to demand they are paid throughout the shutdown for the hours they\u0027ve been working over the past three months.More details on government support for zero-hours workers will be revealed “shortly”, the chancellor said last week. Further support is also expected to be forthcoming for the self-employed. For Powell and others in her position, the clarification cannot come soon enough.Coronavirus poses a slightly different, but no less daunting, problem for Sandra Tochez, a cleaner at University of London.Until Friday, she cleaned the university’s Senate House building for three hours every weekday morning. In the afternoon, she made her way over to the halls fo residence to clean. Then she was told not to come in.She says that the outsourcing company that employs her, Cordant, told her and several other cleaners that they would only be paid for their “contracted” hours.For Tochez, that meant just the three hours in the morning, so her pay had more than halved. If Tochez had been furloughed under the government’s scheme, she would have received 80 per cent of her pay for three months.She had been fighting for two years to have the four hours she works every afternoon to be recognised on her contract rather than classified as “overtime”. She says Cordant has refused.Cordant disputes Tochez’s account and\u0026nbspsays: “All staff across our business will continue to be paid for their contractual hours as well as any overtime worked.”This gives little comfort to Tochez and the other cleaners.“We are all extremely worried as we all have debts to pay and this money is not going to be enough to make the payments,” she says.“We are all thinking, ‘how are we going to manage, how are we going to pay rent?’”“It’s just not acceptable that they do this to people who have been working there for such a long time.”Millions of self-employed and gig economy workers who at present have even less financial support if they can\u0027t work during the pandemic.Greg Howard, a rider for food delivery service Deliveroo, says his recent decision to self-isolate cost him around £400 a week.\u0026nbspIt is stressful. I don\u0027t know how long this situation is going to go on for, nobody does. It does put a bit of fear and a bit of trepidation in me, says Howard.Deliveroo has set up a hardship fund for its riders who cannot work but there have been problems accessing it because riders must provide a doctor\u0027s note. The government announced in the Budget that workers could obtain one via the NHS\u0027 111 helpline but this service is not yet available.With millions of people now in enforced isolation, drivers involved in food distribution are recognised as crucial for the functioning of the economy but many feel they do not have the support they need.Courier services often do not employ staff directly but treat them as independent contractors, leaving the onus on the inidual to ensure they are safe, well and not at risk of spreading the virus.\u0026nbspRiders are doing all they can to protect themselves and others but they are being put in a difficult position, as Howard explains: Deliveroo have announced they will fund up to £20 the purchase of hand sanitisers, hand gels, soap, that kind of thing. We can\u0027t get hold of that, nobody can get hold of that.He believes that Deliveroo has been better at helping riders through the coronavirus crisis so far than some other gig economy companies, but there is much more to do.Alex Marshall, 35, couriers \u0026amp logistics branch chair of the IWGB union, is pushing for firms to cover riders\u0027 pay if they can\u0027t work.He adds: These companies need to take some responsibilities for workers that really could be integral to society to keep moving forward in these really troubling times.They can\u0027t continue to just say that these people are self-employed and totally in control of their own sanitising and everything. That responsibility is too much for one guy on his motorbike with a box on the back.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, Avengers Assemble still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all.  5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke).

That\u0027s half the amount of people who work in our pubs.The dirty truth about washing your handsWhat is the difference between Covid-19 and the common cold and flu?Can face masks really protect you against coronavirus or flu?The UK government\u0027s four stages of fighting coronavirus explainedWhat are symptoms of coronavirus – and where has it spread?In the recording, Mr Martin - seen clutching a mug and apparently at home - acknowledges the government will pay 80 per cent of the wages of staff at companies who have lost work during the crisis.But he said the money could take weeks to come through, and made no suggestion that Wetherspoon itself would cover the cost until the back payments arrived. The company has an annual turnover of £1.8 billion.In contrast to firms such as Costa – which has promised to carry on paying full wages for at least eight weeks – Mr Martin also suggested staff would receive no more than the government stipend.I can completely understand it.

However, Mr Khan’s spokesman insisted ministers were told “countless times” that Tube frequencies reflect high levels of staff sickness and self-isolation.Shortly before 7am on Wednesday, a senior nurse named Danny posted on Twitter: “Another busy tube. Can we not stagger people’s start times so we aren’t all squashed on the same tube! This is unsafe and not fair!”Barry Trimble, who said his work involves ensuring cancer patients receive chemotherapy, posted an image of a busy Victoria line carriage shortly after 7am on Wednesday.“The Tube is packed, with social distancing impossible. We need more people to stay at home and more trains running in morning and evening peak.”The Tube is currently operating at around 50 per cent of its normal capacity during peak times. Transport for London\u0026nbsp(TfL)\u0026nbsphas pledged to “continue to run as much of a Tube service as we possibly can”.On Tuesday Mr Hancock said: “Transport for London should have the Tube running in full so that people travelling on the Tube are spaced out and can be further apart – obeying the two-metre rule wherever possible.“And there is no good reason in the information that I’ve seen that the current levels of Tube provision should be as low as they are. We should have more Tube trains running.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He also said all nonessential workers should stay home.\u0026nbsp“This is the most drastic action we can take,” said Mr Cuomo. “This is not life as usual.”There have been more than 192 deaths due to Covid-19 in New York, and there are now more than 54,800 people diagnosed in the United States. Health experts have urged people to practice social distancing to help stop the spread of the virus.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMore than ever before in recent history, people are shuttered inside their homes across the nation and the world. Stephen Lovekin, a New York photographer, responded to the shutdown by taking to the streets to capture images of families at home in Ditmas Park, a neighbourhood in Brooklyn.\u0026nbsp“As a photographer I have always loved and been drawn to shooting portraits,” said Mr Lovekin. “So, when this Coronavirus\u0026nbsp began to rapidly spread, and people were ordered into “self-isolation” and “social distancing,” I began to feel compelled to document this unprecedented time.”Created with Sketch.Words at the window: Social isolation and the Coronavirus Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Agnetha Septimus, Matthew Septimus, and children Ezra and NoraHusband and wife filmmakers, Claire Ince and Ancil McKain pose for a portrait for the series by Shutterstock Staff Photographer, Stephen Lovekin, shot around the Ditmas Park neighborhood of Brooklyn, New YorkKhadijah Silver and son EliotAnna Beth Rousakis and daughter Mary RousakisMike Pergola and Denise Pergola with children Henry, Jack, and WillJean Davis and Danny Rosenthal, with children Simone, Naomi, and LeahLisa Draho and Josh Zuckerman, with children Ruby and AvaProfessor and activist Dr Kristin LawlerTom Smith and Laura Ross, with daughters Caroline, Elizabeth, and AbigailCallie Lovekin and Lucas LovekinAgnetha Septimus, Matthew Septimus, and children Ezra and NoraHusband and wife filmmakers, Claire Ince and Ancil McKain pose for a portrait for the series by Shutterstock Staff Photographer, Stephen Lovekin, shot around the Ditmas Park neighborhood of Brooklyn, New YorkKhadijah Silver and son EliotAnna Beth Rousakis and daughter Mary RousakisMike Pergola and Denise Pergola with children Henry, Jack, and WillJean Davis and Danny Rosenthal, with children Simone, Naomi, and LeahLisa Draho and Josh Zuckerman, with children Ruby and AvaProfessor and activist Dr Kristin LawlerTom Smith and Laura Ross, with daughters Caroline, Elizabeth, and AbigailCallie Lovekin and Lucas LovekinThe project, like the statewide lockdown, started a week ago.

Mr Beshear has ordered all non-essential retail businesses closed until the end of a state of emergency, which has also seen him activate the national guard.The governor’s tone remained even throughout his address, but he made clear that the circumstances of the new case had infuriated him.How to help the elderly and vulnerable during the coronavirusHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusHow to be productive when working from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your hands“My job in these press conferences is to talk to you about how we’re going to get through it — and we are — and that we’re going to do everything we can to protect the lives of those around us.“But this is one that makes me mad. And it should make you mad. Ultimately, the power of forgiveness — we get through this, we should forgive that person. But no more of these, anywhere, statewide, ever, for any reason.”The party seems to have been held by a group of young adults defying social distancing orders. Similar gatherings have been condemned in other states.In New York, now the epicentre of the US outbreak, a full lockdown has had to be imposed to stop people violating distancing rules. In Florida, meanwhile, CBS interviews showed young college students on spring break openly dismissing the risk of infection while drinking and mingling on the streets. “If I get corona, I get corona,” said one.Mr Beshear clearly has no truck with this behaviour. Laying the potential consequences uncompromisingly at the distancing-defiers’ feet, he had sharp words for them:“We are battling for the health, and even the lives, of our parents and grandparents.

The hard borders going up across the globe have – in some cases – come between married couples, and even separated children from their parents.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Andersen, a 38-year-old photographer, has been living in Indonesia since 2003 and got married there in 2012.Worried about the spread of the coronavirus, he and his wife – an Indonesian citizen – decided it was the right time to move to Norway, with its excellent health care system.Arriving at the airport on 16 March, they were told Ms Anderson would not be allowed on the flight, since the Norwegian government had changed the rules and was only allowing Norwegian citizens and people with permanent residence entry.“Without arguing with the staff, we sat down to make a decision together,” he said. “We landed on her returning to our apartment in Jakarta, and me and my son continuing the journey. It was a hard decision, but bringing our son to Norway was the tipping point.”Others face arduous journeys\u0026nbspas they try to get back home. Tim Kikke is stuck in Guatemala along with dozens of other British citizens after the country closed its borders. The 32-year-old doesn’t know when he’ll next see his mum Tineke, at home in Dumfries in the Scottish borders.The 62-year-old is also due to go into hospital this week for an operation for a serious illness not related to the coronavirus. “She’s worried of course – but I should still be able to FaceTime and WhatsApp her when she’s in hospital,” Mr Kikke told The Independent.The traveller is currently with three friends at an Airbnb house in the small Guatemalan city of Antigua. The group is planning to head over the border into Mexico and attempt to get a flight to the US before heading back to Britain, if they can.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But it’s not quite the same as seeing someone, as giving them a hug. It’s sad to be 1,500km away.”He added: “Maybe can see each other again in August or September, if everything goes as well as it can. Let’s hope so.”The thought of hugging family and friends again, one day soon, will no doubt keep many of us going in the tough times ahead.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In normal times, everyone is busy, at work all day.We rarely see even the lovely couple who live across the landing. The streets below teem with workers, always in a hurry.Now these streets are empty. Our neighbours stay indoors, self-isolating.But we still see each other more than ever before, on the way to supermarkets for Silver Hour or grabbing some fresh air. We stand well apart, chat about the only subject in town and exchange offers of help. The City of London has become a village again.We receive tip-offs about loo roll delivery times or surprise consignments of hand gel and wet wipes at the nearby ­pharmacy.WhatsApp support groups have sprung up, advising on contactless payment via online bank accounts or how to spend your time indoors. Laptops are a leline.A frail friend and neighbour politely declines my offer to pick up her prescription.“I’m inundated with calls,” she says. “Everyone’s so kind.”Not everything is so fraternal.There is real anger at the hoarders in our midst — at people like the couple who arrived home with trolleys piled high and a new freezer to store three months of food.The Sun picture of a ­Teesside shopper with  loo rolls hit a nerve, along with the scumbag who made £, selling them at £ each to pensioners.So did private cardiologist Dr Mark Ali, who — says The Sunday Times — made £.million in a week flogging coronavirus test kits for £ a go — three times the cost price.Most employers are doing the decent thing, using help from Chancellor Rishi Sunak to keep workers on  per cent pay.But others are seizing the chance to slash their payroll, risking a huge spike in ­unemployment once the crisis is over.

Only critical workers should be using public transport and no one . Ignoring these orders will put lives at risk.“We will continue to run as much of a Tube service as we possibly can so that those critical NHS staff and other workers can get to work, but as our staff themselves fall ill or have to self-isolate we are simply not able to run a full service.The majority of people are playing their part and avoiding travel, but more people need to stop travelling immediately to save lives.”In a letter, she said: “London’s NHS workers need to use the Tube, but too many Londoners are flouting the rules and turning it into a petri dish for coronavirus.“Sadiq Khan should use the police to bolster the dwindling number of Tube staff to stop non-critical workers making unnecessary journeys, implement crowd-control measures, and check which employers are forcing staff to commute.He was also bashed by the Tory candidate for mayor Shaun Bailey.The former youth worker told The Sun: I called for the Congestion charge and ULEZ to be suspended so that key workers, including NHS staff, wouldnt be penalised for driving into work in London to avoid public transport.Butthe trains are packed, I urge the Mayor to restore more services to allow key workers to make essential journeys safely.”Transport Secretary Grant Shapps and the London Major are set to speak later on.Today Michael Gove suggested the Government could act to get more trains running.He said: I know that the Transport Secretary, the Prime Minister and the Mayor have been talking in order to ensure we can have the drivers in place to make sure we can have a service that limits the need for people to be crammed one against the other on the Tube.The conversation is going on at the moment to have the best possible Tube service.This morning an NHS nurse was just one to share a photo of a packed Tube, saying: This is my Tube this morning.

Help me!It comes after the drastic measures announced last night which will change every aspect of Brits lives, including:"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus lockdown change britain forever brave new world revolution","story":"WHEN our grandchildren turn back the history books, they will point to the revolution that gripped Britain - not through war or political turmoil, but the devastating coronavirus.Today, as millions go into lockdown, we must accept that this unprecedented health crisis will bring fundamental change. Our nation will never be the same again.So many features of our society will be transformed, from the way we are governed to where we work and how we entertain ourselves.The state will be far bigger and more powerful. Free enterprise will no longer flourish. Welfare dependency, even for businesses, will the new norm.Our social lives will reshape around the home, with travel firms, cinemas and restaurants feeling the burden, while key workers like our NHS heroes will replace narcissistic celebrities in our adoration.And in practice, we will live under a socialist system, where the government has effectively nationalised the entire economy.That dramatic change will be a legacy of the extraordinary measures adopted by the Treasury in the face of the coronavirus challenge.The Chancellor Rishi Sunak has recently announced a range of policies that amount to the biggest bailout in history, including a £ billion rescue package for businesses, a massive expansion in the social security system, and an unprecedented subsidy of up to  per cent for wages in the private sector.This vast intervention is on top of the Budget a fortnight ago, in which Mr Sunak announced the biggest increase in public expenditure since the s, as well as a colossal £ billion capital investment fund for infrastructure projects.Great Britain PLC has now been the subject of a takeover by the state.Mr Sunak’s phenomenal splurge is more radical than anything even Jeremy Corbyn proposed at the last election. And the clock will not be turned back.Having tasted economic control on an epic scale, Whitehall and Westminster will be reluctant to give it up.After all, the post-war socialist expansion of the state by the - Labour Government was not reversed for decades, despite long periods of Conservative rule, until Margaret Thatcher came to power in .Recent nationalisations like those of the railways and airlines will remain in place. The public sector will continue to dominate.But the new socialist Britain will be poorer and less dynamic.The services sector, which currently accounts for  per cent of the economy, will take decades to recover from the shutdown imposed by the coronavirus panic.With the collapse of so many businesses, especially in the hospitality trade and retailing, mass unemployment will cast a long shadow.At the same time, record levels of government debt will require huge levels of borrowing and higher taxation.The fall-out from the coronavirus crisis will probably also make our nation more inward-looking and less enthusiastic about globalisation.The barriers that are now going up around Europe will remain in place, while Britain is likely to impose stronger border controls.Immigration, currently running at over , new arrivals every year, is bound to plummet, especially when shrunken firms cannot claim to need cheap foreign labour.The international travel industry will continue to struggle once the crisis is over, with clients fearful of health risks.With reduced activity, it seems doubtful that the third runway at Heathrow Airport will ever be built.Ruined airlines and cruise companies will look back on pre-corona days as a golden age, though domestic tourism may receive a boost from the greater number of Brits holidaying at home.The Covid- catastrophe has exposed how fragile our inter-connected world really is.In an attempt to reduce our vulnerability, Britain is likely to become far more self-sufficient by strengthening our domestic supply lines, rebuilding our manufacturing base and bolstering the agricultural sector.Similarly, our dangerous dependence on Chinese contractors for everything from nuclear power to broadband technology will end.Future governments will be reluctant to reach the kind of deal that Boris Johnson recently did with the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei to play a key role in the expansion of the G network.One key result of the Covid crackdown has been to show businesses that it is perfectly possible for a signicant number of their employees to work from home, thanks to the web.This trend is bound to gather pace even when the crisis has passed.The huge increase in home working will herald a long-term decline in the office, for so long one of the symbols of our sophisticated civilisation.And the consequences of such a change will be enormous.Commercial property, which is estimated to be worth around £ billion in Britain, will drastically fall in value.Commuting by road or rail will become far less common, leaving trains emptier and roads less congested.For the first time since rail privatisation, passenger numbers will drop signicantly.Nor will there be any justication for huge, expensive transport projects like the £ billion HS rail link or the vast proposed new £ billion Lower Thames crossing, linking Kent and Essex by road.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.In a culture dominated by home working, expensive city living will lose much of its appeal.Already overblown, property bubbles in fashionable hotspots like London and Manchester could soon burst.Yet, while the urban housing market runs into deep trouble, coastal and rural regions may well see a revival.Will Margate be the new Islington On a more profound level, the shock of the present crisis will leave us more oriented towards our homes and family le.We will be less obsessed with eating out, more focused on home entertainment. TV streaming services will grow rapidly. Cinema chains will shrink.Hardly any area of British le will be free of the covid revolution’s impact.Throughout the academic world, there will be more respect for valuable, practical subjects like science, engineering and medicine - and less for academic pursuits like media studies.In politics, there is likely to be less partisanship and more consensus, as highlighted by the remarkable praise heaped last week on Mr Sunak by the TUC for his bailout.In a shell-shocked country, trying to recover from economic meltdown and social lockdown, there won’t be much time for isive fads, poisonous identity politics or invented victimhood.Shrieking about safe spaces will sound like pathetic self-indulgence in a society where thousands are likely to have died from the Corona killer.What could be beneficial for Britain is a fundamental rethink about the values of our age.The health crisis has graphically revealed who really matters when it comes to the le-and-death crunch.As the death toll mounts, it is not the property speculators, lawyers, quango chiefs, and hedge fund managers that keep our country going, despite their vast financial rewards.It is the NHS staff, the care home workers, the retail assistants, the emergency services personnel, the lorry drivers and the shelf-stackers, many of whom have limited earnings.Perhaps in the new Britain forged by the coronavirus, we will lavish more on our carers, and less on our celebrities.Out of the current despair, we may come to recognise our real priorities.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That figure includes  per cent of Conservative voters and  per cent of Labour voters.What’s more, only two per cent of the public said they don’t intend to follow the new rules.His personal favourability rating has skyrocketed too.So how has the Prime Minister achieved the type of public support that most leaders during any era of our history could only dream of Because he made it clear he was desperate not to impose these measures.We support Boris introducing draconian rule over our lives now because it’s obvious that doing so is his worst nightmare.He started slowly, initially allowing schools to stay open and football games to still be played based on scientic advice.But as the modelling changed and the threat to le became very real, our willingness to comply dramatically increased too.Only time will tellhe did too much too soon or too little too late. However, I am prepared to say on the record that the measured response was the right one.The British public, who have been brave enough to put their lives and ideology to one side, will be horried to learn that leaders within the Labour party have tried to snf out a political opportunity here.Labour party chairman Ian Lavery has been caught by the Guido Fawkes website plotting to use the coronavirus crisis as what he disgustingly calls a “great opportunity”.He said: “By the way when something like this happens, we’re going to see lots of our own dying as a consequence. But, you know apart from that, it’s going to give the fantastic battalion of Labour Party members, community champions out there a great opportunity of showing how Labour, and why Labour, is best when it gets on the front foot and best when it gets people together. We need to make sure that we do that, and community organising what a great opportunity it’s going to give us.”How revolting.The coronavirus pandemic is not a great political opportunity, Mr Lavery.It’s an international tragedy of epic proportions that will cause grief for many and economic catastrophe for years to come.It’s caused someone I know to lose a dear relative before their time. It’s caused weddings to be cancelled, jobs to be lost and le savings to go down the drain.It’s not a “great opportunity” for anyone – and Lavery should immediately apologise for such a smear.

He also said the PM slapped him down during a meeting on whether builders should go to work.Mr Hancock put the onus on bosses to keep their workers safe, saying: “In work, in many, many instances, the two-metre rule can be applied. Employers have a duty to ensure workers are two metres apart.”It came as Sports Direct owner Mike Ashley tried to keep stores open — then pushed up prices.

We were high on euphoria and expectation before the inevitable responsibilities and occasional disappointments of adult le set in.For me, it meant a week in Tywyn, Wales, in the caravan of my friend Mandy’s mum and dad, followed by a summer job in Littlewoods and Sundays spent hanging around the local rec with my mates while passing round a warm, spittle-filled bottle of budget cider.Ah, those were the days. Today’s kids are more likely to be drinking canned Pinot Grigio at an American-style prom party before heading off on a family holiday to Spain, but the sense of closure they feel at the end of exams is exactly the same. It’s a rite of passage.So for all those GCSE and A-level students for whom Covid- has put paid to that “end of exams” feeling, I have nothing but the utmost sympathy.Last Wednesday I was on a dog walk with my youngestwhen news came in that her GCSEs were off.It’s tempting to think that she and the rest of Class  might have whooped with joy at this unprecedented cancellation of national exams, but that would be to sorely underestimate the level of pressure placed on their generation to get a qualication that will elevate them out of the in-tray of le and into paid employment.Like the Olympic athletes who’ve spent the past few years training for that one event in Tokyo that has been postponed until next year, our kids have been preparing for exams that their parents and teachers have drummed into them are so critically important to their future.So forgive them , despite the deaths that give perspective to the little things that many of us find frustrating about this plague on all our houses, they allow themselves a spell of feeling deeply sorry for themselves.They will now be given “predicted” grades — though the Government is still frustratingly vague on the exact detail of how they will be decided upon.There has been some suggestion that mock results might be a factor but, let’s face it, they’re rarely taken seriously at the time and never match the grades kids get in the real thing. So let’s hope they come up with something fairer.Either way, it’s going to be potentially fraught with pitfalls.“I wanted to earn my grades,” the youngest said, plaintively, the other day. “Now I feel like all my hard work has been for nothing.”I reassured her that, one day, knowledge such as “changes to Tanzania’s economy through private and foreign investment” , “the formation of polyesters through the reaction between dicarboxylic acid monomers and diol monomers”and “parallel and collinear vectors”might come in handy when, ten years from now, she’s at a pub quiz. Or maybe not.Which brings me to my final point on this unprecedented cancellation of GCSEs and A-levels.The latter are fine as they are, but perhaps those in the upper echelons of education could use this time of isolation to take a long, hard look at GCSEs and whether they are fit for purpose in the modern world Most kids know their subject strengths and weaknesses by the time they’re  so, aside from basic maths and English, which prove useful whatever your chosen employment, do they really need their heads crammed with often obscure information that,needed in later le, they could simply look up on Google Better, surely, to teach them vital le skills such as entrepreneurialism, money management, how to compose an impressive CV and do well in job interviews Like a reverse version of a minute’s silence, it’s to show our hard-working NHS staff how much we appreciate their efforts at this deeply challenging time.So whether you do it in a garden balcony windowbox or post it live on social media, put your hands together and show that we care about them too.MADONNA has posted an, er, inspirational Instagram video of herself ponticating on the Covid- plague while luxuriating in a bath full of rose petals.Her Madgeness declares: “That’s the thing about Covid-. It doesn’t care about how rich you are, how famous you are, how funny you are, how smart you are, where you live, how old you are, what amazing stories you can tell.“It’s the great equaliser and what’s terrible about it is what’s great about it.”Hmmmm. Nice sentiment, but the reality of self-isolation for the majority brings to mind the famous quote from George Orwell’s Animal Farm. “All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.”Be it the Queen Of Pop, with her vast mansion and multi-million dollar nest egg to see her through these trying times, or The Queen with her “skeleton staff of eight” – being in lockdown is far nicer when you’re wealthy.But when there’s loads of you in a pokey space and with no discernible means of paying next month’s rent, it’s not so “great”. GOVERNMENT advice on who should be doing what and when is still a little woolly.And where there’s potential loopholes there are those who will either misunderstand or willfully exploit them.Step forward Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley who, post-lockdown, told his staff they should turn up for work before being publicly shamed in to telling them to stay home after all.But with cycle shops being allowed to stay open, he could perhaps mitigate that as he’s in the business of sports equipment, he thought the same rule applied to his business too.­Similarly, while the building work on one house near me has ceased, another is still ongoing with at least eight construction workers – all of whom will have either shared a van or taken public transport to get there.So one suspects the Government is going to have to ramp up the “lockdown” rhetoric to make it clearer exactly what is deemed essential and what’s not.Meanwhile, I’m going to exploit this small pocket of vagueness by hopping on my bike and heading to the local pharmacy for a packet of hair dye, not least because it comes with a handy pair of disposable gloves.As the Donald Trump meme shows above, no one wants to see that much harsh reality.THE closure of McDonald’s prompted s of people to queue round the block for one last Big Mac.They shouldn’t worry.Given that a man in Utah claims to own the world’s oldest McDonald’s burgerand it shows no sign of decay.All those desperate McAddicts could have bought  of them and they’d still be edible at Christmas.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There’s the normal day job, but there’s also everything  that you’ve got to take in like keeping up with all the latest developments.From the moment you wake up to the moment you go to bed, it’s taking over.For my hospital colleagues it must be horrible. The other challenges we’re having to cope with are more patients with fewer people as more and more GPs are isolated.It’s still very hard to get colleagues tested. It would be really helpfulyou could easily access testing for colleagues.We’ve got doctors and nurses who are off with cough or cold symptoms that might have coronavirus. If I knew they had coronavirus, great, we could keep them off.ButI knew they didn’t have it, we could get them back to work. We’re really crying out for the testing and it’s still unclear as to how to get those tests.We had some correspondence yesterday looking for doctors to work extra shts at the new NHS Nightingale Hospital, which to be honest is challenging.They are talking about the doctors they’ve managed to get out of retirement, or the final-year medical students, or the military personnel going in there.Getting the existing scant workforce to work there will be so hard.Kirsty Gage, , is a childminder from Kettering, Northamptonshire. She lives with partner Lewis and their -month-old son, Tommy.Kirsty says: When I went from seven kids down to three — the children of key workers — I thought, This will be quite easy. But I feel like Ive got more work — and more stress.Im constantly sterilising everything. One of the children is at school and, as soon as hes gone, Im sterilising all the door handles, the chairs, the table that hes been sat at, everything.Obviously, Ive got to protect my family.Even with the younger children — a toddler and a four-year-old girl — I do a big deep-clean of all the toys weve had out.Im also constantly taking the childrens temperatures to check theyre alright.I only had the boy yesterday so Monday nights lockdown didnt affect us too much.But today Ive got one of the girls as well — and tomorrow, Ill have both girls, and thats when Ill notice it.Well be confined to my living room and garden, instead of play groups, the library and the park.The four-year-old will be asking where everyone is!Im now spending my evenings trying to figure out what the self-employed are entitled to.I cant get through to my mortgage company, so I think Im going to have to just cancel my direct debit and wait for them to contact me.I cant afford it — Im about £, down a month now.Shannon Summerfield, , is a support worker with not-for-profit Dimensions in Cardf. The organisation offers help to those with learning disabilities, autism, challenging behaviour and complex needs.Shannon says: “We had a call with our ladies’ families yesterday. One of them was quite tearful, but she was happy to hear her family.We’re going to buy an iPad so they can FaceTime their families now so they can have more contact.Work is quite hard for my mum at the moment, who is a nurse. It’ll be a few months of staff being off, but she’s coping well.And we’re keeping busy. At the house where I work, we’ve just found loads of paint.We’ve got a really big wall that’s plain at the moment so we’re going to do a big rainbow on there and all the ladies are going to do their handprints and put some writing on it.We’ve also gone out and bought old jewellery, and we’re going to be making bracelets. The ladies are just obsessed with jewellery, it’s like their favourite thing in the world.I thought the ladies would be a bit agitated and wanting to go out, but they’ve been really well actually.I did quite a long sht yesterday and I’ve got a few long shts coming up, but I’m doing my best.Sam Oxley, , is a senior sous chef at Italian restaurant Forza Win, in Peckham, South London. Sam says: Yesterday, the restaurant announced publicly that we won’t be reopening as a takeaway — we’re properly shut for the foreseeable future.It’s a sad day. With everyone self-isolating, and people being forced to stay inside, I know that food delivery has a huge role to play in this current climate, but we’re a small independent business, and after a lot of thought, we felt like it was the best decision we could make for our staff and customers.It means while I usually work long hours, for the first time in my adult le now I’m off work indefinitely, and I need to figure out how the government scheme to cover my wages works in practice.I know I’m lucky to have that safety net.For now, however, I’m more concerned about my parents, who are currently stranded in Melbourne, Australia.They flew out for a trip of a letime before the pandemic was announced, and have had their flights home cancelled, and are now terried about being stuck out there.Theyre dealing with it as best they can and keeping their spirits up for now as I know they dont want to worry anyone, but they obviously feel helpless.Apparently flights are going for , each at the moment, with no real guarantee they won’t be cancelled as most countries are shutting their airports and borders.They’re just desperately trying toto the UK before its too late.For the time being theyre able to stay in a holiday apartment but Im really worried — I just want them to be safely home.Raegan Drew, , is a funeral director for the Co-op Funeralcare in Edinburgh.She says: Thankfully, everyone’s being very understanding and the response that we’re getting from people is that they’d happily go along with the restrictions so long as it means they can come to the funeral.They don’t want to get to the point where we’re at no attendance.They’re more than happy to abide by the restrictions and not have limousines so long as they can be there.Because we haven’t been given strong guidelines from the Government, the Co-op are setting a precedent of  people allowed at funeral What the crematoriums locally are saying is ‘immediate family’, but it’s hard to cap that and we need to think of safety first.There’s a lack of government guidelines for it at the moment.‘Immediate family’ is quite vague. Every family has dferent numbers.You can categorise what immediate family, but that doesn’t help us with numbers and trying to control the numbers in the way of keeping everybody safe with social distancing.But thankfully a lot of people are taking it upon themselves not to attend the service.We have our PPE and the Co-op have set up a -hour safety support line for their colleagues should they have any issues or questions relating to Covid- cases.Gemma Woodall, , works as a primary school teacher in the village of Holme-on-Spalding-Moor in Yorkshire.Gemma says: “We got the kids to make a giant rainbow for outside the school yesterday.Parents had told them about people putting them in their windows to spread positivity, so they got really excited.We were so surprised at how many people were still out in the village… It’s dficult educating children as best you can, yet there’s still people breaking the rules.Then the other question I’ve been asked is, a lot of my kids are from split parent families, so they’ve asked, ‘Will I be able to visit my dad further down the country ’They’re really worried, especially as many parents were confused yesterday too.We have also now had some staff that have had to self-isolate because they’re vulnerable.Our head is keen for us to work for seven days and then have  off, to keep us as safe as possible. We’re lucky we can do that.Meanwhile, we had absolutely no-one come to pick up lunches yesterday, despite having another  delivered, which was really disappointing.But volunteers delivered them to elderly and vulnerable nearby — they told us that a few of them cried when they got them, it makes it so much better knowing that.From Monday, the parents will be given £ Tesco vouchers, which should work better for them.”Peter Booth, , from Leicestershire is a self-employed plumber running his family business GV Booth, with help from his -year-old dad – who manages the company’s office work.Peter says: “There was a lot of stuff online yesterday, with people arguingwe should be at work or not.The guys at home are resenting the ones that are working, saying we’re selfish and could be spreading it.Yesterday I did a flooded kitchen. The lady had cable tied a tea towel around the pipe to try and stop it, but it was all round the floor when I got there, so I obviously class that as an emergency.Now I’ve got another couple in their s without hot water.There’s just so much confusion and speculation, everyone’s just waiting for this announcement on the money situation for the self-employed. That will help us a lot.I know I’ll be staying in apart from absolute emergencies.I’m here at my first job today, the guy met me on the drive, we stayed four metres apart, then he left the house open for me and left while I do the work.”Katie*, , is a social worker, supporting vulnerable young adults between -, many of whom have left the care or prison system, and often have severe mental health issues.Katie says: In such uncertain times, I keep stressing to the young people I support that trying to maintain some structure and routine is so important.Getting up, showered, having your breakfast — Im trying to encourage some normality.However, yesterday I found out family nurses and health visitors, who support young parents who are vulnerable, are no longer doing home visits, so a young girl I support who is about to have her baby isnt going to have those visits when she leaves hospital.I therefore had to work out what we could do, as she has mental health issues and was trafficked here so has no family support.My main worryshes isolated is she could be more likely to suffer postnatal depression.Thankfully we have a process called exceptional circumstances soshe did become really low, we would be able to go and see her but right now were doing everything we can to ensure shell be contacted daily, on FaceTime.Shell be able to keep us on the phone for key moments, like bathing the baby for the first time so someone can guide her and offer words of encouragement.*Names have been changed to protect identitiesOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This is not just for health workers, this is for the general population.“Over time we would expect a proportion of the population to test positive and that will allow them to get back to work.”Users or pharmacists will have to prick a finger and place a drop of blood on a stick, which looks like a home pregnancy test.Currently, Public Health England is only testing patients for Covid- in hospital with nasal swabs.This test only shows whether someone has the virus - and not whether they have already recovered from it.However, the new at-home test would revealsomeone has had the bug and built up immunity, and is therefore unlikely to catch it again.The chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, explained the government would prioritise key workers - such as NHS staff - for the new antibody test.Explaining the process at the Downing Street press briefing tonight, he said: Once we’re confident of which tests will work and how many we have available to use, there’s a hierarchy of things that we need to do.We need to start off by answering that critical question - what proportion of people get this without any symptoms because that has big implications for the way we then manage this.Then we need to help make sure we can get NHS workers tested to make sure we can work out who is immune, or almost certainly immune, to this infection and who isn’t.We’ll basically go out in kind of a graded way from there.He added: I do not think - and I want to be clear - that this is something that we’ll be suddenly ordering on the internet next week.We need to go through the evaluation, then the first critical uses, and then spread it out from there.The NHS is also carrying out separate tests to seepeople currently have the virus, which are being given to patients in hospitals alongside some community sampling.Tap to see where COVID- is near youA Boots UK spokesperson told The Sun Online: “We are keen to work with the Government to explore opportunities to support Covid- testing and to support the NHS in any way we can.However we do not have any type of Covid- tests in our stores.Customers should not make a trip to a Boots store or pharmacy for this purpose.”Also during tonights briefing, Boris Johnson said the Government was massively ramping up testing for coronavirus as he announced that , people have now signed up as volunteers to help vulnerable people.He said it was hoped that very soon , tests would be carried out each day.Speaking at the daily press conference inside Number , he added that he wanted to offer a special thank you to everyone who has now volunteered to help the NHS.When we launched the appeal last night, we hoped to get , volunteers over a few days.But I can tell you that in just  hours, , people have responded to the call.That is already, in one day, as many volunteers as the population of Coventry.Prof Whitty also said there were shortages along many supply chains in the production of tests because every country in the world is simultaneously wanting this new thing.He added: Its not that there is no testing going on, what we need, clearly, is to be able to scale it up.Answering a question about how well the country was coping, Mr Johnson said that never in our history has the Government put its arms around people in the way we are doing now to help them get through this time.He added that a tailored package of support would be announced on Thursday to help self-employed people.The PM said: I do think when you look at the sheer scale of what the Government is doing to get this country through, we will cope and are coping very well indeed under the most challenging possible circumstances.To come out of it well together as I know we can, we all need to follow the instructions the Government have given and to stay at home, protect the NHS and thats the way to save lives.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was the apex of collective euphoria in a unique football season for this club.A month has passed since that match, so the timing is pertinent.The aggregation of thousands of people, centimetres from each other, engaging in manestations of euphoria like hugging, shouting, all of that could’ve favoured viral reciprocation.I have to imagine many didn’t want to miss that gamethey had tickets, eventhey felt a slight fever.With hindsight, it was madness to play with a crowd present, but at the time things weren’t clear enough. It’d be unthinkable now.Valencia have announced  per cent of their squad and staff tested positive for coronavirus, linking it to that trip to Milan.And, so far Atalanta goalkeeper Marco Sportiello has tested positive for the deadly bug leading to the entire squad being quarantined.The area around Bergamo went into lockdown just four days after the game as the number of cases soared.Bergamo mayor Giorgio Gori has labelled the clash a “biological bomb” and says he believes it caused the spread of the virus in Europe.He is quoted in Spanish paper Marca as saying: “The match was a biological bomb.

Can the PM be absolutely clear and give unequivocal guidance that construction work and non-emergency work should stop now However, the PM could only say that people are allowed to go into workthey cant do their jobs at home.Any businesses who cant make sure their workers stay two metres apart should be shut, ministers said earlier.Boris said: Everybody should work at home unless they must go to work and cannot do work from home. They should do so in accordance wit advice from Public Health England.He added: What we are saying is unless you need to leave the house for exercise, for medical reasons or buy essential supplies, is to  stay at home, and save lives.The case in question was Dan, from Leytonstone, who appeared on LBC this morning.Dan told Nick Ferrari: I am extremely confused at the moment, I am having to go against my morals.I am currently not well, I should be in quarantine.I work in the construction industry and I am on my way into work.He admitted that he visited five or six sites per day but insisted he had no choice but to work to support his two-year-old daughter and pay his mortgage.Nick told him he could be unwittingly killing other people by spreading the virus around, and Dan replied:  per cent. Its disgusting.

Lots of people will have had very mild, or in some cases no symptoms, so it is possible that people have had it without knowing. Unfortunately we don’t have enough testing to know how many people have had it.Q: What is the dference between coronavirus and hay fever symptoms A: Hay fever symptoms are usually itchy, red eyes and, for people who have asthma, some get wheezing. It can also cause a runny, itchy or bunged-up nose. Coronavirus can cause people with asthma to have wheezing but the two main symptoms of the virus are a dry, persistent cough that is new and a high fever. Despite its name, hay fever does not cause a fever.Q: What are the guidelines regarding bedding and towels when you are in self-isolation A: If someone is in self-isolation because they are showing symptoms of the virus they should use their own bedding, pillows, towels and toiletriesthey live with other people. People should also use their own cutlery and crockery. They should visit the bathroom last and clean hard surfaces with a household bleach product.Q: My daughter and her partner are key workers on shts and are struggling to arrange childcare. Is it safe to look after my grandchildren A: If you are over  you should avoid looking after your grandchildrenpossible because older people are more vulnerable and because children can carry and transmit the virus without having symptoms.Q: I’m a care worker and also a carer for my disabled husband, who has heart failure and is on immunosuppressant medication. He has been told by the Government to isolate for  weeks. Do I have to stop work and isolate as well in case I catch the virus from work A: Your husband is in the high-risk group and needs to keep a physical distance from everybody . As you are a care worker, you will be coming into contact with other people but because you are living together you don’t need to self-isolate unless you get symptoms. You still need to care for your husband and you cannot always keep a two-metre distance from him.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Q: I live alone and have had the virus symptoms. I have been self-isolating for seven days. When is it safe to stop self-isolating A: If you live alone, the seven-day self- isolation period begins the day your symptoms start. If after seven days, your symptoms have gone and you are well, you can carry on as normal, evenyou still have a cough. Butyou still feel unwell, you must stay at home until you feel completely better.Q: What is the best way to protect our mental health during lockdown  I have a family member constantly crying and who has locked herself in her room.A: It’s understandable and normal that people feel like your family member. It’s a worrying time for everybody. But it is important to remember the virus is usually a mild illness. Most people will recover. If you find watching the news upsetting then I would advise switching it off and finding something that makes you feel more relaxed and happy, such as listening to your favourite music, getting out in your garden or doing some exercise, which releases happy hormones. You can also call a friend as it can help to share your anxiety.Q: My partner is seven months pregnant and I suffer from asthma, plus we have a two-year-old daughter with breathing problems. We are self-isolating but when should I go back to work  I can’t work from home.A: Your partner is in the vulnerable group and should be staying at home, as should your daughter. You have asthma so you should be staying at home unless it is very controlled. If your asthma is at all frequent, you should not be going to work.Q: I have no cough or temperature but I am suffering fatigue, shortness of breath and have lost my sense of taste. Someone told me these are still symptoms of the virus. Is this true A: For those who have very mild symptoms of coronavirus, some have only experienced a loss of sense of taste and smell. That is not a reason to self-isolate, though. It could be down to an allergy or an ordinary cold.Q: I am due to go for an MRI next week for prostate cancer. I am , wheelchair-bound and have other problems. Is it safe for me to go Q: I work at Royal Mail as a sorter and work closely with colleagues. Now the coronavirus is spreading fast, should I stay at home A: Physical distancing is key to anyone who still remains at work. Your work is important and as long as you are not too close to your colleagues there is no reason why you cannot continue.Think of all the people working in hospitals, at  call centres and all the paramedics seeing patients.

What matters most is we get money to those who need it the most as quickly as we can”.Better off earners are instead judged to have nest eggs tucked away that they can delve into for short-term support.Five million Brits - almost one in six of the workforce - work for themselves.Some . million of them have already been left out of pocket by the crisis, the Resolution Foundation think-tank warned yesterday.But until the brand new system is up and running, they will be asked to go on Universal Credit.The Chancellor will also highlight how he last week hiked the job support element of the benefit to £ a week, as well as point to the series of other emergency reliefs he has put in place, including deferring VAT, mortgage holidays, scrapping business rates and free loans for businesses.Insiders also yesterday claimed the new self-employed bailout has been “incredibly dficult” to set up, and there were also serious concerns about designing a system that took away the incentive to work.Mr Johnson also told MPs yesterday that the Government will “put our arms around every worker” to help them during the unprecedented crisis.He told PMQs: “As a society and a country we’re doing a quite extraordinary thing.“For the first time in our history, to get through this crisis, we’re putting our arms as a country around every single worker, every single employee in this country.“It is a quite unprecedented step. I know there are concerns about the self-employed, but he’ll be hearing more in the next couple of days from the Chancellor.”The Chancellor last week launched an all-out bid to save millions of jobs by promising to pay  per cent of the wages of staff kept on the books.And the PM hinted today’s bailout for Britain’s five million self-employed will be on a similar scale, saying he wants “parity” of support.Mr Sunak also extended the one year business rates holiday to all firms forced to close for the coronavirus lockdown.That means estate agents, hairdressers, furniture stores, sports shops and other businesses forced to shut down for at least three weeks will pay no rates until April .It is an extension of the one-year business rates holiday handed to retailers, pubs, restaurants, leisure centres and travel agents in last week’s announcement.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Depending on their exact form, some might be able to be administered without leaving home. Prof Peacock said patients could eventually get the test delivered from Amazon or by visiting Boots to showthey have immunity. But Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty warned people wonapost simply be able to order them next week.  He said they must be rolled out in a graded way with NHS staff and key workers being tested for immunity first - and while carefully gathering data on what proportion of the population might be immune. Prof Whitty said: “I do not think, and I want to be clear, that this is something we’ll suddenly be ordering on the internet next week. “We need to go through the evaluation, then the first critical uses, and then spread it out from that point of view. We need to do that in a systematic way.” The tests are designed to establish whether people have previously been infected with coronavirus, as opposed to antigen tests which showsomeone has the virus as they areexperiencing symptoms of COVID-, the disease caused by the coronavirus.These are brand new products. We have to be clear they work as they are claimed to do, Prof Peacock told MPs. Once they have been tested, and that will happen this week, once the bulk of tests arrive, they will be distributed into the community, she said, adding that the they could be delivered via Amazon. Testing the test is a small matter, and I would anticipate that it would be done by the end of this week. She said there were ious dferent models, and some might might require people to go to a high street chemist.  Prof Peacock said she thought any charge for the tests would be minimal and though she declined to say they would be available by next week, she confirmed that they would be ready in days rather than weeks or months. Asked when they would be rolled out more widely she cautioned: “I think I would be somewhat less categorical about the date.  “But in the near future people will be able to order a test that they can test themselves, or go to Boots or somewhere similar to have their finger prick test done.” She told MPs on the Commons Science and Technology Committee the finger-prick test “looks like a pregnancy test”, but using a drop of blood. She added: “.million have been ordered and further millions are being ordered today. “But we do need to make sure we understand how they operate because these are brand new tests, they haven’t been used by us before.”  Prof Peacock explained: “We are developing home testing so people who have been sick can be tested for the presence of antibodies.  “So thatthey’re positive, they can then go out and go back to work.” She said they will be rolled out into the community once PHE are sure they work. She added: ”These are brand new products. We have to be clear they work as they are claimed to do.

The man, named as Dan from Leytonstone, east London, told a radio phone-in he was having to go against my morals to pay the mortgage and feed his toddler daughter.Danaposs case was raised by Jeremy Corbyn in Parliament as an example of self-employed people making impossible choices in the coronavirus pandemic.million self-employed people have been left without full government support for several days despite a UK lockdown. And many construction workers in particular have been told to carry on going to work.The worker told LBCaposs Nick Ferrari: “I’m currently not well. I should be in quarantine. But I work in the construction industry - and I’m on my way into work.I think it may be five or six dferent construction sites throughout the day.” Told he could unwittingly be killing people, Dan - who said his monthly income was several thousand pounds, but disappears on regular outgoings - replied: % and it’s disgusting. But unfortunately it’s human nature, when you come down to the crunch you put yourself first. And I’m definitely going to put myself and my daughter and my we first.Dan could likely access a three-month payment holiday on his mortgage, because itaposs available for all residential mortgages of people hit by the coronavirus.He did not describe his symptoms, buthe had a fever or cough, he is directly defying strict government orders. The governmentaposs advice says entire households must isolate for  daysone of them falls ill. People who are caught defying orders to be tested, or stay in isolation, can be fined up to £, under new police powers to be passed into law today. Despite Danaposs case going against the governmentaposs orders, it does also expose a huge gap in support for the self-employed.  Self-employed people are not eligible either for a guarantee of % of wages, up to a cap of £, a month, or Statutory Sick Pay.Instead they must claim a beefed-up version of Universal Credit, with half a million people doing so in nine days.The benefit itself has not collapsed, but a website asking people to prove their identity has seen queues of tens of thousands of people. Danaposs case also raises the thorny issue of construction workers still heading in on the job after the government said non-essential work could continue. Calling on the government to act, Dan told LBC: I want them to hear that I’m not going to be the only person doing this now. New measures for the self-employed will be unveiled by the Chancellor tomorrow afternoon, the Mirror understands.But Dan told LBC that eventhe support matched the £,-a-month cap for the self-employed, it wouldn’t even be half my monthly income. He added his outgoings are high and I’ve got quite a large mortgage, I’ve got other things like a car. He told LBC: I don’t want to work feeling like this. I really don’t feel well. My we isn’t well. But he added: “I know I’m wrong but I’ve also got a two year old daughter. I’ve got a mortgage, I’ve got a we, I am self employed as well. There’s nothing I can do and honestly I’m sitting here and I feel so guilty.” Askedhe could go a month without income he said: No.Jeremy Corbyn raised the case at PMQs, saying: We heard this morning on the radio a call from a self-employed construction worker who said he had contracted coronavirus, he was suffering from it, he knew heaposs got it. But [he] had no other option to get on the London Tube and go onto a site to work - obviously putting himself at greater risk and putting all other passengers and all other workers on that site at risk. The man did not explicitly say his illness was coronavirus - community testing is not available - and did not specy whether he had travelled on the Tube. Mr Corbyn went on: Why was he doing it  Because his site had not been closed down, he had no other source of income to feed his family, so heaposs going to work making all of us more at risk as a result. So can the Prime Minister be absolutely clear and give unequivocal guidance now that construction work on non-emergency work should stop now.

The death of -year-old Chloe Middleton is a reminder that all ages are at risk. Our thoughts are with her family. We also wish the Prince a speedy recovery. The heir to the throne was one of the lucky ones who has been able to receive a test. Our concern is the delay in rolling out a testing regime for NHS staff and care workers. Boris Johnson says he hopes to have widespread testing available as quickly as possible. The Prime Minister has yet to explain why Britain has been so slow to act when other countries such as South Korea have been aggressively testing for the bug. Germany has the capacity to test , people a week. The UK has tested just , since the virus first appeared on our shores. It looks like no coincidence that Germany has reported more cases of the coronavirus than Britain but has lower mortality rate.  Ministers also need to explain why it is taking so long to provide personal protection equipment to NHS and care workers. Without masks, gloves and sanitisers these frontline workers are putting themselves and their patients at risk. The Government is asking all of us to do our bit to help the country through this crisis. Inwe expect it to play its part by providing NHS staff with the equipment they need and to rapidly expand the testing programme. Clap for heroes  When the call went out for volunteers to support the NHS in its hour of need some thought it would go unanswered. Instead people have responded in their hundreds of thousands. This same spirit has also seen more than , former doctors and nurses come out of retirement to help the NHS. Everyone who does so knows they could be putting their own le at risk in order to save the lives of others.

In Stoke-on-Trent, nine people tested positive for coronavirus as of Tuesday, and  in Staffordshire.However, StokeonTrentLive reports that the numbers could be even higher due to limited testing.Dr Richard Harling, the Director for Health and Care at Staffordshire County Council is chairing the Strategic Coordinating Group, which is overseeing the multi-agency response, said: “Everyone is now aware that we are facing a unique challenge, with the Government addressing the nation on a daily basis.Do you have a coronavirus story to share  Email webnews@mirror“Declaring a Major Incident now is a way of making sure all public sector agencies and our partners can work together, share resources where necessary, and better anticipate and deal with challenges. “It is something we prepare for and practice regularly. It does not confer any special powers or change the roles of the dferent organisations involved. “This is a sensible step as we know from other countries that dealing with Coronavirus COVID- is going to take time and persistence. “Pooling resources is important because we know we will face challenges, particularly the likelihood that more staff will be self-isolating in the coming weeks and that will strain resources.

British scientists are among those scrutinising data out of the country where the pandemic emerged in Wuhan in December, the city has been in lockdown since January but restrictions were loosened this week. It comes after a separate study by Oxford University suggested many more Brits may have been infected but developed no symptoms. The optimistic modelling theory suggests the virus was circulating in the UK by mid-January, around two weeks before the first reported case here. If true it would mean more than half of the population are likely to have had Covid- and be immune to it. China is ahead of all other countries and spread of the disease there has slowed signicantly. Mass gatherings are still banned. Author Prof Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College London, who is advising the UK government, said: “This provides hope for countries currently in ious levels of lockdown.” It was not all good news though as a separate study warned that China can expect a second wave of infections by August after it lted restrictions in Hubei province. Peer-reviewed modelling published in the Lancet Public Health journal found that delaying reopening schools and workplaces a month until April would delay the second wave from hitting until October. Dr Kiesha Prem, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: “The measures the city of Wuhan has put in place have helped to control the outbreak. However, the city now needs to be careful to avoid prematurely lting physical distancing measures, because that could lead to an earlier secondary peak.”The UK is currently only testing a fth of the , daily checks promised by Boris Johnson last week and lags behind other countries such as South Korea, Germany, Italy and Norway. Prof Ferguson, who is recovering from Covid- himself, told MPs yesterday via video link that any lting of restrictions would require widespread testing. Sir Patrick Vallance, the Government’s Chief Scientic Officer, told MPs: “I wish we had more tests available.” Prof Sharon Peacock, of Public Health England, admitted the , daily test total will not be hit until the “end of April”. Prof Ferguson, expects transmission to be reduced in the summer months by %-%. The only long term “exit strategy” from current lockdown is the development of a vaccine, which could take between  and  months.  The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovations, has said that it needs extra cash from governments for eight vaccine candidates in development. But Prof Andrew Pollard, of Oxford University, told MPs: ““I believe that six months is possible but it needs a lot of things to fall in place so that this process goes well.”Sunetra Gupta, a professor of theoretical epidemiology at Oxford, said: “We need to begin mass antibody testing to assess what stage of the epidemic weare in.”The government has purchased . million antibody tests, which could tellsomeone has ever had Covid-, and they will be kept at a centre in Milton Keynes, Bucks.

CUPRA, which is the performance arm of SEAT, is using state-of-the-art, multi-jet fusion technology to fashion parts in a fast and efficient way. They D printed the door mirror, air intakes and cooling intakes for the new race spec Leon Competici n model. The process of printing a mirror can take around  hours, but as they can print six at a time it gives the team the ability to create dferent designs simultaneously. This way they can quickly test the ying prototypes in a wind tunnel to find out which is best for aerodynamics. When taken to this controlled environment, the printed parts are fitted to the car and face winds of more than mph while sensors study the impact on inidual surfaces. The caraposs resistance data is displayed on screen and the engineers and designers compare the results for the dferent printed wing mirrors and grilles. As the smallest margins can make the dference in motorsport, it is crucial the D printed parts play their part in reducing fuel consumption while also increasing stability, speed and safety.Xavi Serra, head of technical development at CUPRA Racing, said: For the new CUPRA Leon Competici n we modelled the steering wheelaposs centre control module, the bonnet air vents, door mirrors and the brake and water cooling inlets. The main goal is to have a lot of parts in a short time. We can quickly test a wide iety of designs and furthermore, since vehicle development is now done in parallel, this technology enables us to react swtly to any changes in the design process.The bigger the iety of parts we can test in this facility, the better. It enables us to make much faster progress. The results were excellent, and some were even surprising, because we were looking to push the material to its limits. This technology is and will continue to be key in countless fields to make the most complex ideas a reality.  The final development of the D printed parts was on a racing circuit, with CUPRA testing the Leon Competici n on the Portimao track in Portugal. So far, CUPRA has been printing parts for its Leon Competici n, its mph touring car inspired by the new Seat Leon family hatchback, and the e-Racer, an electric touring car which does -mph in . seconds. CUPRA has released footage of the printing and test processes of the project, which is in partnership with HP.

West Midlands couple Kirsten Robson and Richard Groom spent  months planning their dream day before the strict social distancing measures were brought in. The couple, both , made the decision to bring their nuptials forward and tied the knot on Saturday - two days before all weddings in the UK were cancelled - and finally became Mr and Mrs Groom.They live-streamed the service on Facebook to more than  guests who watched in their wedding outfits from their homes in England and in Kirstenaposs native Northern Ireland. The couple said aposI doapos at St Matthew’s Church in Walsall, in the West Midlands, and are planning to go on honeymoon when the crisis is over, reports Birmingham Live. Kirsten, who is partially-sighted and works as a church administrator, said: We could sense that the restrictions were getting tighter and we didnapost want to risk having to call the whole wedding off. Richard had seen the situation in the UK was heating up and had floated the idea of bringing the wedding forward. When the Prime Minister started restrictions last week, another person said aposwhy not get married now apos but we had put a year-and-a-half into planning our perfect wedding. We knew there was no way we would be able to get married in April, so we took the opportunity while we could. The couple were joined by  other guests who had all self-isolated for a week prior to the big day, the vicar and Kirstenaposs guide dog Kip. The couple’s friends pitched in with arranging flowers and decorating the church while all the guests were told to log in for the service.  Kirsten added: “We had planned the wedding for April and the dress wasn’t ready but my housemates sourced another one. “Me and Richard are real technophobes so our friends also set up the Facebook live stream which was basically a mobile phone propped on a music stand so everyone could watch us walk down the aisle. We know at least  people watched it from all over England and my family from Northern Ireland so at least they could share the day with us. The church is huge and has a capacity for , people so it was strange for just  of us to be there.

The couple are already in Canada with their son Archie ready to officially begin their new non-royal lives. Many things will change from April , including their names. At the moment, they use their official HRH titles - which technically means they donapost have surnames. But as the Queen has said they must drop their titles as part of stepping back from their senior duties, they will have to use something . In the past, royals have often used their dukedoms as their surnames, with Princes William and Harry using Wales for school and their time in the military and George, Charlotte and Louis taking Cambridge. Meghan and Harry might keep using Sussex, but there are other options they might opt for instead. Harry might revert back to using Wales, which he used throughout his Army career, and Meghan may stick to her maiden name Markle - which is what she is still best known for. Or they could opt for something a little dferent, which would mean the whole family has the same name. Their son Archieaposs surname is Mountbatten-Windsor - the Royal Familyaposs official surname, which is used by all members who donapost have a title.  They adopted it back in  as a combination of Prince Philip and the Queenaposs names. Before marrying the Queen, Philip was Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark of the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg. However this wasnapost neutral enough so he adopted the name Mountbatten after his grandparents. When the then Princess Elizabeth had the coupleaposs first child Prince Charles, he assumed they would take on his name in the traditional way.  But Prime Minister Winston Churchill didnapost agree, and wanted them to continue to use the name Windsor, which was the official Royal Family surname. The Queenaposs grandmother Queen Mary agreed, and it caused such a row that the matter was even discussed in Parliament. In the end the Queen made the decision to go with her familyaposs views, and the name Windsor was used.

Jade Edgington was just six months away from her big day when the groom-to-be had a change of heart and shattered her dream of a fairytale ending. The business development manager spent the summer of  holidaying to take her mind off the break-up but her desire to be a mum never went away. After being diagnosed with polycystic oy syndrome, the -year-old knew her chances of conceiving naturally were slim and that sheaposd need IVF one day.  Jade, from Birmingham, West Mids, then made the bold decision to become a single parent with the help of IVF and a sperm donor.She says her le is now aposcompleteapos after giving birth to Eden last year on July .Jade says: I had known for a few years I had polycystic oy syndrome which meant that my oies had a lot of cysts all over them.My then partner seemed to be on the exact same wave and spoke about children and marriage from the very start. I felt like everything I had ever been waiting for was coming true. Until he randomly texted me to say he didnapost want to be with me - my entire world came crashing down.But that didnapost stop me from wanting to become a mum and it was the best decision I have ever made.I donapost have any regrets about doing this on my own and I feel like she has made me into the person I was always supposed to be.Jade was initially thrilled when her ex popped the question - nine months into their relationship and the pair went on to book their wedding for July . Jade recalls being on cloud nine in aposcoocoo landapos when booking her dream honeymoon to Thailand and Bali.But as the six month countdown approached, Jadeaposs ex-fiancee got cold feet. She said: He just changed his mind, as simple as that but kept me hanging for six weeks until he made his mind up about wanting to be with me or not.I was on a shoestring just wanting him to love me. I was distraught and genuinely broken.I put on a brave face when at work or with my friends and family but when I got home, I would sob and sob.But eventually I realised I deserve to be with someone who wants to be with me.I wasnapost willing to put myself into that situation ever again nor wait another few months or years to meet aposthe oneapos.I was still focussed on becoming a mum, evenit meant doing it alone. According to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence fertility guidelines it is broadly recognised that single women are not eligible for IVF on the NHS.After thorough research, she found a clinic in Northern Spain and her journey to motherhood began.She adds: It was such a big decision and I had no idea where to find a clinic that is going to be the best at sucking my eggs out and sticking them back in fertilised!A friend had been to a dferent clinic in Spain but the country seemed to have higher success rates and was much cheaper.I found Manzanera Fertility Clinic in Northern Spain, and had my consultation via Skype in August [].I didnapost want to feel under pressure so I decided to keep it a secret from everyone but my dad Brian, , who accompanied me to to the clinic in October .Jade forked out £, of her savings to pay for IVF and she was able to get IVF medication in the UK.The clinic matched her characteristics to a sperm donoraposs to ensure her baby looked like her.She had three eggs fertilised but a pregnancy test two weeks later revealed one had stuck.

We’re all in the same situation.“I’ve been nipping to my mum’s and using the gym to keep me occupied but I know I can’t keep doing that.“It’s the best job in the world being a footballer and when you’re not able to do it, it’s rubbish.“However, you have to realise there is a bigger picture. It’s easy to look from a selfish point of view and moan but there is a bigger issue of people’s safety and their health.”He added: “I get cabin fever at the best of times, never mind with this situation.“Anyone who knows me has been saying ‘you’ll go off your head in the house’, I always need to be doing stuff. I’ve been pottering around the house but I struggle to sit around.“I’m already missing going into Dens and seeing everyone, there’s always plenty of banter. I’d usually get a bit off Gowser so it’ll good to get a rest from him!“You think about these things but at the back of the mind you are always aware there are more important things than football, it’s about keeping things in perspective.“That might be good for me in the long-term, I would always have a bad game in my head and people would say ‘there are more important things than football’ and I can definitely see that now.”Training has been cancelled all week at Dens Park and, with no indication from the authorities of when it will be safe to restart playing, Kerr and his team-mates have had to find ways to fill their time away from the football pitch.For a young man like Kerr who is dedicated to his job and keeping himself in the best shape possible for his boyhood club, that’s not been easy and he knows it will get harder over the coming weeks as everyone gets to grips to such a massive change to normal le.The -year-old added: “My usual routine is to head to Dens early doors about am, recently I’ve been doing a bit with the physio Gerry Docherty after the problem with my knee, and start training at am till lunchtime.“Then it’s gym in the afternoon and home before maybe heading to the pool or sauna in the evening. Changing that for me has been dficult.“Since we’ve been off I’ve been getting a longer lie and going to meet up with some people.“Fin Robertson is one of the local boys so we’ve gone for coffee.“It’s the same struggles that everyone is having – going to the shops and not being able to get handwash and stuff like that.“It’s dficult to do anything really because there is nothing concrete to say when we are going to restart.”When the Dark Blues do finally get back out on the pitch, Kerr expects the good form since the start of February to continue as Dundee look to put their up-and-down start to le in the Championship behind them.“I had said from day one we had a really good group of players at the club and I don’t think it was expected we would be so inconsistent,” he added.“The boys who came in in January have all brought something and we had been doing well up until the shutdown.“We have a standard to meet every day and,we were still playing, we would expect to be getting better and better.”PODCAST: Twa Teams, One Street – What the coronavirus could mean for Dundee and Dundee United\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp podcast-twa-teams-one-street-what-the-coronavirus-could-mean-for-dundee-and-dundee-united embed # secreteTtVElWoIb\" data-secret\"eTtVElWoIb\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\""},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b029991d13a2-692x564.jpg ","title":"dundee fc dundee united simon murray transfer","story":"Former Dundee and Dundee United striker Simon Murray is targeting ato the Scottish game this summer after playing his last game in South Africa.Murray, , hopes an extension to this season due to the coronavirus shutdown might even see him back in action on home soil before the end of the campaign.The Dundonian has enjoyed the last  months on an adventure at Bidwest Wits in the South African top flight but has had to spend almost the entirety of this season on the sidelines.A damaged cruciate ligament early in the campaign required surgery which saw his place in the squad taken up.Speaking from Johannesburg, he told the Tele: “I hurt my knee in the third game of the season and needed an operation so I’ve been out six-and-a-half months.“Because there’s a limit on the number of foreign players over here, the club signed another forward when I was injured and took my place so we’ve come to an agreement to terminate my contract when I’m fit.“The club have been really good, to be honest, they’ve made sure I got through the injury and looked after me during rehab.“The plan was to stay here in South Africa, get the rehab done and recover from the injury and then head back to Scotland in the summer but because of all this coronavirus it is up in the air.”Murray revealed there has already been interest in his services, once he is back up and running, from Premiership and Championship clubs.He said: “During the injury, I’ve had some interest from a few teams. Nothing concrete, though, and I want to prove my fitness first before doing anything.“If the season gets extended, that might end up being a good thing for me.“There might even be time for me to play for somebody this season depending on what happens. That would be great for my fitness before heading into pre-season.”Despite the impact the coronavirus has had on le back in Scotland, Murray and his family are planning to head back to Dundee in the coming weeks with his time at Wits coming to an end.In South Africa, the virus hasn’t yet had the same effect as in Europe and the football season was only shut down last week.He admits there are worries but being back home and closer to family and friends is a draw for Murray as he plots the next move of a career that has seen him turn out for Montrose, Downfield, Tayport, Dundee Violet, Arbroath, United, Hibs and then the Dark Blues before heading for Johannesburg.CALUM WOODGER: It#s a perfect storm and, make no doubts about it, Dundee and Dundee United are right in the eye of it\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp calum-woodger-dundee-fc-dundee-united-spfl-shutdown embed # secretlKqPsPpAv\" data-secret\"lKqPsPpAv\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"He added: “There haven’t been any deaths so it is all just starting here, to be honest.“I think countries like this have learned from the ones who got it first so President Cyril Ramaphosa here is putting measures in place for prevention, hand sanitiser everywhere and things like that.“I get UK TV so I’ve been hearing all the stuff from home, get to see Boris every night, and it is worrying.“Having lived in South Africa, you are isolated at the best of times anyway so that won’t be as much a problem for people here.“You never walk anywhere for safety reasons – don’t get me wrong, it’s a great place but you have to be careful.”Murray has loved his time in South Africa but says he’s looking forward to getting back home.“I’ve missed Scottish football in some ways, not others I suppose,” he added.“The football is good over here but there’s not the passion in the stands like in Scotland.“It’s a dferent culture.

Bottom of the second tier got £,.Could they not pay out the minimum to everybody right now and decide the rest later Welcome to lockdown everybody!

It set up finally ending the  year trophy drought.Jonny Hayes opened the scoring four minutes before half-time and in the process, ended Fraser Forster’s record clean-sheet run.Adam Rooney doubled the lead before half-time and, despite James Forrest pulling a goal back in the second half, the Dons held on.In a dire game, with neither side showing particular urgency to win the game, the Dons emerged triumphant on penalties to win their first silverware since .Billy Mckay and future Don Greg Tansey missed from the spot, allowing Rooney to tuck away the decisive spot-kick.The Dons’to European football proved a fruitful one as they thumped the nine-man Latvian side at Pittodrie.Shay Logan, Niall McGinn, a Rooney brace and another from Hayes sent the Pittodrie faithful home happy.Victory over the Caley Jags on their own turf effectively secured second spot for the Dons, a position they would not relinquish for several seasons.Edward Ofere had put the Scottish Cup finalists in front, before a David Raven own-goal and McGinn’s strike five minutes later nudged the Dons over the line.Aberdeen blew the title race wide open with a win that moved them to within three points of league leaders Celtic.Jonny Hayes fired the Dons ahead with a sensational  yard drive after  minutes.Soon after, Welsh international striker Simon Church, bundled home from close range to net on his debut.Leigh Grfiths netted in injury time, but it was no more than a consolation for a well-beaten Celtic side.This was the season that will leave Aberdeen fans with regret and thoughts of #what #.Following this win, the Reds would move to within one point of Celtic after  games, although the Hoops had a game in hand.A - loss at Motherwell on March  killed all momentum and the Dons would collapse post-top six split.Ultimately they finished  points behind champions Celtic. So near… but yet so farThe biggest away win under McInnes came courtesy of a memorable hat-trick from Considine.Rooney, Kenny McLean, Ryan Jack and McGinn were also on the scoresheet in the rout at Dens Park.Tom Rogic’s goal prevented Aberdeen winning their first Scottish Cup since .The two sides had swapped early goals between Hayes and Stuart Armstrong, before Rogic broke Aberdeen hearts in the closing moments of the game.Needing a victory to cement second spot for the fourth season in a row, Aberdeen won at Celtic Park for the first time in  years thanks to Andy Considine’s goal.Coupled with Rangers’ dramatic - draw with Hibernian at Easter Road, it was mission accomplished for the Dons in Glasgow.The year when the Dons proved they could cut it in Glasgow, Lewis Ferguson scored the vital goal that beat Rangers at Hampden Park and sealed a spot in the Betfred Cup final.McInnes’ side would go on to beat Rangers twice more, both wins coming at Ibrox as they won - in the Premiership and - in a Scottish Cup replay."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor january 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,in  The Argyllshire Advertiser ran a story entitled #Skate park pipe dream a reality for Lochgilphead#. Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column february 7 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDog walkers on the banks of the Crinan Canal need to take collective responsibility for lting their canine companions# mess.There is no excuse for leaving it lying for others to tread in, push a pram through or meet while cutting grass.The bins are there, so use them.We wish Rhona Love all the best in her shooting career.

Patsy Dyer will speak on #Man#s Relationship and Mythology with Plants#, drawing on her work at botanical gardens in America, the UK and Kilmartin."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part five","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe Mate had gone below when the sails came down and very shortly after we had anchored we sat down to a supper of lamb salad, strawberry tarts, coffee and biscuits. As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Editor Andrew McQuarrie grabbed a torch, pulled on his big-boy trousers and joined the funhellipIt was .pm on a Saturday night and I was trying to communicate with a supernatural beingusing a pair of copper rods.Having done as instructed and asked the tools a simple lsquoYes Norsquo question, I was slightly dismayed to see the rods stubbornly remaining still, the spirit apparently refusing to play ball.Sheila, an employee of UK Ghost Nights, appeared quite perplexed as her eyes darted between me and the rods.ldquoAre you a sceptic  she asked, a faint edge of suspicion laced in her voice.I admitted that I was indeed a sceptic, but one who was more than willing to be converted into a true believer.Happy with this answer, Sheila ushered me into a corner that was, she said, known to be particularly popular with spirits.ldquoAre we in Melrose  I asked the rods, willing them to show even the smallest hint of movement.But after a full minute of tense observation, it was plain to see the equipment would not co-operate.An hour earlier, when the ghost experts were delivering their briefing, they had promised the  paying customers that ldquonothing is fabricated on the tours.The insinuation, it seemed to me, was that this would likely not be a night of high drama and theatrics.Nevertheless, I couldnrsquot help but feel a bit disappointed that my opening bid to converse with the dead had fallen distinctly flat.And over the next four hours, so it would prove, my luck would not change much.Yet, as I wandered the portrait-lined corridors of the George  Abbotsford Hotel, trying to channel my inner Bill Murray, some of the people to whom I spoke offered compelling tales.Few were as gripping as those delivered by Dawn Barrett - owner of the hotel for the last  months - and her cooking team.Among the unusual goings-on noted by Mrs Barrett, for instance, were lights turning on and off on their own, furniture moving around, footsteps at all hours and even the feeling of her hair being brushed.Asked for her views on the supernatural, Mrs Barrett said: ldquoI definitely believe - Irsquove seen and heard too much now.It was Mrs Barrett herself who contacted UK Ghost Nights in the first place, with the aim of getting to the root of what makes the hotel tick.ldquoI want to know why they [spirits] are here. I donrsquot understand how they can put lights on and off. I just want to understand it more, she said.Head chef Kailee Reidie, , spoke of an alarming encounter with a spirit who has come to be known as John, supposedly a grouchy ex-chef.As Kailee turned on the fryer one evening, while she was alone in the kitchen, her hair was pulled back so sharply that she was thrown into the table behind her, banging her head.ldquoAs soon as I turned my back on him [John], thatrsquos when it happened, recalled Kailee, going on to explain her emotions at the time.ldquoI was in shock because I knew he [John] was there, but Irsquom not a big believer in ghostshellip Irsquove never seen John - itrsquos just a feeling.Just a feeling. Well, there was certainly a sense of foreboding in some areas of the building - not least the cellar and the attic.In one of the attic rooms, we indulged in an activity called the lsquohuman pendulumrsquo. This entails three people standing in a row, with the person in the middle acting as the spiritrsquos means of communication.When the spirit is asked a Yes No question, the piggy in the middle is expected to rock forwards for a lsquoYesrsquo and backwards for a lsquoNorsquo - a movement being directed by the answering spirit.One by one, the customers lined up to participate in this creepy experiment, watched by the rest of the room with a mixture of excitement and dread.Time and again, the spiritrsquos presence was well felt. In fact, there turned out to be a number of obliging spirits, each surprisingly keen to answer questions including, lsquoDo you have childrenrsquo  and lsquoAre you happy with us being herersquo As I watched this circus unfold, I was praying Irsquod be able to endure the entire episode as an observer, a witness to the craziness.Not so much because I was scared - although I was a little, I must admit - but more because I knew what would happen.,params: .pushldquoAndrew, would you like to have a shot in the middle What followed was several minutes of embarrassment for everyone.Because of course I didnrsquot move. Not even an inch. And the change in atmosphere was so marked that I genuinely wonderedmy trousers had somehow dropped to my ankles without my noticing.Thankfully, my clothes had remained bound to my body, but any faith I might have had in the ghost-hunting process was sliding away fast.As the tour continued, taking in several other locations promising ldquohigh activity, it became increasingly dficult to muster the energy to stay alert, with the clock ticking into the wee small hours.That said, there was one incident which aroused a certain degree of puzzlement - a maglite which appeared to flash when certain questions were posed.Admittedly, that was a curious development. But still not enough to push me into the camp of believers.The more I dwelt on the nightrsquos events, however, the more I came to realise the deeper signicance of it all.Before the tour, UK Ghost Nights founder Lisa Tedstill had made sure I was aware of the crucial equipment to bring.ldquoAll you need is a torch and a sense of humour, she said, going on to lay her finger on the true essence of the affair.ldquoWe donrsquot guarantee there will be any paranormal activity - anyone who does that is a charlatan.ldquoBut we can guarantee everybody will have a very fun experience.And, indeed, while I may have left the George  Abbotsford that night without a firmer belief in ghosts, I certainly ed home with a smile."},{"url":null,"title":"council-powers-handed-chief-meetings-scrapped","story":"PLANS to hand Scottish Borders Councilchief Tracey Logan delegated control of decision-making are expected to be rubber-stamped this week.It comes hot on the heels of Prime Minister Boris Johnsonrsquos instruction that everyone in the UK should spend most of their time at home in order to counter the coronavirus outbreak.But on Thursday , in an unprecedented move, proposals to temporarily delegate the local authorityrsquos decision-making responsibility to the Chief Executive will be passed.Council meetings in Newtown St Boswells will be cancelled until September , with the exception of vital committee meetings which will be done through video-conferencing.SBC chief legal officer Nuala McKinlay stated: ldquoAs the virus makes a wider impact on public le, Scottish Borders Council must consider how to respond.\"In taking any decision to protect health by limiting social contact, it must also ensure processes are in place to enable it to continue to make urgent decisions.ldquoIn order to allow decisions to be made, it is proposed that all those decision-making s of council which can lawfully be delegated, be delegated to the chief executive to be made in consultation with members and relevant senior officers.It is also proposed that any committee meetings which do need to take place between now and October will be held via remote video links.Ms McKinlay added: ldquoThe Local Government in Scotland Act  allows a local authority to y that process and conduct a meeting by other ways.

And the Bank of England has slashed interest rates to a new low, helping to reduce costs for some borrowers.Mr Donnell explained: ldquoLevels of property transactions are typically more volatile than changes in house prices.ldquoWe do not expect any immediate impact on prices.

Shersquos right, of course. We need such stories just now.My response was: ldquoYes, we all need to make our own version of Stone Soup.My youngest daughter overheard me. ldquoYuck, I donrsquot want that, I want porridge for breakfast like usual, she said.I reassured her and reminded her of the story. Itrsquos an old tale Irsquove shared in these pages before. It has many versions and I base the story in a land when there is a famine and people have very little food on which to survive, and so understandably people keep what little they have for their own use.But then a wise traveller fills his pot with water and begins to boil it over a fire. Then he adds a stone. People get curious and ask: ldquoWhat are you making  The traveller replies: ldquoStone soup.ldquoStone soup  Never heard of that.ldquoOh, itrsquos delicious and very filling.ldquoCould I try some ldquoOf course, but it would taste betteryou had something to add to it, says the traveller.And so as the story unfolds, each person adds a little to the pot, which means in the end the soup really is delicious and filling, and there is enough for all, because everyone has shared the little they have.But before they eat, the traveller does one last thing ndash takes out the stone!My daughter remembered the story and was reassured stone soup wasnrsquot on the breakfast menu. But I think the storyrsquos meaning has deeper signicance than just the sharing of food. Itrsquos also about the sharing of ourselves, and how adding a little bit of who we are can transform the pot of community.In the midst of all the fear and panic around us just now, this is what is happening. People are helping out, checking on neighbours and thinking how their own behaviour can affect others who are more vulnerable.And in all this, our mental wellbeing is as important as our physical health. Irsquom reminded of something my motherrsquos partner once told me. His name was Harry. He was originally from Holland and in his childhood he lived through the horric Dutch famine of -.He said: ldquoWe survived on rotten potato soup, tulip bulbs and a joke a day. Sometimes the jokes were as rotten as the potatoes but just as important!We need to smile, laugh and feel connected, especially in dficult times. We can all begin our own metaphorical stone soup and invite others to contribute and share.For example, many of my fellow storytellers are arranging online storytelling sessions. I will be telling stories online for the schools I currently work with and Irsquom happy to do likewise for any other organisation or group ndash once my six-year-old has taught me how the technology works!There are local musicians playing online gigs, people sharing recipes, visiting older family members outside their windows, writing letters and telephoning people for a chat the list goes on. One idea can lead to another, and soon a new community pot is made!Every contribution, no matter how seemingly small, can make a big dference to that pot. And in so doing, it will challenge that sense of despair and powerlessness that so many of us feel right now.So the question should be: Whatrsquos your thing  How can you safely share it  Whatrsquos your amusing or uplting story or your talent  Think about it and letrsquos share, for others, as well as ourselves.And so in the spirit of this, here is my wee contribution for this week itrsquos a funny wee tale passed onto me, so I claim no credit or originality for it. It was told to me by an Irish friend, but Irsquove adapted it slightly.There was this van driver called George who got a job delivering monkeys to the zoo. Unfortunately, his van broke down and while waiting for the mechanic the monkeys began to get restless.Then another van driver called Archie pulled up and askedhe could help.ldquoIrsquom late for my delivery. If I give you pound, will you take these monkeys to the zoo  asked George.ldquoSure, said Archie.So Archie took the monkeys away in his van.George waited for the mechanic and finally his van was repaired. He then set off for the zoo to make sure the monkeys were delivered successfully.But to his surprise, he saw Archie walking along the street with the monkeys!George called out to him: ldquoWhat are you doing  I gave you pound to take the monkeys to the zoo!Archie called back: ldquoI did, but we got a group discount, I have some money left, so now Irsquom taking them to the cinema!"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-residents-urged-keep-helping-east-lothian-foodbank","story":"The foodbank, based in Tranent, provides food parcels to vulnerable members of the community.Candace Higgins, foodbank director, said the situation was changing ldquohour by hour, adding: ldquoWe are still operating as normal but certain protocols have been put in place when delivering food parcels.Volunteers making deliveries are now simply knocking on doors or ringing bells, rather than waiting for doors to be opened to them.

This includes people over , as well as people with underlying conditions that could make the symptoms of coronavirus worse.Unfortunately for these people, self-isolation means not leaving your house - making going walks outside or meeting friends an impossibility. But the government does say people who are self-isolating can keep windows open to get fresh air.Whatrsquos social distancing The government is advising everyone who is not currently self-isolating to still practise social distancing.This means not meeting with friends and family, staying away from crowded areas, avoiding all non-essential travel, and working from home where possible.Luckily for these people, there is no restriction on going for walks outside.

At a crucial time in the survival of the language, graduates have helped create a Gaelic speaking workforce that now holds key posts across a wide range of sectors in Scotland.Sabhal Mograver Ostaig is one of the key partners in fulfilling the governmentrsquos objectives in the National Gaelic Plan, which aims to increase the number of people speaking the language and accelerate the growth of Gaelic.Many people are keen to learn more about the language because of its rich culture and the college provides a wide range of short courses in Gaelic language, song and traditional music. Ceilidhs, workshops, conversation circles and music sessions all create an encouraging atmosphere that bring together students from  countries across five continents.As a modern, innovative college, Sabhal Mograver Ostaig has excellent learning resources on campus including an exceptional library collection, residential student accommodation, broadcast and recording facilities and a Gaelic medium childcare facility on site. It also has a growing international reputation for academic research.The college was founded on the principle of being part of the local and wider community and its activities are greatly enhanced by co-operative links, being home to a number of signicant national creative and cultural projects such as Tobar an Dualchais, Ainmean Agraveite na h-Alba and Cagravenan Graphics Studio. It plays a leading role in the promotion of the Gaelic arts and culture and also offers an international exchange programme with universities in Canada and Ireland.The collegersquos graduates include Seumas Greumach , Chief Executive of An Comunn Gaidhealach, which runs the Royal National Mod, who studied the Cugraversa Comais in  and then ed for another year to study Cagravenan is Cultar na Gagraveidhlig.

The Nest is set in Monersquos hometown of Glasgow. While ostensibly a drama about surrogacy, it is really a tale of two cities, two Scotlands, the haves and the have nots.Property developer Dan and his musician we Emily , have everything, including a stunning lochside home, but not the child they long for.Kayahas a flat in Possil with barely a stick of furniture in it, and the kind of temper that sees her threaten to stab her case worker with a bottle.The opposites collide when Emily gets lost one night and hits -year-old Kaya with her car. So far, so Bonfire of the Vanities. The teen starts to work her way into the older womanrsquos le and, long story short, offers to be a surrogate infor pound,.Dan thinks this is a crazy idea, not to mention illegal. As does his sister, his lawyer, Emilyrsquos colleague, and probably every viewer watching. Many a drama would struggle to get beyond such a point, but the writer here is Nicole Taylor , who carefully takes each objection and picks away at it.: Susan Swarbrick meets Martin CompstonUltimately, the viewer has to believe that Emily is unhinged by grief, and that Dan would give in because he is desperate to keep her. Madness happens when people convince themselves a situation is all or nothing, black or white. That is how noir works.Even so, Taylorrsquos story is such a high-wire act that it needs to keep propelling itself onwards at speed or it will crash to the ground in a heap of improbabilities.Helping immensely with the task of keeping the viewer on side is a terric cast. Rundle is a convincing mix of fierce determination and eggshell fragility. Mack, a real find, does that bravest of things as an actor and makes herself an unlikeable pain in the neck.Then there is Compston. Once the prince of Sunday nights as Essex wide boy DS Arnott in Line of Duty, he is even better back on his home turf and in his own accent.It was a nice touch by Taylor to make Dan a bad boy made good, eventhe working class middle class contrast was laid on a a bit thick. Every time Kaya appeared the score would slip into menacing music mode, as though people who do not live in beautul lochside homes were naturally best avoided.What a house, mind. As in Guilt, Glasgow scrubbed up well. While The Nestrsquos location choices were more obvious ndash the Botanic Gardens, City Chambers, Kelvingrove Park ndash so far there is not a red sandstone tenement in sight.With four episodes to go, Taylorrsquos cleverly sleekit drama is shaping up nicely, playing on viewersrsquo assumptions. There is a cuckoo in the nest here, but who is it "},{"url":null,"title":"jeanne-freemans-coronavirus-advice-right---not-exceptional","story":"That, in order to effect real and vital change in the world, you could just sit on your behind, let your blubber settle and do absolutely diddly squat all.Imagine no longer! Your country needs you to be as lazy as humanly possible.Just... stay in your house. Covid- can only be quashedwe self-isolate and socially distance ourselves.And yet, and yet. People still seem incapable of taking the advice fully on board.At the weekend we saw city dwellers flocking to the countryside to take advantage of the lovely weather, and to hang with any germs they might be carrying with them to the remoter parts of the country.There were umpteen social media posts from those who just couldnt bear the pubs being shut on a Friday night and so went to hotels to drink at their bars, and never mind about the bar staff who had to serve them or the housekeeping staff who had to clean up after them.Snowdoniarsquos National Park Authority announced yesterday it has closed its main carparks ldquofollowing the busiest visitor weekend in living memory.The sunshine was part of the problem. Here weve been stuck indoors over a long and storm laden winter. Now, finally, the weather has turned and we had two beautul, crisp, sunny days to play with.Yet we werent meant to play with them. We were meant to stand at the window and gaze out at them, forlornly.The government advice is that a walk outside is good for you so, like others and understandably, I tried on Sunday to go for a walk. The park was hoaching with people and keeping a solid two metre distance was not possible so I ed home.Thats part of the problem with social distancing - it only workseveryone gets on board. If some of us are weaving about and leaping out of the way like Jumping Frenchmen of Maine while others wander blindly in our path, its not effective.The messages from the English and Scottish governments is also conflicting. Late on Saturday night - far too late - Boris Johnson advised that people should not visit their mums for Mothers Day. Stay put, he advised.Scotlands National Clinical Director Jason Leitch, who is excellent, calm, measured and clear, gave his three-step advice for Mothers Day. Dont visit, he said, or try to have a video all with mum. Butyou do visit then wash your hands, have mum wash her hands, and stay two metres away from each other.The upshot was everyone translating the advice dferently - some insisting you cant visit your mother at all, others saying it would be fine.On Friday night Mr Leitch appeared on BBC Scotlands The Nine and said visiting the hairdressers was fine, as salons tend to be one of the more sanitary places you can visit. On Monday Nicola Sturgeon said hair salons should close.The messaging is not straightforward. \"Social distancing\" is relatively meaningless. I saw a great tweet asking why the messaging isnt \"the two metre rule\" - much easier to grasp.What really is easy to grasp, though, is that we should stay at home unless for vital journeys or a bit of solo exercise. All  is paused for now.If you have symptoms and live with other people then  days at home and dont cross the doorstep. Ive come across people who have symptoms and are going out and about as usual. That is unconscionable. Why are they doing it  Because they dont think the rules apply to them and, while they have symptoms, they dont believe them to really be Covid-.Its really moot, for the purposes of the behaviour of the general public, whether its Covid- or not. This is not the time for self-diagnosis or taking chances because you believe yourself to be the exception to the rule.Jeane Freeman MSP put it beautully: \"You are neither an exception nor exceptional.\"This is not the time for bending the rules to suit your bespoke and special circumstances. This is the time for knuckling down and doing exactly whats asked. If you have symptoms and you go outside then your actions could be responsible for a death. Being stuck indoors when the sun is shining is rubbish. Is it worth making other people gravely ill The advice to just stay in your house is more dficult when you live with people you dont particularly like or you have flatmates who are a pain in the behind. Its frightening advice when you live with someone who is abusive.But for the majority of us it just means a prolonged spell of slight tedium, perhaps with some whining weans wed like a break from. In the absolute grand scheme of things, this is not a terrible situation to be in.Stay home and fewer people will die. Be a bit canny, protect your granny."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  To see middle-aged children laying down the law to their parents is yet another example of a world gone bananas","story":"She hadnrsquot even mentioned that she was intending to go forth and socialise, but they had guessed it was likely. Reluctantly she promised strictly to self-isolate, hence the call to cancel. In some ways I was relieved, because the responsibility had been gnawing at me. Bad enough to fall ill yourself, but a hundred times worseyou pass it on.As last week unfolded, with more stringent government warnings and edicts issued every day ndash sometimes every few hours ndash I heard of more and more instances like this. Children of elderly parents, and some who havenrsquot yet reached retirement age, were imploring, begging, and in some cases emotionally blackmailing them to heed medical advice and stay behind doors.My husband, who is -plus on the outside but at heart still at Newport when Dylan went electric, also came under fire.

Instead of catching the bus home, he had ed on foot over the hills, his backpack stuffed with goodies.His daughter knew better than to tackle him directly, so texted me instead. ldquoTell her not to worry, he replied. As reassurance goes, it lacked a certain rigour. How often have teenagers told their mum or dad ldquonot to worry when they were neglecting their homework, or spending the small hours who knows where, doing who knows what  Did that lower their blood pressure one iota Up and down the country, the tables have been turned. If this were the era of switchboards, operators could tap into millions of lines and hear the increasingly anxious voices of the middle-aged trying to get their stubborn and defensive old ones to see sense.The problem is, the over-seventies are exceptionally proud of retaining their independence. They bridle at any hint of being past it or not capable of looking after themselves. In normal circumstances this is a healthy mindset, fending off the reality of advancing years and the worry of one day becoming a burden. How many magazine features have you read reporting that  is the new , and weightlting and running are essential to stave off premature rigor mortis  Until the past fortnight, all those who remember rationingand were carrying on asthey were mere striplings were viewed as marvels and inspirations. Now, their gung-ho, can-do spirit has to be put on hold, forced into hibernation for however long this blight lasts. I donrsquot envy any son or daughter reminding their mother or father of their vulnerability, and urging them to take seriously the mortal threat that lies beyond the gate.To see children laying down the law is yet another example of a world gone bananas. You could call it pay-back. Did any of us manage to get through adolescence without coming under constant sniper attack  Most parents griped and girned until their hair turned grey. In our household you could set the clock by the raised voices chivvying us to get out to school, or turn down the radio, or help with the washing up. The small print of parent-child contracts includes the adultrsquos right to scold, ponticate and nag as often as required. Juniorrsquos side of the bargain makes no provision for reasoned argument, protest or rebellion. It states simply that they must unquestioningly obey, preferably for all time.The irony of policing onersquos parents behaviour doesnrsquot make this any easier. But perhaps therersquos a frisson of satisfaction in being able to exact revenge on those who spent the best years of their lives hectoring and carping. Could it feel like a righting of old wrongs to chastise dad for his recklessness, or ask a -year-old to grow up when she suggests an SAS-style dawn-raid on the supermarket It is especially satisfying, surely, that the role reversal necessary to reinforce these new rules is done in the name of commonsense and caring. When the point of the exercise is to protect the lives of those you love, in terms of moral high ground itrsquos up there with Macchu Pichu. What possible riposte can anyone give when urged to take precautions not just to safeguard yourself, but those closest to you Yet as most handbooks to raising a family suggest, nagging is futile. It sets up a vicious circle of resentment and rebellion, and makes the one being chastised feel sore. When people are lectured, they switch off, mentally reaching for the headphones until the tone of voice improves. Whether yoursquore  or , that never changes. So, as a mass technological revolution is rolled-out, with elderly luddites being all but forcibly initiated into the art of video calling, more trouble lies ahead.In an old-fashioned phone conversation, finger-wagging offspring canrsquot see their loved ones rolling their eyes, putting an invisible gun to their temples, or mouthing ldquoGive me a break!. But as soon as they can observe the impact their words are having itrsquoll be like travelling back in time. Theyrsquoll see these beloved faces taking on an unfamiliar juvenile expression: sullen irritation, avoidance of eye contact, nail-biting, fidgeting, a huffily shrugged shoulder.The longer these virus vigilantes bang on, the less response theyrsquoll get. The age-old aria between adult and adolescent is an unequal contest: a torrent of words in one corner, mutinous monosyllables in the other. I donrsquot doubt for a moment that most older folk will pay heed to their familyrsquos concerns.

Obviously the leak that was given to a single newspaper was designed to put things in that direction.In January , the Scottish Government insisted it had found no evidence of a data breach, and said its investigation had been ldquokept entirely confidential throughout.Mr Salmond then reported the matter to the ICO and asked it to investigate.An ICO spokeswoman said: ldquoAfter conducting thorough inquiries with the Scottish government, the ICO found no evidence that a third party or an employee from the Scottish government unlawfully obtained or disclosed personal data relating to Mr Alex Salmond.ldquoWe also found no evidence that Mr Salmondrsquos personal data was processed unfairly.\"However, during the course of our investigation, we identied some concerns in relation to the Scottish governmentrsquos data protection practices, and we have given them recommendations to improve their compliance with data protection law.\"This matter is now closed and we wonrsquot be taking further action.After the in-house investigation became public, Mr Salmond launched a successful judicial review at the Court of Session over the Governmentrsquos handling of it.SNP ministers were forced to admit that the probe had been flawed from the outset because the investigating official had been in prior contact with the complainers.This rendered the whole process unfair, unlawful and ldquotainted by apparent bias.The cost to taxpayers in legal fees for both sides was around poundm.Mr Salmondrsquos defence team had wanted to present evidencethat this ldquoshambles had spurred effortswithin government to discredit Mr Salmond.However Judge Lady Dorrian did not allow most of it in case the trial strayed off course.Some of Mr Salmondrsquos supporters have suggested he was the victim of a conspiracy embracing the state and the SNP.A Scottish Government spokesman said of the ICO ruling: ldquoWe note the Information Commissionerrsquos findings."},{"url":null,"title":"half-uk-population-may-caught-coronavirus-scientists-claim","story":"Academics from the University of Oxford suggested the epidemic began in Britain and Italy at least a month before the first reported death.If this turns out to be true, then both nations will have already built up \"signicant levels of herd immunity\", researchers wrote in their report.The study has not yet been peer-reviewed.

Mail is still scheduled to be collected and delivered as normal.#This is a fast-moving situation and local service levels may at times be impacted by local absences.#Mr O’Riordain explained that Royal Mail takes the health and safety of its colleagues, its customers and the local communities in which it operates very seriously.#From today we have introduced a range of new social distancing measures aimed at offering further protection for our colleagues,# he said.#Standard ways of working are being revised to ensure that, wherever possible, colleagues stay two metres apart. We are implementing a new rule that means there will only be one person in a Royal Mail delivery vehicle at any one time.#Processes have been further reviewed to minimise the passing of work between colleagues. And we are calling for the washing of hands when colleagues enter and leave Royal Mail buildings, as well as at regular times during the day.#In order to protect further both staff and customers, Royal Mail has said it will not be handing over hand-held devices to customers to capture signatures during signed deliveries. Postal workers will instead log the name of the person accepting the item, and can sign on their behalf.The managing director added: #For all customerswhere we need to deliver any parcel that won’t fit through their letterbox, we will place their item at their door.#Having knocked on the door, we will then step aside to a safe distance while they retrieve their item. This will ensure the item is delivered securely rather than being left outside.“If they are unable to come to the door at all we will issue a #something for you# card, advising of other ways they can arrange to get their item.#For example, by getting a friend or family member to collect the parcel from our local customer service point on their behalf. In this situation, and to keep their mail as secure as possible, they will need to bring along the card we left and a form of ID in the name of the person the item is addressed to.#In line with guidance from the UK#s chief medical officer and public health authorities, Royal Mail is also advising colleagues that good hand hygiene is the first and most important line of defence.“We continue to act on public health authority advice which is updated daily,#  explained Mr O’Riordain.#In the meantime we share regular updates and information with colleagues. We have also adopted enhanced disinfectant cleaning of communal areas in all Royal Mail sites on a daily basis. We are monitoring the situation closely.“Public health authorities have advised people receiving parcels are not at risk of contracting coronavirus. From experience with other coronaviruses, we know that these types of viruses don’t survive long on objects, such as letters or parcels. This complements the highly publicised guidance from public health authorities for people to wash their hands more often than usual using soap and hot water.“These actions form part of a package of measures being taken by Royal Mail to protect both its customers and its colleagues”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

And the Bank of England has slashed interest rates to a new low, helping to reduce costs for some borrowers.Mr Donnell explained: ldquoLevels of property transactions are typically more volatile than changes in house prices.ldquoWe do not expect any immediate impact on prices. Beyond this, the outlook for house prices largely depends upon how the Governmentrsquos major package of support for business and households reduces the scale of the economic impact.ldquoLow mortgage rates mean forbearance will remain the preferred choice for lenders, but further Government support in these unique times cannot be ruled out.Looking further ahead, Mr Donnell said: ldquoThe timing of any rebound in housing market activity depends upon when new restrictions are lted, and the extent to which households and businesses are able toto a normal way of le.ldquoBrowsing for homes online is set to continue and, while demand for property may rebound quickly, it will take several months for agents to rebuild new business pipelines.copy -.

What is alarming is how little challenge there has been to our government#s decision to take a dferent path from that recommended by the World Health Organisation . Shetland, Scotland and the UK is out of synch with almost everywhere  in how we are trying to tackle this coronavirus. We are not #following the science#, as ‘experts’ and politicians of ious colours frequently suggest. The scientic community is itself ided over this issue and we are following a particular reading of the science.WHO’s consistent advice has been to test, track and trace every suspected case of coronavirus. The overwhelming majority of countries are taking this approach. The UK Scientic Advisory Group For Emergencies , the body advising our politicians, do not believe we can contain the virus using the WHO#s methodology, so our government has allowed the virus to spread, while attempting to control itin a manner that doesn#t put excessive pressure on the NHS at any particular point during the outbreak.My opinion is worth little on this matter # but the fact the UK is taking a dferent approach concerns me, given the WHO#s history in dealing with virus outbreaks such as this. What disturbs me is the apparent lack of awareness about UK exceptionalism on this issue. We must come together to overcome this problem but people will only buy into a collective effortthey have at least a basic understanding of what we are trying to do and why. #We know best # trust us# will not do. Scrutiny, questions and critique are vital when there is still much to learn and so much is at stake. You are not an idiot. Please don#t let name calling, or whatever, put you off getting better informed about this most crucial of matters.At last count  out of the  countries that presently exist have recorded cases#.How do you know who is taking exactly what advice, how many tests are being done or how those governments rhetoric dfers from the actual reality  We have much ignorance and  information in the media, and as always the headless-chicken doom-merchants tell fake tails of doom. Only yesterday a self-ordained fitness person Facebooked about a boy trapped with the corpse of his sister for three days. The actual truth no otherwise healthy child has died worldwide of Covid, not one ever. The boy was a man, the sister was  and died of status epilepticus! Just what possesses people to peddle such tripe is beyond comprehension, but the online media is awash with it.I don#t think anybody knows which governments are taking exactly what advice, how many tests are being done by every one of them or how their rhetoric dfers from the actual reality. I certainly don#t know and never claimed I did. I said the majority of countries are adopting the WHO approach, successfully or otherwise.I appreciateisn#t gospel and apologiseyou, or anybody , has evidence contrary to what they have stated.Time will tell whether this alternative approach has been for better or worse.Ian T # South Korea has followed WHO guidelines, testing more people per capita than anywhere , and the number of new cases there has dropped drastically.The country recorded  new cases of Covid- yesterday, compared with a peak of  cases on February th.I understand there is every chance the virus will spread again in South Koreaonce social contact restrictions are lted, but at the very least their efforts to contain the spread has bought them more time.More time to make sure their NHS and other essential services are prepared as well as possible. More time to acquire testing capability. More time to shield those most at risk from the virus as best as possible.You claim the WHO approach has been unsuccessful. South Korea adopted it and has had more success fighting this virus than anywhere .I appreciate what works in one country may not work where. What concerns me is our governmentshave paid little heed to the likes of South Korea and taken a path at odds with almost everywhere .A failure to adequately explain why has induced panic as much as anything . Now the UK resources are going into the new antibody test. That tells us who is immune, a far far more useful thing to know.You said earlier in this thread: #We have much ignorance and  information in the media.# I suggest you focus on getting your facts right before you start bashingor the press at large. Unless of course you have abandoned the truth and decided to take the path of the most habitual of liars Donald Trump  In which case I#d have more success debating this issuewith a brick!Now stop panicking and do like me. I have volunteered to come out of retirement and rejoin the NHS. I am qualied to help and will do so without questionI can. Now just stop your moaning, spreading of alarmist criticism and postulating about something you know little. Nothing is much worse than raising fear and alarm when one is not remotely qualied so to do.For heaven#s sake Helen, we have gone beyond our capacity to trace, let alone test. Whatever did you write your PhD thesis in, headlesschikenology or alarmistscarmongology !Faroes which have fixed links between the islands have  times as many cases as Shetland. May just be coincidence but i would have thought that fixed links help spread disease more quickly.Yes Ian, a car in a tunnel does go a little bit faster than a ferry. So the spread by fixed link will perhaps be accelerated by a few minutes. Now, what probably makes more sense is that Faroe has a population of , rather more than  times that of Shetland., proportionally per head of population,Faroe, fixed links and all is doing rather better than us!!!Ian T.I think you may have accidently hit an extra  there # The current population of the Faroe Islands is c. , Ian, Faroe had a population of , as of June  . Unlike Shetland they are almost certainly testing for Covid- more widely in the community, so it is not possible to directly compare our current figure of  hospital tested cases to their .Whoops, no. I gave the population of Faro!! Portugal!!! Dyslexia rules OK!!!!Just to state the obvious. If you are afraid for yourself,relatives and loved ones. All you have to do is stay inside your house. It is as simple as that.This Virus can not get to youyou do that simple thing. It is not rocket science!!!Yes it can, via an envelope retrieved from a mailbox, groceries and any other items brought into your home that have been handled by other people.There are some strategies you may employ to minimize risk of contamination.Wear disposable gloves when retrieving mail, disinfect the mail before bringing it into your house.Junk mail should go directly from the mailbox to the bin. Retrieve mail only every two to three days to minimize exposure.As to groceries, avoid fresh produce.Wear disposable gloves when shopping.Only buy canned or frozen items and sanitize them before putting into storage.Ideally, buy enough that you can rotate the stock.Use only grocery items, canned or frozen that have been in your possession for  days or more.On the other handyou literally stay in your house and not opened the door to anyone or thing, for the next month or two, or three, or four# the virus probably will not be able to get to you.

In good old Ballymena terms they dont know whether to laugh or cry.At thisearly stage, you can still see people sharing a joke about the hot topics of the day .. where the new hand sanitisers can be found or who has the new supply of paracetemol.But there are also reports, as you can see by the letter at the bottom of this page, of bad tempers and selfishness.When such behaviour affects medical and pharmacy it really hits a nerve but let us not forget the staff working in retail outkets - especially in the grocery sector - who are also dealing with an increased level of ‘thran-ness’.Social media is awash with tales of bad behaviour and that has to stopwe are to get through the next few weeks .. and months .. in half decent shape as a society.I liked the comment from Ballymena woman Jackie Neill who had just ed from a supermarket visit.She said: “Just been to Lidl in Ballymena at am this morning. Met at the door by a very pleasant security man who was informing younger shoppers that the shop was closed til . Got all I needed - I refuse to stockpile! Thank you Lidl and your ever so lovely security officer!” Be kind was the watchword a few weeks ago and there has never been a better time to show consideration for others than right now.

We watched as petrol bombs were made on a makefht production line and stored behind the barricade at the top of Ramoan Gardens. Young as we were, we knew that this was an epoch-making time.My most vivid memory from those franticfew days in August is of Patcheye Doyle standing on the roof of a Morris  which was caving in under his weight. His one eye dancing, he was roaring at a gathering of local men, urging them to get organised before the next onslaught. A fearsome and fearless scrapper of some reknown, Patcheye took the lead while others dithered. He was a hard man, in a time when that epithet was more than a throwaway schoolyard taunt.And of course, there was real fear abroad. There were no weapons to hold off an invasion, no police force to turn to for protection.And yet, the people did pull together defences, after a fashion. Barricades went up, British Army ‘ex-servies’ patrolled the streets and the people turned to each other for support and comfort.Mistakes were made too in the maelstrom. Some concerned matters of le and death, others were less consequential but remain with me: I remember the proud pine trees on the Glen Road being cut down to block the road. You can still seethe gaps where they once stood – and where their more fortunate cousins continue to watch over us.And, yet,we survived. Not in one piece, admittedly. But we emerged on the other side. Changed for sure, stronger undoubtedly but also scarred.And so what I can retrieve from thoseall-but forgotten memories of the heady days of August ’ to help us as we march headlong into this coming Cornavirus hurricane  Well, put up the barricades. Protect your neighbour. Gear up for the fight.But most of all, listen to the key men and women – those selfless heroes who we will find today not on car roofs but in the hospital emergency rooms and the Intensive Care Units. They have given us fair warning: keep your distance, isolate and defend the elderly, wash your hands and, above all , stay at home.I can put it no better than in the words of a -year-old paper boy who arrived, complete with surgical gloves, to the Andersonstown News offices last week insisting that he be allowed to do his door-to-doorpaper round — which we had cancelled in light of the crisis. Pointinga gloved finger at me, he said, “I will knock the f*** out of this Coronavirus.” Patcheye must be smiling down.Today it’s not Shankill against Falls or unionist versus nationalist. It’s all of us, one people, one city, and one battle which we cannot and which we most certainlyWILL NOTlose."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus decision on northern ireland schools staying open for easter yet to be taken","story":"Concerned: Justin McCamphill FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappConcerned: Justin McCamphillBy Claire WilliamsonMarch   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailWhether or not schools remain open for key workers# children during the Easter holidays remains under consideration, the Department of Education has said.Almost  schools stayed open on Monday and nearly  will be open by the end of the week, according to Education Minister Peter Weir.The NASUWT, Northern Ireland#s biggest teachers# union, said it was unaware of plans directing schools to remain open over the holidays.It added it would not agree with teachers having to work.Northern Ireland national officer Justin McCamphill said: During the period of continued closures, some schools may seek to provide childcare to priority households outside of term time .

This should be done alone, unless it is with members of your household.If you provide care or help to a vulnerable person you will also be able to leave home for this purpose.If you are a “key worker”, such as a police officer or nurse, and your child children are attending school, you will be able to dropped them off and pick them up.Q. The UK Government says I must only travel to and from work“absolutely necessary” - how do I knowit is “absolutely necessary” A. All those who are able to work from home have been advised to do so, however for many jobs this is not possible. Those providing essential services or goods will still be able to travel to and from work. Social distancing rules, however, should still be enforced. This means you should stay at least two metres apart from anyone and work gatherings should not take place.Q. Will the children of orced parents be able to visit both of them A. Cabinet minister the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove has confirmed that children under  can move between the households of separated parents, as long as this is normal practice.Q. Can I attend any outside events A. All social events, such as weddings or baptisms, cannot go ahead. Funerals are permitted with only immediate family members in attendance. All social gatherings of more than two people are prohibited.Q. What businesses are allowed to remain open A. Only businesses providing essential goods or services are permitted to stay open. In the food and drink industry, this includes restaurants operating takeaway or delivery services and canteens at hospitals, care homes, schools and prisons.Facilities offering food or drink to the homeless are also permitted.All retail shops should shut, except for supermarkets and other food shops, pharmacies, petrol stations, hardware shops and laundrettes.Pet shops, newsagents and banks can also remain open.Here#s the full list of essential retail services which should continue to trade in Northern Ireland:Supermarkets , convenience stores and corner shopsGrocery markets – not including farmers markets, hot food markets or street food marketsLocal fresh food suppliers like butchers, fishmongers and bakeriesHot food takeaways - over the counter services only and not allowing an option to eat inPharmacies Chemists and Health food shopsDental surgeries, opticians, audiology, physiotherapy, chiropody and other professional vocational medical services – for urgent appointments onlyVeterinary clinics and pet shopsNewsagentsHardware and building supplies storesRetail services in hospitalsPetrol stations, garages, and auto repair shops for urgent work onlyHigh street banks, credit unions and cash pointsPost officesFuneral directors, crematoriums and relatedLaundrettes and dry cleanersStorage and distribution facilities, including delivery drop-off pointsMedical or storage servicesPublic car parks in towns and cities near food takeaway servicesPublic toilets.Businesses that are permitted to stay open have been asked to ensure a distance of two meters is kept between customers and shop assistants, to only let people enter in small groups, and to introduce queue control measures outside the premises.Hotels, hostels and BBs can only remain open for those guests staying while their primary residence is unavailable. Key workers can also continue to stay at such accommodation.Manufacturing and construction firms can continue to operate as long as they enforce social distancing. Ministers say this will be kept under review.Q. What should I domy business is not on the list of essential services A.

Weddings and baptisms should be postponed. If clergy want to live-stream for church services, they are free to do soAll indoor recreation sites such as bowling alleys, arcades, soft play areasEnclosed spaces in public parks such as playgrounds, tennis courts and outdoor gyms.Q. How will these measures be enforced A. Police will have the power to disperse public gatherings and issue fines, however it is unclear how officers will monitor whether people are breaking the rules, what action will then be taken, and how much the fines will be.Environmental Health and Trading Standards officers will enforce the rules regarding businesses. Those found to be breaking the rules can be subject to prohibition notices and potentially unlimited fines.Q. How long will the restrictions be in place for A. The restrictions will be in place for at least three weeks, at which time they will be reviewed. At this stage they could be relaxed or tightened.Many have speculated that the restrictions will be in force for longer than three weeks, such as First Minister Arlene Foster.“If I was a betting person, I would say it would continue long after three weeks. It is right we review what are quite draconian measures. But I would imagine it will last longer than three weeks,” she said.Belfast Related ContentVideoCoronavirusCoronavirus: It#s for the best, says Foster as she welcomes Prime Minister#s move to place UK on lockdownArlene Foster has welcomed Boris Johnson#s announcement of draconian new restrictions on everyday le in a bid to tackle the spread of coronavirus.Lindy McDowellOpinionLindy McDowell:Enormity of coronavirus crisis we face is laid bare on day of raw emotion in the AssemblyThese are the choices we are going to have to deal with...

Kitchens, dining rooms and living rooms are now temporary classrooms - with schedules being drawn up and pinned to fridges, full of plans for numeracy, literacy, arts and crafts and PE lessons.

This morning we did PE with Joe Wicks, then after that it was academic work. “The school has been really good and sent us home worksheets, so we’ve been doing those and each day we pick something dferent.“We were doing numbers with my youngest on the fridge with number magnets and we were putting them in order and working out sequences.“With my eldest daughter we have been doing times-tables and she has an advanced reading book, and I let her read a chapter or two.”Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseIvana reading FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappIvana readingAt lunchtime they got to catch up with friends, as they would in the playground, only now it’s via video calls.After that they were planning some creative time with musical instruments or baking. Pete said: “It’s really dficult for everyone. But what we don’t want is for this period of time to be a moment that the children look back and think it was really bad for them. So we are trying to keep a bit of academic work going and teach them as much as we can, but have as much fun as we can.“We are hopefully going to instigate a few chores, that is easier said than done.”Pete also called for anyone who has come up with a good homeschooling technique to share it with him and he’ll share it on air.“At this stage, it’s all about trying to help each other out in whatever way we possibly can.”Belfast author and playwright Leesa Harker is also at the helm of the home classroom with her two daughters Lolaand Lexi .Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseLeesa Harker FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappLeesa HarkerLeesa loves learning, andanything, she thinks it will be her children asking her for a break.

They will need some sort of timetable and structure throughout the day.It’s also important that they have time for rest and family le, time to maybe go outside and it’s very important that they#re not overloaded with work.As a teacher, I’m going to make sure that my classes have got work in little chunks and that the teaching will continue in the amount of time that they would usually have at school.Be flexibleYou have to be flexible with the amount of time that children spend doing school work. Some households will maybe have three or four children using one computer, so it’s important that it’s broken up into easy chunks. There are so many dferent things that can children can do. They can read a book, they can do things about the house, get some exercise outside, but it is important that they keep focused and do the lessons that teachers are setting online.Use time off school wiselyWe can use this time as an opportunity. It’s important for family time. It’s maybe important that children know how to cook, or that they do a bit of exercise. There’s so many things parents can do - it’s not just about the school work.#Use all available resourcesBBC Bitesize is brilliant for Key Stage  and Key Stage . There’s also so many things available through the library service librariesni.org.uk where you can download so many books.Many schools already have resources online through the Fronter service, through My-School, through Google Drive and through homework apps. This is a time of opportunity. There are many companies putting things online for children to access for free which you can find on Google.Don#t put too much pressure on yourselfI think we have to be realistic. The school year is usually about  weeks long, so the next few weeks will be very challenging but that’s a very small amount of the entire year, so it’s just important that we can keep the children focused on as much work as they can.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I knew every song, she laughs, taking a drag of her vape.The teacher told me to go and get my book. I said, I dont need it and she said, Go and get your book and I said, Shove it up your arse.She came back looking for me, but I never went back.Derry was always going to be too small for Noella and at  she headed to London with her guitar on her back and gigs with the likes of Van Morrison already under her belt.There was nothing here in , she says.I would have done anything to escape.Not long after she arrived, The NoellaHuttonBand landed a residency at Madame JoJos, a legendary Soho strip club frequented by actors and popstars.Youd have people like Robbie Williams, theyd all come in there mincing about, says Noella.Before we went on wed be sitting in the green room with two totally naked strippers.But it was just normal. It wasnt a big deal. It was just work and they were so professional.Mariah Carey came in one night and she tried to move my friends from the front seats and I said, Naw, thats my friends there.She asked meI had a demo and I said naw. Honestly, I just didnt want to give her anything, she smiles.Boy George was another regular and after watching her play, he asked her to sign to his label More Protein.He said to me, No one has ever scared me before, but you scare me, she recalls.So, you signed with Boy George Naw.One of things he said to me was, So, youre a big dyke then That got my back up right away. I said George, my sexuality has got f**k all to do with what I am.Its such a small, small part of who I am.And its really nobodys business. It wasnt because I was ashamed, I just thought, Im not going to ride on the back of that honey.If he hadnthave said that, who knows  But it just wasnt meant for me.The pair still hit it off and Noella sang with Boy George at a string of gigs in Shepherds Bush Empire, dueting on a punk version of Karma Chameleon.They also enjoyed wild nights out together, where people used to confuse them for brother and sister.He was a good guy - very intelligent.And he loved me and he was so proud of me.Noella was having the time of her le, singing at Paul OGradys thbut still working at Camden Market on the weekends to make ends meet.She was hanging out with the likes of Oasis, Paula Yates and Michael Hutchence and the buzz around her was starting to grow.Then she got the call that would change her le.It was from the head of Radioactive Records who had signed the likes of Garbage and Debbie Harry.He asked me how much I wanted, I could barely afford to make it to the bus stop, she laughs.Radioactive asked Noella who she wanted to produce her album and she chooseJerry Harrison of Talking Heads, who had just produced for the American rock band Lives album Throwing Copper.The label flew her to LA to record it and soon she was living the American dream with a substantial advance and her own cab driver who was on call around the clock.I was just happy to be able to do stuff for people, she says.Sure whats the point of having money  You cant take it with you.Noella released her self titled album NoellaHutton in , toured extensively in the States and was put up in the likes of New Yorks Cha Hotel.I slept the best I ever have in my le when I was in New York, she says.It was just the characters. Everything.I felt at home there.Her husky, soulful voice was also in hot demand commercially and featured in ads for Lexus, Nike, Coca-Cola and Toyota.In  Noella played to , people at Canadian singer Sarah McLachlans Lilith Fair where she shared the stage with Nelly Furtado and Christina Aguilera.We had to do a press conference with Sky News, I just kept thinking Im a wee girl from Derry.Despite reaching such dizzying heights, very few back home knew was happening.I never told anybody, I just didnt think it was important, she says candidly.I dont think Im anything special, do you know what I mean I was just writing and playing and having a wee laugh. Thats very important. Youre only here for a wee while.Fame never interested me. It was terrying.I knew too many people who were miserable and had no le.I had too much badness to get up to.And what a le Noella was having. She was dating Taryn Manningand her album was No  on the playlist of the Virgin record store in Hollywood.She was living the kind of le most of us can only dream of, but her mental health was suffering and in  Noella suffered a complete nervous breakdown.Everything just crashed in my head at the one time, she says with characteristic frankness.It all closed in at the one time.I had just been putting it off my whole le.Everything that had went on reared its head.Id had a breakdown in London too, but this was on a dferent scale.It was just trauma. You think youve dealt with certain things. But naw, you havent.Im amazed that Im still here to be honest.Noellas sister, JeanetteHutton, brought her back to Derry, where she worked very hard to get better with the help of Gransha Hospital and the support of her family.A couple of years later she met American singer songwriter and producer Justin Black, who had her album as a teenager growing up in Arkansas.He said my album inspired him to play the guitar, she laughs.He didnt even know I was Irish.She also formed the band Blood with her sister Jeanette and brother-in-law Ruairi ODoherty and two years ago they released an album of the same name.Shes the eldest girl in the family and Im the youngest and all we do is laugh at stupid sh***, said Noella.Shes so loved. Shes brilliant. Shes my hero.In recent years Noella has also channelled her energy into animal rescue charity Friends of Rescue founded by her best friend Suzanne Fleming.Together with Suzanne, Keith Rutherford and Carly Russell, Noella helps rescue and rehome neglected and abused animals.The day before yesterday we rescued  dogs, she said.Its the most rewarding, heartbreaking, devastating, incredible all-encompassing thing.Im fearless when it comes to the well being of animals, children or old people.Noella is now sponsored by world-renowned bespoke guitar makers Emerald Guitars, who are based in St Johnston.Justin persuaded her to record her recently released solo album Love and Liars which deserves to be heard on the world stage, but Noella has no plans for a big tour.Ive honestly never made a plan in my le, she says.I dont believe in forcing squaresinto circles, do you know what I mean Its something that has to happenorganically, naturally.And this feels right at the minute.To find out more about Noella, visit her Facebook page The First Noella.Her music is available at noellahutton.bandcampA documentary about Noellas le, The First Noella, made by Justin Black is now available on YouTube.If you would like to support Friends of Rescue you can find them at Friends of Rescue Ireland on Facebook.For more information on Emerald Guitars visitwww.emeraldguitars googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I said, I dont need it and she said, Go and get your book and I said, Shove it up your arse.She came back looking for me, but I never went back.Derry was always going to be too small for Noella and at  she headed to London with her guitar on her back and gigs with the likes of Van Morrison already under her belt.There was nothing here in , she says.I would have done anything to escape.Not long after she arrived, The NoellaHuttonBand landed a residency at Madame JoJos, a legendary Soho strip club frequented by actors and popstars.Youd have people like Robbie Williams, theyd all come in there mincing about, says Noella.Before we went on wed be sitting in the green room with two totally naked strippers.But it was just normal. It wasnt a big deal. It was just work and they were so professional.Mariah Carey came in one night and she tried to move my friends from the front seats and I said, Naw, thats my friends there.She asked meI had a demo and I said naw. Honestly, I just didnt want to give her anything, she smiles.Boy George was another regular and after watching her play, he asked her to sign to his label More Protein.He said to me, No one has ever scared me before, but you scare me, she recalls.So, you signed with Boy George Naw.One of things he said to me was, So, youre a big dyke then That got my back up right away. I said George, my sexuality has got f**k all to do with what I am.Its such a small, small part of who I am.And its really nobodys business. It wasnt because I was ashamed, I just thought, Im not going to ride on the back of that honey.If he hadnthave said that, who knows  But it just wasnt meant for me.The pair still hit it off and Noella sang with Boy George at a string of gigs in Shepherds Bush Empire, dueting on a punk version of Karma Chameleon.They also enjoyed wild nights out together, where people used to confuse them for brother and sister.He was a good guy - very intelligent.And he loved me and he was so proud of me.Noella was having the time of her le, singing at Paul OGradys thbut still working at Camden Market on the weekends to make ends meet.She was hanging out with the likes of Oasis, Paula Yates and Michael Hutchence and the buzz around her was starting to grow.Then she got the call that would change her le.It was from the head of Radioactive Records who had signed the likes of Garbage and Debbie Harry.He asked me how much I wanted, I could barely afford to make it to the bus stop, she laughs.Radioactive asked Noella who she wanted to produce her album and she chooseJerry Harrison of Talking Heads, who had just produced for the American rock band Lives album Throwing Copper.The label flew her to LA to record it and soon she was living the American dream with a substantial advance and her own cab driver who was on call around the clock.I was just happy to be able to do stuff for people, she says.Sure whats the point of having money  You cant take it with you.Noella released her self titled album NoellaHutton in , toured extensively in the States and was put up in the likes of New Yorks Cha Hotel.I slept the best I ever have in my le when I was in New York, she says.It was just the characters. Everything.I felt at home there.Her husky, soulful voice was also in hot demand commercially and featured in ads for Lexus, Nike, Coca-Cola and Toyota.In  Noella played to , people at Canadian singer Sarah McLachlans Lilith Fair where she shared the stage with Nelly Furtado and Christina Aguilera.We had to do a press conference with Sky News, I just kept thinking Im a wee girl from Derry.Despite reaching such dizzying heights, very few back home knew was happening.I never told anybody, I just didnt think it was important, she says candidly.I dont think Im anything special, do you know what I mean I was just writing and playing and having a wee laugh. Thats very important. Youre only here for a wee while.Fame never interested me. It was terrying.I knew too many people who were miserable and had no le.I had too much badness to get up to.And what a le Noella was having. She was dating Taryn Manningand her album was No  on the playlist of the Virgin record store in Hollywood.She was living the kind of le most of us can only dream of, but her mental health was suffering and in  Noella suffered a complete nervous breakdown.Everything just crashed in my head at the one time, she says with characteristic frankness.It all closed in at the one time.I had just been putting it off my whole le.Everything that had went on reared its head.Id had a breakdown in London too, but this was on a dferent scale.It was just trauma. You think youve dealt with certain things. But naw, you havent.Im amazed that Im still here to be honest.Noellas sister, JeanetteHutton, brought her back to Derry, where she worked very hard to get better with the help of Gransha Hospital and the support of her family.A couple of years later she met American singer songwriter and producer Justin Black, who had her album as a teenager growing up in Arkansas.He said my album inspired him to play the guitar, she laughs.He didnt even know I was Irish.She also formed the band Blood with her sister Jeanette and brother-in-law Ruairi ODoherty and two years ago they released an album of the same name.Shes the eldest girl in the family and Im the youngest and all we do is laugh at stupid sh***, said Noella.Shes so loved. Shes brilliant. Shes my hero.In recent years Noella has also channelled her energy into animal rescue charity Friends of Rescue founded by her best friend Suzanne Fleming.Together with Suzanne, Keith Rutherford and Carly Russell, Noella helps rescue and rehome neglected and abused animals.The day before yesterday we rescued  dogs, she said.Its the most rewarding, heartbreaking, devastating, incredible all-encompassing thing.Im fearless when it comes to the well being of animals, children or old people.Noella is now sponsored by world-renowned bespoke guitar makers Emerald Guitars, who are based in St Johnston.Justin persuaded her to record her recently released solo album Love and Liars which deserves to be heard on the world stage, but Noella has no plans for a big tour.Ive honestly never made a plan in my le, she says.I dont believe in forcing squaresinto circles, do you know what I mean Its something that has to happenorganically, naturally.And this feels right at the minute.To find out more about Noella, visit her Facebook page The First Noella.Her music is available at noellahutton.bandcampA documentary about Noellas le, The First Noella, made by Justin Black is now available on YouTube.If you would like to support Friends of Rescue you can find them at Friends of Rescue Ireland on Facebook.For more information on Emerald Guitars visitwww.emeraldguitars googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

At Home … We all love being at home, love the homes we have made, love being with our children and families.But to be restricted to being at home can be dficult, to be advised to stay at home and have our normal routine change can be stressful as we wonder how best to manage and live as normal.So here are a few ideas to help keep you sane, to still enjoy your days and be positive …Working at home  Is dficult at the best of times as the washing calls to be put on the line, the dog looks adoringly at you for a walk, the sun and garden beckon etc.But now with your children off too it’s about to get even harder, with demands for play, shouts of I’m bored, he took my doll, she keeps standing in front of the TV.So why not set up a new routine, plan your day to incorporate activities with the children and work time too.Yes you may have to work later than . pm as you’ll be doing less during usual office hours but at least you will get work done.Do explain that you do have to work, and then try activities with them for an hour and then work for an hour, or set up tasks and play activities they can do themselves play dough, creation station, jigsaws, a video about the natural world etc.If you have little ones at home, those under three years, it’s even harder but maybe your teenagers could help If not then you’ll have to adapt the routine to maybe work for half an hour and then play, or set up a play stationnext to you and you can work together.If you have a partner at home maybe you could set up an office in the bedroom or dining room and take it in turns to work and play  Many schools and nurseries have provided work packs for your children to do.Don’t be tempted to rush through these all in one go, do what their teacher suggests.There are many websites who have learning resources you can access too such as The National Literacy Trust’s Family Zone or Twinklwho have a parents page full of resources for those with children aged from birth.I’ll be sharing lots of the ideas and links from these two sites plus more on my Facebook pageas too much information and too many ideas can be overwhelming!Stock Up, forget the toilet roll and tins!Stock up on glue, crayons, pencils, paint, paper , colouring or activity books and real books too, card, sequins and glitter , flour, salt, food colouring, cake making ingredients, bubbles, cornflour for gloop, jelly for jelly play, bag of sand etc!I know most of us already have a Facebook page and use Whats App but do your parents and their friends I know my mum would be ‘gulp’ why do I need them.But these social media sites will ensure that we are all able to keep in touch with each other, that your Mum and mine will be able to see, her Bowling Buddies, your Mums Knit  Natter friends and this ‘keeping in touch’ will be so very importantthey, and we, can’t go out.So do take the time to teach them and their friends as well, maybe consider too using and showing them how to use Skype or Face Time - it’s great to talk but even better to talk and see each other too!Busy, wondering how exactly you are going to keep busy stuck in the house all day Do the ‘jobs’ you’ve been putting off for the past few years!Plan to decorate, spring clean, learn to sew or knitbuild a pond, sort out the garden or, like me get ready to paint your shed yellow!Can you help anyone  An elderly neighbour, the new mum next door, the single dad who has to work in the hospital, the old lady down the road who now can’t walk her dog, the food bank delivery service  It’s greatyou can, just remember though to protect yourself and your family. Invest in two or three garden chairs or benches, old or new it doesn’t matter, pop them by your fences so you and your neighbours can talk to each other! Talk, Sing, Read And Play with your children every day - with all this time at home there’s no excuse not to! googletag.cmd.push Written by, on Facebook, Me  You @meandyoubyjenni to support the Greater Shantallow Talking To Our Babies, Greater Shantallow Area Partnership.

The canary was sent down the mineshaft and didn’t . googletag.cmd.push It was a shockingly sudden and complete disappearance.  PICTURED:Daniel and King Henry  We’re all now sat six feet apart at the sporting wakenot quite at the funeral yet. Sport, all sports, build strong social bonds. Friendships, networks. Shared interests, hopes, dreams, disappointments. Togetherness. None of us are getting out of here alive. And the ability to enjoy the triviality of sport is often a welcome distraction from le’s deathly inevitability. The Doherty males are very much traditional men. We still ask for a bar of Marathon, never Snickers. Muhammad Ali will always be Cassius Clay. And, to a man, we still refer to the Waterfoot Hotel as the Blue Tit. And other than running around the house wearing Seagate outfits these days, the skin near washed off our hands, we’re taking things very much in our stride. But we’re simple folk, and we love sport. The first confirmed sighting of cabin fever in Derry arrived at Doherty Towers approximately  seconds after the self-imposed lockdown. Like most parents across the country and beyond we’ve faced the same quandary all week, and will continue to do so in the weeks to come. Our days seem to fall into broadly the same routine. Wake up, remove their Ipads and attempt to stop the kids killing each other. Watch some news and get the beJesus scared out of me. Stop the kids trying to kill each other. Watch some more news and get the beJesus scared out of me. Stop the kids trying to kill each other. Give them their Ipads back. Watch some more news and empty the last of my entrails into my now soggy togs. Put kids to bed.Breathe. Open the bottle of wine. Rinse and repeat. Those ing clowns from Cheltenham to these shores will have certainly cost lives. Shame on them. Panic buying at the supermarket can be put down to fear. But it’s greedy and wrong, and should still be called out. There’s plenty for everyonewe all keep cool.  PICTURED:Monkey Magic  It’s a team game, and we’re all playing for the same team now. Not one amongst is without an elderly relative. Dozens probably. Or family members not quite as physically strong as us. This thing only workswe all put the shoulder to the wheel. Facing the sporting abyss, therefore, offers up other options. It’s the perfect opportunity to rewatch some classic television – The Wire, The West Wing, Monkey Magic or Benny Hill. Or better still to relive the summer of love in  on Youtube, when Derry lted the Sam Maguire. Some outstanding sports documentaries can be found on Netflix. Start with The Dawn Wall. Why not read that classic book you always meant to  Or retrieve the dusty old box of Razzles from the attic. Or buy a newspaper. It’s no coincidence that the great Paddy Heaney has ed like Clint Eastwood in Pale Rider to enliven your Wednesdays in the Irish News. Buy a copy. And buy the Derry News, for God’s sake. Or use your solitary exercise allowance to dander down the Bay Road with a big blue bag of cans, keeping a socially isolated distance from your drinking buddy. In many ways we are the lucky ones. Cast adrt on the far westerly reaches of Europe, and an island nation too, we’re the last to feel the virus’ full force. We are blessed with some of the most magnicent beaches in the world, many of them just a short drive away. A walk, a jog, a cycle down the quay. Anything to take your mind off coronavirus to dampen the worry. Bono has written a song about the pandemic, aswe haven’t suffered enough. Hopefully our scientists and political masters can learn from our fallen fellow Europeans. Find a vaccine or treatment. Soften the blow. Save lives. Hope trumps fear every time. You almost pine for the days of the great ‘foot and mouth’ epidemic, where getting out of you motor at the border to tramp though a big wet sponge seemed such an inconvenience.   PICTURED:The dastardly coronavirus  My parents, who seem to have le sussed after years of hard work and halyin-rearing, jetted off to the Canary Islands recently. “No concerns about the coronavirus ” says I. “Not at all,” replied my mother. “Sure I’m taking the Rescue Remedy with me.” Her faith in that small bottle of homeopathic goodness both reassuring and worrying at the same time. While my father studiously checks the obituary section of the paper just to make sure he’s not in it. It’s not just a matter of le and death, it’s more important than that to paraphrase Bill Shankly. Of all the things that matter in this le, sport might not be too high up everybody’s list. But to many of us that begin reading our newspapers from the back, sport matters most. What’s it like to live in a world with no sport  Well we’re finding out the hard way and it’s as bleak as we could have imagined. But we have to remain positive, strong and sensible. And kind. And stay home. Optimists live longer, happier lives. Wine helps.  The words of Paddy’s uncle Seamus seem particularly apposite in these increasingly uncertain times… “If we winter this one out, we can summer anywhere.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Wake up, remove their Ipads and attempt to stop the kids killing each other. Watch some news and get the beJesus scared out of me. Stop the kids trying to kill each other. Watch some more news and get the beJesus scared out of me. Stop the kids trying to kill each other. Give them their Ipads back. Watch some more news and empty the last of my entrails into my now soggy togs. Put kids to bed.Breathe. Open the bottle of wine. Rinse and repeat. Those ing clowns from Cheltenham to these shores will have certainly cost lives. Shame on them. Panic buying at the supermarket can be put down to fear. But it’s greedy and wrong, and should still be called out. There’s plenty for everyonewe all keep cool.  PICTURED:Monkey Magic  It’s a team game, and we’re all playing for the same team now. Not one amongst is without an elderly relative. Dozens probably. Or family members not quite as physically strong as us. This thing only workswe all put the shoulder to the wheel. Facing the sporting abyss, therefore, offers up other options. It’s the perfect opportunity to rewatch some classic television – The Wire, The West Wing, Monkey Magic or Benny Hill. Or better still to relive the summer of love in  on Youtube, when Derry lted the Sam Maguire. Some outstanding sports documentaries can be found on Netflix. Start with The Dawn Wall. Why not read that classic book you always meant to  Or retrieve the dusty old box of Razzles from the attic. Or buy a newspaper. It’s no coincidence that the great Paddy Heaney has ed like Clint Eastwood in Pale Rider to enliven your Wednesdays in the Irish News. Buy a copy. And buy the Derry News, for God’s sake. Or use your solitary exercise allowance to dander down the Bay Road with a big blue bag of cans, keeping a socially isolated distance from your drinking buddy. In many ways we are the lucky ones. Cast adrt on the far westerly reaches of Europe, and an island nation too, we’re the last to feel the virus’ full force. We are blessed with some of the most magnicent beaches in the world, many of them just a short drive away. A walk, a jog, a cycle down the quay. Anything to take your mind off coronavirus to dampen the worry. Bono has written a song about the pandemic, aswe haven’t suffered enough. Hopefully our scientists and political masters can learn from our fallen fellow Europeans. Find a vaccine or treatment. Soften the blow. Save lives. Hope trumps fear every time. You almost pine for the days of the great ‘foot and mouth’ epidemic, where getting out of you motor at the border to tramp though a big wet sponge seemed such an inconvenience.   PICTURED:The dastardly coronavirus  My parents, who seem to have le sussed after years of hard work and halyin-rearing, jetted off to the Canary Islands recently. “No concerns about the coronavirus ” says I. “Not at all,” replied my mother. “Sure I’m taking the Rescue Remedy with me.” Her faith in that small bottle of homeopathic goodness both reassuring and worrying at the same time. While my father studiously checks the obituary section of the paper just to make sure he’s not in it. It’s not just a matter of le and death, it’s more important than that to paraphrase Bill Shankly. Of all the things that matter in this le, sport might not be too high up everybody’s list. But to many of us that begin reading our newspapers from the back, sport matters most. What’s it like to live in a world with no sport  Well we’re finding out the hard way and it’s as bleak as we could have imagined. But we have to remain positive, strong and sensible. And kind. And stay home. Optimists live longer, happier lives. Wine helps.  The words of Paddy’s uncle Seamus seem particularly apposite in these increasingly uncertain times… “If we winter this one out, we can summer anywhere.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

They entered the MacLarnon Cup in  and won it at the first time of asking. Michael McMullan caught up with Ballinascreen man Kenny Bradley to take a look back... Kenny Bradley still vividly remembers the words of Master Brian McKevitt, asit was yesterday. The Louth man taught in St Patricks Maghera in the early years, before later moving on to the Abbey in Newry. Bradley and his mates were constantly told by McKevitt that St Patricks Maghera should be making its mark on the Ulster school scene. He would tell them the Derry club scene was among the best in Ireland. googletag.cmd.push With hindsight, McKevitt was proven right. Derry clubs have cleaned up all over Ulster and St Patricks Maghera would amass  MacRory Cup titles since their first in . They sit just four titles behind St Colmans, who lead the roll of honour. The adventure had to start somewhere. Someone had to break new ground. With Sean Spud Murphy in charge, St Patricks Maghera entered the MacLarnon Cup in  and won it at the first time of asking. It may be the forgotten team in that long illustrious list of successful teams on the corridor walls of St Patricks but, this group was indeed special. googletag.cmd.push To mark the Golden Jubilee, the  were due to come together earlier this month, for the first time in  years to mull over their memories. The recent coronavirus outbreak, put their plans on ice, but such was the enthusiasm for the initial idea, it has been put on the back burner until later in the year. On answering the phone in his Sixtowns home last week, Kenny Bradley was in his element, sting through ious clippings and artefacts. History, not necessarily sport, is in his DNA and all the memories from the year Maghera took their infant steps into Ulster Schools football have given him another spark. The school opened in  and this was now the first A-Level class to reach Upper Sixth. “We wouldnt have been allowed into the MacRory because you would have to have qualied through the MacLarnon,” Bradley outlines. Before that, the late Frankie Kearney and Brian McKevitt were involved with the youth teams. Ironically, when Maghera reached the semi-final of the MacRory in their first year, , it was Abbey – with McKevitt at the helm – who ran out narrow winners. Before that, came the gradual building blocks towards the class of  setting an example for others to follow. There were  boys in the first register in September of  and it built up over the next five years. It saw the school begin to field against local teams: St Colms Draperstown, St Pius Magherafelt and St Patricks Dungiven. “Once we went above that, we moved into the Ulster Colleges competitions,” Bradley added. A Corn na nOacuteg quarter-final place the previous year brought hope, wrote Lower Sixth pupil Barney Kielt in the school magazine that year. County minors Frankie McCotter, Mickey Moran, Eugene Laverty, Vincent Conway and Brendan Kelly were back on board. In from St Malachys Belfast came Cargin duo Packie McGuckin and Pat ONeill, who was on their winning Rannafast team. In the MacLarnon Cup, Dungannon Academy, St Patricks Omagh and St Marys Irvinestown all withdrew from Magheras group, left them with just Omagh CBS to play-off with to decide semi-finals pairings. Scores were hard to come by on a frosty December morning on Omaghs home pitch, as Maghera were - to - winners. Central to the win, as Kielt outlined, was midfield control from Conway and Laverty, helping set up scores for Liam Harbinson and Brendan Kelly. “Omagh had a great team back then,” Kenny Bradley recalls. “Their goalkeeper, Ciaran Harte, would have played for Tyrone, in goals as their reserve keeper. “The full-back was Willie McKenna, a brother of Eugene and Dessie McKenna. He went on to work over around Drumsurn, in the forestry. He played minor and U for Tyrone.” With challenge games against local Glen and Slaughtneil teams, St Patricks prepared for their semi-final with St Patricks Armagh, which Bradley describes as a tight enough game. In dficult conditions in Coalisland, it was a - brace after half-time that saw them book a place in the final against Omagh, who had defeated Dundalk on the other side of the draw. Given it being their first final and Omagh having played in the  MacRory semi-final, Kenny Bradley didnt really feel Maghera were going in as underdogs. “We knew we had a good team. We had played MacRory teams early on . We played Malachysin a friendly match down in Newbridge. We were short a couple of good players that day and they beat us by a point. It was a good tight game. We knew then, that we were as good as anybody. They also gave St Columbs Derry a good tight run at the start of the year. “We had boys like Eugene Laverty and Mickey Moran. Eugene Laverty wouldve ran through a hedge, that was the type of him – a big strong player and very dominant.” The sides were level at half-time in the final and when Pat ONeill edged Maghera into a - to - lead early in the second half, they never looked back. There was no All-Ireland series for the MacLarnon champions at that time. “I have no doubt that we wouldve won it, we were good enough and we had the stuff,” Bradley said, with confidence. Bradley, Vincent Conway and Brendan Kelly left the post-match celebrations and swtly headed for the Coalisland dressing rooms. At that time, in the Derry league, Ballinascreen fielded three teams – one in each ision – and on the day of the final, “We headed into Neillysfathers car and headed to Ballinascreen to play against Castledawson in the league. “We missed the celebrations and I remember thinking afterwards, were we feckin mad in the head. Youd think there would never be another game, but that was how mad we were to play football.” The team stopped in what it now called the Central Bar in Cookstown for a meal on the way home but Principal Fr Donnelly was far from happy with the Screen exodus. “He took Neilly out of class the next day. He gave him six slaps and a  lines for not showing up at the meal. I dont knowhe was telling the truth or not,” Bradley jokes. “We didnt worry too much about the celebrations back them. As Willie McKennalater mentioned to me....you played a match and when it was finished,there was another one, you went and played that, you never questioned who won or lost.” Behind the success was Sean Murphy, who had been in the school five years, who volunteered to take the team. “There was nobody busting themselves to get taking teams,” Bradley highlights. “He was the kind of man that called a spade a spade and we liked that about him. He hit the right note, there was no fuss with him, he just got on with it. “There were no sophisticated tactics, he picked the team the way he wanted and the boys did the rest.” Another change Bradley notices now, how more accessible school sport is and how much easier it is to stay behind for training. “There were no taxis in our day. I live up at the top of the Sixtowns, beside the Shepherds Rest, and you had to thumb it home. “It was hard to stay for the training and thats why we couldve been a lot betterwe had the modern-day facilities with boys being dropped off . Everybody wouldve been training all the time.” Bradley points to St Columbs being the team at that time but were on the wane. “The South Derry boys were starting to come to Maghera, and so too the Dungiven ones. Theywere still the big fellas but it wasnt long before Maghera overtook them.” But it was the class of  that was the real change in momentum. When the coronavirus crisis subsides and le s to relative normality, Kenny Bradley will get the wheels in motion to unite the team, who are all in good health. “They all went on to have good careers and good jobs in le. Youd have to say, they all fared fierce well for themselves. Its tara how quick the times goes past...its a flash. Brian McKevitt knew his football. Every journey begins with a single step and the team of  were the pioneers of Magheras summit to the top of Ulster schools football.

To order, telephone .Foyle Food Bank has seen a surge in demand and has encouraged anyone in need to come forward.Denis McGowan, chairman, said: Shopping in the food bank’s supermarketand access to its cafehas had to be suspended and instead users are asked to present their food bank vouchers outside the premises and food parcels will then be brought to their car by volunteers.Mr McGowan asked that those issuing food bank vouchers continue to ensure that all donated food goes to those in genuine need. Such controls are necessary in spite of the pressures of these challenging times but anyone in food crisis, particularly those who now find themselves in this situation for the first time, should not delay in coming to us, he said.

Rosemary McAllen Bucella lives just outside Varese, in the Italian region of Lombardy, and has been self-isolating as, at  years old, she falls into an at-risk category. She told DerryNow: “People have to stay at home, it’s the only solution. We have to stay at home to isolate this virus, there’s nothing  for it. “I look at Milan and it’s getting worse. People are not staying at home - they say % of people in Milan are still moving around. googletag.cmd.push “It’s totally irresponsible, they don’t realise how this can affect their own family. “Especially young people who will be carriers go back home to their family and friends and can be carrying the virus. “It can’t just be recommended, it has to be done for your own safety. Once we realised how dangerous it was, the government started to act and made rules. “People that go out risk being arrested. If we go from our townland to pick up shopping in a supermarket, we have to download a certicate from the internet and fill it in. “If we’re stopped by the police, we can show them that and they’ll check it.” googletag.cmd.push Rosemary lives in quite a remote area, but she is keen to warn people at home that this is no guarantee of protection from the spread of coronavirus. She said: “In Italy, people are dying like flies. “I would say we’re quite lucky because we don’t come into close contact with people, but there have still been a couple of deaths. “The terrible thing about this is that when they’re ill, they need to go to intensive care and that’s it. They don’t see another person in their family. If they die, they die alone. “They’re put in a coffin, there’s no one near them, there’s no funeral. They’re taken to be cremated and perhaps eventually, the relatives will get the ashes. “They get a phone call to say the person has passed on and that’s it, they can’t even have a funeral.” The Castledawson native has pleaded with people back home to take the warnings seriously and stay away from crowds. She said: “I’ve been telling them please, please stay away from people, don’t go into crowds. It’s vitally important that they stay at home in their own houses. “In a little place like Northern Ireland, they have to act quickly. It’s vital. Since family le in Ireland is important, people visit each other all the time. “They have to stop that. You can telephone, you can Skype. If you can look after yourself, they can stay out. They will have plenty of time to see them once this is all over,” added Rosemary.

From this evening people must stay at home except for shopping for basic necessities, daily exercise, any medical need and travelling to and from essential work. Shops selling non-essential goods will also be shut and gatherings in public of more than two people who do not live together prohibited. The UK death toll has reached . It was announced this evening that a third person has died from the disease in Northern Ireland. If people do not follow the rules police will have the powers to enforce them, including through fines and dispersing gatherings, Boris Johnson said in a televised statement from Downing Street. googletag.cmd.push The Department of Health said the third patient to die in Northern Ireland was in their late sixties and had underlying health conditions. Health Minister Robin Swann said: “My heart goes out to the loved ones of this patient. “This is the third tragic announcement of this kind I have had to make in recent days. “The lethal threat from this virus is very real and we all have to do everything we can to combat it.” Below is Boris Johnstons full address this evening:  Good Evening, The coronavirus is the biggest threat this country has faced for decades – and this country is not alone. googletag.cmd.push All over the world we are seeing the devastating impact of this invisible killer. And so tonight I want to update you on the latest steps we are taking to fight the disease and what you can do to help. And I want to begin by reminding you why the UK has been taking the approach that we have. Without a huge national effort to halt the growth of this virus, there will come a moment when no health service in the world could possibly cope because there won’t be enough ventilators, enough intensive care beds, enough doctors and nurses. And as we have seen where, in other countries that also have fantastic health care systems, that is the moment of real danger. To put it simply,too many people become seriously unwell at one time, the NHS will be unable to handle it – meaning more people are likely to die, not just from coronavirus but from other illnesses as well. So it’s vital to slow the spread of the disease. Because that is the way we reduce the number of people needing hospital treatment at any one time, so we can protect the NHS’s ability to cope – and save more lives. And that’s why we have been asking people to stay at home during this pandemic. And though huge numbers are complying – and I thank you all – the time has now come for us all to do more. From this evening I must give the British people a very simple instruction – you must stay at home. Because the critical thing we must do is stop the disease spreading between households. That is why people will only be allowed to leave their home for the following very limited purposes: – shopping for basic necessities, as infrequently as possible – one form of exercise a day – for example a run, walk, or cycle – alone or with members of your household – any medical need, to provide care or to help a vulnerable person and – travelling to and from work, but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home. That’s all – these are the only reasons you should leave your home. You should not be meeting friends. If your friends ask you to meet, you should say No. You should not be meeting family members who do not live in your home. You should not be going shopping except for essentials like food and medicine — and you should do this as little as you can. And use food delivery services where you can. If you don’t follow the rules the police will have the powers to enforce them, including through fines and dispersing gatherings. To ensure compliance with the Government’s instruction to stay at home, we will immediately: – close all shops selling non-essential goods, including clothing and electronic stores and other premises including libraries, playgrounds and outdoor gyms, and places of worship – we will stop all gatherings of more than two people in public – excluding people you live with – and we’ll stop all social events , including weddings, baptisms and other ceremonies, but excluding funerals. Parks will remain open for exercise but gatherings will be dispersed. No Prime Minister wants to enact measures like this. I know the damage that this disruption is doing and will do to people’s lives, to their businesses and to their jobs. And that’s why we have produced a huge and unprecedented programme of support both for workers and for business. And I can assure you that we will keep these restrictions under constant review. We will look again in three weeks, and relax themthe evidence shows we are able to. But at present there are just no easy options. The way ahead is hard, and it is still true that many lives will sadly be lost. And yet it is also true that there is a clear way through. Day by day we are strengthening our amazing NHS with , former clinicians now coming back to the service. With the time you buy – by simply staying at home – we are increasing our stocks of equipment. We are accelerating our search for treatments. We are pioneering work on a vaccine. And we are buying millions of testing kits that will enable us to turn the tide on this invisible killer. I want to thank everyone who is working flat out to beat the virus. Everyone from the supermarket staff to the transport workers to the carers to the nurses and doctors on the frontline. But in this fight we can be in no doubt that each and every one of us is directly enlisted. Each and every one of us is now obliged to join together, to halt the spread of this disease, to protect our NHS and to save many many thousands of lives. And I know that as they have in the past so many times, the people of this country will rise to that challenge. And we will come through it stronger than ever. We will beat the coronavirus and we will beat it together. And therefore I urge you at this moment of national emergency to stay at home, protect our NHS and save lives. Thank you.

Minister Mallon said: “Just yesterday I confirmed MOT test centres would no longer be carrying out tests and that all vehicles eligible would be issued with a temporary exemption certicate . However, this could not be applied to four year old cars and taxis due to legal requirements. “I am pleased to confirm that following signicant work by my officials, I am now able to put arrangements in place to ensure four year old cars can get back on the road,given the ongoing health advice, the journey to be made is essential. googletag.cmd.push “From tomorrow, four year old cars will be given a TEC for six months from the date that their MOT test should have been due. This will allow the vehicle to be taxed and driven on the road. Issuing the certicates will take some time but the exemption will automatically apply from the due date. “The PSNI has agreed to our request that given these exceptional circumstances, where PSNI detects a vehicle without a valid MOT certicate, it will in suitable cases, exercise its discretion under the law, in circumstances where there is no identied risk to public safety. It is important that drivers realise that they are responsible under the law for the roadworthiness of their vehicle at all times.” googletag.cmd.push The Minister continued that she and officials are continuing to urgently explore options to support taxis at this dficult time. “For taxis which require PSV tests, new regulation and legislation needs to be put in place to allow the legal issuing of Temporary Exemption Certicates and,despite best efforts, this is taking longer to resolve. However, I want to reassure taxi drivers that we are working urgently on options to help them at this dficult time. I recognise the taxi industry is being hard hit by this public health and economic crisis. I also am working with Executive colleagues and pushing hard for more support from the UK Government for the self-employed. Protecting drivers and the public from the serious impact of COVID- is my priority.” Alastair Ross, Head of Public Policy for Northern Ireland at the Association of British Insurers, said: “Insurers recognise that this is worrying time for everyone and will take a pragmatic view. They will not penalise customers for something that is entirely out of their control and where motorists with an MOT exemption certicate request a quote, they will not be prejudiced by their lack of a valid MOT certicate. This applies regardless of whether they wish to renew with their existing insurance provider or are looking to take out a policy with a dferent insurer. “Insurers do, however, expect that motorists comply with their legal obligation to keep their vehicle in a roadworthy conditionthey are driving it. Those affected by the ongoing MOT testing suspension should continue to service their vehicle and carry out basic checks such as looking out for brake wear, ensuring that all lights are working and that windscreen liquid and oil are at the correct levels.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Minister Mallon said: “Just yesterday I confirmed MOT test centres would no longer be carrying out tests and that all vehicles eligible would be issued with a temporary exemption certicate . However, this could not be applied to four year old cars and taxis due to legal requirements. “I am pleased to confirm that following signicant work by my officials, I am now able to put arrangements in place to ensure four year old cars can get back on the road,given the ongoing health advice, the journey to be made is essential. googletag.cmd.push “From tomorrow, four year old cars will be given a TEC for six months from the date that their MOT test should have been due. This will allow the vehicle to be taxed and driven on the road. Issuing the certicates will take some time but the exemption will automatically apply from the due date. “The PSNI has agreed to our request that given these exceptional circumstances, where PSNI detects a vehicle without a valid MOT certicate, it will in suitable cases, exercise its discretion under the law, in circumstances where there is no identied risk to public safety. It is important that drivers realise that they are responsible under the law for the roadworthiness of their vehicle at all times.” googletag.cmd.push The Minister continued that she and officials are continuing to urgently explore options to support taxis at this dficult time. “For taxis which require PSV tests, new regulation and legislation needs to be put in place to allow the legal issuing of Temporary Exemption Certicates and,despite best efforts, this is taking longer to resolve. However, I want to reassure taxi drivers that we are working urgently on options to help them at this dficult time. I recognise the taxi industry is being hard hit by this public health and economic crisis. I also am working with Executive colleagues and pushing hard for more support from the UK Government for the self-employed. Protecting drivers and the public from the serious impact of COVID- is my priority.” Alastair Ross, Head of Public Policy for Northern Ireland at the Association of British Insurers, said: “Insurers recognise that this is worrying time for everyone and will take a pragmatic view. They will not penalise customers for something that is entirely out of their control and where motorists with an MOT exemption certicate request a quote, they will not be prejudiced by their lack of a valid MOT certicate. This applies regardless of whether they wish to renew with their existing insurance provider or are looking to take out a policy with a dferent insurer. “Insurers do, however, expect that motorists comply with their legal obligation to keep their vehicle in a roadworthy conditionthey are driving it. Those affected by the ongoing MOT testing suspension should continue to service their vehicle and carry out basic checks such as looking out for brake wear, ensuring that all lights are working and that windscreen liquid and oil are at the correct levels.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The date for a potentialto League of Ireland action was set by the Football Association of Ireland and the National League Executive Committee this past weekend in the wake of the Covid- pandemic.The decision was made at a tele-conference conducted from FAI HQ at Abbotstown on Friday, with all  League clubs represented. Both parties agreed to work together to play as many games as possible this season to minimise the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on attendances and sponsorship, and to consider the needs of clubs who have qualied for Europe.The new plan is based around UEFA guidelines on ato club action across Europe, as presented to the FAI last Tuesday. This decision will see the Premier Division and the First Division of the SSE Airtricity League resume on the weekend commencing Friday, June . The Premier Division will finish on Friday, December  and the SSE Airtricity League season will close on Friday, December , with the second leg of the promotion relegation play-off. The Extra.ie FAI Cup Final will go ahead as scheduled on November , whilst the EA SPORTS Cup will be deferred.The new schedule will require the cancellation of the last round of fixtures in the Premier Division, now reduced to  games in total. Changes to the dates for European club fixtures may force alterations to the new calendar of games as the season develops and this will be continually reviewed.The First Division clubs will examine the possibility of fulfilling their -game schedule within this timeframe from June to December.Welcoming the decision, FAI Competitions Director Fran Gavin said: “These are very dficult times for our clubs and players and the FAI remains committed to doing everything we can to get us all through this crisis together.“There are no certainties around the COVID- pandemic but this decision offers us something to aim for. UEFA hope to have European football back up and running by early June at the latest so June  is a realistic target for us at this moment in time.“Together with the clubs and the Professional Footballer’s Association of Ireland, we will work together towards this date and continue to liaise with the NLEC and the PFAI to protect our clubs and players as best we can.“The FAI will continue to work with the Department of Health and the HSE to prioritise the health of our players, match officials, supporters and staff at this time and we will continue to follow all government guidelines.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Gone are the days of rounding up your friends for a knock-out on the nearest piece of grass you could find. Remember headers and volleys   seconds  Last Man standing  How about playing asyou were your childhood idol whilst the sun beat down and the grass stains got on the knees of your jeans. That meant that you got your arse warmed for you by your ma because the grass stains were hard to get out. I was Mark Hughes day in and day out and was the one who could be often found trying to score overhead kicks of the Sparky iety. It wasnt just football. If you fancied a game of rounders, you welcomed anyone and everyone, andit wasnt sports related, it would have been a game of Knick-Knock, which involved knocking on some poor neighbours door and making a run for it . Another classic – Pomp Pomp, involved one person standing with their eyes closed at a lamp post whilst everyone  hid, with the purpose of ing to said lamp post to free yourself. Speed was your friend in that game, a clown who never went further than ten feet from the lamp post was the enemy.The common denominator was that we were all outside playing, all day every day, and there wasnt an evening passed when someone was called in for their bed and there began vocerous negotiations across the street MAMMY, CAN I JUST HAVE ANOTHER  MINUTES . Glorious days. Really.To kids today, its an alien concept.This coronavirus craic is no craic at all, but it has made me, as a parent of two wains that would rather stay in watching TV than breathe fresh air, dig deep for creativity. With the sun shining, I took the two of them to Malinhead on Friday, and whilst I feared they would be bored within  minutes, they actually had a ball of a time, both simultaneously and spontaneously developing an interest in amateur photography. That shared interest gave way to a miracle of sorts as well – they stopped narking at each other. It was glorious peace, for them. I was having all sorts of panic attacks because they were getting far too close to the clf edges for my liking. Of course they were nowhere near them, but my eyesight isnt what it was andI said Careful once, I must have said it  times. Mortality hits you right in the face when you become a parent – and that irrationality never leaves you. I still check them to seetheyre breathing at night, and probably will until they get their own places. googletag.cmd.push HighlightMalinhead was great, and the fresh air did a number on them as they were wrecked when they got back in the car. Yet the real highlight of the day came before Malinhead, when I took them outside for an old school game of padsy.Now, you may call it padsy, or you may call it kerby, either way, you know what Im talking about. What you may not remember is that it is brilliant craic and in these scary times, a le saver.The rules are simple, and perfect for social distancing,thats your thing with your own wains. One person stands on one side of the road, facing the other, each taking turns to throw a ball. If it hits the opposite curb you get  points and you get to stand in the middle of the road for possible -pointers.It is simple and it is fun, butyoure a competitive sort, it also scratches that itch. Finding myself losing badly to my -year old daughter, I opted for desperation, turning my back and throwing it over my head in the hope of a -pointer. I also found myself hoping for the Ultimate shot - throwing the ball over a passing car and hitting the curb to win the game outright - the fabled -pointer. Those shots are for the talented or desperate, and I was the latter. Not once did I succeed. But sure at least I tried, with my daughter feeling more and more sorry for me with every beating.I did manage to claim a victory over my son, but that was neck and neck as well, and I have a feeling that he, like his sister, pitied the old fool and gave him a sympathy win.I discovered two things playing a game I played a thousand times as a Ballymac youngster – My -pointer game is now atrocious, and thats even with my glasses on. Also, a persistent leg problem prevented me from bending down to pick up the ball with any grace at all. If there was ever a sign Im getting old, it slapped me right up the face in those moments.But enough griping – my leg is sore, my hair is grey and my eyesight is shot, but the smiles were on my wains faces, and thats all that mattered. I left them playing amongst themselves whilst I talked to a neighbour about the worry affecting us all. They played on, innocently, competitively and obliviously. Thats all that mattered.They were kids being kids.Like we all were at one time.All you need is a ball. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Our priority is protecting our people and saving lives, which is paramount. As an Executive, we are doing everything we can and will continue to do so in the days, weeks and months ahead but we all have a role to play to protect ourselves and others from Covid-.The Executive has also paid tribute to health service staff who are performing ldquoheroically during this unprecedented time.Mr Swann said the entire health service is under growing pressure and appealed to people not to add to it unless they had to.ldquoPlease, please be patient and treat our great staff with respect, said the health minister. ldquoThey are there to care for you you are their first concern. Please show them the same concern and consideration.The Executive has also taken the opportunity to urge the public to follow the public health advice which means continuing to wash hands regularly for at least  seconds and anyone with mild symptoms should stay at home they will not need to be tested.People are asked not to contact or go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or emergency department. If symptoms worsen during home isolation or you are no better after seven days, seek medical advice by telephone.Those with an underlying health condition and who develop symptoms are advised to let their GP know and only only call  in an emergency..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th March 2020 Catholic.jpg","title":"Catholic Principals’ Association calls on Education Minister to close schools  ","story":"AT least three schools in the district have confirmed they pupils who may have been exposed to coronavirus.The closure of all schools appears likely within days as pressure mounts on Education Minister Peter Weir to follow the example of the Irish government and close all schools and colleges.Mr Weir ruled out full-out closure on Monday, but yesterday the Catholic Principalsrsquo Association, called for an immediate closure of all schools.First Minister Arlene Foster indicated that the closure could last for up to four months.All school principals and teachers have been working hard to protect pupils this week in the face of the coronavirus threat.Any planned parent teacher evenings have been cancelled and many schools are restricting access into the school apart from staff and students.Many schools have taken exceptional closure days on Monday and from tomorrow to Friday to allow teachers time to prepare lesson packs for students as well as preparing for online lesson sessions in the anticipation of closure.These include De La Salle High School and St Brigidrsquos Primary School in Downpatrick. St Maryrsquos High School in the town is closed today only for an exceptional closure.Some schools are working to continue lessons for Year - students to prepare them for their forthcoming examinations but have asked that all other children are kept at home.Despite the current government advice to keep schools open, attendance is likely to be down from Wednesday onwards as worried parents keep children at home for their protection or other more vulnerable family members.Principal of St Patrickrsquos Primary School in Saul, Mr Mark McGrath, said: ldquoWe are open again on Wednesday but we fully respect parentsrsquo right to do what is best for their own family situation.Down High School is closed today for a school development day but is open tomorrow and Friday for Years - only.

Council insurers also visited the site to inspect the scale of the damage.The roof of the cemetery building which was badly affected by the fire contained asbestos tiles which resulted in debris falling within the structure and on ground immediately beside it.Council staff erected fencing around the damaged part of the building to prevent access to the asbestos material with arrangements made to remove it off site by an approved asbestos contractor.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said politicians will be keen to hear tomorrowrsquos update and how soon the main building will be fully operational. He also hopes that councillors will be provided with an estimate of the cost of the repair work.ldquoThis is Downpatrickrsquos only public cemetery and I hope that once the insurers have completed their assessment and the Fire and Rescue Service report is discussed, that repairs can get underway, said Cllr Curran.ldquoThe cemetery is widely used by people from across the district and while the scale of the damage was signicant, it is somewhat comforting that the blaze is being blamed on an electrical fault and was not as the result of an arson attack..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th March 2020 Cheltenham.jpg","title":"Cheltenham joy  ","story":"THERE was local success at the Cheltenham Festival last week.Ravenhill, bred in Comber by Aaron Metcalfe, won the National Hunt Chase on the opening day of the Festival last Tuesday.The  year-old, ridden by leading amateur jockey Jamie Codd and trained by Gordon Elliott, romped home at  .

I also think it is ludicrous that you only have schools and public buildings closed on one side of the border, he said.ldquoI know that from talking to parents last weekend, especially those with vulnerable children, that they are really fearful about sending them to school and into public buildings. People are effectively voting with their feet and taking decisions themselves.Cllr Clarke said elected representatives had to listen to what the public was saying and that confusion had been fuelled by conflicting medical advice from across the globe.He added: ldquoWe simply have to look at restrictions on public buildings and even perhaps how many people go into play parks. This council needs to send out a strong message that it is taking this issue seriously following. We have already cancelled of this weekrsquos St Patrickrsquos Day parades. We have to start by getting our own house in order.The DUPrsquos Billy Walker mdash who initially said that his party would ldquoreluctantly support the closure of leisure centres mdash subsequently agreed that all council buildings should go into lockdown following the Prime Ministerrsquos statement.He said that in the interests of the publicrsquos health and safety ldquothis is the right thing to do, even though Northern Irelandrsquos chief medical officer, Michael McBride, said that leisure centres could remain openthey were properly managed.ldquoAll the political parties need to work together to make sure that the people out there are properly informed as there are mixed messages. To be honest, some have attempted to turn this issue into and Orange and Green situation and that is wrong, declared Cllr Walker.ldquoThe bottom line for us all is that we do not want any member of the public to get infected with this virus. We want to come out the far side of this crisis unscathed and prevent as many as people as possible from contracting coronavirus. We have to send out a united message.The UUPrsquos David Taylor said while politicians could ldquodebate all day about who was right and who was wrong in relation to conflicting medical advice, they had to approach the issue in a collective manner and give confidence to the community that they are united in their approach.He added: ldquoThis is not a political issue. It is one that affects each and everyone of us. It is a very serious issue given the potential damage it could cause to peoplersquos lives and we could actually lose some as a result of this. We need to take collective approach and act responsibly.ldquoI have serious concerns about the way the virus is impacting the business community and some of the stories I have heard are frightening, with some businesses down by as much as  percent and jobs at others at risk. We need the Assembly to provide a package of measures to help.SDLP councillor Pete Byrne said that at this time the public need clarity with the overwhelming majority of them of the view that acting early is better than acting too late.ldquoPeople want us to show leadership and while we are taking about closing leisure centres, we have an obligation to protect the interests and health of people and our staff, he said.ldquoWhile I support the closure of leisure centres, we also need to look at community centres, many of which are visited by huge number of our senior citizens for a range of activities and programmes. We need to send out a clear message to people.Cllr Byrne said there also needed to be a focus on the criteria for reopening public buildings following their closure, suggesting that an alternative venue needs to be found for future council meetings to promote social distancing, suggesting the Down Leisure Centre as a possible location.ldquoWhen we close public facilities we are going to push people into parks but we must ensure that there is social distancing in these locations. We need staff there to assure people and perhaps we could redeploy those from our leisure centres to make sure are parks are up to scratch, he added.Cllr Henry Reilly highlighted the great deal of anguish in the community, suggesting that a two-week closure smacked of ldquotokenism as the coronavirus issue will not be over by the end of March.He also highlighted the need to ensure that frontline staff, especially those who work in refuse collection and household recycling centres, are provided with appropriate protective equipment.Cllr Jarlath Tinnelly urged the Public Health Agency to provide information leaflets on the coronavirus to every household in the country, while Alliancersquos Andrew McMurray said his party supported the decision to close all council buildings, excluding those which deliver statutory s.He added: ldquoMoving forward, it is imperative that we enact and support the decision made by the council. On the wider issue, I would ask all residents to follow the advice given by the Public Health Agency, to shop responsibility in order to avoid shortages and to look out for the most vulnerable in our

contact.Volunteers from the foodbank, who are appealing for more donations to help them cope with the increase in demand in what are unprecedented times, are asking people with cars to drive into the car park at Downpatrick Presbyterian Church where the foodbank is based.People are being asked to remain in their cars and once they have handed over their voucher, the food parcel will either be left beside their vehicle or placed in the boot.The volunteers have confirmed that they will also be changing the way they hand over parcels to people who arrive at the foodbank on foot or accept the generous donations people from across the district provide them with.Foodbank co-ordinator Shirley Lennon said people continue to be generous and revealed that she was heartened this week to see collection points the charity has at a number of local stores filled with items.She also revealed that while in the Asdarsquos Downpatrick store yesterday morning, she was approached by a woman who gave her an envelope with money it which her grandfather had donated.Shirley explained the woman approached her after spotting that she was wearing her Fountain Foodbank hoodie.Shirley has been at the helm of the foodbank since it opened and described the impact of the coronavirus issue on the community as ldquochallenging.She also confirmed that the volunteers who provide the food parcel service are committed to continuing to help others across the community in need.She described the climate the foodbank is currently operating in as ldquodficult and revealed that it was extremely busy last Friday.ldquoOn Tuesday of last week we gave out  food parcels which was busy but not unusual, but suddenly on Friday everyone seemed to panic and there were  parcels given out to help  people.ldquoTo put that number of parcels in context, it was like the Friday before Christmas when we give out around  parcels. This is the only time that we would distribute that many.Shirley said she believes that this is as a direct response to what is happening across the community, explaining that measures had been put in place to restrict the time volunteers speak with people in a bid to protect their health.ldquoWhile I was not there last Friday when people were calling I believe that there was a sombre atmosphere. We gave out a lot of food and we reckon that we will be busy from here on, she continued.ldquoIt has been dficult to replace the food that was given out. We do not have that big a store, but we have managed and it is quite well stocked again just now, but it is dficult. Normally we have financial donations which lets me buy what we need, but there is no long le milk to be had anywhere. It has been hard for me to do that normal shopping for the foodbank.Shirley explained that while she collected an order from the Asda store in Downpatrick yesterday, she was unable to get the quantity of some items that she would have liked.The foodbank co-ordinator saidshoppers would think about the charity when they are shopping it would help, explaining that people are being good, with messages coming in from people saying they will make donations. Shirley said that local churches have also been helping.ldquoThere has been a good response from people which is very much appreciated, but the increase in demand is having an impact on our stock, coupled with the inability to get the food, she said.ldquoPeople should not be panic buying, but it seems to be the way they react at times like this.She said that the Downpatrick foodbank and the Pantry foodbank in Newcastle are anticipating greater need and with people having no jobs and no money coming in, ldquothey are going to be in more dficulty.Shirley added: ldquoEveryone who used the foodbank over the past few months do not have the reserves to go and panic buy, that is why we are going to be busy.Donations can be left at the Fountain Foodbank on Tuesday or Friday mornings between am and noon.

Also running for NAC was Stevie Rice, finishing in : for th place. The ladiesrsquo race was won by Dickson for the fourth time in a row in : followed by Mourne Runnersrsquo Karalee McBride in : and third was Ballydrain Harriersrsquo Alison Stocks in :.Following on from last weekendrsquos Slieve Gullion race, Newcastle AC again won the team prize.The silly boy award this week went to Hicks, who very nearly wasnrsquot allowed to start the race, having turned up without his mandatory safety kit bag.His only excuse was: ldquoOn ing from injury and a year out, Irsquom just getting back into the swing of things.Fortunately, a quick scramble around the start area saw him beg and borrow enough gear to be allowed to start the race.

Michael said: “People think, the music is dark and intense, they’re going to be really dark and intense.The band’s original line-up of Michael, Andy and Fyfe \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...“The most messed-up people I find are people in pop music. A lot of them are horrible twisted people with weird agendas and they become quite damaged iniduals. Then they go on stage everything is rosy.“It’s really the old cliche – never judge a book by its cover. With us the lyrics are kind of twisted, but there’s a big, dark sense of humour there.“We let off steam when we go on stage and jump up and down for  minutes. You tend to be pretty chilled afterwards.”When the band first got together in  lead singer and guitarist Andy Cairns was a pupil at Ballyclare High. Michael, who attended Larne Grammar with Fyfe Ewing , wasn’t present for the band’s first recording though he was there in spirit.On the front cover of metal magazine Kerrang! in He said: “Fyfe and I were in the same English class and would have traded records. He was in a band, I was in a band. “His band and Andy’s band had played a gig at Jordanstown Uni. They had more in common than they did with their own bands. “They did a demo together. I was there in spirit because Andy didn’t have a bass guitar so Fyfe asked me and I lent Andy my bass. Andy played it on the first demo.” Michael soon joined to play his own bass and things clicked from the start: “Our first gig was at Giro’s supporting Decadence Within. It went down really well, I was flabbergasted. “We weren’t trying to be U or Guns N’ Roses – those were the two big musical things at that time in , . I don’t mind U and I quite like Guns N’ Roses but we had our own little thing going on.“You kind of gravitated towards anyone who liked something that wasn’t Bryan Adams at school. In Larne where I grew up the metallers hung out with the goths, the goths hung out with the indie kids and you heard Joy Division, The Dead Kennedys and Slayer. We clung together as musical outsiders.”The friendship between Michael and Andy has extended more than  years: “I think I was  or  when Andy and I first met. When the first album came out I’d just turned . I’ll be  later this month.“One thing we did find quite early on is that we tend to be huffers. We got that out of our system. If you don’t like something you say then, you don’t leave it for six months and have a meltdown in the middle of eastern Europe.“There’s a lot of rock and rolls myths and stereotypes out there that people love. One of them I think which is not correct is that you need to have creative tension in a band. Maybe that’s works for one or two albums, but that burns itself out really quickly.“It’s really great working together as part of the band, what I get out of it is quite special, I think I’m very lucky.”Michael contrasted the crazy intensity when the band shared a house together in Belfast’s Holylandswith the situation now where they all live in dferent parts of the UK.He said: “I think there was one time me and Andy worked out over an -months period we’d been within  metres of each other every day with the exception of Christmas Day.“Now I live in Larne, Andy lives in Cambridge and Neilour drummer lives in Derby. When we meet up there’s lots of interesting stories and dferent experiences to share rather than walk down the main street in Larne going, ‘oh there’s the lads’.”On Fyfe, his original bandmate who left in , he said: “I haven’t spoken to him since he left. We have friends in common. He’s doing alright I believe. He moved to Brighton, he’s been there  years now. He’s had very little involvement in the music business.“It’s a real pity because he was such a great drummer, it’s just he couldn’t really get on with the lestyle. Somewhere down the line we’ll meet again.”Family man with attic of collectablesLast year Michael contributed a recipe to a celebrity cookbook to support his nephew Matthew who had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia.Michael said: “Matthew is doing well. The family is getting things back on track. It was a big thing, he’s still a bit traumatised as you’d expect but he’s doing well.”Of family le at home in Larne he said: “My we works full time soI’m at home I’m daddy day care. The only downside is when I’m away, I’m away   so there’s a whole dferent set of challenges for my we who’s an absolute saint.”Askedhis children, aged nine and five, were excited about their dad being in an band, he said: “They saw us at a big festival in Europe which was great because they were at the side of the stage and they were able to see , people from the other side. “They’re quite blasé about their dad being in a band. They’re not into music that much, they’re more into games, football and karate.”Michael went on to discuss some of the Therapy  treasure trovecontained in his attic: “I’ve got Fyfe’s original snare drum that he used on Babyteeth, the basses that I used on Troublegum. I’ve got a lot of the flyers, posters, tour passes and recordings and audio stuff I’ve kept over the years. The attic is a disaster area.”In the early days of Therapy  a pair of denim dungarees were Michael’s stagewear of choice. Askedstill had them, he said: “I actually do. I’m quite pleased that I’d still fit into them but I never wear them.“When we did the Troublegum shows a while ago there were some bets that they’d turn up again, but it didn’t happen for whatever reason. But never say never – right now I don’t think the world is ready for that.”Michael explained that there were in fact two pairs of his trademark dungarees, one of them he referred to as ‘the good pair’ then immediately burst out laughing.“Can you imagine denim dungarees after three weeks of touring ” he said. “It’s hard to find a -hour laundrette when you’re on the road. They were crunchy. I’m surprised they’re still in one piece.”Dates cancelled due to pandemicTherapy  have had to cancel some European tour dates later this month because of the coronavirus.Michael said: “We’ve had to cancel where the crowds would have been above ,, some of the big festivals we were really looking forward to. As it stands we’re still planning to play some of the smaller shows unless told otherwise. “It’s something that you just can’t account for. Gigs sometimes have to be cancelled because of illness or injury but this is beyond the band’s control. It’s a bit of a headmelt.”Touring major European cities is a far cry from the band’s gigging schedule in : “When we started there was the Warzone Collective in Belfast and Hope Promotions in Dublin. They worked in conjunction and would bring hardcore punk bands over like Fugazi and Concrete Sox. “We knew the Warzone people and that led to us being invited down to Dublin to play with the likes of Babes In Toyland. “They’d rent rooms above pubs for gigs, in Belfast they used the Art College and the Conor Hall. “We were quite lucky to get in at that DIY stage.”It’s okay not to be okayMuch is currently being done to raise awareness and funds for musicians suffering from mental health issues, particularly through Aware NI, PIPS and Help Musicians. As a band Therapy  have been tuned into the struggle from day one with many of Andy’s lyrics exploring the pressures that weigh on the human mind.Michael said: “It’s something that we’re all very aware of and very sympathetic towards. Being a young male in Northern Ireland there’s a bit of a ‘come on, man up’ vibe. That has been very damaging for a couple of generations now.“There is a rock and roll myth that everyone’s an all-singing, all-dancing, all-fighting gunslinger – you roll into town decimate it and move on. It’s not really like that.“I don’t think anyone hasn’t been touched by themselves or someone  who has had a mental health issue.“It’s such a fragile thing. It’s right there, there just seems not to be the widespread acknowledgement that it exists and for treatment. It’s so underfunded. It’s a real tragedy.”He added: “We’ve always had a lot of empathy, we take people as they are, we don’t have the answers, but we do try to let people know that it’s okay to not be okay. “Just talk about it, talk to your friends, talk to someone, reach out. Thankfully that stigma is moving away.“We’ve always been celebrating the outsiders – be yourself, do you own thing, what makes you happy, self preservation, looking after yourself.”Michael continued: “It’s one of these rock and roll myths that people want their musicians to be messed up and die young and leave a pretty corpse. “None of us subscribe to that at all.“We like to have a good time when we’re on tour, but doing it for so long there’s a massive element of self preservation.“It’s about doing a good gig. People don’t come and see you againyou’re stood there looking bored or hungover. It’s not pleasant for anyone – the player or the watcher.“We all feel a big responsibility to put on a good show. There’s people who have seen us  plus times.“We want every show to be as goodnot better than the last time. You make a rod for your own back with that.”• Therapy  will play the Limelight on September  to celebrate the band’s th anniversary• To coincide with the ‘So Much for the  Year Plan’ tour the band re-recorded  of their UK Top  hits in Abbey Road with producer Chris Sheldon, who produced the original Troublegum album.

Victims are regularly kept updated on progress of investigations.ldquoWe are dedicated to making our communities even safer by preventing and reducing crime and building on our success in solving crime and seeking justice for victims.ldquoCompared to similar forces in the UK, South Wales Police is the best performing force on recorded crime and there is a  per cent lower chance of being a victim of crime in South Wales than where.ldquoThere was a  per cent year-on-year reduction in burglaries in the Bridgend and Vale of Glamorgan area, where people are far less likely to become a victim of burglary than where in South Wales. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There will always be someone worse off and someone better off and whilst you can sympathise and empathise and seek to understand, you can only really know your own lived experience.But this is in part why I am so interested in the news, because in dealing with, embracing, enduring, revelling in my own le, I appreciate that window on the world to open my mind, teach me things and remind me that there are others in similar, same, better and much worse situations than me. It doesnrsquot stop a flooded road being frustrating, but it does remind me that in the midst of chuntering and muttering, because I do indulge in a chunter and mutter, thatpossible, it is important to take a moment to think about a world outside ourselves and our immediate surrounds.It can feel depressing. It is easy to feel powerless. But I do believe that as citizens in a democracy, it is important to have an idea about what is going on becausewe always turn a blind eye, eventually I fear, we might stop seeing anything at all. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The aim is that these virtues help to form them.With such a vast space at its disposal, the school ensures that children are given a rich and versatile experience.In the orchard, pupils pick fruit from pear, apple, plum, and damson trees which they use in cooking lessons during the autumn.They also grow  dferent kinds of fruit, salad, and vegetables in a polytunnel.Earlier this year, St Josephrsquos Primary was awarded a gold award in the UNICEF Rights Respecting School programme.The award is granted to schools which show a commitment to promoting childrenrsquos rights and raising awareness of these amongst young people.It recognises efforts to place the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child at the heart of a schoolrsquos policies and practice.ldquoAlongside our work on rights is the fact that we want our children to be aware of their responsibilities, said Mr Rein.ldquoYes, they have rights to be heard, but they also have a responsibility to listen to others.St Josephrsquos was the first school in Wales to develop a pupil parliament.Every child is a member of the parliament, and elected representatives from eight student groups form a cabinet which has decision-making powers.ldquoThe school parliament is a vehicle for the pupils to have a voice, so they can decide how the school can be a better place, how the local community can improve, and how we can help the UN to achieve their global goals, continued Mr Rein.ldquoSo the children are looking inward ndash at themselves and how the school environment can improve ndash and looking outward at how we can develop better links with the parishes and the areas of Penarth and Dinas Powys.ldquoOur Eco Ministry has been involved in a project to tidy beaches and pick up plastic, and our Healthy Schools and School Mission team have given food to local foodbanks.St Josephrsquos Primary is one of  innovation schools which have been chosen to contribute to the Welsh Governmentrsquos new curriculum framework, which will be rolled out to every school in Wales by . As part of the new framework, schools are required to design their own curriculum based upon the needs of specic learners, rather than adhering to a national learning program.St Josephrsquos curriculum is lsquoresearch-ledrsquo, meaning it is based on findings in child development and cognitive science.Teachers have undertaken training on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop, and lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social, and physical development.Mr Rein said: ldquoWe want our children to develop physically in terms of their gross motor skills, their fine motor skills, and their locomotion skills.ldquoWe have apparatus on which they can hang, climb, and swing, to build up their core strength.Mr Rein called the schoolrsquos curriculum lsquoreally ambitions.rsquoldquoWe are one of sixteen innovation schools in Wales helping to implement the new curriculum and develop special projects to do with the curriculum, he said.ldquoWe have taken that on by focusing on a knowledge-rich curriculum, so that we develop childrenrsquos knowledge, skills, and give them fantastic experiences.ldquoWe have taken good, rich materials from lots of dferent places, and developed some of our own, which we have implemented to a high standard.ldquoBehaviour in the school is exemplary partly because we have spent a long time asking what good teachers do.ldquoWe practice together as staff, so our teachers are working at a high level using a very well-researched curriculum.In last yearrsquos maths reasoning test,  per cent of pupils at St Josephrsquos scored higher than the national average, and  per cent of pupils scored above average in the National Reading TestldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos, said Mr Rein.ldquoEverything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.The schoolrsquos curriculum has recently been praised by cabinet member for education and regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, who said St Josephrsquos had done a lsquobrilliant job.rsquoShe said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning.ldquoIt encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It will cut planned capital spending to pound million from a budget of pound million and will work to grow online.MS said in a statement: \"Whilst we remain confident that the post-crisis future of the business and our transformation programme remains as strong as ever, trading over the next nine to  months in our clothing and home and international businesses is likely to be severely impacted.\"As a result, it is not possible to provide meaningful guidance on future earnings, although we are taking every step to secure future value for shareholders, colleagues and suppliers.\"The chairman of Wetherspoon has said that a decline in sales was accelerated when prime minister Boris Johnson told people to stay away from pubs.After rising in previous weeks, sales fell by . per cent in the week to March  and the slowdown has picked up further since the Prime Ministers statement, Tim Martin said.It came as the business reported profit before tax rose  per cent to pound. million in the half-year to January  on revenue of pound million.Health secretary Matt Hancock has warned that coronavirus will keep spreading as long as people continue to socialise.Speaking on talkRadio, Mr Hancock said: \"If you stay at home you are saving lives.\"I know, of course, this is a more dangerous disease for older people but not exclusively, some young people get it too.\"But, more importantly, the more that people continue to go out and continue to socialise, the more it will spread and the longer were going to have to keep these measures in place.\"So, were urging people to follow the public health advice.In the emergency Bill thats in front of Parliament right now, we are taking the powers to be able to enforce these measures, so we can make it happen by lawwe need to.\"Id rather not do that and the evidence so far is that the vast majority of people are following the advice, are doing what is sensible and right.\"The company said it was cancelling its interim idend, which had been p a year earlier.Mr Martin said: \"It is obviously very dficult to predict, in these circumstances, how events will unfold in future weeks and months, but we now anticipate profits being below market expectations, so long as the current health scare continues.\"As a result of this uncertainty, it is impossible to provide realistic guidance on our performance in the remainder of the financial year.\"The company has decided to delay most capital projects and to reduce expenditure, where possible, including the cancellation of the interim idend.\"As a result of these actions, combined with the Governments proposals on business rates relief and credit guarantee facilities, the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to maintain operations at a substantially lower level of sales.\"Nicola Sturgeon has urged anyone who left the medical profession in the past three years to consider ing to help the fight against coronavirus.Sharing a plea from Scotlands chief nursing officer Fiona McQueen, the First minister tweeted: \"Scotlands NHS needs our help to meet the #coronavirus challenge.\"Mr Hancock said some retired medics whoto work in the NHS to fight the coronavirus will be able to come \"straight back in\".Asked on the BBCs Breakfast programme when workers couldto the NHS, he said: \"Well, over the next couple of weeks because for some theyll have very recently left and they can come straight back in, their annual trainings been up-to-date and they can just restart.\"Imagineyouve left at Christmas, for instance, you can restart straight away. For others who have been out for a little bit longer, they may need more of a refresher because, of course, its vital that we keep people safe, thats the whole point of the NHS.\"So the letter will go out today, well then be engaging inidually with all those who respond and I very much hope that many, many thousands will respond.\"From those Ive talked to, I think people can see just how important this is. The training will happen for those who need it over the next couple of weeks, at the same time well allocate people to a hospital near them because theres a logistical exercise here as well.\"Mr Hancock suggested that tougher measures could have to be brought inpeople do not follow the Governments advice.He told the BBCs Breakfast programme: \"What I can say is thatpeople follow the advice, stay home which saves lives andthey keep apart from others, more than two metres, more than six foot, then we can tackle this and we can turn the tide.\"The scientists advise that we can turn the tide in  weekspeople follow the advice.\"If people dont follow the advice, then itll be longer and we might have to bring more and tougher measures.\"He added: \"We have brought these measures in earlier than Italy did in terms of where theyre up to with the number of cases.\"But were absolutely clear thatwe need to, we have the powers, in fact weve got a Bill in front of Parliament now to strengthen those powers further.\"But I think its far betterpeople follow the advice.\"The FTSE  has risen by more than five per cent in early trading as travel companies jump out ahead after a bruising few weeks for the sector sparked by the Covid- pandemic.Intercontinental Hotels jumped by about a fth despite revealing that demand for rooms was the worst it had ever seen, as markets opened on Friday.EasyJet also rose by around  per cent and cruise operator Carnival jumped by around . per cent.Meanwhile, the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil joined the rally, rising five per cent to . dollarsafter a massive fall earlier in the week.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has warned about the prospect of a recessionpeople do not receive their wages.Labour has urged the Government to ensure the salaries of workers are protected as businesses lose trade during the coronavirus pandemic.He told the BBCs Breakfast programme: \"We need the Government now to act to protect people to keep them in their jobs.\"In that way, what well be able to do is ensure people have an income coming in, their job will be protected, but we prevent the second wave of a recession hitting uswere not careful.\"Becausepeople lose their jobs, they dont have their wages, demand collapses in the economy and then you really do have a recession.\"The lesson from past crises like these is act fast and act big, so thats why were saying the Government should step in and say to employers, well cover  per cent of your wages, you keep people in work.\"Demand for a room at Intercontinental Hotels has reached its lowest point in history, the group said, as the travel industry continues to be battered by the coronavirus pandemic.The business revealed that it would be cutting costs, eliminating its idend and reducing salaries in a bid to save cash.However, shares in the group, which have been badly hit in recent months, jumped by around  per cent on market open in London as investors reacted positively to the companys proposals.Chief executive Keith Barr said: \"Demand for hotels is currently at the lowest levels weve ever seen.Intercontinental Hotel Group has a robust business model and the measures we are announcing today to reduce costs and preserve cash give us the capacity to manage the business through this unique environment and to support our owners during this incredibly dficult time.\"These were not easy choices and we are mindful of the impact these decisions will have on our colleagues and shareholders.\"However, we believe that these are essential to ensuring that we come out of this as strong as we possibly can and ready to capitalise on what remains an industry with excellent long-term growth potential.\"Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , said the list of key workers to whom schools will remain open is \"perhaps more extensive than we might have expected\".He said: \"Realistically, theywill need to identy these children by lunchtime.\"Mr Barton added: \"We already know from the trajectory of this that were not going to have many staff.\"We have to be careful that the message to parents is not business as usual.\"Matt Hancock said that a communication will be sent to around . million people who are classed as vulnerable to set out specic action for them to take.The Health secretary told Sky News: \"The first thing were going to do is set out exactly what conditions that applies to.\"We expect about . million people to then get a communication from the NHS to say that they are part of this and what they need to do.\"Many of these people have pre-existing health conditions and so will be very worried right now, and I understand that, and theyll need very specic sets of action - for instance, how do you go about still getting your chemoyou have cancer whilst also social-distancing \"If you have cancer its particularly important to stay away from other people, but you also of course have got to keep going with your chemotherapy.\"He added: \"These are some of the most dficult and challenging cases so well be getting in contact with them, butpeople think that they are on this list and dont receive a communication from the NHS, then they also need to get in contact.\"So that is under way, the money was announced for it yesterday.\"A combination of money to the NHS and money to councils because theyve got a very big part to play in keeping people safe.\"ASCL general secretary Geoff Barton said schools will have first worked to identy vulnerable children, as they will know who they are, and will then be looking at the \"key worker\" category.He said the ASCL is telling members: \"You have to do your best to negotiate the key workers list. Youre doing this to a tight timescale, and what you offer children on Monday may be dferent to what you offer next Wednesday.\"Mr Barton said that initially, schools will be doing all they can so that pupils who need to can still turn up to their own school after the weekend.In the longer term, there will be more strategic planning of school provision, he added.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: \"The Government has made clear that every child who can be safely cared for at home should be. And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice. We will continue to work with the Government throughout the day to provide greater clarity to schools to enable this reduced offer to be up and running as soon as possible.\"Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added her voice to calls from school leaders urging parents to only send their children in as a last resort.She said: \"This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. This will not achieve the goal of slowing the spread of the virus.\"So it is vitally important that parents follow government advice to keep their children at home, wherever possible. Schools can only accommodate a limited number of children and the fewer children making the journey to school, and the fewer children in educational settings, the lower the risk that the virus can spread.\"The competition watchdog has launched a taskforce to tackle businesses looking to exploit the coronavirus outbreak to take advantage of customers.The Competition and Markets Authoritysaid the outbreak has prompted concerns that people could be exploited by companies \"charging excessive prices or making misleading claims about their products\".It said it has already contacted traders and s over excessive pricing of hand sanitiser as part of its efforts.Andrea Coscelli, the CMAs chief executive, said: \"This is obviously a time when we all have to behave responsibly to protect our fellow citizens, and particularly those who are most vulnerable.\"We urge retailers to behave responsibly in the exceptional circumstances of the Covid- outbreak.\"Butthey do not, our taskforce is monitoring market developments to enable us to intervene as quickly as possible.\"We have a range of options at our disposal, from warnings to enforcement action to seeking emergency powers.\"The ceremonial of the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace, St Jamess Palace and Windsor Castle is being postponed until further notice \"in line with Government advice to avoid mass gatherings\", Buckingham Palace has announced.The palace said in a statement that the situation would be \"reviewed on an ongoing basis, with a view to restarting when appropriate\". article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And the Bank of England has slashed interest rates to a new low, helping to reduce costs for some borrowers.Mr Donnell explained: ldquoLevels of property transactions are typically more volatile than changes in house prices.ldquoWe do not expect any immediate impact on prices. Beyond this, the outlook for house prices largely depends upon how the Governmentrsquos major package of support for business and households reduces the scale of the economic impact.ldquoLow mortgage rates mean forbearance will remain the preferred choice for lenders, but further Government support in these unique times cannot be ruled out.Looking further ahead, Mr Donnell said: ldquoThe timing of any rebound in housing market activity depends upon when new restrictions are lted, and the extent to which households and businesses are able toto a normal way of le.ldquoBrowsing for homes online is set to continue and, while demand for property may rebound quickly, it will take several months for agents to rebuild new business pipelines..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: House sales set to plunge by up to % over next three months  u report article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
