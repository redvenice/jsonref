Then she stopped and looked up at me, puzzled. She had detected something odd, but wasn’t sure what. All I could see were dead leaves. Then she started digging, raking up the soil around her and thrusting her nose into the deepening hole. I watched with amusement and interest, until her muddy head emerged with a grubby velvet bag between her teeth.It was about the size of a hot water bottle — and, inside, I found a collection of jewellery, including necklaces, rings and bracelets. We handed it in to the police.Before we could resume our search, the phone rang. Cola had returned home on his own, filthy and exhausted, but otherwise none the worse for wear.In Brixton, South London, Molly came up against a problem during her search for a marmalade cat called Columbus, who had gone exploring and not come back.Columbus was not an ‘only cat’ — he shared a family home with three other felines, which meant getting a fur sample that was exclusively his proved difficult.We did our best, though, and set off in search.The neighbouring streets were a warren of houses and shops, yards and lock-up businesses, with criss-crossing roads and a railway line. This was going to be quite a challenge.However, we hit a promising lead when, after two hours, we visited a care home for senior citizens. Molly became animated as we walked up the driveway. I approached a nurse who, as luck would have it, was a cat-lover and invited us to search the grounds.While we were looking, I met Gracie, a tiny woman with white hair, a beret that matched her purple coat and spectacles with lenses so thick they gave her an almost cartoonish look.          The old methods of detective work are still the best. Nothing beats house-to-house inquiries for collecting clues and local information. But, these days, the reaction I get on the doorstep is a bit different from that of my days in the policeShe immediately took to Molly and explained that, because the residents were not allowed pets, she had started putting out cat food for the foxes and hedgehogs.As we chatted, Molly suddenly shot to the end of the garden and started to snuffle feverishly around a hole in a fence panel. Moving closer, I could see wisps of ginger hair on the splintered wood.We could safely say Columbus woz ’ere.I asked Gracie if she would mind keeping an eye out that evening and was somewhat taken aback to see her eyes filling with tears.‘How very kind of you to ask,’ she said. ‘It’s nice to feel wanted, for a change. You tend to feel a bit invisible when you get past 90.’At around 9.45 that evening, a tired and hungry marmalade cat crept through the hole in the fence, padded over to the plate of whitebait left out for him by Gracie and began to gobble it up.At the same time, the elderly lady sitting by her bedroom window squinted through her spectacles and picked up the phone. She dialled the number on the note she clutched in her hand.A couple of days later, I had a call from the nurse who had allowed me to search the gardens. ‘I must tell you about Gracie,’ she said with a chuckle.‘She’s been so happy since her adventure. She’s telling all the residents that she helped to solve Operation Columbus.’Adapted from Molly And Me by Colin Butcher (Michael Joseph, £12.99). ©Colin Butcher 2019.

Photograph: Nick BradshawThe .Minister for Health Simon Harris has sought the advice of Attorney General Seamus Woulfe on whether it is possible to make it mandatory for children to be vaccinated if they attend schools or crèches.The request comes as a United Nations report warned that the number of measles cases in Ireland had increased more than three-fold and that millions of children worldwide are missing out on the measles vaccine.The report says the number of Irish measles cases has risen by 244 per cent, from 25 in 2017 to 86 last year. So far this year in Ireland there have been 48 cases of measles, a highly contagious disease that can kill or cause blindness, deafness or brain damage. In response to a rise in measles cases there, British health secretary Matt Hancock has said he could not “rule out” making vaccination a mandatory prerequisite to attending crèche or school. Mr Harris on Friday said he was also considering such a move.“We obviously have a written constitution and we obviously need to take legal advice in relation to what we can and can’t do legislatively in this country,” Mr Harris said. “I haven’t made any firm decisions yet or consulted Government colleagues on the matter but I do feel very strongly about it. “I feel there is something irresponsible and that is against the public good sending an unvaccinated child into a school, into a crèche or into a public place where they could actually make other children sick, particularly young babies who might be too young to actually get vaccinated, who could then end up with a very significant disease and also vulnerable groups in our community.”‘Absolute nonsense’However, the Minister said there were more ways to increase take up rates than just making vaccination mandatory.“I also have my department doing an analysis on what other countries have done and it varies...But we need to do more than that. We need to form an alliance of healthcare professionals and policy makers to push back against the absolute nonsense that is put out by some, often on social media, in relation to vaccinations.”Mr Harris said there is a lot of “scaremongering” and “populist nonsense” on the issue and added he will write to every TD and senator to ask them to commit to supporting the childhood immunisation programme.In 2017, the Irish vaccination rate was estimated to be 92 per cent, up from 86 per cent in 2009. However, vaccination rates have fallen slightly in recent years.Peter Power, the Unicef Ireland chief executive, warned that measles would “always find unvaccinated children” and that the foundations for the ongoing global measles outbreak were laid years ago. “If we are serious about averting the spread of this dangerous but preventable disease, we need to vaccinate every child, in rich and poor countries alike.”Dr Lucy Jessop, head of the HSE national immunisation office, warned that one case of measles could infect up to 18 people and that the only protection was the MMR vaccine."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Union conference hears surgical consultants face premiums of up to \u0026euro400,000 per yearMayor unveils plaque in Cabra in tribute to \u0026lsquointernationally renowned\u0026rsquo craftsmanCounties in the south east worst hit as gusts as high as 122kmh recordedEmma Hurley\u0026rsquos efforts with Cork Penny Dinners highlighted at awards ceremonyCandidates out putting up campaign ads after strong winds blow them downMinister says doctors should help in fight against pseudoscience that was costing livesNo one injured in overnight incidents say garda\u0026iacute investigating ongoing criminal feudSimon Harris pledges process to address lower pay for consultants appointed before 2012\u0026lsquoIt is clear the commercial sector has abandoned rural Ireland,\u0026rsquo says CommissionerDublin councillor highlights large number of abandoned shopping trollies in the citySoldier F to be charged with murdering two people during 1972 Derry civil rights marchSligo cardiologist says man could do well at home with \u0026lsquojust a bit of assistance\u0026rsquoMourners at Superquinn founder\u0026rsquos funeral hear of a \u0026lsquotruly exceptional\u0026rsquo inidualHistorian Marisa McGlinchey on death of Lyra McKee and state of dissident republicanismVaradkar, May announce negotiations to restart Stormont will begin on May 7thPriest who spoke at Lyra McKee\u0026rsquos funeral urged politicians to take example from her \u0026lsquodetermined doggedness\u0026rsquoIncrease in cannabis, cocaine, heroin seizures shows role of internet in narcotics tradeGovernment wants to increase number of medical specialists in public hospitalsTeenager was subject of care order in 2012 following violent attack on her motherDeveloper Kieran Gannon wants to stop existing scheme and build taller blocks"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3872925.1556295878!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"people looking to come home to ireland cannot afford dublin","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Nicola Dunne, who works in London, is contemplating a return to her native Mayo.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Worcester-born Tom Wesley, 31, had been looking for an excuse to leave London when his Irish-born partner  got a new job in Ireland.Nicola Dunne is not tired of London, but there are days when it is exhausting. Like many others attending a London property show this week for those thinking of moving back to Ireland, she is contemplating a return.However, she is torn. “There is the worry that I will move back home and think what have I done. But then London has a bit of an expiry date on it. It’s just so draining,” she said.If she does come back, the Mayo-born Dunne, like others present at the invite-only Sherry FitzGerald London Property Show, is not thinking about living in Dublin, put off by the thought of paying high rents.From Mayo Abbey near Claremorris, Dunne moved to Leeds in 2008 before moving down to London eight years ago, working first for ITV News and now as a freelance stylist.“London is extortionate to live in and you get to a point where paying so much money for an apartment is just depressing. Dublin wouldn’t be any different,” she said.Saying she feels “like a Londoner”, Dunne is tempted by the slower pace Mayo could offer: “Whenever I go home I feel so relaxed and all I want to do is stay. Then I arrive back in London and the buzz is amazing.”Despite predictions that Brexit will increase demand in stock, the focus at the exhibition was on properties outside the capital, with sellers hoping to demonstrate the “revival” of regional Ireland.Des O’Malley, head of countrywide at Sherry FitzGerald, said more and more people were looking outside of Dublin, given prices in the capital: “Many people come over and look at Dublin.BrexitBrexit was an issue, but not overwhelmingly so, he said. “The underpinnings of the property market are very strong in the medium to long term. Unless there is a dramatic hard Brexit, we don’t expect any more price shifts.”Worcester-born Tom Wesley, 31, had been looking for an excuse to leave London. Then his Irish-born partner got a job in Ireland. One of his chief motivations for leaving is the “endless talk” about Brexit.“Honestly, I’m just so sick of hearing about Brexit. I could not care less any more,” says the civil engineer. “It does make me feel a bit embarrassed being from England. I have started looking for jobs, but not seriously yet.”Waterford native, 37-year-old John, no surname given, who has been in London for almost a decade, will move back home to his native county in July. “I had been looking to move out of London for a while,” he said, “There is definitely a pull home. Being from the countryside, I miss that element and London is just so busy. And then, of course, Brexit has given me an extra push.”But he will not be coming home alone, since he will be arriving back with his Portuguese boyfriend, Goncalo Gomes, 31, who will need to learn Irish if he is to continue his career as a primary school teacher.“We will be heading to the shops and the pub in the Gaeltacht, which is only up the road,” said Gomes, “We don’t want to live in the craziness of London any more. We want to visit crazy and then go home to our nice lives.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3874035.1556380614!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"politicians scramble to replace posters after storm hannah massacre","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tStorm damaged election posters in Dublin city on Saturday.

Dublin city councillor Mannix Flynn said he spent Saturday morning fixing his posters back onto poles.“Nobody wants anyone to get injured so this means candidates need to make sure our posters are in an orderly manner,” the Independent councillor said. “The posters tend to slip down or get blown off when there are strong winds. I realigned two other candidates’ posters that had slipped right down. “I would ask the public to report any posters that have fallen and candidates to tell each other. It’s our responsibility to make sure they’re correctly maintained.” Una Power, Green party candidate for Killiney-Shankill said she was missing a “handful” of posters following Storm Hannah. “I found a few that were down but there’s a handful completely missing so I’m searching high and low for them, I haven’t found them yet. Dublin City Council said it had a team out working this weekend, cleaning up election posters in “inappropriate places”, including those which were blown down due to the strong gusts. Local authorities are responsible for the removal of posters which constitute a hazard to either pedestrians or road users. Any electionreferendum posters in place before or after the stipulated timeframe can face an on-the-spot litter fine of €150. There are several restrictions around the erection of posters, and they cannot be placed too close to the ground, or on ESB electricity poles for safety reasons.A council spokeswoman was unable to say on Saturday whether candidates could face fines in relation to posters that are blown down due to severe weather conditions.

The Minister said the overwhelming amount of parents in Ireland had their children vaccinated.“We also need to be clear if you have a young baby and that baby is too young to receive their vaccination, that young baby is at risk if there is another, older child who has not received their vaccination.”He said parents who did not have their children vaccinated, were not just making a decision in relation to their own child but one which could impact on others.“It is absolutely irresponsible and reprehensible to send your child without a vaccination to a school or creche where they could spread diseases.”He said he was grappling with the question of how to deal with that issue.The Minister said he had asked the Attorney General to look at the constitutional position and to advise if there were any legislative solutions.He said he wanted the Oireachtas to speak with one voice on the issue and to establish an alliance of health professionals.Mr Harris said he would report back to Cabinet colleagues on the issue of mandatory vaccination when he had received the Attorney General’s advice.However the Minister ruled out imposing financial sanctions on parents who did not get their children vaccinated if mandatory vaccination was not permitted on constitutional grounds."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3873974.1556382600!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"storm hannah power restored to 31 000 homes after strong winds","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA festival tent in Fenit was blown down as storm Hannah hit Kerry. Photograph: Domnick WalshThe storm battered the south west of the country particularly hard on Friday night. Forecasters had issued several weather warnings, including a red warning of “violent gusts”.\u0026nbspThe highest recorded gusts were at Mace Head in Galway, where 122kmh was observed, while gusts reached 119kmh at Shannon Airport.The ESB said there were around 1,800 homes and businesses without power shortly after 5pm, with those affected predominately in counties Clare, Limerick, Kerry and Tipperary.“ESB Networks crews have been continuing efforts to repair the electricity network since first light this morning,” a spokesman for the ESB said.“At the height of the storm this morning, 33,000 customers were impacted.”Crews would continue to work into the evening and the ESB expected the vast majority of remaining cohort to be back tonight, he added.“All available resources from ESB Networks are deployed to carry out repairs to the network and restore power.”Additional crews from less impacted areas of the country have been deployed in areas of west Munster that have seen most of the storm damage. These include county Clare, the Iveragh and Dingle peninsulas, north Kerry, west Limerick and parts of Tipperary.The ESB said the damage to the electricity network is mainly attributable to trees falling on overhead lines as a result of the high winds.Real time information on power outages and restoration times is available on the PowerCheck App or www.esbpowercheck.ie.Met Éireann said that “very windy” conditions continued on Saturday morning before easing.“Whilst the winds will abate, it will still be windy into the afternoon, with brisk northwest wind steering down a mix of sunny spells and scattered heavy showers,” the weather service tweeted.The forecaster said much of the country will be dry by Saturday evening, with spells of sunshine. However, later in the night patchy outbreaks of light rain or drizzle will develop in the south and west, with temperatures dropping to between 3 and 6 degrees.It will be generally cloudy on Sunday with scattered patches of light rain but there is expected to be a good deal of dry weather overall. Sunny intervals will develop, the best of these due in the south and west of the country in the afternoon. Highest temperatures will be between 12 and 17 degrees in moderate southwesterly breezes.Monday is due to be mild with temperatures likely to fall again from Tuesday through to Friday.Met Éireann meteorologist Matthew Martin said Storm Hannah moved “quite quickly” over the country.“It’s already over northern England. There will be strong blustery north westerly winds that are going to continue to moderate during the day,” he said.“It’s really an improving picture - rain in Ulster is going to clear out and then it’s going to be a bright day with some sunny spells and a few passing showers.”Mr Martin said there is a “mixed outlook” for next week, with temperatures near average.AA Roadwatch said roads were mainly damp or wet across the country on Saturday morning with wind-blown debris likely on secondary roads.It has advised motorists to slow down and leave extra distance between vehicles in front and to be mindful of motorcyclists, cyclists and pedestrians."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Six children among those killed in shootout between troops and suspected militantsAttacks show even prominent members of the community can fall prey to radicalisationUS president responds as Kim Jong-un warns a state of hostility could returnSoldiers exchange gunfire with suspects linked to Easter attacks as tensions highAuthorities now believe up to 260 killed in terrorist attacks on Easter SundayMost who died were locals, but victims \u0026ndash including children \u0026ndash came from across the worldAttackers identified amid row over security failings ahead of Easter bombingsMeeting comes two months afer North Korean leader\u0026rsquos failed summit with Donald Trump\u0026lsquoWe maintain our determination to achieve universal suffrage ... this won\u0026rsquot change\u0026rsquoAt least 16 killed as 6.1 magnitude earthquake strikes area 110km north of ManilaAdvanced ocean research vessel joins search for missing stealth fighter that crashed into the sea off northeastern Japan on April 9thFirst burials take place as death toll following Easter Sunday bombings rises to 321People present at mosques during attacks can apply, as can immediate family membersPM\u0026rsquos party displays anti-Muslim bias while campaigning in Hindu-majority countryNazarbayev backs Tokayev in central Asian state where elections not judged free or fairJournalists jailed for seven years for work on investigation into massacre of RohingyaMeeting expected to take place in the far-eastern port of VlaostockMore British, Spanish, Portuguese, Swiss and Turkish are some of the 32 foreigners killedSecurity agencies got specific intelligence on April 11th that a radical Islamist organisation was planning to bomb Catholic churchesAsos stakeholder Anders Holch Povlsen lost three of his four children in the attacks"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph audio briefings sign new whatsapp group","story":"Want audio briefings direct to your WhatsApp?

Early childhood is a period of rapid physical and cognitive development and a time during which a child\u0027s habits are formed.The recommendations go much further than recent guidance from the UK\u0027s chief medical officers.This recommended a break from screens every two hours for all children. It also said phones should be banned from meal times and overnight. At a glance | WHO guidelines on physical activity for childrenThe guidance, which will be launched at the European Congress on Obesity in Glasgow this weekend sets out different advice for children of different ages, up to the age of five. It stresses the importance of avoiding sedentary screen time, in a bid to ensure children get sufficient exercise. One in five children in England are overweight or obese by the time they start primary school, rising to one in three by the time they leave. But some experts said parents were being given conflicting advice based on limited evidence. In January the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health shied away from recommending a limit, but said children should not be exposed to screens for at least an hour before bedtime. Tim Smith, Reader in Cognitive Psychology, Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development, Birkbeck, University of London, said: “In recent months UK parents of 0- to five-year-olds and early-years practitioners have been bombarded with conflicting recommendations and guidelines about how and whether they should be managing their children\u0027s screen time and sedentary behaviour, e.g. from the RCPCH and Chief Medical Officers.“The release of new WHO guidelines does not help to clarify the situation, as its specific recommendations with regards to \u0027sedentary screen time\u0027 and their negative impacts on physical, cognitive and psychosocial health are, by its own admission based on \u0027moderate to very low-quality evidence\u0027.Duty of Care CampaignWorld\u0026#39s fastest marathon runner Eliud Kipchoge was inspired by Roger BannisterExtraordinary tale of fake German heiress set for silver screen as Netflix and HBO battle for rightsPease pudding disappears from menus in all but its northern eastern heartlandsGame industry \u0026#39will suffer\u0026#39 from new Natural England shooting licencesCyprus protest vigil held for military officer\u0026#39s seven assumed victims  Net closing around alleged ringleader of audacious North Korea embassy raidComment: Britain will be worse off if punitive taxes force billionaires like me to leave the countryComment: What the dickens is Emma Thompson talking about?Spain prepares to go to the polls as country ided over hard-Right party VoxJapan\u0026#39s new empress ignites hopes for modern era as battle commences over royal succession lawsSister of Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u0026#39s royal wedding cellist is signed with top record labelChina\u0026#39s president calls for more countries to join Belt and Road initiativeLuther star Idris Elba marries girlfriend Sabrina Dhowre in lavish Morocco ceremonyTheresa May donates historical murder mystery to phone box library6 children among 15 dead after gun battle between Sri Lankan military and Easter bombing suspects Woman and \u0026#39always smiling\u0026#39 young boy found dead at Suffolk propertyInside the jihadist training camp that should have warned Sri Lanka of Easter bombingsTommy Robinson in line for up to £2million in taxpayers\u0026#39 cash if elected to European ParliamentComment: Populism, like climate change, is a product of today\u0026#39s mass prosperityMeet the 85-year-old runner taking on his 39th London marathonWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/04/27/TELEMMGLPICT000195338640_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"chinas president calls countries join belt road initiative","story":"China\u0026#39s President Xi Jinping waves as he arrives for a press briefing at the end of the final day of the Belt and Road Forum at the China National Convention Centre at the Yanqi Lake venue outside BeijingXi Jinping, China\u0027s president, has urged more nations to sign up to the country\u0027s vast Belt and Road infrastructure project, amid concerns that it is setting debt traps for poorer countries and bolstering Beijing’s political influence abroad.Beijing said that 115 governments had signed up to Belt and Road, which was announced in 2013 and will see trade routes linking China to other Asian nations plus Africa and Europe.Attracted by billions of US dollars-worth of investment, 37 world leaders attended this week’s Belt and Road Forum in the Chinese capital.Mr Xi used the forum, jokingly referred to as “Barf” by some critics, as a recruitment drive for both governments and businesses. We need to encourage the full participation of more countries and companies, he said in the Chinese capital.On Friday he said: We welcome the participation of multilateral and international financial institutions in Belt and Road investment and financing… with involvement of multiple stake holders we can surely deliver benefits to all.First row from the left: Chile\u0026#39s President Sebastian Pinera, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping wave to the media while posing for a photo during the Belt and Road Forum in Beijing,Rather than benefits, critics are concerned that nations are signing up to crippling debt and pressure to kowtow to Beijing’s authoritarian influence. The Morgan Stanley bank predicted that China could spend around £1 trillion on the project overall.Belt and Road-related loans worth over £70 billion have been loaned from China to overseas.In 2017 Sri Lanka handed over Hambantota, a port on the country’s south coast, to China on a 99-year lease after accruing debts of over£6 billion to Chinese state-owned companies.Britain has not signed up to the Belt and Road project, with Prime Minister Theresa May saying that although China was a “natural partner”, the Belt and Road project must reach “international standards”.In March, Italy signed up to the project, becoming the first G7 nation to do so. Switzerland is expected to sign a memorandum of understanding to sign up to it on Sunday.Africa has been another focal point of Belt and Road investment, with Ethiopia this week saying that China had written off interest payments the former country had owed the latter through to the end of 2018.In 2017 China opened a military outpost in the in Djibouti, a small Horn of Africa nation also signed up to Belt and Road.The first offshore wind turbine tower is hoisted from the port of Nanjing, east China\u0026#39s jiangsu provinceBeijing denies expansionist ambitions, but the US is concerned about Belt and Road shoring up China’s military and political clout. However, Mr Xi touted his vast project as marking China’s further “opening up”.He said: “We are convinced that a more open China will further integrate itself into the world and deliver greater progress and prosperity for both China and the world at large.”At the forum Russian President Vladimir Putin praised the project: a move that will further rile the US, which did not send a delegation to the event. Xi did not directly mention China’s trade war with the US, but said that China would be tougher in intellectual property violations and would not undergo currency devaluation.World leaders from Malaysia, Pakistan, Vietnam, the Philippines and Myanmar were among those attending the forum. Mr Xi said that over £49.5 billion-worth of deals were signed at the event.Please review our commenting policyWorld\u0026#39s fastest marathon runner Eliud Kipchoge was inspired by Roger BannisterExtraordinary tale of fake German heiress set for silver screen as Netflix and HBO battle for rightsPease pudding disappears from menus in all but its northern eastern heartlandsGame industry \u0026#39will suffer\u0026#39 from new Natural England shooting licencesCyprus protest vigil held for military officer\u0026#39s seven assumed victims  Net closing around alleged ringleader of audacious North Korea embassy raidComment: Britain will be worse off if punitive taxes force billionaires like me to leave the countryComment: What the dickens is Emma Thompson talking about?Spain prepares to go to the polls as country ided over hard-Right party VoxJapan\u0026#39s new empress ignites hopes for modern era as battle commences over royal succession lawsSister of Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u0026#39s royal wedding cellist is signed with top record labelLuther star Idris Elba marries girlfriend Sabrina Dhowre in lavish Morocco ceremonyTheresa May donates historical murder mystery to phone box library6 children among 15 dead after gun battle between Sri Lankan military and Easter bombing suspects Woman and \u0026#39always smiling\u0026#39 young boy found dead at Suffolk propertyInside the jihadist training camp that should have warned Sri Lanka of Easter bombingsTommy Robinson in line for up to £2million in taxpayers\u0026#39 cash if elected to European ParliamentComment: Populism, like climate change, is a product of today\u0026#39s mass prosperityMeet the 85-year-old runner taking on his 39th London marathonMarathon training risk over fitness trackers that \u0026#39can\u0026#39t be trusted\u0026#39 to measure distanceWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2019/04/24/TELEMMGLPICT000195069775_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqH8oGYaaASnJZUiuddQ1p_w4wRx7k9ixzqw8pl8JMpsM.jpeg?imwidth","title":"feast fruitcakes really future british politics","story":"Having a personality bigger than your principles is a dangerous trait for a politicianAn opera singer, an ex-lads’ magazine editor and Ann Widdecombe walk into a parliamentary chamber: not the beginning of a joke – or a game of kiss, marry, kill – but the current leadership hopefuls for Nigel Farage’s new Brexit Party.

It\u0027s time to consider a change in approachClick to followThe IndependentHMRC has been given extra resources to tackle non payment of the minimum wage The problem with the welcome war between Labour and the Conservatives over minimum wage rates is that it means nothing if employers ignore them.\u0026nbspAccording to the Low Pay Commission, a record number of people were underpaid last year by those that chose to do just that.\u0026nbspIn a report published just a few weeks after the minimum wage celebrated its 20 year anniversary, it put the number at 439,000\u0026nbspand rising.\u0026nbsp\u0027Worrying\u0027 rise in number of people being paid below minimum wageMinimum wage at 20: Too many employers still trying to get around itTwenty years on, the national minimum wage is a successYounger workers were particularly vulnerable, even though employers are allowed to pay them less. Ditto women. The report tagged childcare as the occupation with the highest proportion of underpaid workers, with hospitality and retail, which similarly employ an unusually high proportion of female workers, also high on the list.\u0026nbspBut hang on a second, I hear you say. Wasn’t HM Revenue \u0026amp Customs (HMRC) given a bunch of extra cash by the Department for Business, Energy \u0026amp Industrial Strategy (BEIS) to bring enforcement actions?\u0026nbspThat is indeed the case, as BEIS was keen to stress in response to the report. And there is evidence that it is having results. HMRC identified an all-time high number of workers as underpaid in the 2017-18 financial year, securing pay rises and arrears for them while also levying fines.\u0026nbspYet the number of cases overall stood still. The figures were driven by a relatively small number of big cases.\u0026nbspWhat this tells you is that HMRC is deploying its resources where it can get the most bang for its buck.\u0026nbspAn eminently sensible policy given that its budget is not unlimited, even after the increases it has enjoyed and the complexities and expense involved in investigating underpayment – and bringing miscreant employers to book.The trouble is that this is inevitably going to lead to a long tail of often smaller employers that are cheating the system and may justifiably feel there is little risk to them in doing so.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

Sometimes it can be as simple as delaying the introduction of new rates. Sometimes it’s a lot worse than that.\u0026nbspHelpfully the commission, which also advises on the rates themselves, has some sensible ideas for addressing the issue, which can be summarised as calling for a more holistic approach.\u0026nbspAs part of this, it wants to see more investment in communicating with workers, and employers, together with efforts to build confidence in complaints processes, and to help workers to use them.\u0026nbspIt would also like government to work more closely with unions, which obviously have considerable expertise in this area through the work they do for low paid members and could provide a great deal of assistance.\u0026nbspCheating the minimum wage not only cheats workers. It cheats the competitors of businesses that fail to pay it by disadvantaging them.\u0026nbspIn treating unions as the enemy, as the Conservative government is frequently guilty of doing, it risks undermining the success of one of its flagship policies.

But it’s only recently that everyone has been able to see what the store has in stock\u0026nbspfor them.Kibworth\u0026nbspBooks is among hundreds of independent UK booksellers who have started using NearSt technology, which allows small retailers to compete with Amazon by making their inventory visible in online searches. As well as listing stock online for potential customers to browse, NearSt has an add-on feature that makes the store appear in searches when people in the area Google the specific title they want.Retailers say high street footfall up March but shoppers didn’t spend Debenhams is on the brink, but could a retail genius save it?Government must protect British retailers from giants like Amazon“Now we have 8,000 titles findable by people who are walking past the shop, or in the pub three minutes down the road,” says Debbie James, who started Kibworth Books when she left the music industry 10 years ago. “They can Google a book from the pub and our shop will come up before Amazon, Waterstones and WHSmith.”NearSt was founded by Max Kreijn and Nick Brackenbury in 2015 with one mission: to get more people into high street shops. The startup comes at a time of rapid change for UK high streets. More than 30 major retailers have shut since Woolworths closed in 2008, according to the ONS. Job losses from the retail sector are expected to rise nearly 20 per cent in 2019, putting 164,000 people out of work and leading to the closure of a further 22,000 stores, according to the Centre for Retail Research.It’s an interesting time in retail,” Brackenbury says. “I think the high street has a ton of value but it needs to be unlocked.”Brackenbury and Kreijn met 10 years ago when they were working together at Ogilvy, the advertising agency. Brackenbury was a graduate trainee and Kreijn was a strategist in a small team of three or four people doing early social analytics.\u0026nbspNot long after, Kreijn left the firm to start his own company, an innovation consultancy helping big companies behave more like startups. He was spending a lot of time working out how big companies could take old assets and come up with something new, when he had a “literal lightbulb moment” – a lightbulb in his living room blew, and when he Googled for a replacement, the search threw up online shops, rather than stores near him.The next time Kreijn saw Brackenbury, he pitched him the lightbulb problem: how could they unlock the retail industry’s massive stock inventory, and make it available in the place where most people were starting to shop – online?\u0026nbsp“I told him I was sure someone had figured out his problem already,” Brackenbury says. “But when I looked at it I thought, ‘My god, why hasn’t anyone done this?’ And it turns out no one has done this because it is quite hard.”The technology developed by NearSt echoes work by Alibaba, the biggest e-commerce company in China, which has been converting 100,000 retail stores into Alibaba-linked smart stores. Customers in these smart stores are able to source products missing in some stores from others nearby, so they know where to look next – or where to order the product for home delivery.NearSt has had early success with booksellers as many of them use the same book supplier, Gardners Books, which makes it easy for NearSt to digitise the inventory used by multiple independent stores. But it is much more of a challenge to digitise and extract the data from hundreds of thousands of small shops.\u0026nbsp“The inventory is locked away in these archaic inventory systems that weren’t built for the modern world,” Brackenbury says. “So if you search for a product on your phone, it shows you hundreds of products in warehouses up the M1 corridor, even though you could be stood outside a shop that sells that very same product and you just don’t know about it. That seems bonkers.”NearSt has developed software to extract and understand rudimentary stock data and feed it into the internet, so that Google doesn’t just show online results, but also local availability.\u0026nbspIf an online inventory is the best way for retailers to take back the bite of their profit stolen by Amazon, why haven’t more done it? “The data challenge is hard for a retailer to do,” Brackenbury says. Many companies that do have digital inventories are using mainframe technology that was built in 1988. Even after the store has established a barcode, a stock level and a price, they must also have pictures, product descriptions and titles before it can be listed as a product online.\u0026nbsp“It’s a huge ask, and they’re busy so they don’t do it,” Brackenbury says. “We connect into old systems, extract information, understand what it is and enrich it so the retailer doesn’t have to do anything. They keep managing the inventory in the same way, but we make it visible on the web.”Last year, NearSt was approached by a Google employee who explained that the search company wanted to list local inventory. “It’s an incredible way for us to make a huge impact,” Brackenbury says of the partnership. “We looked at who we wanted to feed data into, and then Google came to us and said they could feed it into the world’s biggest search engine – that’s the way to achieve that mission.”The company has raised £1.5m to date and is in the middle of another funding round. Brackenbury knows that as the company’s mission grows, it must do what it can to safeguard the privacy of stores. He imagines opening inventory data to other technology companies, like Facebook and Uber, so that users can get instant delivery of branded spirits from local stores by nearby couriers, for instance. But he says this would have to be done with the consent of the retailers, so their inventory only appears when they want it to.At Kibworth Books, James say the decision to sign up to NearSt was a “no brainer”. She recently paid an extra £2 a day for the store to appear in local Google searches for titles around World Book Day. “I did it for two weeks to get my shop out there when families who weren’t aware of us were searching where to get the books from,” she says. “Looking at the statistics it was worth it, you can safely say footfall increased.”Independent bookshops on the rise for the second year runningBrackenbury meanwhile says that in a few years, live inventory technology will be so commonplace we will wonder how we ever did without it: “Within three or four years, this real time local inventory will seem completely normal to us in the same way that now\u0026nbspif you look up on your phone what time Boots shuts, Google tells you the closing time for the nearest store. Four years ago that didn’t exist,” he says. Whether it can save the high street remains to be seen.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The new owners include Barclays and Bank of Ireland, as well as US investment firms.It first put forward proposals in October to shut 50 stores over three years as it bids to cut costs. More detailed plans have now been formally laid out and will be put to creditors, 75 per cent of whom must approve before they can go ahead.Terry\u0026nbspDuddy,\u0026nbspDebenhams\u0026nbspexecutive chairman said: “Debenhams has a clear strategy and a bright future, but in order for the business to prosper, we need to restructure the group’s store portfolio and its balance sheet, which are not appropriate for today’s much changed retail environment.Created with Sketch.

A creditor vote\u0026nbspwill take place on 9 May.KPMG, which is handling the CVA, said consultations had\u0026nbspalready taken place with key creditors with further talks planned\u0026nbspto ensure the full details of the proposal are understood.Suppliers\u0026nbspwill continue to be paid “on time and in full, and terms of employment are not impacted”, KPMG said.A key part of rescue plans for the retailer is to slash its rent bill by closing stores and renegotiating leases with landlords.Leases will be retained at current rents for 39 stores, with the 22 stores earmarked for closure seeking rent reductions of 50 per cent until next year. The remaining stores will pay 25 to 50 per cent less rent under the plans.Debenhams sneaks out confirmation of CEO Bucher\u0027s departureHigh costs and large debts have made it difficult for\u0026nbspDebenhams\u0026nbspto invest as it attempts to deal with the threat posed by changing consumer habits and the rise of online giants such as Amazon.Gary Carter, national officer for the GMB union, said the closures were a travesty.\u0026nbsp“Although many will not be surprised by the closure announcements\u0026nbsp - this is devastating news for Debenhams employees who have battled hard to keep the company afloat, Mr Carter said.“They will join the tens of thousands of retail workers made redundant in recent months.“It’s another hammer blow for the high street, another established name gone and more retail space left empty.Last week, Debenhams chief executive Sergio Boucher quit\u0026nbspafter two difficult years in charge.\u0026nbspHe had faced fierce attacks from Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley, who was seeking to take over at Debenhams and described the administration as a “national scandal”.Mr Ashley’s company owned a 30 per cent stake in Debenhams\u0026nbspbut all shareholders were wiped out as part of the administration process.The stores to close in 2020:Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Welcome steps have been taken in that direction, but this work shows more needs to be done.”A government spokesperson said: “It is illegal not to pay the minimum wage and we are cracking down on employers who fail to pay the national minimum wage and national living wage.“We have almost doubled HMRC’s budget to £26.3m since 2015, ensuring it has the resources needed to investigate employers who break these rules.“HMRC has collected £15.6m of underpayment for over 200,000 workers and issued £14.1m\u0026nbspin financial penalties to employers that breached the rules – the highest amount ever.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Welcome steps have been taken in that direction, but this work shows more needs to be done.”A government spokesperson said: “It is illegal not to pay the minimum wage and we are cracking down on employers who fail to pay the national minimum wage and national living wage.“We have almost doubled HMRC’s budget to £26.3m since 2015, ensuring it has the resources needed to investigate employers who break these rules.“HMRC has collected £15.6m of underpayment for over 200,000 workers and issued £14.1m\u0026nbspin financial penalties to employers that breached the rules – the highest amount ever.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But this isn’t a typical beauty pageant.The women are from former Soviet Union countries, and on Saturday, are competing for the title “Miss USSR UK”.Some have travelled to London from abroad for the contest, others are based in Britain.The USSR Empire may have collapsed 28 years ago – but in London, the idea feels\u0026nbsp alive and carefully preserved.“Miss USSR” was held in Moscow for three years before the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. Its successor, “Miss USSR UK” has run in London for seven years.The contest is now growing\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspin 2018, the same competition took place in Monaco, and according to the organisers, is set to be an annual event. There are also plans now to stage “Miss USSR” in Montenegro.But this year’s main contest is taking place on 27 April in London’s luxurious Hilton Hotel in Mayfair.It unites women from across the former Soviet countries – including those the USSR occupied in 1940.Created with Sketch.The world today, according to the Soviet Union in 1960 Show all 5Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Driving force: prototype autonomous cars in a sunny Soviet 2017Face time: live video communication, as imagined in 1960Lines man: the International  across the north of EurasiaWater way: connecting the Arctic Ocean with the Caspian SeaPolar express: high-speed atomic-powered trains across the Bering StraitDriving force: prototype autonomous cars in a sunny Soviet 2017Face time: live video communication, as imagined in 1960Lines man: the International  across the north of EurasiaWater way: connecting the Arctic Ocean with the Caspian SeaPolar express: high-speed atomic-powered trains across the Bering StraitIndeed the vast majority of this year’s applicants appear to come from Ukraine, despite the ongoing conflict with Russia.“We will show how beauty will save the world,” claims the Miss USSR UK website.But the competition has faced stiff criticism from various sides.“It shows a serious lack of taste and historical awareness,” former British ambassador to Latvia Ian Bond told The Independent, now foreign policy director at the Centre for European Reform.“Imagine if someone organised a \u0027Miss Third Reich\u0027 competition for women from countries occupied by the Nazis? Or even \u0027Miss British Empire\u0027?!” he adds.\u0026nbspThe organisers, however, deny that there is any ideological motivation behind the contest.\u0026nbsp“Our name has nothing to do with politics,” Kateryna Burceva, who co-organised the contest in 2012, tells\u0026nbspThe Independent. Burceva is no longer involved in Miss USSR.Karina Barulina, a 2014 finalist from Moscow, agrees.It’s only named after the Soviet Empire, she says, to make it more inclusive.“It had been called this way deliberately to avoid discrimination, because it’s not only Russian girls participating, but Russian-speaking girls also. This name makes it more understandable.”Applicants shoot and present videos about themselves and their countries, whilst wearing in national costumes on stage.On the contest’s website, an applicant from Crimea is listed among the girls representing Russia.Russia annexed the Ukrainian peninsula in 2014, in\u0026nbsp a move considered illegal by the UN General Assembly. The vast majority of the international communities does not recognise Crimea as a part of Russia.Hunt enrages Slovenia by wrongly saying it was \u0027Soviet vassal state\u0027And while the organisers insist that the contest is non-political, they also invite diplomats to the show every year.However, Ukrainian, Belarusian and Uzbekistani diplomats said that they were first told about the contest by The Independent and insisted they have never attended.Titova was reluctant to name them, adding: “Kazakhstani diplomats attend with a great pleasure. I just do not know to what extent it is politically correct to mention them.”Moldovan diplomats came to the event back in 2016 according to the “Miss USSR UK” Instagram page.Representatives from the Kazakhstan and Moldovan embassies in the UK did not immediately respond to The Independent’s request for comment.Several former Soviet countries have spoken out against the competition.“The invitation of Lithuanian girls to participate in the event, named on behalf of the Soviet Union, shows great disrespect for the restored independence of Lithuania,” says a statement on the Lithuanian Embassy’s website.Imagine if someone organised a \u0027Miss Third Reich\u0027 competition for women from countries occupied by the Nazis? Or even \u0027Miss British EmpireLithuanian diplomats in the UK tell The Independent that they have asked the contest’s organisers to remove any reference to Lithuania from its literature, but that the organisers did not oblige.\u0026nbspA spokesperson from the Latvian Embassy told to The Independent that they advise women not to take part in the event, stressing that those who do, “by no means represent Latvia.”Aliyor Tilavov, political counsel at the Uzbekistan embassy, was similarly unimpressed.“We do not approve this contest and we have no connection to it. If someone has nostalgia for a Soviet Union, we do not,” he says.The contest also gathers “representatives of royal families, lords, directors and CEOs of global corporations,” according to its website.Titova, the director, declined to provide further information on this year’s guests.“They are quite influential and noble people. We care about our clients and do not disclose this information.”For John Lough, Russia expert at Chatham House and a former NATO representative in Moscow, the event seeks to reinforce a longing for the Soviet Union, and hope to use such VIP guests to do so.“It possibly seeks to reinforce an agenda that the Russian state would be very comfortable with, that ‘we are all one big happy family, whatever happened in history. We are all together’.”“That is clearly not consistent with reality,” Lough adds.Women compete to win a contract with an international modelling agency, which changes annually.This year, it remains a secret.Titova says that the first runners-ups will also get a trip to the hotel Rixos in Kemer on Turkey’s coast and a holiday exploring Montenegro on a 42-metre luxury yacht called Riana.“Miss USSR UK” was first launched in 2012 by Titova.If someone has nostalgia for a Soviet Union, we do notShe had moved to London a couple of years earlier to work as a nightclub promoter, but says she soon decided to promote her own beauty pageant.To take part in the contest, there is an online vote for the best-looking women. Votes have to be purchased, at a cost of 1 euro for three votes.The winner is likely determined by how much money backers are ready to spend, as the number of votes a person can buy is unlimited.But money itself is not a guarantee of getting a place in the show in the first place, says Julia Rebenok, a 2018 finalist from Ukraine.Women who win this first stage then have to pass a Skype interview.“The organisers look at your body shape and ask you to do a small catwalk on the camera,” Rebenok says.Selected candidates then pay a £300 participation fee and the preparation for the show begins in earnest.Inspirational and transformational coaches are employed to train the girls prior to the competition.The webinars are available for anyone to join. During one, Ekaterina Lebedeva, a psychologist and sexologist, teaches the applicants how to produce pheromones while performing on the stage.It possibly seeks to reinforce an agenda that the Russian state would be very comfortable with, that ‘we are all one big happy family, whatever happened in history“Listen, girls, you should remind yourself where our vaginal tube is. Now we begin to compress it, we compress our vaginal muscles. One, two, three…”“At the beauty contest, there will be men among the judges. You do not even need perfume. You will emit a smell of sexuality and it is not vulgar. Male judges will not understand why they like you, but they will like you,” Lebedeva continues.Lebedeva participated in the “Miss USSR” contest in Monaco last year, where she met her future husband, a Russian drummer. She was introduced to him by a contest’s choreographer, she says during her webinar.“I participated in the contest to get married,” she confesses.“Perhaps someone will see you at the beauty contest as there are some decent men. Behave properly.”The tickets to the show, starting at £400, are not available to the general public. The event is private - for “VIP clients” only.“A person files an application on the website and our team decides whether to approve it or decline,” says Titova.\u0026nbspTop TV and pop-stars perform at the events.Sonique, Sheyla Bonnick from Boney M and DJ Smash are among those who have provided entertainment in recent years.Despite the extravagance of the contest, “Miss USSR Management Ltd”, the company, owned by Titova, does not earn much, according to its balance sheets filed on Companies House.In 2016 the company first declared profit - £877 of current assets. In 2017 it showed a negative balance of £6,308.How Tintin satirised the Soviet UnionThe contest, though, has a strong financial backing from sponsors.“As long as sponsors pay, the contest exists,” says ex-organiser Burceva.Among the sponsors are London Luxury Chauffeuring, Caviar House, and The Elite London – \u0026nbspan exclusive jet-set lifestyle event for rich people.However, by far the biggest company backing Miss USSR UK is Rixos, the luxury chain of 25 hotels around the world.Rixos was founded by Turkish businessmen Fettah Tamince, but, according to emails leaked through Football Leaks and published by The Black Sea news agency in 2016, 50 per cent of the Rixos shares are owned by a Kazakh businessman Tevfik Arif. He has extensive links to Russia and used to work in Moscow for 17 years in the Soviet Ministry of Trade.He is also the founder of the Bayrock Group, which has worked with the Trump Organization on multiple projects.Arif was previously reported to be involved in a sex scandal - he had been arrested together with nine prostitutes from Russia during a party on the yacht in Turkey in 2010 and charged with financing an international prostitution ring, but in 2011 was acquitted.As long as sponsors pay, the contest existsEighty kilometres away lies the Rixos Sungate, where the finalists of “Miss USSR UK” spent a holiday in spring 2018. The next visit is planned for this summer.Sponsors put money into “Miss USSR UK” to advertise their businesses, Titova says.However, not many sponsors place the competition’s logo on their own websites.“We make a marketing strategy for a year and offer opportunities for companies to attract new clients,” she says.\u0026nbsp“Plus a photo shoot with our contestants.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The scenario has been developed by one of the Nasa organisations tasked with studying such near-earth objects, or NEOs.It will bring together not just Nasa\u0026nbspbut other international organisations to test out their response. Such exercises are used across the disaster response sector, to ensure that the real responses are as fast and effective as possible.These exercises have really helped us in the planetary\u0026nbspdefense\u0026nbspcommunity to understand what our colleagues on the disaster management side need to know, said Lindley Johnson, NASA\u0027s Planetary\u0026nbspDefense\u0026nbspOfficer.

Groups such as Nasa\u0027s\u0026nbspPlanetary\u0026nbspDefense\u0026nbspCoordination Office (PDCO) as well as the European Space Agency\u0027s Space Situational Awareness-NEO Segment and the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) have been working to better communicate the danger that such objects pose to Earth.Universe expanding faster than expected, Nasa data confirmsAs part of that mission, officials will play out such a scenario in an attempt to demonstrate how Earth might respond.There is no strict script in such an exercise. Instead, it will be used to test out how\u0026nbspNEO observers, space agency officials, emergency managers, decision makers and citizens would respond to the threat of an impact, and how that might become clear.It will start with the story that on 26 March, astronomers have found an NEO that could be hazardous to Earth. They will be told that it has been tracked for a\u0026nbsp few months and that it has a one in 100 chance of hitting Earth in 2027 – the chances that would require action from people on Earth.Those taking part will discuss possible preparations: how they would explore the asteroid, work out the best ways of deflecting it and dealing with its impact effects.Nasa has already participated in such exercises, working on some with\u0026nbspthe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Those exercises brough representatives from a variety of different federal agencies, including the departments of Defense and State.Previous exercises showed that the focus of emergency management officials was not on scientific details. Instead, they just want to know when, where and how an asteroid will hit the Earth, as well as what sort of damage is done, according to FEMA.Nasa continues to work on that science, however, in an attempt to better improve humanity\u0027s ability to predict the exact location and effects of any impact.NASA and FEMA will continue to conduct periodic exercises with a continually widening community of US\u0026nbspgovernment agencies and international partners, said Leviticus Lewis of the Response Operations Division for\u0026nbspFEMA. They are a great way for us to learn how to work together and meet each other\u0027s needs and the objectives laid out in the White House National NEO Preparedness Action Plan.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Gemini IV crew conducted scientific experiments, including photography of Earth\u0027s weather and terrain, for the remainder of their four-day mission following Ed White\u0027s historic spacewalk on June 31230 Frosty slopes of MarsThis image of an area on the surface of Mars, approximately 1.5 by 3 kilometers in size, shows frosted gullies on a south-facing slope within a crater. The image was taken by Nasa\u0027s HiRISE camera, which is mounted on its Mars Reconaissance Orbiter1330 Yellowstone from spaceNASA astronaut Reid Wiseman shared this image of Yellowstone via his twitter accountThis near-infrared color image shows a specular reflection, or sunglint, off of a hydrocarbon lake named Kivu Lacus on Saturn\u0027s moon TitanAlthough Mimas and Pandora, shown here, both orbit Saturn, they are very different moons. Pandora, small by moon standards (50 miles or 81 kilometers across) is elongated and irregular in shape. Mimas (246 miles or 396 kilometers across), a medium-sized moon, formed into a sphere due to self-gravity imposed by its higher massAn X1.6 class solar flare flashes in the middle of the sun in this image taken 10 September, captured by NASA\u0027s Solar Dynamics ObservatoryAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory.

The image shows the robotic arm extended to the rock called Adirondack1930 Morning Aurora From the Space StationNasa astronaut Scott Kelly captured this photograph of the green lights of the aurora from the International Space Station 2030 Launch of History - Making STS-41G Mission in 1984The Space Shuttle Challenger launches from Florida at dawn. On this mission, Kathryn Sullivan became the first U.S. woman to perform a spacewalk and Marc Garneau became the first Canadian in space. The crew of seven was the largest to fly on a spacecraft at that time, and STS-41G was the first flight to include two female astronauts2130 A Fresh Perspective on an Extraordinary Cluster of GalaxiesGalaxy clusters are often described by superlatives. After all, they are huge conglomerations of galaxies, hot gas, and dark matter and represent the largest structures in the Universe held together by gravityThe arrangement of the spiral arms in the galaxy Messier 63, seen here in an image from the Nasa Hubble Space Telescope, recall the pattern at the center of a sunflowerFour images from New Horizons’ Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) were combined with colour data from the Ralph instrument to create this enhanced colour global view of Pluto2430 Fresh Crater Near Sirenum Fossae Region of MarsThe HiRISE camera aboard Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter acquired this closeup image of a fresh (on a geological scale, though quite old on a human scale) impact crater in the Sirenum Fossae region of Mars. This impact crater appears relatively recent as it has a sharp rim and well-preserved ejecta2530 Hubble Peers into the Most Crowded Place in the Milky WayThis Nasa Hubble Space Telescope image presents the Arches Cluster, the densest known star cluster in the Milky Way2630 An Astronaut\u0027s View from SpaceNasa astronaut Reid Wiseman tweeted this photo from the International Space Station on 2 September 20142730 Giant Landform on MarsOn Mars, we can observe four classes of sandy landforms formed by the wind, or aeolian bedforms: ripples, transverse aeolian ridges, dunes, and what are called “draa”A sokol suit helmet can be seen against the window of the Soyuz TMA-11M capsule shortly after the spacecraft landed with Expedition 39 Commander Koichi Wakata of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), Soyuz Commander Mikhail Tyurin of Roscosmos, and Flight Engineer Rick Mastracchio of NASA near the town of Zhezkazgan, Kazakhstan2930 Jupiter\u0027s Great Red Spot Viewed by Voyager IJupiter is the largest planet in the solar system and perhaps the most majestic. Vibrant bands of clouds carried by winds that can exceed 400 mph continuously circle the planet\u0027s atmosphere3030 Chandra Observatory Sees a Heart in the DarknessThis Chandra X-Ray Observatory image of the young star cluster NGC 346 highlights a heart-shaped cloud of 8 million-degree Celsius gas in the central regionLike the moon, Mars lacks tectonic plates.The planet is also not as geologically active as Earth.Nasa posted an audio clip of the vibrations on its official Twitter account.“We’ve been collecting background noise up until now, but this first event officially kicks off a new field: Martian seismology!” Bruce Bandert, InSight’s lead scientist, added.Researchers are hoping that the quake recordings\u0026nbspwill reveal more about how rocky planets formed.Scientists are still analysing the data collected by the spacecraft, which arrived on Mars in late November.The craft’s French-made seismometer was placed directly on Mars’ surface\u0026nbspin December and\u0026nbspthree other seismic signals have been detected since mid-March.Another part of the lander is a German-built drilling instrument.\u0026nbspResearchers are hoping the device will drill into Mars’\u0026nbspand measure the planet’s internal temperature.But so far it has only managed to drill\u0026nbsp50cm\u0026nbspinto the planet.The InSight project will cost Nasa $814m (£633m) over two years, as the\u0026nbspUS\u0026nbspspace agency aims to discover more about how Mars was formed.Researchers also hope to discover more about the Red Planet’s structure, by using the spacecraft to map its core, crust and mantle.Additional reporting by agenciesOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 432 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.532 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1332 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1432 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1732 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2132 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2732 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2932 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3132 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail.

Several\u0026nbspsenior shadow cabinet ministers want the party to support a public vote on any Brexit deal passed by parliament, but Mr Corbyn’s inner circle say he only supports a referendum on the government’s deal or to avoid a no-deal outcome. Other shadow ministers oppose another public poll\u0026nbspentirely.In their letter to the National Executive Committee (NEC), the MPs and MEPs said Labour had “a clear opportunity to win these elections” if it fully supports a Final Say vote.No-deal Brexit better than staying in EU, Jeremy Hunt saysThey wrote: “These elections are about the kind of Europe we want to live in, and we can’t make a convincing case in them without being clear about Brexit. Labour has already, rightly, backed a confirmatory public vote. The overwhelming majority of our members and voters support this, and it is the democratically established policy of the party.“Our members need to feel supported on doorsteps by a clear manifesto that marks us out as the only viable alternative to Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party.\u0026nbsp“We need a message of hope and solidarity, and we need to campaign for it without caveats. To motivate our supporters, and to do the right thing by our members and our policy, a clear commitment to a confirmatory public vote on any Brexit deal must be part of our European election manifesto. We understand the many different pressures and views within our movement, but without this clear commitment, we fear that our electoral coalition could fall apart.”The MPs and MEPs said “the world is watching” and that Labour “must be ready to rise to the challenge”. They added: “We must run a dynamic, energetic campaign around a radical manifesto to transform Europe and a clear position on Brexit.”Created with Sketch.Opposing protesters flock to parliament on would be date of Brexit Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentPro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentThe letter was organised by the Love Socialism, Hate Brexit group. Signatories included 10 current shadow ministers, House of Commons Brexit select committee chair Hilary Benn and former shadow cabinet ministers\u0026nbspincluding Angela Eagle, Debbie Abrahams, Rachel Reeves and Owen Smith.Several prominent supporters of Mr Corbyn, including shadow Treasury minister Clive Lewis and former international development secretary Kate Osamor, have also added their names.It came as Labour MPs, MEPs and party members reacted with fury to the\u0026nbspleaked draft campaign leaflet, which suggested Labour would deliver Brexit by seeking “a better deal with Europe”.The flyer made no mention of another referendum, saying only: “The Tories’ chaotic handling of Brexit has left our country in crisis.“With Labour, Britain will have a proper say in future trade deals and businesses wouldn’t have to pay to trade with Europe.“Labour will keep a close relationship with the EU and protect workers’ rights.”It is understood that the leaflet, which was drawn up by Mr Corbyn’s team and staff at Labour’s HQ, was not signed off by shadow cabinet ministers or Labour MEPs.Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, was said to be “furious” at the omission of the party’s policy on another referendum.Sources said many MPs were also infuriated by the draft.One Labour MP told\u0026nbspThe Independent: “People went into complete meltdown and were utterly furious at what appears to be yet another attempt by a small cabal of disgruntled officials to undermine the entire rest of the party, with no reference to the very candidates these leaflets are meant to promote.”“I sincerely hope this is an early draft because it would be unacceptable for unelected officials to attempt to subvert Labour’s members, trade unions and elected representatives in this way.”Mr Corbyn\u0026nbsphas struggled to keep his ided shadow cabinet together on the issue of on another referendum. Some of his closest advisers and shadow ministers, including party chairman Ian Lavery, shadow Cabinet Office minister Jon Trickett and shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey are staunchly opposed to another vote.\u0026nbspBut others, led by\u0026nbspSir Keir ​and deputy leader Tom Watson, have pushed hard for the party to support a Final Say vote.A Labour spokesperson said: “There are a number of different texts for different leaflets in circulation, including for a freepost and for other campaign purposes. They all reflect existing party policy. Our manifesto for the European elections will be decided next Tuesday.”The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is the North’s people’s vote.

Mr Eastwood will be in competition with Alliance party leader Naomi Long, but defends the choice not to agree a pro-Remain candidate between themselves, on account of\u0026nbspMs Long turning down an electoral pact in the past. “Alliance would have to double their vote to take the seat and I don’t think that’s realistic. I need the support of people who disagree with me on some issues, even on big issues like the union, because this is more important right now, he said.Mr Eastwood is following in the tradition of SDLP founder John Hume, who sat in the European Parliament from 1979 to 2004.He said: “The EU is in the SDLP’s DNA and John made it so. We are the most pro European party in the north. Sinn Féin were always anti-Europe, it’s good that they’ve changed their mind, but we are the strongest messengers for remain.”Speaking about the murder of journalist Lyra McKee at the hands of dissident republicans in his home city of Derry last week, Mr Eastwood said\u0026nbsppeople in the region were\u0026nbsp“sad and ashamed” about what happened.“The tragic murder of Lyra has just made people very angry, he said.The mood here now is for people to get back to work, and come back together again.”The writing is on the wall in Derry for those who killed Lyra McKeeOn Friday, the British and Irish governments announced fresh talks in an attempt to restore power sharing in Northern Ireland, and Mr Eastwood has called on his fellow party leaders to seize the moment after two years of no executive.“We cannot allow the instability that has been created by our lack of government to then end up in a political vacuum which can then be exploited by people with guns, he said.In a bid to see functioning government restored at Stormont, the SDLP are advocating for a suspension of the petition of concern - a mechanism which was designed to safeguard minority rights, but which has been used by the DUP as a veto against issues like same-sex marriage.Mr Eastwood also has some choice words for the Northern Ireland Secretary of State Karen Bradley, who he says has “not covered herself in glory” during her tenure.“But it almost doesn’t matter about Karen,” he adds. “Parties in the north need to show willingness now.”The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Allies of the former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, have previously briefed that\u0026nbsphe will be sitting this one out. “He believes the prospect of the UK fielding candidates is utterly preposterous,” one told The Times.It is quite extraordinary on one level that the government is avoiding relatively simple questions on an election that is likely to take place in just four weeks’ time.\u0026nbspUnder the current terms of the revised\u0026nbspArticle 50 Brexit negotiating deadline, the UK does not have to take part\u0026nbspin the European elections if a deal is secured in the British parliament by the end of play on 22\u0026nbspMay. However,\u0026nbspif no deal is done, then the British public will be heading to the polls on the following day to elect the next crop of MEPs.\u0026nbspGiven that no agreement in the cross-party talks over Brexit appear imminent, it seems fairly unlikely the prime minister will receive MPs’ backing for a Brexit plan\u0026nbspin just a matter of weeks.Experts have also warned that\u0026nbspeven if Ms May secures approval in principle, she has “no chance” of formally passing her deal\u0026nbspin time to pull the UK out of the elections and to avoid what many speculate will be a devastating set of results for the party.But confusion will reign over the Conservative Party’s strategy for the European parliament election campaign for as long as the prime minister clings to the hope she can win parliamentary approval for\u0026nbspa deal by\u0026nbsp22 May.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The decision on Huawei and this country’s telecommunications network in which, it is claimed, Theresa May was a driving force, is in contrast to the position of many western allies and the “Five Eyes Network”\u0026nbspof English speaking states which share intelligence.\u0026nbspThree of the members of this group – the US, Australia and New Zealand –\u0026nbsphave taken a tougher stance in the involvement of Huawei, effectively prohibiting the installation of the company’s equipment in the next generation of their telecommunications apparatus. Canada is due to announce its position on the issue in the coming months amid strained relations with Beijing. The Canadian authorities arrested a senior Huawei executive at American request four months ago the Chinese detained a number of Canadian citizens in retaliation.Elsewhere the Netherlands announced on Friday that it will switch from Huawei to a western company for its 5G network after the US criticised the proposed involvement of the Chinese company. Other countries like Germany and India have expressed concern about using Huawei equipment as they upgrade for 5G .Two of the Chinese nationals detained overseas were working in telecommunications in Poland, one of them a Huawei employee.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Inside Huawei\u0027s new campus for workers in China Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An employee enters a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanHuawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanHuawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA staff member outside the Huawei University in Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusServers are seen inside Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanThe conductor waits for a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA general view shows the research and development centre at Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusAn employee works on a mobile phone production line at Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanEmployees works on a mobile phone production line at Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanAn office building on the Huawei campus in DongguanAn employee enters a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanHuawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanHuawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA staff member outside the Huawei University in Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusServers are seen inside Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanThe conductor waits for a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA general view shows the research and development centre at Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusAn employee works on a mobile phone production line at Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanEmployees works on a mobile phone production line at Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanAn office building on the Huawei campus in DongguanUS intelligence has charged that Huawei is directly funded by Chinese state security. The UK’s National Cyber Security Centre warns that the company posed a threat to national security. However, the organisation’s chief has also stated that this country has established the “toughest and most rigorous oversight regime in the world for Huawei”.Telecommunications is not the only field where Britain is, at times, out of step with allies when it comes to China. Beijing’s “Belt and Road”\u0026nbspprogramme is hugely contentious with accusations that it\u0026nbsppromotes “debt-trap diplomacy” – providing cheap finance and then extracting advantage when debtor countries have difficulties paying back. The most notorious example of this is Sri Lanka ceding a port, Hambantota, in return for the waiver of $1bn in loans. A number of states, including Malaysia, Nepal and Myanmar have recently pulled out of Chinese-financed programmes because of apprehension of being similarly sucked in.Last year, 27 out of 28 European Union ambassadors in Beijing (Hungary the exception) signed off a report saying the project “runs counter to the European Union’s agenda for liberalising trade and pushes the balance of power in favour of subsidised Chinese companies”.The British ambassador was one of the signatories. But in December 2016 Philip Hammond, on a visit to Beijing, spoke of how “privileged” the UK was to take part in the programme. The chancellor subsequently announced the launch of a £750m private fund, supported by the British government, and led by David Cameron, which will work with the Belt and Road initiative.The only other western European government which has talked of working with China on the scheme is Italy’s hard-right populist government, some of whose leaders are also keen admirers of Vladimir Putin.Conduct towards China is also now an internal matter in the febrile and fractured political landscape of the UK.Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary, Sajid Javid, the home secretary, Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, Liam Fox, the international trade secretary and Penny Mordaunt, the international development Secretary, are all said to have objected strongly to the participation of Huawei in such a key sector of the UK’s communications network.All of them, it is claimed, view themselves as potential successors to Theresa May and\u0026nbspit has been suggested, appearing tough on China, they feel, will augment their leadership credentials.Suspicions about the leak have focused on the Huawei objectors. All have denied they are responsible.Senior intelligence officers ‘bemused and concerned’ at Huawei leakThe China factor has already played a part in the internecine struggle of the Conservative government. Williamson announced in February that he is going to send the aircraft carrier, Queen Elizabeth, into disputed waters of the China Seas in a display of “hard power”.The language he used resonated with echoes of “Pax Britannica” and “East of Suez”. But there was nothing intrinsically wrong with the proposal itself which reiterates the right of navigation in international waters. The growth of Chinese military power has led to alarm among neighbours in the region and beyond. Japan, India, the US\u0026nbspand Australia have formed the Quadrilateral Security group which has held large-scale naval exercises in these areas.But within hours of the defence secretary’s speech at the Royal United Services Institute,\u0026nbspTreasury officials were briefing that it will scupper a trade visit to Beijing by Hammond.China has continued to trade with other countries which had sent warships into the disputed seas as it has done with those who have placed restrictions on Huawei, albeit while making complaints to world trade bodies. Hammond is in Beijing taking part in an investment forum and has met Vice Premier Hu Chunhua who did not, according to diplomatic sources, mention Huawei.Beyond the accusations and recriminations lie\u0026nbspfundamental questions about just how dangerous Huawei is to the national security of the country where it operates.The company was founded in 1987 by Ren Zhengfei, who had formerly served in the technical engineering sector of the People’s Liberation Army. He and senior Huawei executives have connections with the Chinese military and the Communist Party.Although the company sells items like telephones and laptops, its main business is supplying core infrastructure devices which touch\u0026nbspalmost every aspect of the internet and thus could facilitate espionage.The Tory Huawei leak confirms that May’s government is doomedMinisters could have ‘phone records trawled in leak inquiry’Britain’s Huawei gamble would be a grave moral misjudgementOf course the PM is useless, she’s letting Huawei build our 5G networkHuawei: Should it be allowed in Britain’s 5G networks? Defenders of Huawei want to stress that there is no compelling evidence that the company is engaged in spying. Professor Qing Wang of\u0026nbspWarwick University, who specialises in marketing and innovation holds: “Some of the reasons put forward for this notion are weak, for example, the background of the founder of Huawei. Mr\u0026nbspRen Zhengfei once served in the People’s Liberation Army. As we know, serving in the army was one way of getting out of poverty for people in the countryside ... Huawei is the textbook case of a great company in the making unfortunately, it has fallen victim to the anti-globalisation policy and sentiment of the US and the ongoing trade war with China.”The US, however, has become increasingly bullish in confronting Huawei and the threat it is supposed to represent.At the recent meeting of the annual Munich security conference Vice President Mike Pence pointed to Huawei as an example of how “Beijing’s vast security apparatus” can have “access to any data that touches their networks\u0026nbspor equipment.”Marco Rubio, the senior Republican senator, maintains: “Huawei is a Chinese state-directed telecom company with a singular goal: undermine foreign competition by stealing trade secrets and intellectual property, and through artificially low prices backed by the Chinese government. The communist Chinese government poses the greatest, long-term threat to America’s national and economic security and the US must be vigilant in preventing Chinese state-directed telecoms companies\u0026nbsplike Huawei from undermining and endangering America’s 5G networks.”What was agreed at the NSC in London was to allow Huawei involvement at the edges of the UK’s 5G network, in non-core parts such as building antennas. But the Americans are wary that this would act as a Trojan horse and is strongly pressuring its allies to keep the Chinese company at arm’s length.Therein lies a conundrum for this government –\u0026nbspkeeping on good terms with both Washington and Beijing in the uncertain post-Brexit landscape.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

legislation, allowing\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspand peers to perform line-by-line scrutiny.It enshrines May’s Brexit plan in law, effectively separating the withdrawal agreement from the so-called political declaration, which was\u0026nbsptacked on to cover the UK’s future relationship with Brussels.Labour mostly supports the withdrawal agreement but it has concerns about the political declaration, so wrenching the two apart could heighten its\u0026nbspappeal.One of the advantages of the bill is that the government could also attach different concessions to win over\u0026nbspwavering MPs.Labour must ‘stop vacillating’ over new referendum, says SDLP veteranIt could offer concessions to Labour MPs from Leave-voting areas.\u0026nbspWigan’s Lisa Nandy and Stoke-on-Trent Central MP Gareth Snell have made it clear that\u0026nbspenhanced\u0026nbspworkers rights’ would be the price of their\u0026nbspsupport for any Brexit deal.Downing Street is also said to be considering adding reassurances around technological solutions to use on the Irish border, which could appeal to Eurosceptic Tories who despise the backstop.It is a high-stakes move, as May is far from sure of securing a majority for it to pass its second reading.And if MPs reject it, May would have start again in a new session of parliament as the same bill cannot be brought during the same session.Despite mounting speculation that the prime minister could introduce the legislation next week, Commons leader Andrea Leadsom failed to announce it in next week’s\u0026nbspbusiness.This decision may be linked to the local elections on 2 May, as days of bad Brexit headlines will do the Conservatives no favours in that contest.May could decide\u0026nbspto bring the bill\u0026nbspback to parliament in the window between the locals and the European parliament elections on 23 May,\u0026nbspto\u0026nbspramp up pressure on Labour to back it or face accusations\u0026nbspof blocking Brexit.It is risky, but the prime minister knows she must do something to take back control of the Brexit process. Otherwise it will be plain that her government has run out of ideas.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We don’t have peace inside ourselves. Each day we are following in the news: what will happen next, who will be killed, which building will be hit?” she tells\u0026nbspThe Independent from her offices at\u0026nbspGaza Sky Geeks, a tech hub in the 25-mile long militant-run strip.“The kids pay for this: the mother, the father, the family are all under pressure,” she adds.Created with Sketch.Gaza protests: Wounded patients being treated at MSF clinic Show all 9Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.She says she wants to connect mothers to professional consultants specialising in psychology and parenting.“You can’t simply\u0026nbspcan’t go to a professional in our culture –\u0026nbspyour family and your husband will not support it.“People call you crazy, they blame the women for not being able to cope. It’s a taboo. You end up sunk in depression, which you take out on your kids. But with the app you can have discreet and confidential support,” she explains.The app, which is registered in Delaware, aims to break through blockades, barriers and borders and help women both within Gaza and across the Arabic-speaking world\u0026nbspon how to look after and support their children.Gazan mother shows her new app designed to help mothers in the Middle EastThrough the app, women can also discreetly book paid sessions from among their team of more than 100 professionals, who speak multiple Arabic dialects and have been carefully vetted.Ms Khodary acknowledges that Momy Helper can only reach those who can afford mobile phones and so cannot\u0026nbspfix all problems women face, but hopes it can help be part of a solution.In a trial run last year, Momy Helper paired up with Oxfam to provide free support\u0026nbspsessions for mothers who could not afford to pay or did not dare ask their husbands.In Gaza, where few have bank accounts or credit cards, women can pay for the $15 hour-long sessions in person.A year on, people in Gaza are losing hope in the ralliesThe app, which is available on Google Play,\u0026nbspalso provides basic questionnaires to help identify what issues the user is facing and then direct them to the correct free advice in Arabic.Ms Khodary hopes in the future to use artificial intelligence to better improve the interaction.For now, they have step-by-step guides of what to expect each month with their new child, and how best to improve the child\u0027s development at each key stage.Gazan protesters head to border protests as Israeli forces fire tear gas on anniversary of Great March of ReturnAfter hearing some of the worst stories from\u0026nbspwomen who have reached out to Momy Helper, Ms\u0026nbspKhodary\u0026nbspalso wants to pair up with charities to improve the gender-based violence section of the app and blog.Gender-based and domestic violence is increasing in Gaza, according to a rights group, which says\u0026nbspit is driven by soaring unemployment and poverty rates among Gaza’s trapped 1.8 million population.\u0026nbspAccording to the United Nations,\u0026nbspmore than half of women in Gaza have experienced violence at home, while nearly 80 per cent have reported being psychologically abused. Depression is also thought to be on the rise.\u0026nbspMs Khodary hopes her app can, in some way, support some women across the Arab world going through this.\u0026nbspNour al-Khodary, founder of Momy Helper, says she hopes it will grow into a business that will provide employment opportunities for war-ravaged Gaza (Bel Trew)“Sometimes mothers just need someone to hear them. We can’t provide professional therapy, but our consultants try to give them support on how they can better deal with their issues,” she says.“With severe cases we encourage them to seek professional therapy and we try to put them\u0026nbspin touch with facilities to help with that,” she adds.Ms Khodary\u0026nbspsays she\u0026nbspfirst came up with the idea in 2014 after having her son Bassem when she was briefly living in Chicago as her husband, who had secured a Fulbright scholarship, was finishing his Masters in Architectural Engineering.A long way away from home, Ms Khodary turned to the wealth of childcare literature and support available in the US.Momy Helper website)“This shocked me and I started posting on Facebook about what I had learned,” she adds.She initially received angry backlash from friends who thought she was judging them.UN urges restraint as truce ends fighting between Gaza and IsraelOvernight cross-border fire crushes hopes of an Israel-Gaza ceasefireGaza witnessing most severe crackdown on dissent in decade: AmnestyIsrael pounds Gaza with airstrikes after rocket fire targets Tel AvivBut that changed to a stream of questions when she put up videos showing examples of positive results from her little boy Bassem.“Then I start thinking about connecting mothers with professional consultants, I realised there was nothing for mothers speaking Arabic,” she says.Through Gaza Sky Geeks, a Mercy Corps-supported initiative that runs a coding academy, she put together a 10-person team to build the app. In 2017 she came second in a region-wide competition in Istanbul for best start-up in the Middle East and North Africa.Khodary runs the app\u0026nbsp(Bel TrewThe Independent)But the problem now is funding. Ms Khodary secured a small injection of cash from angel investors at the start, who gave her around 10 per cent of what was needed.But two years on she has had to drop her team and is now running the business entirely on her own.She registered the app in Delaware and with a US bank, knowing foreign investors would be nervous about money going into Gaza. Right now, she is looking into crowdfunding options.TrewThe Independent)The working mother hopes to run the app as a business, so she can create work back in Gaza where youth unemployment has soared past 70 per cent and only 19 per cent of women of working age have jobs:\u0026nbspthe highest female jobless rate in the world“My first dream is that I can reach every woman in the Arab world that needs the support that Momy\u0026nbspHelper can offer,” she says.“But I have a bigger dream, to be the first female investor in Palestine, to grow my business and earn enough to be able to invest in other start-ups to help others achieve their goals.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We demand the Government makes the following changes to help hard-working famililes before its too late. We want you to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Things have not improved for the former housekeeper, who has been forced to borrow money to pay for furniture and did not have enough cash to celebrate her eight-year-old son’s birthday.“I got my son a little truck for his birthday but that was it, she said. “He was happy to get something as I’ve had to sell the toys he has just to charge the electric and the gas,”Charlotte charges men £ for sex and other favours - bringing in around £ every week. She sees one client whenever she can as she appreciates the “regular” work.In fact, the mum feels so let down by the Government she claims her clients are the only people she can trust.Charlotte, who lives on an estate, had to give up her job when she had her son because she couldnt afford childcare.She moved onto Universal Credit in January  but fell £ behind on her rent while waiting for her first payment and was threatened with eviction.She says: “If I didn’t have to wait so long for my first payment, I would have been OK.“Something always goes wrong - five weeks is too much. I’m still just about managing now.“Winter has been hard, I’ve had to keep the house warm and the lights on, but it’s been so expensive to do.Her sons dad pays nothing towards his upkeep and while she received a £ loan from the government to tide her over when she moved onto Universal Credit last year, she claims she wasn’t told by her local job centre that it would need to be repaid.“That was the final straw when everything changed, and I saw how much debt I was in… the payments and the household bills, it all built up,” she says.Charlotte now receives £-a-month in Universal Credit after her rent has been paid to her landlord and her debts, including the £ furniture loan, are taken off.At one point, after shed paid the rest of her bills, she was left with just £. a day for her and her son to live on.Other women have also claimed that a long wait for their first Universal Credit payment has forced them into sex work.Julie, , from Merseyside told the BBC she had been left “so ashamed” after being forced to turn to sex work after an EIGHT-week wait for her Universal Credit payment.“I didnt go out looking for it, I said no at first ... it wasnt until about three weeks later that I said OK, yeah, because I thought I need to, because I need money’,” she said.Its something I never ever thought I would be ever capable of doing.”Apply for an advance - Claimants are able to get some cash within five days rather than waiting weeks for their first payment. But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently, or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussell Trust website.Women like Charlotte are often too ashamed to tell their families that they have resorted to prostitution to survive.“I can’t talk to anyone. It’s the guilt mainly. My family don’t know - they wouldn’t be happy. They’d be angry, furious, upset. They would be so judgemental.My son still doesn’t know about what I do for money either.”“And I’m sure there are other women out there in worse situations than me.”Charlotte is struggling with her mental health at the moment and is having therapy for a second time – but she hasn’t admitted what she “does on the side” as she doesn’t think her counsellor would understand.She is considering going to college to do a course as she wants to be an author, but feels things are stacked against her.“I know I’ve got lots to work on, but it’s too much sometimes,” she says.“I keep thinking, why is this happening “They say Universal Credit is working, but who is that for Why are people getting poorer but the government don’t care  Evensomething changes, I can’t erase what I’ve done now.Officials say that advances are available from day one on Universal Credit - and that Brits can get up to  per cent of their cash upfrontthey need it.But delays getting the welfare payments are causing women to rack up debt and some are selling their bodies while they wait for help, charities have said.We know from the stories of women that have contacted us that the delays in processing universal credit and the drop in benefits is financially crippling.It is essential that the vulnerable are protected and their welfare is paramount.”A representative for Beyond The Streets, which works to help women who have suffered sexual exploitation, said: We welcome the investigation in to failures in universal credit and the increase in survival sex.In October, MP Frank Field shocked the House of Commons when he revealed women in his Birkenhead constituency were selling themselves for sex for the first time as a result of hardship caused by the introduction of Universal Credit.After The Sun shared Charlottes story with Mr Field, he said he would write to Department for Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd about her case.Here we have yet another awful example of Universal Credit pushing vulnerable mothers, who are trying to protect their children, to rock bottom and beyond, he told The Sun.The DWP insists safeguards are in place to make sure all repayments are affordable and sustainable.It also aims to give people help to find routes out of the sex industry, with personalised work coaches in place to help people looking for alternative roles.The department insists it has responded quickly to feedback on Universal Credit by continuing to pay Housing Benefit for two weeks after people move on to the new system. Other legacy benefits will follow suit shortly.Ms Rudd has responded to the Suns campaign, saying shes listening to Sun readers as she tries to improve Universal Credit for working families.A DWP spokeswoman told The Sun: We’re committed to getting help to people when they need it most, and advance payments and budgeting support are available.Work coaches are trained to spot vulnerable people, including those working in the sex industry, and offer appropriate support.”*Charlottes name has been changed.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Why kill the innocents ”An obvious question from all right-minded people. But when you’re a murdering psycho, you want to wreak terror not just on those present, but in the minds of millions around the world.And the way they do that is to target innocent people in the normal, everyday scenarios we can all identy with.Attending a church or mosque with family and friends, taking our kids to a concert or a busy shopping mall at the weekend, cheering on marathon runners, queuing for breakfast at a holiday hotel . . .Who among us has not read about Sneha and her friends . . .  or the heartbreaking stories of the British father who lost his we and two children . . . or the Danish man who lost three of his four children . . . and thought of how we would copefaced with the same situation That’s terrorism. It projects fear on to the masses and seeks to make us alter our behaviour accordingly.With every fibre of my being, I want to resist the power of this pernicious tactic, but of late I’ll admit I have struggled.On Friday night, our -year-old attended a Shawn Mendes concert at London’s O arena with a friend and her mother. We wrestled with whether to let her go or not, then felt anxious from the moment she set off until she ed home.Equally, when she expressed a wish to meet her friends at a vast mall last week, we urged her to give it a miss and browse the shops locally. Irrational, yes, but that’s what terrorism can do to your mindsetyou let it.You don’t want to be that grieving family, so you try to minimise the chances of it happening.The truth, of course, is thata suicide bomber decides to board your train carriage, or walk in to your community centre, or drive a car that blows up just as you’re walking past — there’s not a damn thing you can do about it.But what we can do is stand together in our firm belief that these attacks — be it on churches or mosques — have nothing to do with religion.Just hours after the coordinated bombings in his country, the Sri Lankan minister of state for defence said preliminary investigations have shown, “this attack was carried out in retaliation for the attack against Muslims in Christchurch [New Zealand]”.Meanwhile, reports have emerged of young Christian men walking the streets near Sneha’s home of Negombo carrying long sticks and “looking for Muslims”.Again, this us-against-them mindset is what terrorism seeks to inflame.But this isn’t about Christianity versus Islam.The attacks in Sri Lanka, New Zealand, Manchester and London — to name but a few — are the actions of a warped few who have distorted the teachings of wholly peaceful religions to suit their own, murderous ends.We mustn’t allow one drop of poison to contaminate an ocean of humanity.DR GAIL BRADBROOK is the co-founder of Extinction Rebellion, the eco action group that brought central London to a virtual standstill last week.She says: “I think our protests have been awesome.“We’re making history at the minute, people are having a fantastic time on the streets and we really welcome people to come join us.”Yes, I’m sure workers on zero hours contracts would relish the opportunity to lose a day’s payto join her, so too the nurses whose arrival at nearby St Thomas’ hospital each day is critical to the wellbeing of thousands of patients.Dr Bradbrook may have a PhD in molecular biophysics but one fears she and her merry band of protestors may have skipped lessons in common sense.Why  would they glue themselves to public transport that encourages people to leave their cars at home while simultaneously causing air polluting traffic jams And why  would they stage a sit-in aimed to make the politicians take notice when the House of Commons rose on April  for recess and didn’tuntil yesterday  Duh.The majority of the population supports action on climate change, but this virtue-signalling nonsense only detracts from the cause by irritating ordinary people just tryingto earn a living. Begging the question: Why only now HOLLYWOOD star Anne Hathaway says she’s giving up alcohol until her son is .She’s a stronger woman than me.Meanwhile, she has also abandoned veganism after admitting that she “just didn’t feel good or healthy”. She says she immediately felt betterafter eating a fish dish from Iceland.I know what you’re thinking . . . was it the £ prawn ring as advertised by Kerry Katona No, Anne’s le-changing fish experience was a sustainably sourced salmon at a Michelin-starred restaurant in Reykjavik.Easy mistake to make though.“HEALTH tourism” is still an ongoing issue, with reports that ten people a day are jetting to the UK to have their babies delivered on the NHS.The bill for caring for , foreign maternity cases was around £.million in  , with only £.million of it clawed back.Meanwhile, three-year-old Victoria Komada, from Norwich, was born with twisted legs and faced a double amputation.And thanks only to the generosity of the local community in Norwich and those in Poland’s Szczecin, where her parents grew up, £, was raised for her to fly toFlorida for an operation to help her walk. Each week we see the plight of desperate people trying to raise money for treatments the NHS won’t fund.Just think of how many of them that unrecouped £.million might have helped.Some days, it feels like we in the UK have  of them.CERTAIN IVF clinics are exploiting older women whose chances of having a baby are very poor, the fertility regulator has warned.Since , the number of -plus women having IVF has doubled, with some clinics “trading on hope” despite a success rate of just one per cent for a woman of  using her own eggs.A spokeswoman for the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authoritysaid she would like these clinics to be honest about the low statistics.She’s right, but one suspects the number of older women opting for IVF will remain high.Because when you’re desperate for a child, even in a fertility lottery of just one per cent, there still lies the hope that it could be you.Fast forward years and they’re still performing though, despite a healthy diet and regular exercise, the batteries are running noticeably lower. Particularly as there’s now only three of them on stage.Howard,  this weekend, is a former breakdancer and perhaps the fittest of them all.But while his body is making all the right moves, his face is positively screaming: “Is there much more of this  Line Of Duty’s on in a minute.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We have assembled a erse group of candidates from across the political spectrum, from former Tory Ann Widdecombe to left-wing grandee Claire Fox.We are all unied in our desire to pressure Westminster to deliver what the people instructed.It is vital we restore parliamentary democracy. Through my service with the Royal Marines and the Special Boat Service, I witnessed the Arab Spring first-hand and saw the horrors suffered by a people with no representation in their political system.I never thought our political class would deliberately undermine the people.But they have done so by failing to deliver on the  referendum. This after the  General Election manestos of the Conservative and Labour parties clearly pledged to honour the result.Voters on all sides have been betrayed. The final straw for me was seeing the men who sent me to a questionable war in Afghanistan — Tony Blair, Lord Adonis and Alastair Campbell — conspiring to undermine the people.They have been colluding with other governments in Europe to stop Brexit.It is vital we stand up against the damage this hardcore group who want to create an EU super-state are inflicting on British democracy.It is deeply saddening to see the isions across our country. People voted to Remain and Leave for a range of legitimate reasons.We are in this position due to John Major and Tony Blair’s arrogance in not consulting thepeople on the treaties that embedded us in the EU — Maastricht, Amsterdam, Nice and Lisbon.The public should have been consulted on these major transfers of power from Parliament towards the supranational structures of the EU.We are now left with this political mess as their legacy.One of the greatest testaments to Britain is that so many people are willing to take huge risks to come and live here, to be free and prosperous.My ancestors came to the UK from Ireland in the th century to escape famine and persecution. They settled in Greenock in the Scottish Lowlands.I am deeply disturbed that Brexit has now come to focus on identity and immigration, instead of on democracy and who runs our country.We should celebrate immigrants as the heroes who want to be British and part of the national ­success story. Brexit is not a right-wing project. Five million Labour voters and a third of ethnic-minority voters backed Leave.Yet from some of the rhetoric spouted, you would think that Brexit voters are all ignorant racists.  The result is that the Leave voters feel patronised, insulted and ignored. Look at the  Labour MPs — many of whom represent Leave-voting constituencies — who voted for a second referendum to overturn the first.The contempt they show for the ordinary people who put their faith in the democratic process is breathtaking.If politicians fail to deliver the result of the referendum, they will be guilty of selling out the people and undermining Britain’s international credibility as a stable and free liberal democracy.The backlash from the public would be unthinkable.Beyond Brexit, I see an opportunity to implement the strongest animal welfare and environmental legislation in the world. It is a chance to reset our relationship with nature, away from the Common Agricultural Policy.I strongly disagree with those who want to weaken environmental policy.Yet the beauty of an accountable liberal democracy is that those decisions can be made in our own Parliament.A vote for the Brexit Party will send shockwaves across Westminster, reminding them that the people are in charge.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Canada may do too.That would leave us out on a limb among the “Five Eyes” intelligence ­alliance in ignoring fears that a tech giant so close to the Chinese state could be used for spying.Theresa May was rightly worried about China’s investment in the Hinkley Point nuclear plant, let alone a vast new communications system.She has had assurances from our spy chiefs that any threat can be contained. Fair enough. But is it worth spooking our closest friends in the world  Their fears are not groundless. The PM and GCHQ will need to convince them too.Mrs May must decide fast, though.The price of being left behind over G will be huge.GRETA Thunberg is in some ways an admirable child: Bright, engaged, passionate about her cause and inspiring to other kids.What troubles us are the credulous adults fawning over her.In Greta’s black-and-white view, climate change is frying the planet while wicked corporations cash in and lazy governments “don’t listen to the science”.It’s simplistic nonsense. Governments try to balance tough environmental action with keeping people in jobs and families fed. The general strike Greta demands — or the end of air travel — would bring only chaos and hardship.Britain is a world leader in emissions reduction. So why are Greta and her aides here lecturing us instead of China, India or the US  Simple. Most journalists won’t interrogate a girl of  over her well-meaning naivety.But our endless supply of vacuous, needy politicians WILL indulge her.And the grandstanding Commons Speaker John Bercow will welcome her to Parliament like she was Nelson Mandela instead of a wide-eyed kid too young to vote.IMAGINEnewspapers gave terrorists a  to stoke violence.Or, immediately after a mass suicide bombing, they spread  conspiracy theories guaranteed to inflame tensions.Or , weeks after a massacre, their websites still streamed horric first-person footage filmed by the gunman.Imagine, too,they provided a  for baseless scaremongering alleging the dangers of routine childhood vaccinations, and the worldwide death rate from measles then soared.Those papers would rightly face massive penalties.

Then he became the TORIES’ infrastructure chief.Then came his deranged crusade to reverse Brexit and his unhinged social media attacks on Leavers and even   neutral civil servants planning for Brexit.He told Leavers not to vote Labour.Now, though, he’s  a Corbynista MEP candidate, suddenly batting for a  “sensible”, “socialist” Brexit. No wonder “people’s vote” Remainers are outraged at their former figurehead’s betrayal.Is there anything this odious shapeshter won’t do for a first-class seat aboard the publicly funded gravy train And why  believe another word he utters THE Tories have only one viable future — as the party that enthusiastically delivers a proper Brexit for .million Leavers.Too many MPs, even Cabinet ministers, fail to grasp it. They are still ­nostalgic for the Cameron era. But the referendum changed all that.It is a fundamental error of liberal Tories and Remainers generally to think a meaningful Brexit is a surrender to the Right.  A third of ethnic minority voters backed Leave, like a third of Labour voters.Delivering Brexit and upholding our democracy is the most noble act any Tory can now carry out.The price of refusal will be vast. As Nigel Farage will prove to them next month.THE Tories’ failure on crime is shameful.They slashed police numbers to  balance the books. It seemed safe as crime kept falling. Now we know that, among other problems,  cuts went too far.Murders, kne crimes, robberies and sex offences are soaring. Yes, the  homicide rate was higher under Labour.

And he said the move could change the whole framework of how the government is managed.Former Tory Attorney General Dominic Grieve said he was convinced the leak was a result of someone on leadership manoeuvres.The Sun revealed Gavin Williamson had blamed Whitehall mandarins for the leak – pointing the finger at Cabinet Office civil servants.WHO cares who leaked the Government’s Huawei decision  No one outside the Westminster bubble.The fact is it has done us a favour.Letting a tech giant linked to the ­Chinese state build our new G network — in defiance of our vital “Five Eyes” security allies — is a mistake the public has a right to know about.True, National Security Council meetings should not leak.

Some have been forced to close early, or cancel “luxuries” such as swimming and music classes. The funding shortage is so severe that heads are begging parents for money to buy basic items such as stationery and toilet paper. For Britain’s private schools, it is a completely dferent story. Thanks to their dubious charitable status, they are exempt from paying millions of pounds a year in business rates. This loophole in the law only entrenches an unacceptable educational ide. It means an elite few benefit from an additional privilege, while the majority are taught in schools with crumbling buildings and rising class sizes. A government that cared about our children’s education would ensure every state school has the same facilities as private ones. They could force private schools to pay their business rates in full, and hand the £million in proceeds to the state sector. Streets behind The closure of nearly two dozen branches of Debenhams is another blow for our struggling high streets. Staff have been badly let down by its former private equity owners who lined their pockets while loading the firm with debt.  But Debenhams has also fallen victim to changing shopping habits and business rates that unfairly penalise bricks and mortar retailers but let online companies off the hook. Department stores are a major draw for shoppers, so when they disappear it can have a knock-on effect for neighbouring retailers. While it is not all gloomy - Primark yesterday said it was recruiting , workers - we must do more to help our high streets thrive. This means making online firms pay their fair share.

The novel, often hailed as the first true English novel, is now  years old. An instant classic, it has been translated into hundreds of languages and inspired Gulliveraposs Travels and The Swiss Family Robinson. Hollywood has also taken Daniel Defoeaposs lead and used it as the basis for hit films like Cast Away, starring Tom Hanks. But the work of fiction is actually based on an amazing true story.    And the events that proved irrestitable to Defoe are every bit as incredible as those within the pages of the novel. Scottish sailor Alexander Selkirk was a real le castaway was every bit as dramatic as Crusoeaposs. Defoe is even said to have met Selkirk, already a celebrity thanks to his seafaring escapades, at a Bristol inn, before penning his book. And while the author never confirmed that Selkirk was the model for Crusoe, the similarities between the two tales have led historians to believe that this is just where Defoe got his big idea. In The Le And Strange Surprising Adventures Of Robinson Crusoe of York, Mariner, Defoeaposs character runs away to sea and is shipwrecked on a Caribbean island.    As sole survivor, he is forced to fend for himself. He recovers weapons and tools from the wreck, then slowly learns to cope - building a hut and learning to hunt. In time he even grows wheat, makes pottery and raises goats, while creating a calendar out of notches on a piece of wood. After famously encountering Friday and teaching him English, Crusoe is eventually rescued after nearly three decades on the island. Just  years before the rip-roaring read hit the shelves, Alexander Selkirk had been marooned on the uninhabited island of Más a Tierra  miles off the coast of Chile in the South Pacic Ocean. The roguish son of a cobbler, from Lower Largo, Fe, the young Selkirk was often in trouble and fled to sea as a teenager. He soon became a buccaneer, joining William Dampieraposs privateers sanctioned by the British government to attack Spanish vessels. But in September , while sailing master of a ship called the Cinque Ports, Selkirk fell out with its skipper Captain Thomas Stradling, who had ignored his warnings that the shipaposs worm ridden timbers had made it unseaworthy. Fearing the craft was about to sink, he demanded to be let off on the island and was duly abandoned on the mountainous  squaremile piece of land, with only a musket, cooking pot and kne along with some bedding, cheese, jam, a flask of rum and a Bible. Selkirk had expected fellow sailors to follow his lead, but when they didnapost, immediately regretted his rash decision.However, the ruthless Stradling wouldnapost let him back on board the ship.  He would spend the next four-and-a-half years on the island.At first Selkirk stayed on the shore forlornly scanning the horizon for passing vessels, but was soon driven inland by wailing two-tonne elephant seals. As the reality of his situation dawned Selkirk showed incredible fortitude, just like Crusoe. He survived by hunting feral goats, even learning how to chase them down on foot, while harvesting wild turnips and cabbage too.Selkirk built a hut out of pepper trees for shelter, fashioned a new kne out of old barrel hoops and domesticated feral cats to help ward off the rats that attacked him at night. Eventually Selkirkaposs feet were so hardened by island le that he didnapost need shoes and he made new clothes from goat skins, while singing to keep himself occupied or finding refuge in reading the Bible just as Crusoe does in Defoeaposs book. While Defoeaposs character has to battle man-eating natives and pirates, Selkirk had equally narrow escapes.He was once badly injured in a fall from a clf and, when a ship did arrive, it turned out to be Spanish.Fearing capture, or death, Selkirk successfully hid up a tree while evading enemy sailors who urinated beneath it. Eventually, on February , , an English ship, The Duke, anchored off the island for supplies. Its captain, Woodes Rogers, found Selkirk barely able to remember how to talk. Yet by now the marooned man had become so adept at survival that he was able to help feed and restore Rogersapos ailing crew who had been suffering from scurvy. Indeed Rogers was so impressed that he gave Selkirk the post of second mate aboard the Duke. In the book, after being rescued, Robinson Crusoe discovers his estates have made him a wealthy in his absence. Selkirk himself ed to Britain in  having made plenty of booty after resuming his career as a privateer.  It also turned out that he had been right about the Cinque Ports, which had sunk shortly after leaving Selkirk behind.Its crew had either been killed or ended up languishing in Spanish prisons.By the time Defoe came to publish Robinson Crusoe, the story of Selkirkaposs amazing survival, against the odds, had already been made public in several accounts. There were other stories of castaways at the time that Defoe may have drawn on, but it seems that Selkirk was the most obvious basis for his hero. In , the connection between Selkirk and the novel came full circle when the Chilean government renamed the island where he had been stranded as Isla Robinson Crusoe - proving the international appeal of Defoeaposs story.  Indeed we have become obsessed with the idea of the lone castaway ever since the book came out on April , . Itaposs a theme on which Radio aposs Desert Island Discs has capitalised - where celebrities choose music and items theyaposd take with them to make the solitude bearable. And there have been other thrilling real-le tales of castaways to intrigue and fascinate us. Just like Crusoe, who goes back to his island for more adventures in Defoeaposs little known sequel, Selkirk never settled into le on land and later enlisted in the Royal Navy.He died at sea from yellow fever in . After hisfrom isolation he had once said: I am now worth  pounds, but shall never be so happy, as when I was not worth a farthing.

The -year-old, who does not want to be named, was driving when he came across the teenagers in the road and asked them to move. When he got out his car, he was surrounded by the teens before punches were thrown and he was hit over the head with a bottle. Part of the incident, which happened in in Bridgend, Wales, at around pm on Bank Holiday Monday, was filmed and shows the dad being shoved. After the attack, the dad managed to escape before one of the teens smashed his windscreen and jumped on his bonnet, reports Wales Online.  The attack left the dad unable to see from one eye for a day. Speaking on Friday the dad said: I literally went to pick up the Chinese and they were all just stood in the road and I beeped my horn and they walked out in front of me. They started chopsing through the window. The window was already down because it was hot. They hit the back of the car. I got out and they started mouthing off at me and started pushing me. The video shows the gang surrounding the dad on the street when one of them pushes him.  One teenager then appears to punch the dad in the side of the head, before another runs up and appears to hit him in the head with a bottle. The dad said the incident went on for about another  seconds after when the video stops. He said: I managed to get away and run to a neighbouraposs house. The one who bottled me threw another bottle at the neighbours.

It shows an array of pictures hanging above a bed of pink flowers featuring pictures of Barbie dolls suffering abuse. One image shows a Ken doll kicking a Barbie doll who is lying helplessly on the ground.    Directors of the Pineapple Black gallery were forced to remove the exhibit from a window display, mainly from parents who said the images were to graphic for children. The exhibit, created by artist Lidia Lidia, was set up to show the realities that a lot of women and young girls actually end up living in. Co-directors Bobby Benjamin and Stephen Irving said that despite complaints they had received overwhelming support for highlighting the important issue. Bobby said: If we made a mistake, it was to run it during half term when a lot more children would be passing the gallery but it wasnapost something that was intentional.    We knew it would provoke and be controversial, but we felt it was important to open up that debate. What I wanted the piece to do is to get people to talk about these crimes against women - domestic violence, FGM, trafficking. Iaposm a dad, Iaposve got boys, and Stephenis a dad, we came from that perspective and personally I wanted my kids to see this. He continued: That story was incredibly sad, and the details were on the front page of The Gazette in all of the shops, for anyone to see. Violence against women is not something thataposs abstract, itaposs real le, happening right here on our doorstep. I think itaposs important that young people understand that message. Stephen added: Obviously the imagery uses Barbies so is very appealing, but the questions raised by the images may not be something people feel comfortable about discussing with their children. We decided as both curators, artists and parents that this exhibition was an important one and deserved to be displayed.    We were completely open with the Hillstreet that it may result in some complaints but they were supportive and willing to let us take the risk. The work is still amazing, the message still important, and we have many supportive and praising comments about the display as well. The exhibit launched on April  and will now be held inside a former New Look shop at Hillstreet shopping centre until May .

It is believed the foot and lower leg may have been carried to the path, just yards from a school, by an animal. Dog walkers raised the alarm when they made the grisly discovery in New Waltham, Lincolnshire, on Thursday morningThere are fears that more body parts may be nearby as Humberside Police widen their search area to include two large fields bordering the path and a stream, GrimsbyLive reports.   It is understood the foot and lower leg, which were found along an old railway line, are that of a female. One of the dog walkers told neighbours the foot was a size four and said it was attached to the lower part of a leg. The traumatised woman told residents she believes the body part belongs to a young woman. A police cordon has surrounded the scene since Thursday as police try to unravel the mystery.    The parish councilaposs chairman warned locals that a body or more body parts could be somewhere in the village, telling residents to be village and know where their children are at all times. A man who lives near the scene said of one of the dog walkers: She is still traumatised by what she found. It looked like a small foot around a size four and was a womanaposs foot. The man said the body part may have been taken to the path by an animal. He added: We can only guess. But it could be there is, sadly, a body in nearby woods or in the fields around here and an animal has taken part of it away.    That is why the search has been all around in the fields and hedgerows and verges. The body part was found close to a playing field at New Waltham Academy. Detective Inspector Rhodri Troake said: “The body part has now been recovered and has been forensically examined, and while we are still in the very early stages of the investigation, we can confirm it is human and is a small section of a lower leg and foot.   “Further detailed forensic examinations and analysis will now be conducted to ascertain the identity of the inidual and to establish the exact circumstances. “Numerous enquiries are being carried out as part of the investigation to determine what events may have occurred prior to this incident, how the body part came to be on the path and also theof time it may have been in situ in the area.  Additional information will be made available as and when we are in a position to provide more details. “A scene and police cordon will remain in place over the few next days as detectives and forensic experts continue enquiries and we would ask people to please allow officers space and time to be able to progress the investigation.” Chairman of New Waltham Parish Council, Grahame Williams, said: No matter where you live, a gruesome discovery like this would be quite shocking. What is perturbing is the possibility there are other body parts in the village. It is important parents know where their children are at all times and to be vigilant.  If anyone becomes suspicious about anything they should get in touch with Humberside Police immediately. A dog walker said he took his three dogs along the path at .pm on Wednesday night and he didnapost see the limb. He said: If it had been around the footpath when we were there, Iaposm sure my dogs would have found it. So I donapost think it was there the previous evening. The path is used by local schoolchildren. A mum said parents are so concerned by the discovery that more are accompanying their children on their walks to and from school. She said: One of the school kids was off school ill because he had been up all night because of the worry. Even I was worried when I went out to my wheelie bin at night in case I found something gruesome. Police have searched two large fields next to the path, and an underwater search team has scoured Buck Beck, a local stream. The search is expected to resume on Saturday.

Some are being hit for hikes of hundreds of pounds after simply notying firms of minor incidents that did not involve making claims. Others were similarly stung merely for inquiring about their policy excesses, experts say. The practice is defended by firms on the grounds that such inquiries, logged on a central industry database, raise “risk profiles”. They maintain that this indicates policyholders who are more likely to make claims.    But experts say the money-grabbing tactic is “endemic” and is costing policyholders millions. Car drivers are thought to be hardest hit by it but it is also believed to affect people querying damage to buildings or theft of property. One driver rang his insurer to askit was worth claiming for hailstone damage but decided not to.    But at renewal time he saw a note flash up on price comparison sites saying he had made a claim. The -year-old from Selby, North Yorks, was offered £ compensation but is now worried about future quotes. Martyn James of consumer complaints site Resolver said firms treated such inquiries as “claimable incidents”, adding: “It’s completely unfair.” Matt Oliver of price comparison site GoCompare said: “If you noty an insurer after any accident or damage, evena claim is unlikely, you could be deemed a higher risk of making a claim or committing an offence in the future.”  The Financial Ombudsman Service said it was seeing a rise in related complaints. But Malcolm Tarling of the Association of British Insurers said: “Telling your insurer that you do not want to make a claim does not automatically mean your premium will go up.” "},{"url":null,"title":"lotto results live numbers saturdays","story":"NewsLotto results LIVE: Numbers for Saturdays £. million jackpotThe winning National Lottery numbers and Thunderball for Saturday April  - live breaking updates belowShareByNeil MurphyUpdated:,  APR NewsA lucky winner could scoop a massive £.m jackpot tonight \" data-chronos-request-url\"https:livecentreps-eb-prod.tm-awx v live-centre nationals-live \" data-embedded-url-endpoint\"https:www.mirror news uk-news lotto-results-live-numbers-saturdays- serviceresponsiveembeddedArticleUrl\" data-chronos-domain\"https:livecentreps-eb-prod.tm-awx \" data-inview\"true\"Tonightaposs National Lottery offers the chance to win a whopping £. million rollover jackpot.

She was in such a panic she couldnapost even remember how to spell her boyfriendaposs name.Rebecca was blue-lighted to hospital where her temperature climbed to .C, putting her at risk of dangerous seizures, she says.And as her body failed to respond to treatment, she feared she was hours away from not making it. But the thought of not seeing her son Louie, two, petried her and was simply not an option, she said. He gave her the strength, determination and positivity to keep fighting and six days later she pulled through and was able to leave hospital. The experience was a real wake up call for Rebecca, who said it spurred her and boyfriend John Thorpe, , onto booking their wedding just days after. They got married six months later and Rebecca has now bravely spoken toabout what happened to her to raise awareness of how serious asthma can be. Her husband is running the London Marathon to raise money for Asthma UK.    Rebecca, from Essex, said: My asthma is normally mild but one morning I woke up wheezy and breathless. I couldn’t get my breath back and I had to call for an ambulance. The look in John’s eyes when he thought I was going to die will haunt me for the rest of my le. I was so close to death and worried I’d never see my son again. The thought of leaving him without a mum made me fight harder and eventually I pulled through. After that John and I learned that le can take a dramatic turn in a blink of an eye, so we started planning our wedding and we were married six months later.    Rebecca says she has always suffered from asthma, and was diagnosed at the age of . Her condition has meant a few hospital trips over the years, but she says it was never serious until her terrying experience in December . She says sheaposs always been able to manage it, or when sheaposs been put on nebulisers or antibiotics in the past it has always been okay. But her close call aposopened her eyes to how quickly it can turnapos. Rebecca had woken up that frightening morning feeling wheezy but initially thought she would be fine. However it soon became clear she needed help.  As the day went on, my wheeziness got worse and worse and I couldnapost control it, she said. I thought I wouldnapost be able to get up and walk to Louie in his cot. Thataposs when I realised I couldnapost do this on my own. John had already left for work in London, so a panicked Rebecca phoned for an ambulance. Before paramedics got there I was really scared because I couldnapost control my own breathing and no one was there to look after Louie, she said. But when the ambulance arrived, Rebecca knew she was in safe hands. Paramedics got Louie out of his cot and took me to hospital, she said. It was such an effort to breathe. Every breath felt like a struggle. I didnapost have the energy. Panic came over me because I thought aposI canapost control this and itaposs getting worseapos. The pressure on my chest was really tight, it was like a weight on my chest. When paramedics asked me how to spell my partneraposs name I couldnapost think how to spell it. I was so focused on trying to breathe I couldnapost think straight.  At hospital, Rebecca says she was aposfaced with lots of doctors and nursesapos. She was given nebulisers every four hours and put on a drip, she says. I was not allowed off the oxygen. I was not allowed to walk and talking was almost impossible, I just didnapost have the energy. But by the evening Rebecca said she felt a lot better. John had come to see her straight from work and left the hospital at about pm when she was feeling okay. She said she had wanted to go home as well but doctors advised her to stay overnight. Now Rebecca saysI hadnapost stayed in hospital that night it would have been a very dferent story. She recalls: As soon as the lights went out I felt wheezy and machines started beeping. My oxygen levels had dropped so low. The nurse phoned John to say I had deteriorated.  A few hours after John had left her, he received a call saying I suggest you come back now, Rebecca says. When they phoned John I thought it must be really serious. He was really scared, I could see it on his face. Everything nurses tried didnapost work. My body didnapost respond. One of them said aposI donapost know what  we can doapos and that scared me. Rebecca feared she was hours away from not making it as her body failed to respond to any of the treatment she was having. I was  and I thought aposthis canapost be happening,apos she said. Rebecca added: Seeing my oxygen levels drop, I realised aposthis is something that I canapost control, itaposs out of my handsapos. I was bedridden, exhausted and drained. It was horrible.  I kept saying aposIaposm OKapos because I convinced myself thatI kept saying it, I would be. I was on the same ward as someone who passed away in the night, and another person who had organ failure. So I knew it was serious. I was thinking aposI need to go home and see Louie. I shouldnapost be here.apos Just the thought of not seeing Louie again petried me. Even though I knew how serious it was, I thought aposI have to get betterapos. I have never been so scared in my le.  Rebeccaaposs temperature reached .C and she says she was told it was so high she was at risk of having a seizure. She said she had to have cold fluids pumped through her and an air conditioning unit beside her bed to try and lower her temperature. Yet she felt so cold she was shivering and was begging to have a blanket. Medics discovered Rebecca had an infection on her lung and she was put on an antibiotic drip to clear it. After eventually stabilising that night, she went on to spend six days in hospital where during the days she would feel okay but every night she would deteriorate in the same way. Rebecca was well looked after though and has praised the medical staff that took care of her, saying they were amazing and she couldnapost fault them. But she missed her son desperately while she was in hospital. Louie didnapost understand, he was so little. I was worried about him and just wanted to get back to him, she said. The thought of him growing up without a mum or leaving him - I had to do everything I could to make sure I got better and came back home to him. Slowly and surely, Rebecca says she got better each day until eventually she was well enough to go home. But it was certainly a wake up call for her. It made me realise how dangerous asthma can be, she said.  Realising le is short, Rebecca thought about her boyfriend and asked herself aposwhat are we waiting for apos So a week after she left hospital, the couple went to view a wedding venue and booked it straight away. And six months later, in July , they got married at a hotel and Rebecca says it was perfect. She says: While I was in hospital I thought aposam I ever going to get married apos I didnapost knowI was going to get home, let alone get married, so it was extra special. The whole experience has made Rebecca think dferently about having asthma. She said: It opened my eyes up massively. Knowing it could take my le so quickly was a massive wake up call. I would say to anyone donapost take it lightheartedly, itaposs serious. Rebeccaaposs husband John is running the London Marathon  for Asthma UK.

He said the insect-like creatures are likely to be leaders and give instructions to the other types. In , he conducted a lecture called Alien Abduction and the Environmental Crisis, justying his theory about the world of the unseen.    He began his lecture with the statement “perhaps human civilisation is coming to an end”. The professor cited a “abduction researcher” in the US who claimed that aliens and humans breed to produce a hybrid species which are so intelligent they are capable of solving the planetaposs major problems. He said: “So, they come not for the sake of us, but for the sake of them, their survival, but their survival is actually our survival as well — the survival of the entire biosphere.” Dr Chi said the aliens will only appear when the world is facing serious crises, such nuclear war.  He added: “It may be more or less assumed that the hybrid project is a response to this impending demise of human civilisation.” Dr Chi said he was “still looking for more evidence to support my view”. He approached The Oxford Union to propose a debate on the subject in April, but was refused.

But when he ascends the throne, he might not be known as King Charles. In fact, we might have to call him by a completely dferent name. Itaposs thought the Prince of Wales might not want to keep his name to reign as monarch thanks to negative connotations with former kings bearing the name Charles.  Itaposs not unusual for a royal to change their given name once theyaposre on the throne. When Queen Victoriaaposs son, Prince Albert Edward, became king in  he took the name Edward VII. And in  another Albert, Duke of York - the Queenaposs father - ascended the throne with the name King George VI. Both used one of their given names, just not their first name. So Prince Charles could choose Philip, Arthur or George as his aposregnalapos name. In  multiple reports circulated that Charles had held private talks with “trusted friends” about the possibility of using his third middle name, George.  Should he do this, he would reign as King George VII. Speaking to Studio , former royal butler Grant Harrold said: Normally royal children have two or three names. The reason is,possibly that child was to become a king or queen, they have to have a kind of pool to choose from. For example, Prince Charles,and when he becomes king, would be - people assume he would be Charles III.But he could technically be George VII because  George  is in his name. A former Buckingham Palace spokesperson, Dickie Arbiter, said this decision would also be a lovely tribute to Charlesapos grandparents. It would not just be a tribute to his grandfather [King George VI], but a sort of loving memory to his late grandmother, whom he absolutely adored, he told the BBC. But Clarence House quickly rubbished the claims, saying no decision had been made and it would be decided at the time Charles became king.  Given the luck of two former monarchs named King Charles, itaposs likely the Prince of Wales wonapost adopt this when he ascends the throne. Charles I, who became king in , dismissed parliament three times and resolved to rule alone four years later. He reigned without a Parliament for more than a decade, a period which was dubbed aposeleven yearsapos tyrannyapos. Following two civil wars, Charles was tried and convicted of being a apostyrant, traitor, murderer and public enemy to the good people of the nationapos and was beheaded for treason on January , . His son, Charles II, lived in exile until he was crowned King of England, Ireland and Scotland in . He was popular and dubbed the Merry Monarch, changing laws brought in by Oliver Cromwell and allowing people more freedom to enjoy themselves.

But those behind the swanky Bank Tower  say its the pinnacle of design and quality.The -storey building in Birmingham, which is developed by Regal Property Group Ltd, has so far achieved a less than impressive rating of . stars on Google with those living there warning prospective neighbours to stay away, BirminghamLive reports.The buildingaposs renters and home owners are worried their hard earned cash is going down the drain. Bernard Caroll, a -year-old retiree, said le has been “hell” since moving in seven months ago.    He said: “It’s been hell since I’ve lived here. Most people who came in September weren’t told about the existing issues with the WiFi. The issues and responses from the developers are so unfair and it’s made me ill actually. “They’re selling it as five-star accommodation, so I can’t believe these issues are going on. I honestly don’t believe anybody would have moved in herethey’d known about the internet. “We’re being treated like idiots. I stay awake all night thinking about it. I’d move out tomorrowI could. I feel robbed. “Being on my own, the internet is a bit of a leline. It’s very comforting to be connected and I’ve lost that for the last seven months. I’m going crazy.” Though residents were provided with public WiFi after they voiced their concerns, they say this connection does not work the majority of the time due to the high number of people trying to access it. Another resident, -year-old design engineer Samuele Sois, said the ongoing issues left him unable to work from his apartment. He said: “We’ve been stranded for months and months. We now have a public WiFi connection, but it’s extremely slow and doesn’t work at all during peak times. “I moved in September and I can remember seeing a letter promising that the issue will be fixed within a week, but it still hasn’t. “That’s the worst bit, the level of communication and the basic need for honesty and transparency from the management. They keep promising and not delivering.”    Samuele added that there are ongoing issues with the building’s elevators, meaning heaposs had to carry his young child and pram up to the th floor. “They left a broken elevator for months and months. Though there are two elevators these are for  floors and a lot of people, so one lt between us for months didn’t work well at all.  “I have a young child so it was very dficult to carry him and the shopping upstairs.” According to Samuele, the building’s cleanliness is another issue, with overflowing rubbish and dirty windows a common sight. The growing list of concerns is causing some residents to question their investment.    Ricky McDowall paid £, for a one-bed apartment in the building - but now fears the poor reviews could impact himhe decided to sell in the future. He said: “I love the apartment, but having the internet would be nice. It’s abysmal that you pay for a luxury apartment with a state of the art building and then you don’t have internet. “It said state of the art on the advertisements, yet they fitted copper cables instead of Fibre Optic. Copper is currently being fazed out. “People are reviewing the building online and in five years time that could come back to hurt meI decide to sell the place. I’m worried about losing value on my apartment because of this.”    Mark Holbeche, of Regal Property Group, said the company had been working with contractors to resolve the issues. He said: “We were concerned to discover that a small minority of residents have experienced initial set up issues at The Bank. While we worked closely with our contractor Wates to produce a snag-free building on completion, as with any new-build property, there are likely to be minor snagging issues on first occupation. We have worked diligently to address them in a timely and effective manner, while keeping residents fully updated. “We would ask for the assistance of residents in ensuring that, for instance, apartments are correctly ventilated as explained in the home guide which all residents receive on completion, and that the advised weight limits in the elevators are noted, as this has caused minor issues. Likewise, we will ensure that our managing agents are available and approachable to assist wherever possible. “While there has been an unfortunate and unavoidable delay in installation, I am pleased to say that fibre broadband is now fully connected throughout the building via Virgin Media and residents can now register to set up their connections. A high-quality temporary internet connection was made available to residents throughout the interim to ensure disruption was kept to a minimum.    “As with much of the city, waste disposal has been affected by the Birmingham City Council bin strikes and our managing agents have organised private refuse collections at no extra cost to residents. Windows are also cleaned quarterly, and our contractor has organised specialist services to dispose of debris. “Work on the completion of the second tower is well underway and the entire development is due for completion later this year, at which point communal spaces such as the gym, residents’ coffee lounge and landscaped area, as well as the retail space will be open, as per the timetable provided to all purchasers. When the first residents moved in, a concierge service was set up between .am and .pm, and an out-of-hours service has also been available to ensure we could assist residents at all times. The full -hour on-site concierge service will be available on completion of the second tower. “The Bank has been designed to a high specication, using high quality materials and finishes, and has recently won an industry award for sustainability. The vast majority of feedback we have received from residents has been positive and we endeavour to provide the best service we can, and it is vital that we, our managing agents and residents maintain an open dialogue to ensure that all issues are addressed as quickly and effectively as possible to ensure that The Bank remains a leading choice for city centre living in Birmingham.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather forecast storm hannah","story":"NewsUK weather forecast: Storm Hannah hits as Met Office warns danger to LIFEThe Met Office has issued severe weather warnings as Storm Hannah threatens to flood homes, cut power and disrupt travel with mph gales and heavy rainShareCommentsByChris kitching:,  APR Updated:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video storm-hannah-sends-tent-flying-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:,],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailStorm Hannah is hitting with mph winds, heavy rain and severe coastal gales, leaving thousands without power and threatening to flood homes and disrupt travel.

There were cancellations after a tree fell on the line between Abercynon and Quakers Yard, but all lines have now reopened. Fallen trees have blocked roads in North Wales and Somerset, and the M Severn Bridge was closed to all eastbound traffic and high-sided vehicles in both directions. Garden furniture and trampolines were blown around, and huge waves were crashing onto shorelines in Wales and western England. In Derby, roofing was blown loose from the top of painter Joseph Wrightaposs former home. Despite the disruption, the storm raised a few smiles.    Filmmaker Chris Lloyd captured a panda-shaped tent seemingly scuttling down the streets of Cardf all alone. He joked: A rare sighting this morning in Roath, Cardf of Hannah of #StormHannah fame whoaposs actually just an angry panda. The core of the storm was situated over the Yorkshire coast in the early afternoon as it churned towards the North Sea and winds eased. The Llyn Peninsula saw the highest gust overnight when a gust of mph was clocked at Aberdaron.  Meanwhile a gust of mph was recorded at Pembrey Sands in Carmarthenshire and a mph gust was observed at the Needles off the Isle of Wight. Forecasters said the highest winds were expected in exposed coastal areas, although gusts could reach up to mph as the storm moves inland. The heaviest rain fell across Northern Ireland and western Wales, with mmin Capel Curig in Snowdonia National Park, and mm in Katesbridge, Co Down, in just six hours. Another mm was expected in Northern Ireland.

A spokesman said that by midday almost all had had their power restored, but the network could see pockets of disruption until the wind eased off completely. Many areas will see wet and windy conditions on Saturday, although Scotland and South East England are expected to see better weather. However temperatures are only expected to reach between C and C - much lower than the C heat seen over the Easter weekend.  Western parts could also see a touch of frost on Saturday night under clearer skies in Storm Hannahaposs wake. Met Office forecaster Simon Partridge: Itaposs a gradually improving picture as we go through the afternoon. Storm Hannah is gradually moving south east so it has pretty much already cleared the south west of England so itaposs much drier and brighter now with just a few showers around. He added: By the evening the winds will gradually ease but it will be a pretty wet and windy day.  Forecaster Marco Petagna said earlier: We are seeing quite hefty bursts of rain moving across Northern Ireland and into Wales, with where a bit more showery in nature. There are also quite lively gusts of wind, certainly for the UK, between  to mph and the highest at Aberdaron of mph at around midnight. The winds will pick up through the morning across the rest of southern England as the low tracks its way eastwards. The most persistent rain will be across Northern Ireland and Wales, with some showery outbreaks across parts of northern England as well.  Named by the Irish weather service Met Eireann, Storm Hannah barrelled into Irelandaposs south-west on Friday. Forecasters issued several weather warnings, including a red warning of violent gusts. The highest recorded were at Mace Head in Galway, where mph was observed, while gusts reached mph at Shannon Airport. Two flights from Shannon Airport to London Heathrow were cancelled, as passengers were told to check their flight status.  ESB Networks said strong winds had caused damage to the electricity network affecting approximately , homes, farms and businesses, predominantly in counties Kerry and Cork. Met Eireann said that very windy conditions would continue on Saturday morning before easing. Whilst the winds will abate, it will still be windy into the afternoon, with brisk northwest wind steering down a mix of sunny spells  scattered heavy showers, the weather service tweeted. The storm will have moved on by the time the London Marathon gets under way on Sunday morning.  The weather conditions for the UKaposs biggest race could be ideal, say forecasters. Mr Partridge said those running the London Marathon could expect a chilly start. The London Marathon will be fairly breezy, pretty cloudy and with a chance of a few showers while the runners are lining up and getting ready, he said. The morning will be gloomy and grey, but slower runners could feel the sun on their backs.  Mr Partridge added: We could see sunshine breaking through in the afternoon and we could see highs of -C - much warmer than today, but nowhere near the record breaking heat we saw last year. In , the mercury hit .C on the day of the marathon. Met Office five-day weather forecast Saturday Cold, with showers or longer spells of rain, most persistent across Northern Ireland, Wales, central and northern England as Storm Hannah hits. Southern England, south Wales and northern Scotland will see the best brightness. Very windy in the south and west. Coastal severe gales. Saturday night The wet and windy weather will ease overnight. Remaining rather cloudy with patchy rain across eastern Scotland, central and eastern parts of England. Clearer spells and patchy frost further west. Sunday Northern, central and eastern areas start rather cloudy with patchy rain. Skies will brighten, with some showers developing. Meanwhile Northern Ireland, Wales and southwest England start bright, before rain arrives. Monday to Wednesday Monday looks rather cloudy with some rain in the west. Brighter further north and east. Rain will move eastwards during Tuesday and Wednesday, followed by sunshine and showers. Showers or longer spells of rain are likely for many on Wednesday, though there will be sunny spells too. However, a pattern of generally dry weather looks likely to develop over the first few days of May and at the start of the bank holiday weekend.  "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather storm hannah batters","story":"NewsUK weather: Storm Hannah batters Britain as mph winds leave thousands without powerThousands have been left without power, roads have been closed by fallen trees and planes have struggled to land as Storm Hannah batters BritainShareCommentsByAmber Hicks:,  APR Updated:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video storm-hannah-sends-tent-flying-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailStorm Hannah is wreaking havoc over parts of the country bringing winds of up to mph and wiping out power at thousands of homes.

Lee was little more than a stranger to me then, but he captivated me with his brilliance, sensitivity, and passion. “His lectures changed forever the way that I think.”    By the time Platt was graduating at the top of her class with a degree in English and a certicate in theatre, she said Mitchell, who turns  in June, had become her “devoted mentor”. But after leaving Princeton, she moved to Oxford and during her years in the UK she said she often thought about the professor. She added: “I was surprised to find how much I still thought of Lee - and soon I understood that I felt something for him that I’d not fully acknowledged before. “At the end of my two years in Oxford, after much reflection, and with encouragement from my wonderful friends, I resolved to shoot my shot.” Platt said the pair only started dating six months ago after praising his “brilliance, sensitivity, and passion”.  She contacted him last September and asked him on a date to the politan Museum of Art in New York. They frolicked through the galleries like “shy teens, eager but tentative,” she wrote. She accepted how her fiancé could be confused over her attraction to him and spent most of the first date trying to figure outit was a date, as they were both “unsure of how to test new boundaries with each other. She wrote: “At last, to our amazement, we broke through. Something then sprouted from a seed that neither of us had known that we’d planted, and we realised that the force of feeling that we’d long had for each other and called by other namesheld within it the hope and the potential for love.  Platt, who is originally from Santa Barbara, Calornia, kept their relationship “private” for the six months, but once they became engaged after about seven months of dates, she was ready to make the relationship public. She acknowledged that the announcement “will come as a surprise to many”. She also admitted the couple had concerns about their relationship, given their “dferent stages of le.” But she wrote that sheaposs deeply in love with her former professor. She added: “Eventually it became impossible to deny how fully we feel meant for each other, and neither of us has looked back since. “Now here we are, more enthralled than ever, wanting no le other than one we make together. Last week, we made it official.Mitchell is on academic sabbatical from Princeton which was requested before his relationship with Platt, a spokesman for Princeton told the New York Post."},{"url":null,"title":"luxury home total sea views","story":"NewsLuxury home with total sea views - because its pinned to side of a CLIFFFive-storey pad has rooms stacked on top of each other and appears to float above the seaShareCommentsByAndrew Gilpin:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsThe luxury home will be pinned to the side of a clf \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe only way is up for anyone planning to go pop to the shops in this amazing home The five-storey pad has rooms stacked on top of each other - and itaposs pinned firmly to the side of a CLIFF. Its top floor offers the way out to ground level, while on the lowest floor the home opens up to an outdoor space which seems to float above the water. And of course thereaposs sea views - with little chance of someone obscuring the view by building in front of you.  Designed by prefab architecture specialists Modscape Concept, the unique building is just a concept at the moment. Aptly called Clf House, the design was created in response to a growing number of people who want to live in rocky areas deemed unlivable. The home was inspired by the shape of barnacles clinging to a hull of a ship, and it extends off the side of a clf, rather than sitting upon it.  The designers say: The unique positioning also gives the homeaposs residents an incredible connection to the ocean below, while alleviating construction problems associated with building on uneven rock. Rooms are stacked atop each other and held securely in place with engineered steel pins. The designers added: Residents would enter at the floor level with the clf top, which includes an outdoor patio adjacent to their parking space.  An elevator or stairs connects each floor, with the bedroom, living area and kitchen each having separate space on the ious floors. The interior features minimal furniture throughout, in order to emphasize the connection to the ocean and the horizon. Patio furniture, an outdoor kitchen and a jacuzzi tub extend the luxurious feeling of being perched above the ocean.

Martin Woods, captain for the day, stepped up and fired into the corner.Just one minute had passed, however, and the home side were level. David Turnbull let fly from outside the area and a massive deflection saw the ball loop over Seny Dieng and into the net.Dundee weren’t done, though, and re-took the lead through loanee Ethan Robson. The Sunderland man bashed James Dunne to the ground before curling a fine strike home from  yards.Once more, the lead didn’t last long.This time it was two minutes and this time it wasn’t bad luck that cost them, instead bad defending as James Scott was allowed to turn on the ball inside the six-yard box before his shot somehow squeezed through Dieng and into the net.Dundee almost grabbed the lead for a third time shortly after the restart as Jesse Curran saw his effort knocked on to his own post by ’Well keeper Mark Gillespie.The fth goal did come – this time it was the home side taking the lead on  minutes.It looked like Alan Campbell was about to shoot from eight yards only for Nathan Ralph to get a vital toe in. The ball, though, dropped for Ariyibi who took a touch before burying it low into the corner.Leads weren’t lasting long in this one and once more it was level within seconds as Ralph rose unchallenged in the area to smash a fine header beyond Gillespie.Motherwell were then reduced to  men as Gorrin ed in on Craig Curran on halfway to earn a second yellow card with half-an-hour to play.On  minutes, the Dens men were within inches once more of going ahead for a third time as Gensy Kusunga flicked a Woods corner off the far post.With  minutes to go, Turnbull went for his second of the day from range but sent his effort just over Dieng’s crossbar. Four minutes later, Turnbull tried again but this time Dieng pulled off a super stop to keep it at -.On  minutes, Dundee hearts were in mouths as referee Kevin Clancy pointed to the spot after the ball struck Kusunga#s arm. There were dark blue sighs of relief, though, as linesman Jordan Stokoe indicated the ball had already gone behind for a goal kick.That relief wouldn#t last until the final whistle, however, as what was left of Dundee#s hopes of survival were hit once more as -man Motherwell snatched the win in stoppage time.Turnbull had been a stand-out all day and grabbed his second of the afternoon after

McInnes insists he has a Plan B with potential replacements already sourced should Graeme Shinnie leave Aberdeen in the summer.Shinnie is out of contract at the end of the season and has been offered a new lucrative long-term Dons deal.Derby County are closing in on the -year-old who recently travelled to the Championship club for talks.The Rams are operating under a soft transfer embargo which has delayed any pre-contract move for Shinnie.McInnes will leave the door open for the Scotland cap to commit his future to the Reds but admits it is highly unlikely the captain will stay.As Shinnie stalled on confirming his future McInnes has been planning for his unwanted exit for months now.McInnes, whose side face Rangers at Ibrox tomorrow, said: “We prepare for le without Shinnie and the other out-of-contract players until they commit to us.“Graeme has a few things to sort out still at the minute.“We have been preparing for a while now.“Conversations have been on-going and we have all taken in plenty of games.“We have been plotting and planning, trying really hard to identy key players.“We’re preparing for le without key players butthey want to stay, the door is still open.”Scotland international winger Gary Mackay-Steven also has a deal set to expire at the end of the season. MLS side New York City approached the Dons in January to open up talks with the winger.McInnes has been keen to retain Mackay-Steven.Aberdeen have also opened up contract talks with on-loan Rotherham defender Dom Ball.At the end of the season Ball’s contract expires with his parent club and McInnes aims to secure him on a permanent deal.The Dons boss confirmed there has been no development in talks with Shinnie, Mackay-Steven or Ball.Shinnie faces a battle to be fit before the end of the season having sustained ankle ligament damage in the - defeat of Kilmarnock.McInnes confirmed that could rule Shinnie out for up to six weeks. If that is the case the club skipper could have played his last game for Aberdeen as Derby boss Frank Lampard has admitted he is keen to sign him.However, McInnes has confirmed Shinnie is determined to beat the odds toto fitness for the final game of the season, away to Hibs on Sunday May  – potentially Shinnie’s farewell to the Aberdeen supporters.McInnes said: “There is ligament damage but no damage to the bone.“It is about four to six weeks but Shinnie is adamant he will be back for the last game of the season. Certainly at this stage though he is up against it.”Despite suffering the injury, Shinnie opted to stay on the pitch at Rugby Park for the remaining  minutes as the Dons had used all their substitutes.He said: “Shinnie didn’t want to come off.“We didn’t expect anything from him as Kilmarnock were down to nine men and then they went down to eight in the last throes of the game.“Shinnie was on the pitch but he never touched the ball and never really did anything. It is maybe symbolic enough that he wanted to stay on the pitch rather than be seen to come off.”The loss of Shinnie is the latest injury blow with Aberdeen set to face Rangers tomorrow with six first-team regulars ruled out.On-loan Birmingham attacker Greg Stewart , Gary Mackay-Steven , Niall McGinn , Shaleum Loganand Tommie Hobanare all out.Aberdeen will tomorrow bid for a fourth straight win over Rangers in Glasgow.Ibrox boss Steven Gerrard has added extra spice to an already tempestuous fixture by insisting the Dons raise their game when facing Rangers.On those comments, McInnes said: “We raise our game every game.“We don’t always get the results, our home form could have been better, but our away form has been second to none.“We have had six years of solid work and we have raised our game time and again against every opponent.”McInnes may have an injury-hit team but he is confident they can find a way to secure a memorable quadruple of Glasgow wins.He said: “Beating Rangers in Glasgow three times is not an easy thing to do. Rangers, and Celtic, have huge advantages over everyone  so to find that consistency against Rangers is good. It shows we can find ways.“At Ibrox tomorrow it may not necessarily be the team we would want to put out.“But we will try to put out a team that will be competitive to try to get a result despite us being the underdog.“Rangers were very good at Hearts last week and were able to score three goals away from home at a tough venue.“But our away form gives us confidence we can put in a performance that gives us a chance of getting the result we want.”McInnes was this week charged by the Scottish FA having been sent to the stand during the - Scottish Cup semi-final loss to Celtic.He was sent off after making a gesture towards Celtic fans in reaction to sectarian abuse directed at him. The hearing is set for Friday May .On being issued with a notice of complaint, McInnes said: “I wasn’t surprised and we will deal with that next week.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/04/2.26537888-240x180.jpg

contractor, the job of turning the vision for Union Terrace Gardens into reality is about to start in earnest.“This is a moment for celebration right across Aberdeen.“The investment we’re making is transforming our city and the benefits will be felt throughout the region. Generations to come can share in the rewards.”Hector MacAulay, Balfour Beatty’s regional managing director of Scotland and

Centre Masterplan.“Our construction expertise coupled with our experience in regenerating public spaces makes us ideally positioned to deliver the three new pavilions and sympathetically upgrade this much-loved historic space which will benefit the local community and visitors alike for years to come.”SNP Group Leader, Councillor Stephen Flynn said: “I am sure the people of Aberdeen will be at a

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a £, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14580367.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_180419rugby_02JPG.jpg","title":"ayr rugby club prepare murrayfield","story":"NewsAyr Rugby Club prepare for Murrayfield date with destiny against HeriotsThe club will bid to land a fourth Scottish Cup and complete a league and cup double this season when they head for the capital on Saturday.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  APR NewsAyr Rugby coach Peter Murchie and his players \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Make mine a double, writes Ron Evans.That was the cry at Millbrae when the pink and black faithful realised that their team had created the chance to win the Tennent’s Premiership and the Scottish Cup in what will be the last opportunity to achieve this feat under the current league set-up. Ayr have been there before of course in  when they won the Premiership by defeating Currie then the Cup final against Melrose with the unforgettable Cammy Taylor try in the injury time of extra time. This time, however, they take on Heriot’s in both games. Having won the epic Tennent’s Premiership play-off final against the Goldenacre outfit two weeks ago, the Nailsare again Ayr’s opponents on Saturday in the cup final at Murrayfield. It might be inappropriateto suggest that Ayr are going out to hammer the Nails on Saturday, but that is exactly what they plan to do. Now in possession of more senior cup and league medals than any other Scottish player, veteran full back Grant Anderson told some of the rookies for whom this is a first- time experience: “You think beating Heriots at Millbrae was good  “Doing it at Murrayfield will feel a hundred times better!” Skipper Pete McCallum, heading for his third cup final at Murrayfield with a won one lost one record, certainly agreed that it was great chance for the players to express themselves on the big stage. “Playing on the international pitch is always something really special so we want to enjoy the occasion and go out with a bang,” he said.  As was the case at Millbrae, there will be little to choose between the two sides, their regular league form having panned out with an away win each but in the winner-takes- all contest for the Premiership title showdown, Ayr were superior. “Yes, we are in a good place but there will be no complacency” said coach Peter Murchie. “It was a physical game and we would expect the same in the cup final. “Thankfully we didn’t pick up any injuries and we were able to give the squad a bit of a rest after the last game which has let us build gradually towards Murrayfield.” “The squad are totally motivated as you would expect from any team going into a cup final becauseyou can’t be motivated for that then I donapost know what would get you up for a game. “I have said several times to the squad that opportunities like this don’t come along very often in your career and you have to take those opportunities and make the very best of it. “Some of our squad have experienced this situation before and our senior players will be a big part of what we achieve but we have some really exciting young talent as well so we will give it our best shot and hopefully have a great finish to what has already been a memorable season.” It has indeed been memorable andAyr do add a fourth Scottish Cup success to the Tennent’s Premiership title, then the call will likely be for trebles not doubles all round. Good luck. Good luck.A ticket for the Millbrae breakfast,coach travel and entrance to the match is £.Other options include £ for match ticket and coach travel and £ for the match ticket only.

The cash withdrawals took place between July  and May  and Cowan helped herself to more than £, of the patient’s savings. The Scottish Social Services Councilheard how the offence came to light when the victim, known only as ‘AA’ and requiring “multiple care needs” decided to alert care home staff, believing that the money would never be repaid.When shocked senior staff at Glebe House found out about the incidents they called the police and reported the matter to the Care Inspectorate and the SSSC. But in the subsequent investigation, Cowan was understood to have shown “limited insight and remorse” in respect of her actions. The victim gave evidence during the hearing, telling the SSSC’s Fitness to Practise Panel how, during a conversation with Cowan, she told her she was “worried about money.” The victim initially offered Cowan money but that invitation was declined. However, in a later conversation, around a week later, Cowan, who had no previous record of wrong-doing with the SSSC, indicated that she “needed a certain amount of money.” On this occasion Cowan was given the lady’s bank card and PIN and the service user believed £ would be withdrawn. In the weeks and months thereafter, a similar scenario took place “several times.” Several cash withdrawals took place from the ATM at the Co-operative, Dalmellington. Cowan then came up with a “sob story” about a family member’s Christmas present and again, the patient handed over her bank card. This pattern continued and the patient did not report the matter at that point because Cowan “promised to pay it back” and she “believed her.” However, the victim’s concerns grew and she reported the matter to other members of staff after fearing she wasn’t going to get her money back. Another witness claimed she was “shocked” that a carer had taken a resident’s bank card and withdrawn money for her own use. During the investigation process Cowan started to make repayments of the outstanding amount. At the hearing in Dundee the victim was described as a “lonely and vulnerable inidual” but “very switched on” and an “impressive witness” who gave her evidence in a forthright manner and was found to be both “credible” and “reliable.” In their written judgement the SSSC found Cowan’s conduct fell “far below the standards” expected, labelled her actions were “serious and deliberate” and amounted to a “signicant breach of trust.” The Panel also stated they could not be satisfied that Cowan had “acknowledged the gravity” of her conduct, or that she demonstrated “meaningful regret.” The judgement concluded: “A Removal Order is the only sanction that will provide an adequate safeguard against yourepeating your misconduct. “It is the only sanction that will ensure that service users are not placed at risk of harm and will maintain public confidence in social services and the SSSC as regulator.” Cowan was neither present nor represented at the hearing. A spokesperson for East Ayrshire Council said: “We are aware of the situation and understand that care home management acted appropriately in conjunction with Scottish Social Service Council and Care Inspectorate when they learned about allegations against the member of staff. “Through our contract management arrangements we actively engage with all the care homes in East Ayrshire to provide assurance in respect of the quality of service provided to residents.” The Post did contact Glebe House Care Home for a response but did not receive one.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrEast Ayrshire CouncilSocial servicesDundee"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14579806.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_010419county_07JPG.jpg","title":"behind scenes south ayrshire council","story":"NewsBehind the scenes at South Ayrshire Council headquartersCounty Buildings mixes antiques with new modern offices in this revealing look behind the scenesShareBySarah Hilley:,  APR NewsCouncillors library at County Buildings \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIt is home to antiques, grand paintings and museum treasures. But historic County Buildings is also a modern workplace housing  staff delivering services for more than , people in South Ayrshire. From the grandeur of Provost Helen Moonie’s luxurious sea-view office to the dingy corridors of the basement, the  landmark is full of character. Our Local Democracy Reporter went on a ‘behind the scenes’ tour guided by council depute chief executive Douglas Hutchison. Looking around County Buildings, it is clear to see that history speaks through the detailed decor oozing out of every cornice. Two sweeping staircases sparkle with stunning stained-glass windows which hark back to the time when the whole of Ayrshire was ided into burghs. Each burgh had a crest, which are intricately etched into the glass. They include Ayr, Irvine, Troon Prestwick, Darvel, Kilmarnock, Largs and Saltcoats among others.  Nowadays Ayrshire is ruled by three separate councils but the County Buildings design still echoes a past when Ayr reigned supreme. Its former position of housing the entire admininstrative work of the county is reflected in its extravagant architecture. The main council chambers where all major decisions take place have sleek slide-back oak  – which open into other rooms. The chambers could have one of the finest council views in the country overlooking the Firth of Clyde. Every committee room has an open fireplace, which would have warmed the wind-battered building before central heating. Another room has a glass display cabinet showing a town clerk wig and Royal Burgh of Ayr Truncheon among other artefacts. Councillors have their own swish ‘members library’ with newspapers, tea and coffee. The details of meetings taking place behind closed doors are still written in old-fashioned chalk on the front of blackboards. Showing us around, Mr Hutchison said: “This the front face of the council where the council business takes place.” The director of people also took us to a secret location – a secure vault – which opens into a large room for storingpostal votes.Now there is a mission to make the historic building more up to date to adhere with current workday practices. The original architecture is in conflict with the needs of a al workplace where open-plan is the norm. Attempts to fit more people into open- plan space means walls must come down but due to the listed status of the landmark all alterations must be carefully managed. There is also a need to make room for staff coming from the John Pollock centre and soon-to-be demolished Burns House. In contrast to the splendid offices and committee meeting rooms on the first floor, a newly renovated office for employee services staff features skylights and a purple meeting pod. Mr Hutchison said: “It is a lovely building. But trying to fit a modern working environment into an old building is not easy. There is a lot going on to make it more modern. We need to make more efficient use of space. The days of everybody turning up at their desks are gone. We have to work more flexibly.” Mr Hutchison showed us empty offices stripped bare, which are currently awaiting a facelt. Money to maintain the seat of power is ongoing with windows getting replaced along with other repairs. Mr Hutchison said: “There is a programme of general investment in the building.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsMuseumsKilmarnockIrvineCosmetic surgeryFirth of ClydeTroonDarvelPrestwickLargsSaltcoats"},{"url":null,"title":"debenhams ayr stay open department","story":"NewsDebenhams in Ayr to stay open as department store announces list of  stores to closeThe department store giant has revealed the first list of stores set to close early next year.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  APR NewsDebenhams is an anchor store for Ayr Central \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailScores of jobs have been spared after Debenhams confirmed their outlet in Ayr Central shopping mall is to survive an initial axe.

Its new owners, who are a consortium of banks and hedge funds, are launching the major store-closure programme via an insolvency process known as a company voluntary arrangement  before the end of this week. It is expected that the first group of stores will close after trading through the Christmas period.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14564550.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18934953.jpg","title":"partick thistle chairman shares tweet","story":"NewsPartick Thistle chairman shares tweet showing injured wrist after celebrating Jags win against Ayr UnitedJacqui Low led from the front as Partick gained a massive win in their battle to beat the drop.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  APR NewsJacqui shows off her injured hand, left, and chats to boss Gary Caldwell before last nights clash\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA football chairman took one for the team last night - after injuring herself celebrating a vital three points.

That’s because Joe, who has died aged , was a one-man citizens’ advice bureau. Joe was incredibly well-versed on how local government works. And he knew the right people to contact in a range of agencies, including South Ayrshire Council. In recent years, Joe was best known as chairman of Riverside Tenants and Residents Association. But he was equally weel kent in the Lochside and Wallacetoun areas - working passionately to improve the housing stock. Joe seemed to be involved in everything pertaining to housing and community issues. He worked alongside Shelter, learning about legislation on homelessness. He also had close links with Riverside Evangelical Church and the Salvation Army - respecting the wonderful work they do in the community. Joe was also involved with the John Pollock Centre, the Mainholm Advice Centre and was on the Community Planning Board. He was a member of the late lamented Wallacetoun and Newton Regeneration Forumwhich provided a focal point for five communities in Ayr. Joe Lafferty hailed from Newarthill, Lanarkshire, and was a choirboy in his youth. He loved singing right up to his untimely death, being a member of the Ayrways Choir, which helps people with breathing dficulties. In his late teenage years and throughout his s, Joe worked abroad for much of the time. He was a project manager on building sites in countries including Nigeria and Pakistan. Joe ed to Scotland after his marriage to Jean, and became aware of the need for communities to have a voice. This became the driving force in the second half of his le. David Burns, South Ayrshire Council’s former head of housing, said he was sorry to hear of Joe’s passing. Mr Burns added: “He was a wonderful gentleman, always taking a keen interest wherever he felt there was a benefit for the community orhe felt ideas would have a detrimental impact on people. “He also made sure I kept my feet on the ground and often said, ‘Don’t change your ability to listen to the community boy, and you’ll do just rightly.” Joe was highly thought of by many senior SAC managers, and often engaged in banter with them, to make his point. Colleague and friend Pauline Mackie said of Joe: “He was never a man who shied away from his own past mistakes and was always very courteous and generous about others as well. He was never a man to bare a grudge. “His wisdom and knowledge along with his sense of humour made him legendary . People were drawn to him even though it meant not getting much of a word in once he got started. He was always courteous and never lost his sense of humour. “Joe also believed in sharing the knowledge he had gleaned over  years, believing knowledge would empower people and communities.” Pauline added: “ Joe, myself and Jackie Lennon considered ourselves the Three Musketeers in the Wallacetoun and Newton Regeneration Forum. “I believe we did make a dference to a lot of people, but sadly the project came to an end.” Joe’s funeral service will be held at noon at Masonhill Crematorium on April  - which would have been his st birthday. He is survived by Jean and their sons, Jack and Jamie, of whom he was immensely proud, and who, like their dad, have worked abroad.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilArmed forcesAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"new-toy-museum-location-and-thirlestane-castle-events","story":"Thirlestane Castle have announced an exciting programme for the summer, including an open-air cinema, and a new location for the Toy Museum.The castlersquos historic toy collection, which features toys, games and pictures from the past, has been relocated to the former school room on the upper ground floor.Thanks to the new location, the Toy Museum now resembles the scene of an early th century nursery in a country house, and it will prove a little wonderland for visiting children.The collection showcases items loaned from the Pollock Toy Museum in London, as well as the belongings of children who once lived at the castle.The castle, which dates back to the th century, is still the family home of the Maitlands.Edward Maitland-Carew said: ldquoIrsquom delighted our fantastic collection of historic toys will be back on display and am eagerly anticipating all of the special events, particularly the new Open-Air Cinema screenings.Thirlestane Castle features some of the finest decorative plasterworks in Europe, and one of the most extensive family collections of portraits and busts in Scotland.Mr Maitland-Carew said: ldquoItrsquos always an exciting time as we approach the start of a new visitor season here at Thirlestane Castle and I am delighted to be able to share Thirlestane Castle with visitors once again.ldquoWe are looking forward to welcoming back familiar faces, not least our wonderful volunteers, the Friends of Thirlestane.Attractions available every day include the Team Room and Gt Shop.

This mast should provide an lsquoemergency servicersquo for all the local residents and businesses should our land lines fail, as they frequently do.ldquoThere have been many occasions when accidents have happened with no means of getting help.ldquoThis will also be a great asset to tourists and traffic passing through our valley.The local branch of the National Farmers Union, which counts  members, has also thrown its weight behind the proposals.In a support letter, Selkirk branch secretary Rory Murray writes: ldquoIt is vital that in todayrsquos connected world, basic services now include the provision of a reliable mobile network, and not just for the obvious benefits to rural safety, should people be stranded without signal.ldquoA solid G signal will transform many agricultural-based businessrsquo ability to complete basic tasks that are now exclusively online, as the time constraints poor mobile phone signal and broadband signal places on rural businesses is a very real worry for our members.Despite this, Scottish Borders Council has received nine letters of objection to the plans, with objectors citing the height of the mast, the impact on the landscape and the potential detrimental impact on property prices.Mr Brian Russell, of Selkirk, writes in his objection letter: ldquoThat the Ettrick valley must have mobile masts is disappointing to those of us who came here to escape such things.ldquoOf course escape is now becoming impossible anywhere on this island, but at the very least we had hoped to be allowed to live far enough away from a base station not to be adversely affected.ldquoHealth concerns for masts and cell phones are largely discounted now, but itrsquos as well to remember that the questionable safety of very profitable technologies may not come out for decades after their introduction, e.g. in the s and s there was widespread use of agrochemicals. I was a farmer at that time and was told they were perfectly safe. Many of the chemicals we were using then have now been banned as unsafe for one reason or another.ldquoI fear the same sort of thing will happen with mobile technologies, the overuse of which masts like this one will encourage ndash technologies which are described as essential but are more often than not simply recreational or convenient.In a submission to council planners, the developers have tried to address some of the issues raised by the objectors.Damian Hosker, the principal planner at WHP Telecoms, writes: ldquoG connectivity enables iniduals and businesses to work and ecommerce effectively from home.ldquoThis means that car travel can be reduced which has a positive effect on the environment.ldquoMobile connectivity creates a sustainable community and promotes environmental issues.ldquoThe proposal is set against the backdrop of the forest. The screening could not be more prominent. WHP will, however, paint the installation green or brown or whatever colour the local planning authority wishes to see.ldquoThe value of property is not a planning issue, however, in an age where connectivity is ever more important for e-commerce, including: real-time tax s education health services requirement to attract tourists social wellbeing and emergencies there is expected to be a positive value to property as a result of being connected.ldquoNo connectivity in the UK is not acceptable to purchasers in the st century.As a result of the number of objections received, the application will be decided by councillors sitting on the Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning and building standards committee.The committee is due to meet on Monday, April  to deliberate on the proposals."},{"url":null,"title":"community-group-targets-steading-to-ease-ettrick-housing-demand","story":"PLANS are in place for a community development company to buy a redundant steading in the Ettrick Valley to ease housing pressures.With many farm and estate cottages being sold over the past decade or so, affordable rentable accommodation in the rural valleys south of Selkirk has dwindled.The Ettrick and Yarrow Community Development Companyhope to reverse the trend by buying Kirkhope Steading, outside of Ettrickbridge, and convert the buildings into inexpensive homes to rent.EYCDC have also launched a housing survey to identy the demand for affordable housing in the area.The group have commissioned Rural Housing Scotland to independently run the survey to gauge opinion on affordable rent, buying prices, size and type of home required.A paper copy of the survey, along with a reply paid envelope, can be found in the Post Office in Selkirk, Honey Cottage Caravan Park shop in Ettrick, the Cross Keys pub in Ettrickbridge and from the Gordon Arms in Yarrow.The survey form can also be filled in online at https:www.surveymonkey r TNDLDIn , a full survey was carried out which highlighted a need for more affordable housing in the Ettrick and Yarrow Valleys.And it is thought the need has increased signicantly during the past  years.Project Manager of EYCDC, Vicky Davidson said: ldquoWe are concerned that the lack of affordable housing is impacting on the number of children living in the valleys, with fewer families and young people able to find somewhere to live.\"We are urging anyone who might be interested in living in the valleys but do not think they are able to find a suitable house, at an affordable rent, to complete the housing survey as soon as possible.\"And to pass on the survey link to anyone who might like toto live there now or within the next couple of yearsthere was an affordable option available.\"The EYCDCs plans for Kirkhope Steading include some workspace areas and potential office units as well as rentable housing.Funding has been provided by the Scottish Land Fund to carry out an independent valuation, get a structural engineers report and to prepare some architect options for the site.This work is now complete and it was presented to a public meeting in Ettrickbridge on April .The proposal is to start work on the site in the beginning of  and be at completion during spring the following year.For more information contact info@ettrickandyarrow.org.uk"},{"url":null,"title":"council-to-chip-in-extra-42k-for-hawick-regeneration-scheme","story":"SCOTTISH Borders Council has agreed to chip in an extra pound, for a Hawick regeneration scheme, in order to receive a million pound grant from Scottish ministers.The local authority has already been awarded pound.m from Historic Environment Scotland to fund the Hawick Conservation Area Regeneration Scheme .However, the council intended to provide just pound, to the pot, to acquire a pound.m grant, but instead has had to stump up an extra pound, in order to secure pound.m.Along with private sector contributions of pound,, the project will have a budget of pound.m to go towards restoring shop fronts and historic buildings in the town centre.At a meeting of Scottish Borders Council executive committee on Tuesday, April , councillors waved through the extra money and emphasised the positives the CARS scheme will bring to Hawick.Hawick and Hermitage councillor George Turnbull told the meeting: ldquoThis is a great news item for Hawick and will help with the town centre regeneration.ldquoIrsquod just like to publicly record my thanks to the team which has put in so much work to achieve this, I wish the project well and every success over the next five years.Kelso and District councillor Tom Weatherston, who has experienced the CARS scheme in Kelso, added: ldquoI welcome this as great news for Hawick.

However, Mr Cameron had failed to noty Scottish Borders Council planners about the change of use, who found out once concerned neighbours began to complain about noise disturbances by rowdy hen parties.In November , Mr Cameron received an enforcement notice from the council outlining its grievances, which included concerns over noise disturbances, a detrimental impact on residential amenity and a breach of planning protocol.Mr Cameron subsequently appealed to the Scottish Governmentrsquos department for planning and environmental appeals , saying that because the property has been used for this purpose for more than ten years the council could no longer object to the change of use.The appeal statement also outlines the steps Mr Cameron has made in order to mitigate the noise disturbances from his property.This includes removing two hot tubs from the rear of the building, and instead installing a new one in the spa, which has triple-glazing to minimise noise impact.Mr Cameron has also proposed to remove the barbeque facility from the rear decking of the property, in an effort to stop groups of guests congregating outside.Finally, Mr Cameron has proposed employing a night manager to monitor the property and sound levels between pm and am on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, and to give the four closest neighbours a direct line to the night manager to raise any issues immediately.Despite this, the DPEA has ruled against the West Linton businessman, and has been two months to cease using the property as a party mansion.Chirs Norman, a DPEA reporter appointed by Scottish Ministers, writes in his ruling: ldquoBefore  November  the availability of lsquoGreenloaningrsquo for holiday letting, and its limited use for  weeks, was ordinarily incidental to its main use as a house.ldquoSome two or three years after  November  it ceased to be the appellantrsquos main residence.ldquoFrom  lsquoGreenloaningrsquo was continually promoted and used as self-catering accommodation for short-stay lets.ldquoOn the balance of probability and on the basis of the evidence before me I find that the unauthorised change of use of the house occurred between  November  and  November .ldquoTherefore the council is not time-barred from taking enforcement action and the appellantrsquos appeal fails.ldquoI find that the house is accessed from an unsurfaced road in the north-east part of West Linton and is in an area characterised by large, in the main, detached houses set in substantial garden grounds in a semi-rural part of the village.ldquoIts location some  metres from the A  and the centre of the village means that residents in the area enjoy a very high standard of amenity.ldquoI have studied the representations on the case and note the alleged impact on residential amenity caused by the use of the property for short-stay letting.ldquoI further note that the appellant has taken steps to curtail the effects of the unauthorised use, and in particular noise and alleged anti-social behaviour.ldquoI am also mindful of the support given by persons staying at lsquoGreenloaningrsquo to businesses in the village.ldquoHowever, I conclude that the unauthorised use of lsquoGreenloaningrsquo has an unacceptable impact on the character of the established amenity in this generally quiet part of West Linton.ldquoExternal activity can arise after . hours and a signicant change into the quiet residential area has been introduced.ldquoThe two-month time period for the cessation of the use is reasonable, given the impact of the unauthorised development on the amenity of this part of West Linton."},{"url":null,"title":"explorers-great-mystery-comes-to-borders-stages","story":"A LIGHT-HEARTED romp featuring starvation, scurvy, cannibalism and some jolly tunes comes to the Borders next week.The new play by Peter Arnott for Mull Theatre, Unspotted Snow, is based on the tale of Sir John Franklinrsquos ill-fated expedition to discover the Northwest Passage.In , Franklin and  men sailed off to discover a route from the Atlantic to the Pacic via the north coast of Canada, but were never seen again.A bold and adventurous account of tragedy, mishap, folly, arrogance and madness, it also serves as a cautionary tale of true-blue British heroism ndash and some ruthless news management.After nine years, news of the expedition was at last brought to London by the remarkable Orcadian explorer and physician John Rae, who worked for the Hudsonrsquos Bay Company.The news he brought was both tragic and grizzly. Unfortunately for Rae, it was the wrong story ndash true, but wrong in that it was not the story that Victorian England wanted.Unspotted Snow is a play of two halves: the first set on the barren ice flows of the Arctic and the second in the equally inhospitable environment of Lady Jane Franklinrsquos drawing room.As playwright Arnott explained, unlike Franklin and the majority of th century British explorers, Rae was uninterested in conquest and the imposition of religious, commercial, or imperial norms on the wilderness.ldquoLike John Muir in Calornia, he anticipated a much more lsquomodernrsquo holistic approach to the natural world, not seeing people as being conquerors of empty space but as inhabitants of a planet shared with other forms of le, he said.The story of the expedition has fascinated the general public, scientists and explorers for over  years.From early findings of frozen corpses and a few artefacts to the very recent discoveries of the expeditionrsquos boats, the Erebusand the Terror , successive generations have been enthralled by the ambition and daring-do of the explorers and by their terrying, macabre fate.That fascination, and the split between two realities, is emphasised by the two-part nature of the play.ldquoIn the first half, a kind of horror-comedy, we have an encounter between three of the last survivors of Franklinrsquos expedition and some Inuit ladies to whom they utterly fail to explain themselves, explained Arnott.ldquoAnd then, in a curious echo of that, we have the inhospitable wilderness of Lady Franklinrsquos Drawing Room, where John Rae again finds himself telling a story that his audience simply cannot, or will not, understand.Unspotted Snow will be performed at the MacArts in Galashiels on Thursday, May  and the following evening at the Eastgate Theatre in Peebles.Tickets for the Galashiels performance, priced at pound and pound, are available from the box office at   .And the Eastgate performance tickets, priced at pound, pound and pound for Under s, are available on  , or online at www.eastgateartsBoth performances begin at .pm."},{"url":null,"title":"six-year-old-has-nightmares-after-school-staff-trapped-him-in-cupboard","story":"A six-year-old boy has been removed from school after allegedly being ldquotrapped in a cupboard by staff, a city councillor has claimed.SNP councillor Elspeth Kerr said the pupil is too scared to go back to school and has nightmares about being trapped in the cupboard.Ms Kerr, who represents Drumchapel and Anniesland on Glasgow City Council, said she has raised concerns with the school and local authority but does not feel the issue is being taken seriously.Speaking at a fringe event at the SNPrsquos spring conference in Edinburgh on violence against teachers hosted by teaching union NASWUT, Ms Kerr claimed the boy was held in what was called a ldquocalm room but was formerly used as a stationery cupboard and she described it as ldquodisgusting.She said: ldquoWhen theystart kicking off they get put in this calm room and they get the door held shut so they are not allowed out.ldquoCurrently this wee boy is not going back to school because hersquos waking up at am with nightmares about being trapped in this cupboard.She said she has raised the issue with the head teacher and a senior education figure in Glasgow City Council.Ms Kerr said the school is working with the childrsquos parents, but claimed the head teacher ldquodenies it is happening and that a senior education figure had told her it is ldquonot punishment, we prefer to term it something dferent.The councillor added: ldquoIrsquom getting absolutely nowhere.

recently met Jeane Freeman MSP, Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport, following ldquooverwhelming public concern regarding the serious lack of appointments to see a doctor and the poor level of service offered by the practice.Mr Beattie stated that a spokesperson from the medical practice, which is based at Musselburgh Primary Care Centre, indicated that ldquoimprovements in the way patients are being cared for in Musselburgh are in the process of being made.Early evaluation of the way services were being delivered since the launch of the Collaborative Working for Immediate Care service ndash run by East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnershipand the merged Eskbridge and Riverside Medical Practices ndash demonstrated that patients who previously would have seen a GP were now seeing the right clinician at the right time for their specic needs.The new service, developed in partnership by Riverside, NHS  and ELHSCP, ensured that urgent care was dealt with on the same day and patients should have ldquono anxieties about being seen by the right professional at the right time.Through this new way of delivering patient care, it not only provided an increase in the number of patient appointments with practice GPs and other healthcare professionals, but also provided an increase in appointmentfor patients with complex needs.A recent survey conducted within the practice demonstrated that more than half of patients agreed that they did not always need to see a GP.Work is also under way by ELHSCP to implement a new telephone and IT system that will support call demand into the practice.The importance of patient involvement in getting services right is ldquovery much recognised by the practice, which is encouraging residents to get involved with the Patient Participation Group.Speaking after meeting with the Cabinet Secretary, Mr Beattie said: ldquoI would like to assure all of my constituents that patient care is of paramount importance and that all agencies involved in the new way services are being delivered within Musselburgh Primary Care Centre are focused on delivering the best care possible.ldquoRiverside Medical Practice is working with other organisations to ensure that improvements are made and I would encourage anyone with any issues regarding the practice to get in touch with them and become involved with the patient participation group.ldquoI am hopeful that the improvements being made by the organisations will be seen by patients and a vastly improved service will be delivered.ldquoI will continue to closely monitor the future performance of the practice and ask patients to keep me advised on whether the improvements are working."},{"url":null,"title":"seatbelt-embarrassment-spurs-on-musselburgh-couple-to-big-weight-loss","story":"Derek Melon, , a customer services advisor, and his we Carole, , a mortgage advisor, of

sports pitches, were formulated last year.However, public consultation showed little appetite for any changes to be made.Dunbar Community Council received word on Monday evening that a further consultation was being planned, despite the apparent lack of interest in any alterations.George Robertson, community councillor and chair of Dunbar and East Linton Area Partnership , noted that there was no funding available to make any of the proposals happen.He said: ldquoIt is a wishlist of things ndash it is not going to be happening any time soon.ldquoThat is the long and the short of it.ldquoIf you are interested in the future of the park obviously come along to the meeting and have your say but do not expect anything to happen any time soon.Included among the ideas is the possibility of creating a ldquopavilion with toilets in the style of the pagoda recently demolished, as well as a series of paths and information cairns.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the community council, was ldquosurprised to receive an email highlighting an upcoming meeting, which is due to take place on Wednesday, where discussions will take place on the plans for the park.She pointed to the public consultation which took place last year in the townrsquos Bleachingfield Centre.At that time, a display featuring a series of images and information boards highlighted potential changes to the park, including new seating and picnic benches, as well as a maze and parkour course.Long-term aspirations also included the suggestion of creating a replacement pavilion with access to public toilets.Winterfield Pagoda, also known as Winterfield Pavilion, which had stood in the park since the s, was torn down by East Lothian Council in March .ldquoIn general, there was no massive enthusiasm for proposed changes, adding paths or parkour, or anything , said Mrs Swan.ldquoI was taken aback that East Lothian Council had seen fit to continue with a masterplan.Mrs Swan, who was previously DELAP chairwoman, also noted that budgets were increasingly tight at the local authority and funding would likely have to come from external organisations.She added: ldquoI still feel immediate priorities should be addressed first and scarce resources addressing immediate wishes of the community as expressed in the first instance.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council said work to develop ldquoa programme of improvements for the park had been ongoing since .She said: ldquoFrom the outset it was made clear that financing any improvements would be challenging but that in itself was not justication for ignoring the need.ldquoThe benefit of having a masterplan in place means thatopportunity presented itself, either by way of outside funding or sources of materials, inidual elements of the plan could perhaps be delivered without detriment to the wider plan.ldquoThe council has used this model of planning very successfully on a number of other sites, the most recent being Ormiston Park where signicant improvements have been delivered.ldquoFollowing the most recent meeting to discuss the draft masterplan, the council was advised by the steering group that, although work was still required on what the plan should contain, the general principles of delivering improvements were still widely supported by the local community."},{"url":null,"title":"seven-year-old-praised-for-taking-action-to-stop-dog-fouling","story":"Seven-year-old Ava Lily Davidson, a P pupil at Stoneyhill Primary School, was inspired to make

service where the British Monarch distributes small purses full of coins called Maundy money as symbolic alms to the nominated recipients. It is a ceremony thought to date back to the Middle Ages and took place at St Georgersquos Chapel in Windsor.The coins are presented in two leather purses, a white one containing coins to the value of the same number of pence as the years of the monarchrsquos age, and a red purse containing a pound and a p coin.Dorothy was one of  recipients. As the Queen is  years old, there are  female recipients and  male recipients, as well as  pence worth of special silver coins in one of the purses.The other purse presented included a commemorative pound coin marking the th anniversary of Queen Victoriarsquos birth.Dorothy attended the ceremony last week with her husband Tom.She added: ldquoThe Queen was so gracious, I felt undeserving.

He said there were concerns about the proposals, particularly regarding the two properties off Manse Road.Mr Drysdale said: ldquoDirleton Village Association has a very strong view on the matter and is supported by the community council.ldquoThis is part of a much bigger planning application, which involves new additional facilities in the Archerfield Links golfing estate, a signicant number of holiday lodges and aroom.ldquoThe community is not concerned about any of these items, other than two house lodges, right beside the village green in Dirleton. There is a very strong feel that this is completely inappropriate.ldquoThe proposal is to build two big two-storey houses, which would simply not fit into the village environment.Set in  acres, the Archerfield Estate is home to two golf courses and a iety of accommodation styles to rent, including grade one-listed Archerfield House.There is also a cafe, deli, food market, gt shop, bar and microbrewery at Archerfield Walled Garden."},{"url":null,"title":"110000-boost-for-musselburgh-charitys-work","story":"The funding to the Bridges Centre, awarded over three years, will go towards the salary costs of a full-time personal development worker to deliver a programme of inidual and small group support to --year-olds.This will help young people develop their skills and aspirations for the future as the service seeks to build their emotional resilience and help them create positive relationships, enabling them to achieve their full potential.The grant, which was allocated through Children in Needrsquos Main Grants Programme, is its first funding allocation of the year, with additional cash-aid being distributed to projects across the UK throughout .Jim Boyle, chief executive of the Bridges Project, which is based on Musselburghrsquos Bogpark Road, said: ldquoWersquove been receiving funding from BBC Children in Need now for the last  years and, in that time, have been able to make a dference to hundreds of young peoplersquos lives.ldquoWersquore delighted that wersquoll be able to continue this for another three years in collaboration with our partners in education, social work, health and the voluntary sector.Florence Burke, national head of Scotland at BBC Children in Need, said: ldquoWe are delighted to fund the work of the Bridges Project and look forward to seeing the dference that this grant will make to children and young people across the region.Simon Antrobus, BBC Children in Needrsquos chief executive, added: ldquoAs always, thanks must go to our generous supporters and fundraisers.

Before that I had been at Stirling Albion for a decade so Irsquove been doing this for a while now.Irsquom there mainly to be an ear or a sounding board. Itrsquos more than a social worker as therersquos a pastoral element to it as well. And Irsquom there for all the clubrsquos staff and their families, not just the players and the coaches. Maintaining confidences and trust is key.On a Friday I train with the players. I take part in the warm-up and then often join in with the under-s. I try to keep up with them, although I end up being the ball boy half the time. Irsquom getting old now so itrsquos still a great feeling when I can nutmeg one of the young lads. After that Irsquoll have lunch with the players and wersquoll have a bit of a chat.I usually get referred to as The Rev or Padre. One of the players even calls me Pope. Therersquos a bit of banter too and Irsquom sometimes the butt of their jokes but you just have to go along with that.Irsquom a Christian so that will always be a part of what I do. Many players have no faith or a nominal faith. Sometimes, though, in a quieter dressing room you might get a player suddenly asking, ldquoSo, Rev, what are you preaching about on Sunday  and I then have a right to answer that.Irsquod never go into a group and say, ldquoLet me tell you about Jesus, guys. When a player is injured I donrsquot go up and offer to pray for them. There are times when a player might ask me to do that. But itrsquos not about me preaching. I leave that to Sunday at church.Whenever a new player signs Irsquom over right away to introduce myself. If theyrsquove not had a chaplain at their previous club, they sometimes donrsquot know how to react. Some even stop swearing when yoursquore in their company! But with time most of them realise yoursquore just there to help themthey need it.For the first half-season or so I didnrsquot go near the players at all. I didnrsquot want the club to think I was only there because I was in awe of them. So at the start I devoted more time to talking with the staff and that was great. It got my face known and people became more comfortable with me. And at the start of the second season I had the freedom to go around the place.After month after month of seeing you around, people might come up to you and ask, ldquoRev, could I meet up with you after training in a private place  I want to chat about something thatrsquos going on with my family. And then you help them through those situations.I went on a two-day mental health training course at Hampden. That was exhausting but insightful. It also taught me how to redirect people to get proper professional helpthey need it. Sothere are health issues you make sure they get proper medical support. If itrsquos gambling there are people who specialise in that as well.Irsquove already got a full-time job so donrsquot get paid for being chaplain. This is just my service to the club.

Soon you will reach a small side road branching off to the left signposted The Golden Road, so called because its tortuous route through the intricate landscape of the Bays of Harris made it extremely expensive to build. Before its construction in the s, all traffic between the villages went either on foot or by boat.Head downhill into the village of Miabhaig which is the first of many villages you will pass through. The Golden Road winds and twists through the east coast of Harris, sometimes called the Bays because of its miniature fjords. The single track road connects all the clachans or townships, which have either Viking or Gaelic names.The best part of the route is that it is the bends are almost D and every few seconds the view changes and shows the rough side of Harris. Soyou get to the Golden Road, you see the other side of the island known for some fantastic beaches.As you wind your way along it, at no great speed, you will pass small cottage industries, local artists, crafts and traditional Harris Tweed weavers along with seals and otters relaxing on the seaweed clad rocks. Many little bays are seen on the sea side of the road and old paths are signposted for walks on these vintage ways that were the only ways before the road was build.The mixture of sea, loch, Lewisian gneiss, heather and wet green and little rounded hills makes for a striking landscape as the road winds through lochans with water lilies and bog bean in amongst the lunar rocky landscape. Its like nowhere  in Scotland.Along the way stop at the Tweed exhibition Clograve-Mograver at Drinishader, where you can see the sheds of the weavers next to many houses. The Bays of Harris has enticed many artists over the years who have been attracted by the ever changing light and complex landscape.If you fancy a break, call in at one of a number of galleries along your way ndash some have excellent cafeacutes. Just after the turn off to one of these ndash Holmasaig Gallery at Cuidhtinis ndash the road descends to the shore. Keep following the signs for Roghadal , ignoring any side roads, and once there you will find St Clementrsquos Church, perched spectacularly on a rock.Rodel was once the main town of Harris and the Skye ferry used to leave from here but now it is a tranquil harbour and many ers view Rodel as a perfect ing destination in Scotland.From here head towards Leverburgh and back onto the A towards Tarbert. On the way marvel at Luskentyre Bay, possibly the finest white beach outside the Caribbean and follow the road for the final climb of the day back over the moonscape. So alien is its appearance, the area was used by Stanley Kubrick as the surface of Jupiter in his famous film,  ndash A Space Odyssey.The climb is long and unrelenting, but eventually you will be rewarded with a tremendous sweeping descent back to Tarbert.Pit stop: Various cafes in Leverburgh, including the Butty BusALAN SIMPSONHow long   miles, three-and-a-half hoursWhat makes it so special  Driving into Scotland by the scenic routeLeft, right or middle  Left is the quickest, straight up the Afrom Carlisle . Right, via Berwick on Tweed, you wind your way along the south-east coastline, past Lindisafarne, beaches and caravans and a nuclear power station, which has its own sci-fi charm.But middle is best. Middle is the A. Middle starts in Darlington, runs up over the Tyne and rolls and bumps through rural Northumberland and then begins to climb into the Cheviot Hills until, at ftin altitude, it reaches Carter Bar on the border and suddenly Scotland is laid out in front of you.Ancient Romans, English soldiers, Scottish soldiers theyrsquove all come this way .It must have been a miserable march. But driving it is a rollercoaster of blind summits and stunning vistas and, once yoursquore in Scotland, the delights of Jedburgh and Lauder.If you have the time, detour at St Boswells to Dryburgh to see Walter Scottrsquos famous view.Pit Stop: Try Carfraemill in Lauder at the foot of the Lammermuir Hills.TEDDY JAMIESONThe Cool List:  Scottish golf courses every fan must playHow long   miles,  minutesWhat makes it so special: A scenic coastal drive with points of interest round every bend.This section of East Lothian is being branded as Scotlands Golf Coast ndash starting at the Musselburgh Links, Scotlands oldest golf club, it takes in fine links courses such as Longniddry, Gullane , Muirfield, Archerfield and North Berwick. Watch out for cyclists ndash part of this route is also the John Muir Way.Dont worryyou dont want to pack the plus-fours and the Pings ndash this short stretch has something for all the family. Starting at Musselburgh, you take the left fork down the coastand proceed through Prestonpans . You will quickly pass through Cockenzie ndash now minus the iconic twin chimneys of the recently-demolished power station ndash and Port Seton. Each boasts a picturesque harbour, and the three villages are something of an artists colony, Port Seton being the birthplace of John Bellany.Theres a fine picnic stop at Longniddry Bents, where you can exercise youngsters and empty the dog, before the traffic crawls through Aberlady and Gullane. Take a short detour to see the ruined medieval fortress of Dirleton Castlebefore ending up at North Berwick, where you can take in the beach, some bespoke shops, and marvel at how many xs can cram into such narrow streets.Pit stops: Since this is such a short drive, pit stops are best on thejourney: start with fish and chips in North Berwick and follow it with ice cream from Lucas in Musselburgh .DREW ALLANThe Cool List:  Scottish golf courses every fan must playHow long   miles but it will take all dayWhat makes it so special: Ferries and islands. Five in one day. Thats pretty special.From the ferry, turn right at Brodick and head to Sannox, where the gentle scenery and winding road from the port is replaced by open hillsides and a much faster, sweeping highway, almost devoid of traffic, with the ragged, jagged peaks of Cir Mhor in the distance. Coming down into Lochranza you pass the Arran Distillery and the ruins of Lochranza Castle, which must rank alongside Eilean Donan and Urquhart Castle for its spectacular location.From here, the ferry for Claonaig make its way across the Kilbrannan Sound to Kintyre. Then its along the narrow B onto the A. Itrsquos like a superhighway after the single track: wide, with fast, sweeping corners to Tarbert, with its pretty harbour, like something out of a Katie Morag book. Back on to the ferry, the next stop is Portavadie on the single track before it opens up towards Tighbnabruich and heads for Colintravie. Then itrsquos on to the dayrsquos shortest crossing, to Bute, which takes less than three minutes, then along to Rothesay and onto the fth and final ferry to Wemyss Bay.Some of the roads are poorly surfaced but that doesnt matter. This is a route to take in the scenery, the castles, wildle, lochs and, of course, the sea views.Pit stops: The Sandwich Stop at Lochranza is the perfect place for a piece. They also do artisanal sandwichesand soups and coffees.GARRY SCOTTTornapress to Applecross, Wester RossHow long   miles, around  minutesWhat makes it so special  Hairpin bends and the promise of a seafood feast.It may not seem very far on the map, yet this drive packs a punch, traversing Bealach na Ba ndash a winding, single-track road through the mountains of the Applecross peninsula ndash complete with hairpin bends, jaw-dropping views and plentul nature sightings.Starting from near sea-level at Tornapress next to Loch Kishorn, the road rises to ftin . milesof climbing, reaching  per cent at its steepest gradient. There is a viewpoint at the top with panoramas across to Skye and beyond on a clear day.You may not want to hang about too long as the reward of a hearty feed awaits at the Applecross Inn once you descend the other side.Pit stop: Grab coffee and cake at the Bealach Cafe in Tornapress but save room for a pint of prawns at the Applecross Inn.SUSAN SWARBRICKCircuit from Spittal of Glenshee, Perth and Kinross.How long  Approx  miles, four days .What makes it so special  If you have already driven the hugely popular North Coast  or you are a looking for a quieter destination, the North East  is an ideal alternative for a multi-day driving route.The circuit heads through the north-east of Scotland, visiting the Cairngorms, Speyside, Moray, Aberdeenshire and Royal Deeside. Famous for its drier and sunnier climate, the north-east also delivers with a fantastic ersity of landscapes, from majestic mountains and wild moorlands to glorious glens, rocky coastlines and pristine beaches.The  miles could be driven in one day although that would be missing the point of such a great journey. Instead, four days to a week allows you to stop at numerous attractions, including castles, heritage centres, distilleries, golf courses and nature reserves.A suggested starting point is Spittal of Glenshee in the Cairngorms National Park.

Irsquove bounded down the steps, through the sticky front door and on past the people sitting in what looks like a giant window box with rice paper .Now Irsquom standing awkwardly in a between-raised-tables channel under quaint market-stall roofing while Edinburgh folk look and frown and I swither about whether to go all the way back and pull that door tight shut again. For them. I get it. Itrsquos cold out. Or go on underneath the hanging lanterns, past the fairground-style booth and round a corner into the next room to seeI can find someone who actually works here.Umm, I shut the front door again, properly this time. Then press on towards the Sea of Swirly Twirly Chinese Lanterns and just as I reach the corner a waiter comes running, literally.OK, any speed above excuse me in here looks like running, but he is simultaneously moving and apologising and sitting me at a tiny table which is about the only one in the whole place not under a hanging lamp. And also revealing there are terrible staff-shortages tonight and he has to serve all these peopleby himself. Andhellipwait for thishellipmake all the ramen too.Crikey, I think, looking towards the door. Suddenly itrsquos a very long way away. Too bloody far to run. We establish importantly anyway that there are definitely chefs in the kitchen and I settle in for a long wait. Which simply doesnrsquot happen.

This is sitting at the table looking like three giant shredded wheat fingers, one of which is rudely stuffed in a glass of what looks like cocktail sauce but is actually, er, mango mayo. Frankly  Not for me.The sickly mango mayo may just be the accidental reinvention of a Mr Men Yoghurt, and the shredded wheat pastry tastes like fried shredded wheat, and while there is some promised Scottish cod deep inside itrsquos so outgunned by everything  it was pointless even showing up.Fortunately, and just as the remnants of this are being dragged off in shame, my original waiter is back from his ramen booth and is asking what I think of the Crazy Tonkotsu Ramen. Which he just made. Himself.The broth is cooked for  hours, he proudly reminds me, as I slide head-first into slippy, slurpy, soupy-land of pork slices, seaweed sheets and jalapeno strands, all underpinned by a very good, creamily smooth, properly seasoned stock and just the right chilli tingle.Umi Japanese Cuisine then  Mad but definitely not bad. I cant help really liking this place.Joanna Blythmans restaurant review: One Square,  Festival Square, EdinburghUmi Japanese Cuisine Deanhaugh StreetEdinburgh  Menu: Crazy kitschy mix of Japanese staples, proper sushi, interesting ramen, -hour broths and those goruden cod fingers.  Service: Full marks for being honest about staff shortages which actually made no dference as the service was swt, pleasant and warm.

asthat werenrsquot enough to be getting on with, a new front opened this week. War has been declared on the elderly ndash by the House of Lords .Recently, I went on record ndash always a mistake as a columnist, I find it preferable to keep my opinions to myself ndash praising the House of Lords as a civilised counterpoint to the bawling brouhaha that is the House of Commons. I take that back now and, never one for half-measures, believe the Lords should be abolished forthwith.The brass neck of them. The out-of-touch ignorance of them. The dim-witted, cloth-eared, pig-headed, hair-raising, nose-blowing, ear-waggling, tongue-wagging cheek of them.You say: ldquoWhat are you getting so het up about  Yoursquore usually quite calm, not to say, you know, a little sleepy. I will tell you what Irsquom getting so het up about, madam. This shower of old gits wants to take the few perks that elderly people get so that the money can be spent instead on the young.Donrsquot get me wrong. I would shower gold on the younglingsI could, evenI would not allow them to drive, vote or be out on the streets after pm . But, rather than rob old Peter to pay young Paul, there is a better way to raise money for them, and I will outline this below, once I have thought of it.So, what does the Lords want to do exactly  Well, its Select Committee on Intergenerational Fairness ndash the what now  ndash has suggested scrapping winter fuel allowances, free bus passes for those under , free TV licences for over-s, and automatic pension rises of at least . per cent.Consider the list. Consider these few pathetic perks, offered to folk after a letime of working. Consider that our state pension is the lowest in the developed world. And consider taking it all away. That is the British way today.There is a definite malice at the heart of the British state. It wasnrsquot always like that. After the Second World War, it looked to make things better for the people. Now it is forever checking to see what it can take away, what it can save, what it can cut. It is a nasty, miserly, malevolent state.Actually, maybe it always was. After all, the predication of the pension is that you would peg out just a couple of years after becoming entitled to it. But at least the state of old instituted the thing and gave the impression of caring.Bizarrely, the Lordsrsquo reason for hammering the old is that theyrsquore apparently all well-off nowadays, which must come as a surprise to the millions who live off nothing more than the state pension. Many folk will have suffered unemployment and poverty under Margaret Thatcher and now find themselves with nothing to look forward to, even these meagre perks, in old age.Those who worked all their lives in low-wage Britain probably know how the system works anyway: you pays your taxes and gets sod all back. By my reckoning, the British state owes me a fortune. And the House of Lords owes the elderly an apology. They must think every old person, like them, gets pound a day for gently snoozing, with subsidised food and drink into the bargain. If they must pick on a section of society to subsidise the young then let it be football.Yes, football. The wages of many players are stratospherically absurd. TV companies make a packet out of horrendously priced sports packages, paid for by folk with more money than sense, who also actually attend games, which are today the province of only the well-heeled upper working class who made their own fortunes by overcharging people in their ldquotrades.Let all of them pay to subsidise the young: the players, the clubs, the TV companies and the spectators. This measure would undoubtedly prove popular across the nation, uniting us all once again and inconveniencing only a privileged few who have had it too good for too long.***THE Axis of Evil is being reborn. I choose my words carefully. Like most decent ratepayers, I am not in favour of evil, as it is arguably a bad thing.Readers who survived the th century may recall that the original Axis of Evil, a term invented by US President and leading philosopher George W Bush, comprised Iran, Iraq and North Korea. There was also a B team of Cuba, Libya and Syria. I think we bombed most of these, thus putting paid to their evil plans for world domination .This week, a new Axis of E began to take shape when North Korearsquos chief narcissist King Kong-un visited leading Russian narcissist Vladimir Putin, after falling out with top US narcissist Derek Trump. Canrsquot put my finger on it, but there may be a pattern here.N Korea is also reaching out to China, never far off when evil is afoot, resulting in the possibility of a new Triumvirate of Badness threatening the peace and order brought to the world by the West.Kong has now invited the Russian president over to his bit to cement the alliance, which unfortunately comes at a time when Britain doesnrsquot have any bombs left.***IMAGES from history often become fixed in our minds, reflecting perhaps signicant world events or, sometimes, moments of horror.An incidence of the latter was brought to mind this week when Jack ldquoLord McConnell, the former First Minister, recalled wearing a pinstripe kilt that sent shock waves around the world.On medical advice, for the sake of readers of an easily frightened disposition, we are unwilling to reproduce the image here. But, for my money, it wasnrsquot so much the kilt as the accompanying blouse that led to record levels of intercontinental vomit.Lord Jack of that ilk was appearing at a photocall while attending a fashion event in New York and, as he later revealed, had become too fat as First Minister to get into his jaickit, thus forcing him to display the full horror of the blouse atop the unconventional kilt.This week, still hounded by the press  years later, Jack was unrepentant, claiming he didnrsquot regret the gaffe in the least. ldquoIrsquom glad people got something to laugh at. It doesnrsquot bother me a bit, he said, as he ed to the House of Lords in a big red cloak and a Napoleon-style cocked hat.***FEMINISTS are burdz who are quite easy to wind up, so we will choose our words carefully here as we consider the Scottish Maritime Museumrsquos decision to stop calling ships and boats ldquoshe and to go gender-neutral.I have no strong views on the matter, accepting on the one hand that the practice is antiquated but also feeling confused as it was never a derogatory reference, as I understand it, butanything a complimentary one, ships often being objects of beauty and wonder.Perhaps itrsquos the objectication to which folk object. I noticed one reader saying that it might have related to these busty dames that used to adorn the prows of vessels, which is arguable I suppose.At any rate, irate lassies would scratch the word out on the museumrsquos displays. Itrsquos odd to think how worked up people get about such small things.

However, Mr Scott is wrong to claim that all the electorate are seeing is marches and rallies the SNP is in its third consecutive term at Holyrood, and has more MPs at Westminster than the Scottish Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat parties put together. As for Mr Scotts assertion that \"the current position at Holyrood is unacceptable with a minority SNP government deciding on policies relating to Scotland\", I would point out that the Scottish electorate can vote Holyrood governments out of office, unlike the position at Westminster, where the arithmetic adds up to Scotland being saddled with the governments England elects.As Westminster wallows in the chaotic Brexit mess, Holyrood is providing calm and competent government, and it is not only the opinion polls which continue to show strong support for the SNP at the latest test of public opinion at the ballot box, local government by-elections in Clackmannanshire Central and Leith Walk were both won by the SNP.Ruth Marr, Grampian Road, Stirling.TODAYS broadcast of BBC Politics Liveincluded some discussion of the case for Scottish in-dependence ,in the course of which one  member, Nick Ferrari, who is apparently a journalist and broadcaster and not a car thief, revealed the interesting news that Scottish schools are now infested with rats. He seemed to be suggesting that this was something that should be considered by persons considering the case for Scottish independence, although I am not entirely sure whether he thought independence might make rat infestation more or less likely to occur.Herald readers will no doubt wish to satisfy themselves of the rat-tolerance ratings of the ious political parties should it become necessary in the future to elect the government in an independent Scot-land. The need for this circumspection is unlikely to be highlighted in any BBC political discussion, since these are iniably conducted based on an underlying assumption that an independent Scotland would be a one-party state governed in perpetuity by the SNP.Willie Maclean, Braehead Avenue, Milngavie.BY next week I expect that climate change activists in Scotland will be disappointed that the SNP conference has not announced plans to oppose all exploration and production in Scotlandrsquos North Sea.Together with the Greens, the SNP constantly criticises the UK Government on environmental and climate change issues such as fracking while boasting of Scotlandrsquos efforts on renewables. Ian Blackford states that ldquoThe UK Government must start taking this issue seriously and it must start now. Meanwhile, we continue to produce hydrocarbons and import fracked gas for us or others to burn. This approach is like that of Norway, making a big gesture out of its Sovereign wealth fund not investing in hydrocarbons while continuing to issue exploration licences in the Arctic.The effect of removing Scotlandrsquos internal carbon emissions from the global total is negligible. An im-mediate ban on North Sea oil wonrsquot happen because even the SNP realises the electorate know that such measures would severely affect living standards and aspirations. The SNP is willing to risk harming the economy for its separatist obsession ndash but not to save the planet.Its approach on global warming is to pretend to be doing something so that it can say ldquoIt wisnae me, it was the bad boys that did it. The flatlands around the moral high ground are littered with the bones of fallen hypocrites.Whether wersquore in or out of the EU, Europe will do tits own thing on emissions but the most effective use of our votes as iniduals is to use them within the UK to influence the reduction of the UKrsquos overall larger effect on global warming.

The council’s Infrastructure Services Committeeapproved the kerbside collection policy and procedures last year, including guidance on how to deal with contaminated bins. Any non-recyclable material placed into the recycling bin is classed as ‘contamination’, which could spoil the recyclates in any load. The recycling reprocessor may then reject whole loads as a result. Any rejected loads of recycling are disposed of at an additional cost to the taxpayer, for which there is no council budget available. Income which they would have generated to invest in services is lost.Collection crews will now visually check each recycling bin for contaminated recycling before emptying as a matter of course – those with severe contamination will not be emptied. Households consistently presenting severely contaminated bins will be offered advice and support to properly separate their waste. Those who ignore that advice could run the risk of their recycling bin being removed.Moderately contaminated bins will be emptied and an orange tag will be attached, providing information to the householder on how to properly use the recycling service. If a bin has not been emptied and tagged explaining why it has not been emptied, it is contaminated and the offending materials must be removed before the next collection. Crews will notto empty a rejected bin until the next scheduled collection day for the same bin.Bins considered to have little or no levels of contaminants will be emptied as normal.Collection crews will keep a record of bins unemptied due to overloading or contamination and this will be checked before a decision is made toto empty any bin reported as a missed collection.For those with a lot of recyclable materials, additional, free recycling bins can be requested by contacting the council’s Wasteline. Additional non-recyclable waste bins may also be authorised where there is a genuine need following a home visit and assessment by a Community Waste Officer. data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.buchanobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Police Scotland\"  Police urge revellers to be safe and responsible viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BUCH | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BUCH | Article Teaser\"The council’s Head of Roads, Waste and Landscape services, Philip McKay, said: “It’s important residents understand how to recycle properly and make best use of the facilities available to them. “Sending waste to landfill costs more than double the amount it costs to recycle and tackling the levels of contamination in kerbside bins is intended to reduce the amount of recyclates sent to landfill.“We will be enforcing the procedures in a staggered rollout, tackling problem routes first.

It is important that we mark the sacrice they made.” vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The council say that all profit would stay in the islands, enabling the local authority to preserve and enhance key services that local people value and depend upon. This, OIC believes, will provide a foundation for communities to drive transformational projects of their own.The council hopes that developments will allow it to join other local developers in making a meaningful contribution to a Needs Case for a new interconnector for Orkney, thereby substantially supporting the vital renewable energy industry in Orkney, including future development of the marine energy sector.OIC believes that the wider economic development value of a new cable to Orkney could be highly signicant, particularlya substantial proportion of local ownership can be secured — which could help employment and income remain in the county.Plans for a development of up to around MW in Hoy were announced to the local community last year — with sites for a development of up to MW on the island of Faray and up to MW on shoreside farmland at Quanterness outside Kirkwall now also being investigated.The proximity of the project at Quanterness to Kirkwall could also enable a separate private wire network project in which the council could directly supply electricity to its own buildings as a means to reduce costs.Public engagement events have been organised for Kirkwall, Eday and Rendall over the coming fortnight. Proposed plans for the developments will be on display at these, with elected members and council officers on hand to discuss the plans with members of the public. The proposed Quanterness site has the potential capacity for six m blade tip height turbines. The site on Faray has enough space for up to eight m blade tip height turbinesThe event details are as follows:An event will also be held in Westray, with the date yet to be confirmed.The current proposal at the third site in Hoy is to erect seven turbines, compared to the  presented in the original plans.The proposals for each site are expected to evolve as further site investigation work and consultation is undertaken. Site investigations, including bird and telecommunications studies, will be ongoing at all three sites.The council#s intention is to reach planning permission stage by the end of , ensuring all views and issues are fully explored and considered before any final decisions are made.  Proposals for how the applications will be determined are currently being considered.Councillor James Stockan, Orkney Islands Council leader said: “It is vital that the Council now takes an active ‘developer approach’ to energy projects in our islands. Not only does this allow us to maximise the resources available to us in the islands to support services and projects for local people, but it also allows us to contribute signicantly and in a meaningful way to allow our world-renowned local energy industry to survive and thrive through a new grid connection.“Our strategy is one that meets uncertainty head-on. The final details of proposals are by no means set in stone whilst investigations are carried out at the three sites, nor are all three sites guaranteed planning permission — and of course we also wish to take into account public opinion on the developments. Widening the net and moving to investigate three separate sites, allows us a degree of flexibility in the make-up of the final outcome.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Or the crisis in our hospitals. Or the crisis on our railways.: Poll: Only  in  Scots want  indyref voteFor the SNP, it is independence first, second and always.No matter how loud the applause in the Edinburgh International Conference Centre is this weekend, Nationalist politicians would do well to understand that their own priorities are at odds with the people of Scotland.: MSPs say concerns raised about changes to gender act are ‘misleading’We know this from the latest opinion polling published this week.Voters were asked to rank issues in order of which they thought should be the most important for the Scottish Government to prioritise.The NHS was ranked in the top three by  per cent of respondents, with the cost of living on  per cent, the economy on  per cent, and education on  per cent.Constitutional affairs and independence scored just nine per cent.I suspect you would get a very dferent resultyou surveyed SNP delegates at the EICC, which just shows how out of touch with reality the SNP has become.While they talk among themselves, the message from the public is clear: get on with the day job.: Kenny MacAskill: Sturgeon did NOT just call for independence referendum by The First Minister could start by fixing the mess her Government has made of our once-envied education system.It emerged this week that some schools are having to teach pupils studying for National , National  and Higher qualications in the same class.An obsession with the constitution means a generation of children is being let down by this Government.Amid this crisis, the idea that we should spend the next two years having yet another debate about independence is the height of irresponsibility.But that is precisely what Nicola Sturgeon wants to do. She wants to ide the country once again and hold an unwanted second independence referendum before .How do we know it’s unwanted  Because the people of Scotland have said so.Only one-in-five voters support the SNP’s reckless plan to hold another contest before the next Holyrood election.People remember the ision and the toxic atmosphere from  and they don’t want to go through that again any time soon.And they certainly don’t want to go through it while the country is still ided over Brexit.Whatever your views on Brexit, we can all agree that it has revealed just how dficult and complex it is to leave a political union.The UK has only been in the EU for four decades, and it is a much looser partnership of countries than the United Kingdom is.: Nicola Sturgeon ‘facing rebellion’ over post-independence currency plansJust imagine how dficult it would be to tear Scotland out of a centuries-old union in which we are considerably more entwined.It’s little wonder that so many people who voted ‘Yes’ in  have changed their minds. According to this week’s poll, a third would now vote to remain in the UK.Despite campaigning every day since September , the SNP has managed to turn more people off independence. Support for leaving the UK now stands at just  per cent.Most Scots know that we are stronger together and want to build a successful economic future based on our shared culture, history and institutions. Institutions such as our currency – the pound.Today, the SNP will vote to scrap the pound and adopt a new currency in an independent Scotland, putting salaries, mortgages and pensions at risk. According to the polling figures published today, that is supported by just  per cent of voters – while  per cent want to keep the pound.By remaining in the UK, we can keep our pound, grow our economy – without extra red tape for businesses – and use a stable currency backed by the strength of the UK’s central bank and its  million taxpayers.But, instead, today’s conference debate will focus on when to inflict economic harm on communities: immediately in the short-term or after a few years.And it will be coupled with the SNP’s growth commission blueprint which confirms breaking up the UK would lead to even deeper austerity.This isn’t the future most people want for Scotland. It’s not a choice we should have to make.We don’t want another independence referendum.We don’t want to create further ision and have a debate about whether to erect barriers between our friends, families and neighbours in the rest of the UK.But I know the SNP will never drop its narrow nationalist agenda. It will never stop campaigning for separation.So that is why those of us who believe in solidarity must continue to campaign as well. We speak for the majority of Scots who want a Government focused on building a better future for the people of Scotland as part of the UK.We must continue campaigning so that Nicola Sturgeon stops listening only to Nationalists and starts listening to the nation.Pamela Nash is chief executive of Scotland in Union©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"independence now within our grasp mike russell tells snp conference","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Achieving independence is now within Scotland#s grasp, Constitutional Relations Secretary Mike Russell has insisted.Mr Russell said the campaign was “moving on from hope to reality”, as he opened the SNP spring conference in Edinburgh.His address came as a new YouGov poll in The Times put support for Scotland leaving the UK at %.: Latest YouGov poll shows support for Scottish independence now “neck and neck”Mr Russell told SNP activists: “Our campaign is far from won, but today we see independence support is at %.”The UK Government is “running scared”, with its refusal to grant Holyrood the powers for a second referendum, he added.: Sturgeon: indyref likely set for late  but ‘options open’Mr Russell hit out at Theresa May’s Tory administration branding it “the most intransigent, the most arrogant UK Government ever”.Meanwhile, he said the “poisoned policy” of Brexit would “deliver a devastating blow” to Scotland.“It will destroy thousands of jobs. It will, by driving away talented and welcome EU citizens, undermine whole industries and increase depopulation in our rural areas,” Mr Russell said.“Brexit is not the only reason for change in our constitutional status, but it is a massive object lesson in the continuing failure of an archaic, deeply ided and out-of-touch Westminster system which looks, sounds and is well past its sell by date.”With First Minister Nicola Sturgeon having outlined plans for a second vote on independence before the next Holyrood elections in May , Mr Russell cautioned: “The journey for any nation to independence is never easy or straightforward”But he insisted Scotland was “moving inexorably” towards that.Mr Russell, who described the independence referendum of  as having been a “unying experience”, stressed the need for the SNP to listen voters to build support.“We need to encourage everyone who lives here to play a part in building our new national story,” he told the conference.“We won’t do so by ignoring them, or by insulting them, or by challenging them in ways to which they simply cannot respond.“We will only do so by working with them and listening to them because in so doing we will all become stronger”.The plan for a citizens’ assembly for Scotland, announced by the First Minister on Wednesday to consider issues surrounding the country’s future, is “a radical new initiative”, Mr Russell said.“It will allow Scotland to engage with its future in a constructive and thoughtful way,” he added.Mr Russell continued: “Our common cause here is independence. Our common aim is to achieve it. There is a democratic pathway towards it which ensures that when we get there our effort will be internationally accepted.“And there are ways in which we can uny Scotland around that vision. The pathway is broad. We need to walk it with all our fellow citizens.”He added: “There is a distance for us still to go, but we have come a vast distance already.“Further,not faster, than was expected in that bleak time.

Scotland doesn’t want yet more referendums – we want to move on and focus on the things that matter: improving our schools, making our streets safer and growing high quality jobs in Scotland.”A stand-off currently exists between the Scottish Government and Westminster over a second referendum. Power over the constitution lies with the UK government and Prime Minister Theresa May has so far rejected Sturgeon’s demands insisting, ‘Now is not the time.’A poll by the pro-independence Progress Scotland organisation earlier this month concluded that support for independence had fallen to below  per cent.But SNP deputy leader Keith Brown, who has been tasked with preparing the case for a second independence campaign, said Brexit turmoil has seen a backlash against the pro-Union parties in Scotland.“Since , across Westminster, the SNP have often been the only adults in the room, the only party focused on offering a serious sensible way forward out of the Brexit mess,” he said.“The Scottish Tories have completely sold out Scotland’s interests over Brexit and are happy to let Westminster do whatever they want to Scotland. “Meanwhile, Labour are quietly signing up to deliver a Tory Brexit – against the wishes of the people of Scotland – and without putting the issue back to the people. Labour and the Tories no longer have a positive vision to offer the people of Scotland. They are running scared of any debate over Scotland’s future.Sturgeon’s comments at the manesto launch came before the Brexit vote later that year which saw a majority of Scots vote to remain in the EU as the UK voted to leave. She insists this represented a “material change” in circumstances which opened the door for another vote.The pro-independence majority at the Scottish Parliament, combining SNP and Green MSPs, has also voted in favour of a second referendum being held.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"sturgeon indyref2 likely set for late 2020 but options open","story":"Nicola Sturgeon has said she expects a second referendum on Scottish independence to take place next year.And the First Minister also appeared to hint she will push for a second vote on independence eventhe UK remains part of the European Union.Ms Sturgeon said “many people” would agree Westminster’s treatment of Scotland during the Brexit process marked the “material change in circumstances” that would be necessary for the SNP to have a mandate for such a vote.: Poll: Only  in  Scots want  indyref voteShe spoke out after announcing to MSPs that the Scottish Government will “shortly” bring forward legislation to lay down the rules for a possible second independence referendum.Ms Sturgeon insisted in her Holyrood statement thatBrexit does go ahead, there should be another vote on Scotland’s place in the current Parliament – and yesterday she hinted it would be late next year.“I would have thought some time … probably in the latter half of next year,” Ms Sturgeon said when quizzed on the timing in a TV interview.: Video: Bus crashes into house in East WhitburnThe SNP’s  election manesto made clear another referendum should be heldthere was to be a “material change in circumstances” from the original ballot in .

That needs to change. “Some of the problems within the rail network, I think, are symptomatic of existing structural arrangements.”Mr Matheson added he had made recommendations to that effect to the Williams Rail Review, which was established by the UK government to examine all aspects of the network and make recommendations for their improvement.He continued: “I thought it was summed up well recently by Tom Harris, a former transport minister in Tony Blair’s Government, who said why would you have Highways England running the trunk road network in Scotland “Well, why would you have Network Rail running the network here in Scotland from Milton Keynes  “Part of the challenge has been, historically, the rail network in Scotland has been treated as a region - but it’s a national network.

The Ballymenawanted to know how Morris came to be in the band. Morris tells how his grandmother had a small hotel in Carnlough and every Saturday night a “Sing Song” was held in the bar. It was mainly Ballymena people attendance.  He remembers Johnny Mitchell, who worked in the Waveney Laundry, bringing his friends every week. Johnny also brought musicians from Ballymena to play including Nellie King on piano and George Kernohan on accordion. Morris said: “George, who had a barber shop in Harryville would leave his accordion during the week with his grandmother. He would let me try to play it, upside down as I remember my first attempts! “During the summer months George’s brothers used to visit as well. ACCORDION“They were great singers and often talked about how well other relations were doing who had emigrated and formed a group called the Irish Rovers in Canada. The first time I heard “Bonnie Kellswater” sung was by an older man called Jimmy Fullerton. Great days, great times and a great introduction to performing music.”He continued: “Eugene O’Dornan from the Braid and I played as teenagers in our first band together. Eugene’s sister Maureen entered, or more properly bluffed me into entering a talent contest as I was very shy and horried at the thought. “Anyway the competition went well and from it I joined a Ballymena based band called “The Countrymen” managed by Harry Lynn and George Dillon.  Leo McCaffrey was the compere at the competition. Leo became a great friend and mentor and a major influence on my music career.”In  Morris went with Leo to play in the famous “Blarney Stone” in Vancouver. Members of the Irish Rovers would come into the Blarney Stone as they knew Leo well. Morris said: “I became great friends with Wilcil McDowell, the Irish Rovers’ Accordion player. I was already a fan of Wilcil’s playing as he too occasionally visited my grandmother’s hotel in Carnlough.“It was through Wilcil that I started to play keyboards on Irish Rovers recordings and take part as a guest musician on some of their videos.” When Morris retired from his day job he was delighted to take up an offer in  by George Millar, the bandleader, to join the Rovers. He said: “When Wilcil decided last year to stop touring with the band I moved from keyboards to playing accordion. Touring Canada with the band also meant I was able to meet up with some other Ballymena musicians now living there.“Paul Fynes who was in the Countrymen with me, and Kevin Erwin who played with Leo. Kevin was ill during my last visit and sadly passed away last year. One of the most talented people I have ever played with.”CONCERTCommenting on the concert which took place in Ballymena on March  Morris said: “It was lovely to perform in what I knew as Ballymena Town Hall.“ It was a great concert and I was so pleased it was a such a success, especially for George and Ian Millar. “Never easy playing in your home town with your relations sitting in the front row!“It never ceases to amaze me that after  years the Irish Rovers continue to play to sell out shows throughout Canada and the USA. They are a fabulous band and brilliant people to work with. “George and Ian are proud of being from Ballymena and the town is mentioned at every show. “The Irish Rovers videos, which are broadcast on American television really show off the local area and the Antrim glens. I’m sure this has a real positive impact on Tourism here. “The warm reception in the Mayor’s parlour just before the concert I think is a well deserved honour for the Millar family and it was an honour to attend it.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1733277.jpg--.jpg?1555495901000\n","title":"ballymena city of the eight towers","story":"Local children have created a new fantasy tower to add to Ballymena’s famous ‘crest’ !And it is one of a number of striking features on is new imagination-fuelled mural which has appeared asby magic in Bryan Street, with the help of Artists Leo Boyd, Laura Nelson and local children.Workshops were held in The Braid Arts Centre on the theme of comics and cartoons and, as a result, local children have delivered a new fabulous monster sized artwork for the town centre.The Bryan Street painting, which is part of a larger arts project called Opening Doors being delivered by the Arts Service of Mid and East Antrim Borough Council, was supported and partnered by BID, which is the Ballymena Improvement District.BID and Councils Arts Service identied some sites in the town centre for re-imaging and engaged professional mural artists to deliver workshops for local children.

He began his career in  as a Chemistry Teacherin Wallace High School, moving to Regent House School where he later was appointed Head of Chemistry and then to the Principalship of Rathfriland High School. From his early career,Simon excelled not only as a vibrant and engaging classroom teacher, but also as the leader of the largest Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme in the Province whilst at Regent House.Simon brought to Portadown College this lelong passion for adventure and outdoor pursuits by participating in Duke of Edinburgh expeditions and instilling a love of the outdoors in all of the young people who participated in these ventures.A hallmark of Simon’s Principalship was his heartfelt interest in students and staff as iniduals. So as to ensure that each knew their value, he was always ready to offer a gentle word of encouragement and would urge them to, “Do something today that your future self will thank you for”.Regardless of background, belief or personal circumstances, students, staff and parents were received with a warm smile and a sincere willingness to work towards a positive outcome. In all such situations, Simon gave of his time generously and graciously, always setting aside his own priorities to support others.Simon was a strong educational leader with distinctive values which he brought to a range of challenging situations. As a College community, we are indebted to him for the dedication and industry he demonstrated in working alongside the Board of Governors to advocate for the Dickson Plan, consistently placing students at the heart of his educational vision.A man of strong personality and principles, Simon espoused high standards in allaspects of College le and never once shied away from any criticism this might have attracted.Simon’s service to education in Northern Ireland extended beyond Portadown College and included holding office in the Craigavon Area Learning Community, Association of ControlledGrammar Schools and the Post-Primary Principal’s Association. His long standing career had also involved acting as Chief Examiner for A Level Chemistry with the CCEA.A passionate traveller who enjoyed adventures in the most far-flung corners of the globe,Simon was ever keen to share his experiences with students and staff alike, encouraging each and every one to get out into the world, savour its magnicence and seize every opportunity. One of Simon’s most distinctive qualities was that he never lost a childlike sense of awe and wonder at the beauty of the world. He took particular delight in his garden at the foothills of the Mountains of Mourne and regularly enjoyed walking these hills with his much loved Irish Deerhound companions, Oisin and Uther.Current and former students will remember with fondness his infectious sense of fun and wicked humour, from his cameo roles in College charity events to a starring role in “PC Happy”. In jovial banter with students, staff and Governors, he also shared his love for sport, in particular his longstanding support for Ulster and Irish Rugby, alongside Coventry City and Crusaders football teams.A man of eclectic taste, Simon derived considerable joy from art and music of all genres - classical, Irish folk and contemporary. Proud of his Banbridge roots and passionate about his Ulster culture, he demonstrated a reverent respect for tradition, as exemplied through his meticulous attention to detail and great pride in leading the College’s annual Act of Remembrance.Indeed, Simon often reflected poignantly on the sacrice of others and had served proudly as an officer in the Royal Naval Reserve for almost a quarter of a century.Students and staff alike will hold dear the sentiment of Simon’s final Easter Assembly, inspired by his many visits to Coventry Cathedral, in which he spoke on the theme of Forgiveness and the message of Hope in the death and resurrection of Jesus themes deeply important to Simon and ones which he sought to enact in his daily le.As a College community, our loss is immeasurable. However, we will endeavour to uphold the College Motto “Fortiter et Humaniter” in Simon’s memory:May the road rise up to meet you.May the wind be always at your back.May the sun shine warm upon your facethe rains fall soft upon your fieldsand until we meet again,may God hold you in the palm of His hand."},{"url":null,"title":"traffic and","story":"The Department for Infrastructure has warned motorists to expect icy conditions on roads in the north, west and south of the Province tomorrow morning.

They know they are in the UK but don’t realise they are on a dferent land mass to England. We provide basic information on housing, hospitals, police serviceand run walkabouts and talk-abouts to bring people around and show them basic things like buying a bus ticket or using an ATM. These are things that you and I take for granted.“Our other main thing is the reach to resilience programme. We deliver family support across Belfast. This can be everything from learning to say no, IT skills, safety on the internet and workshops.“The European employment service programme also provides information on free movement on labour across Europe, something which is attracting huge interest given the threats of Brexit.”It is perhaps the John Hewitt Bar, located just around the corner from the Belfast Unemployed Resource Centre, which is the hidden gem of the organisation.Not many people know that the BURC own the bar as a social enterprise, meaning all profits go back into funding their key projects outlined here.The bar was the first social enterprise bar set up in the north and continues to run as a competitive business in the Cathedral Quarter, serving food and it is very popular for its range of beers.Aisling says the location of the BURC is beneficial for service users and hopes their programmes will continue to benefit those who need them.“These programmes are hugely important. The centre is located on the outskirts of the city centre, people can come all over. We can reach a wider network of people and bring the programmes to them.“We are also keen to deliver programmes in their own areas before they feel safe to come to the city centre office.“Our overall aim is to try and bring people back into the local community.“One such challenge today is some people coming to us to report incidents of racism because they don’t feel comfortable going to police. We can help support them and give them advice on how to deal with such an issue and not just accept it as an everyday occurrence.“Overall, the general feedback from people has been very positive. For mothers, learning how to say no is an important issue. We want to give people the confidence, skills and knowledge to try things a bit dferently and explore the way they react to things.“Many of our programmes have come out of other ones – all our work is led by the inidual and other service users.“We want to give people skills of a community leader to empower themselves and help them in every way possible.”Belfast Unemployed Resource Centre,- Donegall Street Place,Belfast,BT FNTel:   Email: info@burc.org or esol@burc.org For more information, visit www.burc.org"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"its double delight for little daithi","story":"THE family of little Dáithí Mac Gabhann are celebrating after learning that their son has made the shortlist for the annual British Heart Foundation’s Heart Hero awards.It was discovered during a routine -week scan that little Dáithí’s heart had not developed as it should have and it was found that the now two-year-old toddler had Hypoplastic heart syndrome. At only four-days-old Dáithí travelled to London where he underwent open heart surgery. Six days after that he underwent his second open heart operation.Since the family’s ‘Is Deontóir Mé Yes I Donate’ campaign began back in July , it has since been reportedthat an increase of four percent of people in the north have opted onto the organ donation register. Dáithí’s parents Máirtín and Seph told the Andersonstown News how delighted they were to learn of the news and that their visit to London for the event in September will coincide with the toddler’s third birthday. “The British Heart Foundation run their annual Heart Hero award every year,” explained Seph.“Máirtín put in the application for it, it was basically a , word essay and we got an email the other day saying that Dáithí had been shortlisted to the last three. “The event is going to be held in the Globe Theatre in London, we are so over the moon, we can’t believe it,” she said. Seph and Máirtín also spoke of how their campaign has taken striking visual awareness with the addition of Dáithí’s pink Is Deontóir Mé slogan and picture emblazoned on a black taxi.“To see the logo on the taxi fills us with so much pride, everyone is going to see it on the road and evenit makes somebody stop and turn around, maybe think twice about organ donation for a wee second, it makes all the dference.”Máirtín added: “I can’t really put it into words how happy we are to find out that Dáithí has been shortlisted for the Heart Hero award. We have sparked up a great relationship with the British Heart Foundation for a couple of months now. They do absolutely unbelievable work that will benefit Dáithí and people like Dáithí, they also work on the promotion of organ donation as well.“In these very hard times, to hear that Dáithí is worthy of this award is great for us. “We are really looking forward to going back to London as Dáithi’s hospital is not that far from where we are going to be – not that we were looking to go into an ICU ward but we can’t wait to bring Dáithí in. The last time the staff saw him he was such a tiny baby, his chest was open, they were preparing us for the worst. Dáithi is turning three when we are over and we can’t wait to show him off to all the doctors and nurses who saved his le.”“Being from West Belfast, I’ve used black taxis all my le, five times a week, twice a day, all my le. To know we have my son on the taxi in bright pink is brilliant, everytime we see the taxi we cheer, Daithí shouts out the car window ‘meeeeeeeeeee’. We want to thank driver Micky Russell for helping us to create awareness, it looks class, we are delighted,” he said.Micky added: “There are only two things you can see from space, the Great Wall of China and my taxi,” he laughed. “It’s an absolute privilege to have the wrap around on the taxi, to create that visual awareness. The taxi is up and down the road, the Shankill, I’ve tourists in the taxi as well, they would ask ‘why the colour ’ I can say to them about organ donation and Dáithí.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"julie file locked for 45","story":"THE sister of a -year-old Lenadoon girl killed by aplastic bullet in  has hit out a decision to lock the National Archives file on her death for another  years.

Reacting to the discovery, Julie’s sister, Elizabeth Livingstone, said that justice had been withheld from her family “for long enough”.“None of us – my brothers or sisters – are going to be alive by the time the file is opened again,it ever is,” she said. “Our parents have already passed away and nobody who ever knew Julie will be alive by then. What could possibly be pertinent to a -year-old’s death – a child’s death – that needs to be kept a secret  What is it that we’re not allowed to know about our sister’s death  We had to go through three inquests to clear Julie’s name. Ultimately, Julie was found to be an innocent victim, but that was after several years of us struggling to get a fair inquest. We already thought that justice had been withheld from us for long enough.”She continued: “It’s not a case of ‘Are they hiding something ’ This is about what’s being hidden. It’s obviously something that would prove to be an embarrassment to the British government and the NIO. Our Julie was a -year-old innocent victim. She was going about her own business when she was shot in the head and murdered. What could they possibly not want us to know about it  Your imagination runs wild. The only thing we could do for her was to get justice and now this has happened.”Paul O’Connor from the Pat Finucane Centre described the decision to close the files as “perverse”.“The decision to close Julie’s file until  was made earlier this year,” he explained. “There’s another file on plastic bullets in general, which is closed until  and it beggars belief. I have never seen anything like this before. We see lots of files closed for a long time, but these two files on the deaths of children who were killed by plastic bullets, one by the British Army, one by the RUC.” He added: “There is a total culture of secrecy within the NIO, within Ministry of Defence, and from all of those who want to protect the reputation of RUC and the British Army. They don’t want this information to come out, but it will come out. I’m confident that this file will not be closed until .”The Livingstone family have since written to the Secretary of State, Karen Bradley, to request a meeting about the NIO’s decision. Relatives for Justice CEO, Mark Thompson, called on Ms Bradley to order the release of the files.“Julie was  years of age when she was killed by a plastic bullet in ,” he said. “Her father Archie travelled these islands and Europe telling the world what happened to his baby girl. Along with the other families and injured in the United Campaign Against Plastic Bullets, he wanted to make a positive dference, to shine a light of truth and justice in the face of the horror his and other families endured. All families who have experienced state violence know that the British government will go to any s to protect its own interest. This strategic policy of impunity for the killing of Irish children clearly extends even to librarians and archives keepers. They too are complicit in the policies that accompany British state violence. This decision, undoubtedly made under direction, was made while families are asked to engage in a consultation on dealing with the past. This discovery points to the bad faith behind this consultation, as well as displaying the callous indference of those responsible. The least Karen Bradley can do now is meet with the families of Julie Livingstone and Paul Whitters. The very least the keeper of the archives can do under Bradley’s instruction is give the families these files.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Feature-pic-copy.png","title":"road safety on agenda for lisnasharragh rep","story":"MANY of you will have heard about the need for road safety improvements to four specic spots in the upper Ormeau area, writes Stevie Jenkins. They are the crossing at Ormeau Road and St John’s Avenue, the intersection of Knock Eden Park and Knockbreda Road, the entrance to Cherryvale Playing Fields and outside the Good Shepherd Church. I was delighted to be able to update the community face-to-face at the inaugural ‘Empowerment through engagement’ public meeting in the newly-built Good Shepherd Parish Centre. We took those present through the criteria obtained from the Department for Infrastructure for each of the locations. There followed a very constructive conversation with the local stakeholders present. The residents, school, youth and sporting organisation leaders all had ideas about how we could work together to build a profile to meet the department’s requirements, thus speeding up progress and change. We then arranged a face-to-face meeting between the stakeholders and the department. We voiced our concerns, including the fact that, at no time in the assessment process for new crossings, was there a public consultation.Such was the success of the meeting that arrangements were made for a second meeting on mental health, an interactive session with the superb local organisations Aware, Inspire and PIPS. Each of these bodies showcased what they do and how we can improve mental wellbeing in our area. Again, the focus was on introducing the local community to important organisations who can help us to access better services. One of the most pleasant effects of the meetings is the frequency of inquiries from constituents about the next meeting. An inquisitive community is an empowered community. I am delighted to confirm that the next meeting is on local history and will take place in May."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"the pen is mightier than the sword","story":"Address by Father Martin Magill at the funeral of Lyra McKee at St Anne#s Cathedral.May I speak in the Name of the Living God.First of all, I want to thank Dean Stephen Forde for his kind invitation to give this reflection today. I have no idea what you Sara, Lyra’s partner must have felt on Thursday night when those shots rang out and Lyra was hit and fell to the ground.I can’t begin to imagine what you Lyra’s mum, and you her sisters and brothers must have gone through when Sara phoned to tell you Lyra had been shot. I can’t imagine the agony of your drive to Altnagelvin hospital knowing that Lyra had died.Many of us here in this cathedral have been praying for you since we heard the dreadful news and will continue to do so.Since the story of Lyra’s murder broke on Holy Thursday into Good Friday, there has been an enormous sense of grief and solidarity with you from many people at this huge injustice. Many, many wonderful things have been said about her including the warm and deserved tributes paid to her by the Secretary of State and by MPs of all parties in the House of Commons yesterday evening. In death Lyra, has united people of many dferent backgrounds, as further evidenced by this erse congregation at her funeral.Like so many others I couldn’t believe it when I heard the am news on Good Friday morning that Lyra McKee had been shot dead the previous night. I’d met Lyra on several occasions, we had kept in contact by phone, ‘what’s app’,and Twitter. I would however have to confess that I wasn’t aware of her great love of Harry Potter. I hadn’t heard the term ‘Hufflepuff’ until I did an internet search and found this definition # ‘Hufflepuff is the most inclusive among the four houses valuing hard work, dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair play.’ It struck me that the definition could just as easily have been about Lyra. Whilst Harry Potter didn’t feature in our conversations what did and it was our last exchange on Twitter at the end of March when Lyra tweeted me with a photo of herself dressed in a nun’s veil with a glass of cider accompanied with these words: ‘Got roped into performing as part of a Sister Act tribute act for Foyle Hospice. Hey @MartinJMagill, you need any help with mass tomorrow ’Let me give a brief overview of Lyra’s le. She was born on st March . She attended Holy Family PS just off the Limestone Road. In her early days at school, she struggled with reading and required extra support.Things changed dramatically when one of her teachers, Mr O’Neill began to read to her class The Twits by Roald Dahl. This was the spark that got Lyra interested in reading and then thanks to her granny Patricia Lawrie buying her each of the Harry Potter books as they were published this led to her le long interest in Harry Potter and later on to exchanges in social media with JK Rowling.Lyra’s love of reading was further nurtured when she went to St Gemma’s High School, just off the Oldpark Road also in North Belfast. Her interest in journalism began at the age of  when she wrote for the St Gemma’s school newspaper.Shortly afterwards Lyra became involved in a charity called “The Headliners’ which gives young people a voice by using journalism and media as a tool for learning and campaigning. This project played an important part in her being awarded the Sky News Young Journalist Award . After school and further education, Lyra studied online journalism at Birmingham City University graduating with an MA degree. Over the years her writing has won her much acclaim such as her letter when she was  to her  year old self about growing up as gay in Belfast. In , aged just , she was acknowledged internationallyas an exceptional achiever with an exciting future by Forbes magazine in their  under  listbecause of her work as an investigative reporter.Last month thefeatured Lyra in an article considering the  rising stars of Irish writing. Her memory also lives on in her TEDx talk, #How uncomfortable conversations can save lives”, about the  Orlando nightclub shooting. Her book on the murder of Rev Robert Bradford, the Member of Parliament for South Belfast, called Angels with Blue Faces was due to be published later this year.Lyra came to see me as part of her research on a book she was working on called Lost Boys. We met on several occasions and kept in contact. I knew absolutely nothing about  year old Thomas Spence and  year old John Rodgers, who vanished at a bus stop onthe Falls Road in West Belfast in November . They were both living in St John’s Parish at that time where I am presently the parish priest and it was for this reason Lyra came to see me. By the time Lyra had told me their story and what she hoped to do, I was fully behind her. Nichola her sister who spoke earlier described Lyra like #a dog with a bone’ when she had found something that interested her.I certainly experienced her gentle, determined doggedness. When we exchanged greetings on New Year’s Day and I wished her well not only in the writing of Lost Boys but also in her search for the remains of the boys which she made clear to me was very important to her. She replied in this way: ‘If that#s the only thing that comes out of this, it#ll be worth it. It#s the only thing I really want out of it, to find them and the others.’In the course of her investigations, Lyra had discovered that other children had disappeared and she had wanted to find their bodies.I pray that her work will be taken up and that their bodies will be found and even more importantly that there will be no more ‘lost boys’ or ‘lost girls.’When I consider Lyra’s determination, it strikes me that she was the embodiment of the St Gemma’s school motto: ‘truth and charity.’ On Good Friday, the day on which Christians all over the world recall the suffering and death of Jesus Christ we also wrestle with the mystery of suffering. For you Lyra’s nearest and dearest, you came to know the experience of Good Friday in your own lives. For those of us who follow Jesus, we believe that the shedding of his innocent blood on the cross was enough # in the words of the hymn: ‘the cross has said it all’. We don’t need any more innocent blood to be shed.The irony could not be more poignant when we consider the signing of the Good Friday agreement which was about ensuring there would be no more deaths like Lyra’s. Earlier in this service, we listened to Matthew’s account of the Beatitudes which was chosen by her family in remembrance of Lyra learning these by heart when she was a pupil at St Gemma’s. The beatitude ‘Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God’is very timely. Many of us will be praying that Lyra’s death in its own way will not have been in vain and will contribute in some way to building peace here. Since Thursday night we have seen the coming together of many people in ious places and the unying of the community against violence. I commend our political leaders for standing together in Creggan on Good Friday. I am however left with a question: ‘Why in God’s name does it take the death of a  year old woman with her whole le in front of her to get us to this point ’ As Christians recalled the death of Jesus on the cross, we remembered that his death was not in vain but was for us the doorway to eternal le. I dare to hope that Lyra’s murder on Holy Thursday night can be the doorway to a new beginning. I detect a deep desire for this. One of Lyra’s friends was reported as saying: ‘We have had enough. There is a younger generation coming up in the town and they don#t need guns put in their hands.They need jobs, they need a better health service and education. They need a le, not a gun put in their hands.’ To those who had any part in her murder, I encourage you to reflect on Lyra McKee journalist and writer as a powerful example of ‘The pen is mightier than the sword’.I plead with you to take the road of non violence to achieve your political ends. It was encouraging to see that those who provide a political analysis to the organisation responsible for her death chose to call off their parade on Easter Monday following the call from Fr Joe Gormley, the parish priest in Creggan where Lyra was killed. To those still intent on violence, I ask you to listen to the majority of the people on your beloved island of Ireland who are calling on you to stop. I pay tribute to the courage and determination of the women who in a very powerful gesture of non violence,one by one placed their hands in blood red paint on a wall and said loudly ‘we are not afraid.’ I commend the + people in Creggan who have contacted the police. There is a rule in many of our communities that we do not, we should not, give information to police and that, to do so is to become a ‘tout.’ But that was one of a number of rules # rules that also said that it was OK to brutalise children for petty crimes, or rules that say you can live in the locality until you are told you can’t or rules that said that the only way we could gain ‘freedom’ was by other fellow-human beings losing their lives. But this week I have seen these rules turned on their head. I have seen many people stand up and condemn this culture of violence and coercive control. We need to send a very dferent message and so I appeal to those who have information about Lyra’s murder but who haven#t yet come forward to do so now. If you want to see an end to these brutal rules, and see a new society built on justice and fairness, on hope and not fear, then you can help build that society by letting the police know what you know. There will be special measures put in place to ensure your safety and where you will not be intimidated by coercive controllers,you do so.To the many politicians present in this cathedral today, let me say again those words which one of Lyra’s friends had said: ’the younger generation need jobs, they need a better health service and education. They need a le, not a gun put in their hands.’ As politicians you will be familiar with the first report of the Independent Reporting Commission published last October which examined in depth paramilitary style attacks and found a clear correlation between these attacks and areas of social deprivation. Lyra’s friend is right in pointing out that our young people need jobs, and education and training to get those jobs. All our young people need a le that gives them an aspiration for the future. As our politicians we need you to be working together to make that happen so that especially for those living in deprived areas that they will feel the peace process is working for them as well – and especially for young people living in these communities. To the press and media which Lyra was so proud to be part of – I ask you to report on what is being done in these areas – to praise good work where you find it and report when it is not happening. I know you as politicians have a very dficult job to but then so too did Lyra. There is another valuable lesson from her le # she was like ‘a dog with a bone’ when she believed she could make a dference. When it comes to our peace process, I would love to see this dogged attitude to the rebuilding of an Assembly that works for the common good. As I listen to the radio every morning, all I seem to hear about ious initiatives in Northern Ireland are these words, ‘without a minister, this can’t be taken forward’. I pray that Lyra’s murder may be the catalyst needed for parties to start talking, to reform that which was corrosive in previous Assemblies and to begin anew. On Easter Sunday, Christians all over the world celebrated the most important event of the Christian year, the resurrection of Jesus. It was because of his resurrection that we believe in le beyond the grave and in the words of today’s second reading from John : ‘in my Father’s house there are many dwelling places.’ It is in this hope of eternal le and happiness that we gather in prayer and now into the tender mercy of a loving God and Father I commend Lyra McKee.

If you open a calendar on any given week you will find a reason for politicians to hold off engaging with each other..pushMarching season, conference season, elections, pressure in Westminster, negotiations in Brussels and issues within inidual parties are just a few examples.Little more than a week ago the usual script had been written, and was widely accepted, for the weeks ahead.Politicians in Westminster, Brussels, Dublin and Belfast were taking an Easter break in the assumption that there could be no engagement while local and European election campaigns were being fought in Northern Ireland in May. The script said the parties were on the doorsteps and would inevitably maintain partisan politics until the elections had past.Just after pm on Thursday April  that script was torn up by the senseless and heartbreaking murder of a woman whose name we have all come to know, Lyra McKee, whom, by the outstanding tributes of her partner, family and friends, we all wish we had known in le.As a politician and Tanaiste there are many things you experience that are unique but there are only a handful of experiences that you know will stay with you until the end of your days.Being in the front pews of St Annes Cathedral as an unstoppable wave of applause, hope and demand hit the most senior politicians from the UK and Ireland in the base of our spines is one such moment I will never forget.The words of Father Martin Magill summed up the desire and frustration of all communities in Northern Ireland in a sentence,\"Why in Gods name does it take the death of the -year old woman, with her whole le in front of her, to get to this point \"Last summer violence in Derry saw live bullets being fired and police officers narrowly escaping injury or death. In January seven young people were minutes from being killed after they passed the car bomb that sat in the centre of Derry. However, on April  the cowards claimed a victim. The fact that it was a journalist and writer who was a shining example of everything Northern Ireland can achieve is the reason so many people have come together to mourn.The night before Lyra McKees funeral I sat in Strand Road police station in Derry with the officers who had tried to save her le. These men and women are hardened by the fact that petrol bombs can be thrown at them in the course of their everyday work but on Tuesday night they were numbed and vulnerable at the fact that a young woman had died beside them. Despite their Land Rovers being alight with petrol and live ammunition being fired at them, the PSNI left its secure position to get to Lyra McKee after she had been hit. They made the decision to drive to Altnagelvin Hospital, officers performed CPR on Lyra for the entire journey and they stayed and supported her partner and friends as the horrible news of her death was confirmed. The leadership shown by the PSNI in Derry has rightly been applauded by the community it serves.While I heard Father Magills rallying call for political leadership loud and clear, I also heard what he said about the events in Derry as the news of Lyras murder sunk in: \"I commend our political leaders for standing together in Creggan on Good Friday.\"Arlene Foster, Michelle ONeill, Colum Eastwood, Robin Swann and Naomi Long were not ordered to release a joint statement by anyone or told to go into the Creggan. When a dark moment threatened to drag Northern Ireland back to a dark past their natural inclination was to do the right thing.We now have a window where the Irish and British Governments are calling the parties together. We have all spoken in person and on the phone many times in the last week and without exception I believe all the party leaders are genuine in their desire toto Stormont.As we meet in the weeks ahead, a conversation I had with Mrs Joan McKee will be foremost in my mind.Standing in the side chapel of St Annes was the President of Ireland, the Taoiseach, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom as well as myself as Tanaiste, the Secretary of State and ministers of both governments. Despite all the power of those elected offices we were standing there as a group that was utterly powerless to comfort a woman who had, as Joan put it, \"lost her baby\".We owe it to Joan and Lyra McKee to make sure no other ceasefire babies are murdered in the prime of their lives and to make sure that Northern Ireland has a ing government.There is never a perfect time to do the right thing in Northern Ireland. However, there is a right time and that time is now.Simon Coveney is Tanaiste of the Republic of Ireland"},{"url":null,"title":"36000 food bank packages handed out in a year in","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

More than a thirdof food bank referrals made due to a delay in benefits being paid in Northern Ireland were linked to Universal Credit.From this data, and other insights from food banks in the Trussell Trusts network, the charity believes ending the five-week wait for a first Universal Credit payment should be the Governments first priority to help create a future without food banks.\"Year-on-year we are seeing more and more people in Northern Ireland struggling to eat because they simply cannot afford food,\" said Dave Magill, Trussell Trust operations manager for Northern Ireland.\"This isnt right. We know Northern Ireland is on a clf-edge with less than a year to go before we see the extra flexibility currently available to people under our benefits system come to an end.\"We have real concerns about the impact this will have on our communities.\"Our benefits system should anchor us all from being swept into poverty. Universal Credit should be part of the solution but currently the five-week wait is leaving many without enough money to cover the basics.\"As a priority, were urging the Government to end the wait for Universal Credit to ease the pressure on thousands of households. \"No charity can replace the dignity of having financial security.

Lyra McKee was murdered in Creggan in Derry on Thursday th April.Photo by Kelvin Boyes   Press Eye.\"The funeral of Journalist Lyra McKee takes place at St Annes Cathedral in Belfast on April th  \"Mourners begin to gather for the funeral of Lyra McKee at St Annes Cathedral in Belfast on April th  In a response redolent of what happened at Princess Dianas funeral in London in , hundreds of people who had gathered outside the cathedral also clapped as they listened to a relay of the priests words in Donegall Street, where from early morning it was obvious that Lyras send-off was going to be a funeral like no other.Young people dressed in the colourful garb of Harry Potter characters and comic book heroes came in their hundreds to say their painful farewells, but also to give thanks for their slain friend, who they called \"a girl in a million\".Some mourners carried rainbow flags in honour of Lyra, a committed campaigner for LGBT rights.Prime Minister Theresa May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn took time out from their fraught Brexit negotiations to join Irish President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to pay tribute to Lyra.Few disputed the north Belfast author and journalist was destined to write herself into the annals of the great wordsmiths, but sadly she made headlines of horror and heartbreak across the globe after being killed by dissident republicans.One friend said she hoped the message from yesterdays funeral that would go out around the world would be how the murder had crystallised the fact that there was for once at least a united Ireland - united in abhorrence of Lyras murder by a New IRA gunman.However, the tears of sorrow yesterday for Lyra were also fused with tears of laughter as her friends and family celebrated her remarkable le that, they said, was full of fun and joy. And compassion and love.People from a myriad of backgrounds, from all generations, of all sexual orientations and from all religions and none, showed the world - which Lyra had at her talented feet - an unmistakable and unshakeable determination that they will not allow her death to have been in vain, and that as in her le, her passing must make a dference.It was also a powerful message that the New IRA must listen to the demands that it should give up violence once and for all.Even the choice of St Annes Cathedral for the service was powerfully symbolic in itself, a recognition of an all-too-rare shared space in what has been a ided city.Only pre-eminent churchmen, sports stars, business leaders and musicians are usually accorded funeral services in the historic building.And normally they have been older men and women who have lived their lives, not a young woman who was still on the threshold of hers and who wasnt even born of the Protestant persuasion.The service was broadcast live by the British-based  hour news channels and dozens of photographers and journalists from English newspapers were in attendance.Lyras murder may have catapulted her into the public domain, but at her funeral her love for her family was also underscored by inspiring addresses about the private side of the daughter who would phone her mother Joan  times a day to check that she was all right - \"even when she was upstairs\".Lyras sister Nichola Corner spoke on behalf of herself, her distraught mother, her sisters Joan and Mary and brothers Gary and David.Nichola told mourners that Lyra had been buried with a flower in her hair in response to her love of the Scott McKenzie song San Francisco.She said the family didnt have Dumbledores time turner to change the past.\"But within each of us we have the power to create the kind of society that Lyra envisioned,\" she added.\"In the words of Lyra herself, we must change our own world, one piece at a time. Now lets get to work.\"Lyras friend Stephen Lusty - a self-avowed \"middle-class, middle-aged Protestant heterosexual British male engineer\" - told the congregation that she had told him just hours before she died that she was going to propose to her partner Sara Canning in New York.\"She showed me pictures of the ring she had bought for Sara and told me of the fabulous plans she had of her proposal in May,\" said Mr Lusty.\"She made me put a date in my diary for the wedding in Donegal in  and gave me strict instructions to wear my kilt, which she always wanted to borrow, adorn it with some Harry Potter, and to find or refind my own version of Sara.\"He laughingly referred to the questions she would ask him out of the blue about whether it was closer to drive to Derry or Londonderry, or why Protestants ate more vegetables than Catholics.Mr Lusty said that after he introduced the indefatigable Lyra to the late southern politician Brian Lenihan, he described her as a \"star\".But he added: \"I would rather do  rounds in the boxing ring with Paisley than do that again.\"He said that in her online journalistic work Lyra received \"more than her fair share of cyber abuse and trolling, but she never hated anyone\".He said his generation had sung about an alternative Ulster - the words of a song by Belfast punk band Stf Little Fingers - but added that people here should now build an alternative Ulster and make peace a lasting legacy of Lyra McKee.Speaking at the beginning of the service, Dean Stephen Forde said: \"Lyra was a person who broke down barriers and reached across boundaries, this was her hallmark in le, this is her legacy in death.\"As a journalist she pursued truth wherever it took her, never content with the sullen silence of unanswered questions.\"She was a child of the Good Friday Agreement.\"She was a primary school pupil in north Belfast when the Agreement was signed.\"She grew up to champion its hope for a society that was free from the prejudices of the past and open to the possibilities of a new future for the people of these islands.\"In her short le Lyra had amassed an extensive network of friends and influential contacts, especially in the realms of crusading and investigative journalism.And the esteem in which she was held was reflected in the fact that upwards of  writers and broadcasters formed a guard of honour for her as her coffin was carried out of the cathedral.The size of the overall attendance underlined the reality that St Annes was the only church big enough to accommodate everyone who wanted to pay their respects to the diminutive girl with the towering and prodigious spirit from a couple of miles up the road in Ardoyne.For many of the people at the service it was their first ever visit to the Church of Ireland cathedral.Lyras family had requested that everyone should give her a dignied send-off but the -minute service wasnt all about solemnity and sadness. Lyras partner Sara had said on Facebook that the \"love of her le\" would like itpeople would wear Hufflepuff, Harry Potter or Marvel-related items at the service.Her friends didnt let her down and Hufflepuff colours were everywhere on scarves and T-shirts emblazoned with #teamlyra.No one was expecting to see DUP leader Arlene Foster or Sinn Fein vice-president Michelle ONeill wearing Hogwarts outfits.But the fact that they were there at all was interpreted by many as a sign of hope.However, that is what many commentators said when the same duo shook hands at the Requiem Mass for Martin McGuinness in the Bogside just over two years ago.\"And look what good that did us,\" one observer pointed out yesterday.But she added: \"The only dference today is that the calls at the funeral were so vocerous and so unanimous that its hard to see how they can be ignored.\"Famous faces voice support for familyAs hundreds gathered at St Anne’s Cathedral yesterday for the funeral of Lyra McKee, many other prominent voices shared their support on social media.Comedian Patrick Kielty posted: “Today Lyra McKee is laid to rest. She believed in peace, tolerance and equality. The exact opposite of those responsible. They will never win because Lyra will always be the future. And her truth will continue to be told.”Actress Bronagh Waugh said: “Thinking of Lyra’s family and friends and partner Sara who have the unfathomable burden of laying her to rest today.“Thinking of the people of Derry, of Belfast. But most of all I’m thinking about Lyra and what a bright and shining light she was.”"},{"url":null,"title":"boojum eaterie rapped over easter advert","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It was the headquarters for the longest continuous campaign in British military history after troops were sent into Northern Ireland in August  to cope with growing sectarian unrest.What was described as a temporary and emergency move lasted for  years and only ended in , long after the ceasefires by the IRA and loyalist paramilitaries.Organisers say they are disappointed that the Ministry of Defence are not backing their event. They were told by the MoD that they are supporting another Op Banner commemoration which is being staged by the Royal British Legion at the National Memorial arboretum in Staffordshire on Wednesday, August .NIVAs event is being held three days later. And the organisation insist that while their members are concerned about the recent charging of soldiers with historical killings in Northern Ireland like Soldier F in relation to Bloody Sunday, their commemoration on Saturday, August  will be a memorial, not a protest.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetThe day will start in Lisburns Wallace Park with a drumhead service before a parade around the city where wreathes will be laid at three dferent points including the scene of a  explosion which killed six soldiers ing from a charity fun run in a minibus.Other floral tributes will be left at Lisburns war memorial and at a statue in honour of the UDR.Organisers say all veterans will be welcome at the commemoration, dating right back to the B Specials and the RUC along with ex-members of the UDR and the Prison Service.But representatives of the Garda Siochana and the Irish Army have also been invited to take part.\"Its a completely inclusive programme,\" said Ian Simpson, media spokesman for NIVA and the chairman of the NI Prison Service Benevolent Fund.One of the centrepieces of the NIVA remembrance day will be the display of the names of soldiers, police officers and prison staff that died in Northern Ireland.There will be , names on a big screen and in remembrance books, twice the number of personnel listed in official records as having been killed in terrorist attacks.NIVA say their roll of honour also includes men and women who died as a result of suicides, accidents and stress-related illnesses which developed as a result of the Troubles.NIVA say they are not inviting serving military chiefs or Royal family members to the Lisburn event although a retired Army general will take the salute.Ian Simpson said: \"The VIPs on the day will be the widows or the families of the people who died. All the organisations within NIVA will nominate representatives to take the salute too.\"He said the decision to hold a separate memorial event here rather than to take part in the national one in England was because this is where it all happened.\"There will be veterans attending both events,\" added Ian. \"And we will still be going to a ceremony we hold every year at the Ulster Ash Grove at the National Arboretum in September. But we thought it was important to have a local ceremony to remember everyone who died or was hurt.\"Organisers are hoping that upwards of , veterans will take part in the parade with , relatives and members of the public in attendance.Tens of thousands of service personnel were injured in the conflict which saw , soldiers coming to Northern Ireland over the  years of Op Banner.\"Taking in the police and the UDR you are talking about half a million people who saw service,\" said Ian, who added that while remembrance of the dead will be the main priority, it wont be the only focus of the Lisburn event.Old security forces vehicles and a scout helicopter will be there for people to see in the centre of Lisburn along with private collections of unorms, decommissioned weapons and regimental memorabilia.\"We want it to be a special day,\" said Ian, who has urged opponents of the security forces to respect the NIVA commemoration. We will be there to remember our fallen colleagues in a peaceful and dignied way and we would ask everyone to respect our day.

The ferry is a real benefit to Strangford, it canrsquot be a liability.Cllr Enright claimed that the DfI ldquoin order to save on staff costs, have not been using the queuing area on the Strangford side.During a recent meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, roads officials confirmed that they were evaluating introducing an earlier morning sailing from Portaferry to Strangford.Councillor Gareth Sharvin said he was also concerned about the regular traffic congestion in Strangford after being contacted by local people caught up in the weekend traffic jam.He said: ldquoI donrsquot understand why there is ferry traffic congestion when there are good ferry traffic lines around the harbour. I will be contacting the Departmentrsquos permanent secretary, Katrina Godfrey, to have a full review and overhaul of the ferry services to ensure that this does not happen again.Strangford businessman, Robert Duffy, owner of a Mace grocery store, confirmed that the village was snarled up with traffic on Saturday evening but reported traffic and the ferry had been running smoothly over the rest of the Easter bank holiday weekend.However, Mr Duffy added: ldquoThe traffic was only bad for a couple of hours on Saturday evening and it was compounded by Saturday night mass in Strangford.ldquoSaturdayrsquos problem was that there was only one boat on. There was racing in Kirkistown and you had between  and  motorhomes travelling from Bishopscourt and that happens every single year.ldquoIrsquove been here  years and it is what it is ndash holiday traffic. The queue management was very good, I was down the street on Sunday and Monday and it was moving well.The Department of Infrastructure was unable to provide a response..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch U","story":"BALLYMACARN Park was bathed in sunshine as the talented lsquoHinch U- squad battled with Virginia for a place in the showpiece Ulster Carpets Cup final at Kingspan Stadium.Despite the heat, both sides put on an excellent display of running rugby in an entertaining encounter with Virginia drawing first blood, taking advantage of an uncharacteristically passive lsquoHinch defence to score from deep with their first attack.lsquoHinch began to work their patterns and took the lead with a typically powerful carry and score from Morgan Croskery and a fine finish from Jojo Naga.Virginia battled back and spent the final minutes before half time battering the lsquoHinch line.Fine close quarter defence enabled the home side to clear their lines but more sloppy defending from the backs allowed Virginia to gain territory and they scored to leave the tie evenly poised at -all.During the half-time break the lsquoHinch coaches asked for more urgency in defence and better ball protection in attack and were rewarded with a superb  minutes of rugby from their side.A line out move was executed perfectly for Matthew Torney to pop up a short pass for a charging Croskery to steam onto the ball and over the line untouched.The home forwards then bullied their opponents in consecutive mauls and Torney used all his power to help himself to a typical close-range score as the Virginia forwards tired.Any thoughts of a comeback were derailed by much improved line speed in defence as Cameron Patterson led the line superbly, driving his man back behind the gain line repeatedly and galvanising his team.James McMaster and Luke Braithwaite were also busy, using their power to disrupt attacks and win turnovers.A Croskery sin-bin was easily absorbed and when Naga finished an excellent Dan Hewitt chip ahead to give his team a  point lead, the match was effectively over as a contest.lsquoHinch emptied their bench to give everyone some time on the pitch and the game lost a little of its intensity as it entered the final  minutes.To their credit, Virginia battled up field for a consolation score with the last move of the match to leave the final score -.League champions, City of Armagh, await the local boys in the final on May  at Kingspan Stadium on what will be a great occasion for this dedicated group of players.Their quarter-final exit from the league play-offs did not do them justice and they have regrouped well over the past few weeks to put together an excellent cup campaign.Hooker Harry McCarroll epitomised the work ethic on Saturday with an all-action man of the match display and senior players continue to set the standards as the season reaches a conclusion.All support welcome on May ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Cormac recognised with two accolades  ","story":"A STUDENT and upcoming politician at Downpatrickrsquos St Patrickrsquos Grammar School recently won two prestigious awards in consecutive days.Cormac Savagereceived the awards for his work in the local community, including engaging young people in politics and for his efforts with local charities like the Mid Down MS Support Group.Cormac mdash who is currently a Member of the Youth Parliament representing South Down mdash was nominated for a Michaela Foundation Wings Award and a Youth and Future Talent Awardin the inspirational young person category by St Patrickrsquos Grammarrsquos head of music, Celeste McEvoy.Cormac delivered a rousing speech last November in the House of Commons with the UK Youth Parliament about the topic of homelessness and, in particular, its gender impact on safety.Also late last year, Cormac gave , local young people the chance to have their voices heard about which issues are most important to them as part of the lsquoMake Your Markrsquo campaign.His first accolade came through The Wings Awards run by the Michaela Foundation in memory of Michaela McAreavey, the young bride murdered on honeymoon in Mauritius in .Cormac said he felt ldquooverwhelmed to have won one of the four awards in the age - category with  young people shortlisted.The awards, set up by Michaelarsquos husband John and her father, Tyrone manager Mickey Harte, seek to recognise young people who have been ldquomotivators within their local community.The following night, Cormac was recognised as an lsquoinspirational young person at the YAFTA awards run by Newry and Mourne Youth Council and Down Area Youth Council.Cormac said the whole experience felt ldquosurreal, adding that it was a ldquototal honour.

The Town Committee asked for the money to go towards a two-week festival they are organising in the town this summer.But councillors bluntly pointed out this week that they have already pumping enough money into the resort for other activities and had already sufficiently helped the Town Committee.Councillors pointed out that the council had spent a ldquovery considerable amount of money in promoting a nine-week summer entertainment programme in Newcastle and had given specic help to the Town Committee in the funding of a joint press conference, advertising and publicity material, as well as providing Radio Newcastle and other facilities.Because of all this ldquoit would not be appropriate to gibe a cash grant in addition.However, the decision did not go down well with Castlewellan councillor Mrs Ethel Smyth, who said it was regrettable that the council had decided to give nothing to the Town Committee.She thought thatthe council could not help by giving the full pound, they should at least have given a part and she hoped the council would have another look at the request.Newcastle councillor Mr Norman Bicker, a member of the Town Committee, said he hoped the council might be able to do something, but he realised there was already a big council programme and he agreed that it was not possible to allow more money.The councilrsquos recreation officer, Mr Bryan Coburn, also pointed out that there was already considerable investment in finance and labour in Newcastle and he felt it would not be appropriate to give more.BALLYGOWAN mdash Bicycling Ballygowan minister, the Rev James Harper, peddled into town last week with a beaming smile on his face for he had just taken part in a smash hit -mile cycle to raise funds to build a new hall in his area.Mr Harper led a team of  modern bikes into Ballygowan on an  year-old penny farthing, which had been loaned to him by cycling enthusiast Albert Watson.The sponsored -mile bike ride took in Raffrey, Derryboy, the Pikestone, Crossgar and Saintfield. Between pound and pound was raised.Itrsquos not the first time Mr Harper, minister of Ballygowan Presbyterian Church, has come up with unusual ideas to raise money. When ministering in Killyleagh he took part in a sponsored bed push and also cycled on a tandem.Coping with the penny farthing proved easier than Mr Harper expected. ldquoIt was remarkably comfortable and I felt really refreshed after the journey, he said.ldquoThere was only one problem mdash it had no brakes, but the police helped us by going ahead to make sure the way was clear.The penny farthing dates from  and is ft in high. Mr Harper only got one half-hour practice to get the feel of it before setting out on the y journey.DOWNPATRICK mdash A proposal to locate a regional museum in Downpatrick has been supported by the South Eastern Education and Library Board.Board members want to be involved in the museumrsquos management together with local councillors.The recommendation is that the museum should be the responsibility of the district council, but Board member Mr Jack Magee believes the concept is too narrow.Board members want top priority to be given to recruiting a pool of staff for regional museums and that they should be seconded for proper professional training to acquire a professional qualication.Meanwhile, Down Council is pressing ahead with its own plans to establish a museum in Downpatrick.The council museum was started before the announcement that Downpatrick had been nominated as the location for a regional museum and it is believed that the council museum will be used as the basis for the regional museum.Councillors have accepted that it will be some time before money will be made available for the appointment of museum staff, so a full-time curator is now needed to enable their lsquoDown Museumrsquo to progress properly.It has been confirmed that until the appointment is made, Mr Albert Colmer, chairman of the Lecale Historical Society, will continue to act as curator.STRANGFORD mdash The Strangford Ferry fares will be increased next week, despite strong protests from Ards and Down councillors and members of Portaferry Development Committee.Representatives from all three groups recently met with the Department of Roads Service, which operates the ferry, and were told that the increases were the absolute minimum which could be implemented.Down councillor Mr John Ritchie said he was told that the fares should meet at least % of the servicersquos running costs, which now stood at nearly pound, a year.KILLYLEAGH mdash The blueprint for Killyleaghrsquos one-day festival of family fun in June was revealed at a public meeting in the Cooke Hall in the town.The planned programme, ranging from car slalom, marathon darts, senior citizensrsquo talent contest and yard of ale competition, makes impressive reading, attempting as it does to involve the whole community.ldquoWe must put Killyleagh on the map, was the message message hammered home at the meeting by Mr Winston Maguire, chairman of Killyleagh Town Committee.The organisers received an enormous boost when local hotelier Mr Harry Briggs offered free of charge for three nights the main hall of the Dunmore Hotel.The organisers have appealed for sponsorship, especially donations for prizes. The townspeople will not only enjoy the one-day festival, but any profits made from the event will be ploughed back to provide Christmas lights for the townrsquos streets.DRUMAROAD mdash Outbreaks of sheep worrying hit the area at the weekend when more than  lambs were savagely attacked and killed by marauding dogs.Mr P J McGrady, a farmer from Drumaroad, lost ten lambs over the weekend, He spotted a black dog with white spots on his land and he rushed into his house for his shotgun, but the dog had gone when he went outside.BALLYNAHINCH mdash A pair of talented Ballynahinch sisters, Lesley and Gail Newham, are among four students from the South Eastern Music Centre who travelled to Grantham in Lincolnshire with the British Youth Symphony Orchestra this week.This is the second year in succession that the sisters have been chosen to join the  young musicians from all over the UK who will be giving concerts for the next two weeks.Mr David Newham, father of  year-old Lesley, who plays a horn, and  year-old Gail, an oboeist, is director and advisor of music for the South Eastern Education and Library Board.STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash A speedboat with the engine still attached was found drting in Strangford Lough close to Don OrsquoNeill Island on Saturday by Mr Paul McCann, of  Springvale Park, Dpwnpatrick.The speedboat was taken to a temporary mooring at Castleward Bay provided by Strangford Sailing Club. Later, when police checked on the speedboat, they discovered that it had been removed from the mooring.It is believed that the owner of the boat had taken it away, but Strangford police would like the owner to confirmthis was so.KILLOUGH mdash Down councillors have run into snags over their plans to provide playing fields in Killough.The council has applied to the Department of Education for a vesting order for land, but two objections have been entered by residents and the Department wonrsquot proceed until all possible alternatives sites have been investigated.SPA mdash The sixth annual inspection and display of First Spa Company of the Boysrsquo Brigade took place in the Arnold Hall over two nights last week.

The event was finished off by further prayers and hymns with soup served to all.The call for the Church of Ireland community to boycott the event was ignored as several additional ministers attended the event for the first time.Former Bishop Trevor Williams, recently retired from the Church of Ireland diocese of Limerick and Killaloe and former rector of Newcastle, said he felt it was important to attend the event.ldquoThe Christian message for me is one primarily of love and concern for others and on this Good Friday thatrsquos precisely the message, the cross of Jesus Christ and what he gave to the world, he said.ldquoJesus said love one another as I have loved you so that is the importance of this day. We learn most from those who are dferent so this walk today gives us an opportunity to realise that each of our traditions have something to offer, each has something to learn from each other.Church of Ireland minister, the Rev Adrian Dorrian from the Lecale group of churches, said he felt it was important to attend the walk.ldquoWe have a similar walk of witness in Downpatrick today, he said. ldquoBut, given the coverage this year and the protest letter which we disagree strongly with, we wanted to show support. Dean Henry Hull would have been here but he has other Good Friday service commitments. Irsquom very glad to have been able to come and represent the other churches in the town.Castlewellan parish priest, Fr Denis McKinlay, said: ldquoItrsquos been a great turnout today and great show of support and solidarity from some very important people. After all it is a peace walk and itrsquos about peace, reconciliation and hope and we all have to learn from one another. Surely that has to be a great thing In welcoming the walkers to St Paulrsquos, the Rev Brian Cadden said: ldquoIt is a real sense of joy today, despite dferent expressions of the Christian faith, that we can come together to share the most basic aspect of our faith which is the death of Jesus Christ on the cross.St Malachyrsquos parishioners, Harry and Margaret McCartan from Newcastle, have attended the walk for years.Mr McCartan said why there were there: ldquoTo bear witness with our Christian neighbours, thatrsquos what it is all about, he said.ldquoThatrsquos exactly it, this is nothing to do with politics, added Mrs McCartan.He continued: ldquoWhy be a Christianyou are afraid to show it Gerald King from Annsborough said he attended the walk due to recent newspaper coverage.ldquoI came today after seeing that letter because them men are wrong, he said. ldquoLove one another as I have loved you, thatrsquos what this is about.St Malachyrsquos parishioner Mary Steele, who walks every year, said: ldquoItrsquos been lovely and peaceful and calm. Itrsquos a prayerful day and it should be. Good Friday is the day and the resurrection is the day. Let those without sin cast the first stone.Fellow St Malachyrsquos parishioner Philomena Rice was there with her three grandchildren as she has done in previous years.ldquoI think itrsquos important to show my grandchildren the other church, she said. ldquoThey like coming out to this, carrying the cross as they call it.Ronnie Hamilton, secretary of the Castlewellan Area Bible Prayer Group said: ldquoIrsquom very happy with the turnout today and itrsquos more than we normally have.

As he sat on top of the mountain with no name, counting all the athletes as they reached the summit and the yellow sun began to set over the rolling green hills, he thought to himself that this was truly a place of beauty to be shared with like-minded people. There was ldquono better place to be on a Thursday evening.This yearrsquos race began at the stone monument. The athletes run along the Shimna River almost as quickly as the salmon heading to spawn. After reaching the lowest part of Tollymore, they run to the very highest point of the park at Carrigard via the affectionately known lsquochutersquo.From here, they cross a stile onto open mountain leading to the hill with no name, a sharp climb and itrsquos all downhill from there to the finish mdash well, almost. So far, this yearrsquos race directors have added and subtracted new paths, just to spice things up.

Seamus Lynch better watch out as Deon has suggested that he is taking a double dose next week. It is ironic that this is called The Monument race. The race takes its name from the stone obelisk built by Robert Jocelyn, in honour of his son James, who suffered from asthma in the days long before Google. Second and third places went to Mourne runners, Timothy Johnston and Jonathan Scott respectively. Jared Martin, in fth place, was the first junior to pass the finish line. As well as the senior event, Phil Hodge organised a junior run as a selection race for an international event.These young ones are aged  to  and it was incredible that Tom Crudingtonof Newcastle AC, on a slightly shortened course, managed to cross the line even ahead of Seamus Lynch.Ciara Savage, of Newcastle AC, was the first female junior. A massive congratulations to all of the juniors who entered and hopefully we can encourage even more for the next junior race at Binnian.The ladiesrsquo event followed a similar vein with last weekrsquos winner Esther Dickson, of Newry AC in dominate form.Second place was Karen Wilton and Sarah Graham romped home in third. Poor Sarah, however, was cornered by McNeilly in the Avoca at the presentation, who was heard regaling her of his past triumphs, including his  minute k and  minute  miler.Perhaps there was some consolation for Sarah in that she wasnrsquot subjected to Joe McCann recounting his illustrious Armagh .

It is understood that it could be early July before this work is completed.There have been a series of issues associated with the regeneration scheme to provide new paving, street lighting and furniture in Irish Street with the initial start date delayed as Phoenix Gas took longer than expected to complete its work at this part of the town.Signicant issues have now arisen with the foundations for the blast wall which surrounded the former police base, but of major concern is problems with the sewer network.A series of frenetic phone calls to politicians and NI Water were made recently after raw sewage flowed out of an old section of piping for over a week.Businesses say they have been told that major sections of the sewer network need replaced and that contractors recently discovered that one large section of the sewer was completely blocked with concrete and has most probably been like this for decades.All businesses have reported a downturn in trade since work in Irish Street started and a temporary one-way traffic system was introduced, while there is concern that a number of parking spaces have been lost and that the width of the main street has been substantially narrowed in places.Calls have been issued for a rates reduction given the impact the work has had on business with traders highlighting that the delay in completing the scheme, ironically designed to help attract more shoppers, is outside their control but has had a signicant impact upon them.Mr Alan Oakes, of Plus  Print, said the sewer outside his business collapsed for eight days, with main contractors apologising for what was happening.ldquoTrade has been poor since the works started on January  and with further realistic delays forthcoming, we donrsquot know what the future might hold, he said.ldquoOne business in Irish Street has now closed, traffic is at a standstill, deliveries are impossible and collection from businesses is a nightmare while footfall is at zero. The management of the entire streetscape has been disastrous from day one and now more delays are anticipated.Mr Oakes said what concerns him most has been the lack of communication provided by Newry, Mourne and Down Council. He also fears that the sewage infrastructure in Irish Street is at breaking point.He added: ldquoWe are a family-run business with  yearsrsquo experience in the town and an employer. These past few months been very testing and dficult for all businesses in Irish Street.Another trader said that given the loss in trade businesses have experienced, they should be entitled to a rates rebate.He said: ldquoWe all accepted that the street upgrade was needed but the work was supposed to take three months. Now they are saying that it will be the end of June and even into July before it is completed. What is going on ldquoEveryone has taken a hit and, given that fact, we deserve a rates rebate. Business is hard enough without having to put up with this. We were told the work would take three months, but we will be into a seventh month before this over.A spokeswoman for the Department of Infrastructure said the Irish Street scheme is a project it is managing on behalf of Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Department for Communities.ldquoThis is a full refurbishment of the existing streetscape, with the provision of new street lighting, street furniture and carriageway resurfacing, she explained.ldquoUnfortunately the scheme has encountered a signicant number of unexpected delays due to utility alterations and dficulties with construction around the old blast wall foundations at the PSNI station.The spokeswoman confirmed that in consultation with the contractor carrying out the work, it is now anticipated that further delays are ldquounfortunately unavoidable at this stage with the finish date of the main paving works now expected to be June .She also revealed that a full road closure will then be required to carry out resurfacing of the carriageway.The spokeswoman added: ldquoWhile we appreciate this unavoidable delay has caused concern, please be assured that all measures to expedite works are being taken.South Down MLA, Colin McGrath, said it was ldquodisappointing to learn that the completion of roadworks at Irish Street have been delayed until the end of June.ldquoWhile residents and business owners will want to see the work completed to the highest standard, that this will be at the cost of another two monthsrsquo interruption which is disheartening.

He then went on to do a second degree, in law, at Queen’s University and had a place at the Institute of Professional Legal Studies to complete his legal training.But by that point he said that he’d had “enough of studying” and decided to work in the -year-old family business, Clarke’s Tyres in Larne.The academic mechanic, who is standing for the DUP in the Coast Road area of Mid and East Antrim Borough Council, said thathe is elected he hopes his unique background will help both in dealing with the public and also with the scrutiny work of a councillor.“Hopefully the law background means that you’re not so easily intimidated with vague advice about legal positions,” he said.When askedhe had been wary about putting his name forward in today’s highly tribalised political atmosphere, he said: “Yes, there were qualms. We run a small business and there is a slight anxiety that in a worst case will you have a boycott or that type of thing  I hope Northern Ireland has moved on from that. “The DUP are now a mainstream party. Hopefully there is less tension than in past times. We need to try and attract people [to politics] from all backgrounds.”The father-of-five said he was “not someone with a party political background” and had only joined the DUP a year and a half ago, around the time the party agreed to prop up theminority Tory government.When asked where he was politically in the DUP, a party which over recent years has become a much broader church of unionist opinion than was the case in decades gone past, Mr Clarke said that he was “probably bang in the middle” of the party.He said that the way in which the party had used its Westminster leverage to secure money for all of Northern Ireland – rather than pressing for purely unionist demands – had impressed him.“How they’ve played their hand at Westminster has been very attractive to me – they didn’t try to do party political things so much but got money for the NHS, broadband, etc, which helped everyone. It was that idea of ‘Team NI’ that I find very attractive.”When asked about his first experience of canvassing, Mr Clarke said: “Candidates are supposed to say its been wonderful, astonishing support. On one level I’m very surprised and pleased at pledges of support from people who haven’t voted before, right across the community, but by far and away the biggest response is ‘I don’t vote’. There is a lot of discontent over Stormont not being there and a fair amount of discontent at Westminster as well.”Ben Lowry: Why I winced at the applause during priest’s criticism of politicians at

The idea of sandwiching talks in between council and European elections – the point at which parties are most stretched and have the least time to consider what may be complex compromise proposals – is unlikely to produce a sudden breakthrough.Evenit did see a sudden sht, parties about to go before the electorate might want to be seen to be open to dialogue, but they are unlikely to want to be seen to compromise on their demands just before voters get their say.There is another complicating factor. Although Sir Patrick Coghlin has never given any indication as to when the RHI Inquiry will report, whispers from ious sources – most of whom are themselves uncertain about what is a closely-guarded secret – suggest that is unlikely to be before June and could be as late as September.For Sinn Fein in particular, that poses a risk. If the inquiry report is so devastating that Arlene Foster is unable to survive, it would be a major destabilising development just weeks or months into a new dawn.If the inquiry is highly critical of Mrs Foster, but she survives, there is the risk of a festering sore whereby every time she appears with Michelle O’Neill that image reminds voters that Sinn Fein pulled Stormont down to demand Foster step aside over RHI but was happy to go back in even after she has been found to have been partly to blame for the scandal.And those problems come before any of the issues in dispute between the DUP and Sinn Fein are considered. Nevertheless, there is a hypothetical route to Stormont ing later this year, evenit is far from certain that the DUP will jointly decide to travel it.The first stage is the two elections taking place next month. On paper, next week’s council elections should be very good for the DUP.Amid weariness at Peter Robinson and multiple unionist alternatives, the party had an awful council election in , seeing its vote slip % to %. Although council and Westminster elections are not entirely analogous, that is so far behind the % of the vote which the DUP took in the  general election that even a result which is halfway between those two figures would represent gains for the DUP across Northern Ireland. For Mrs Foster, who has been wounded as leader for more than two years, that would represent a strong result.Sinn Fein did not see its vote slide quite so much in , but it also had a poor council election that year. Its vote has risen –as has the total nationalist vote – since then and in the current highly tribalised atmosphere both major parties can expect to take more seats.Robin Swann: Don’t let DUP and Sinn Fein turn council elections into border poll Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"If that happens, Sinn Fein would have seen off the first electoral test from both the nascent SDLP-Fianna Fail alliance and the conservative Catholic party Aontú. The DUP would have confirmed its dominance of unionism, despite its dficulties. The European election is likely to follow a similar pattern. From such positions of hegemonic control, both parties would have at least the chance to strike a deal.The RHI Inquiry report will then either precipitate the defenestration of Mrs Foster, ushering in a new leader who will probably be less disliked by nationalists, or, based on the principle that what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger, she will survive and regain some of her lost authority.Either of those scenarios potentially make it easier for Sinn Fein to compromise –it wants to. The question then would be whether the DUP want to commit to three more years of Stormont where – based on the  result – unionism is a minority and they are just one seat ahead of Sinn Fein.try catch

Three years on, operators Penarth Quays Marina and Vale owners have not agreed on a way to bring it back into operation. Gwynne Grfiths, chairman of the association, said: ldquoLoss of this amenity is particularly hard for those without access to a car who rely on public transport.ldquoThere is nothing mechanically wrong with the bridge. It was tested on February .ldquoThere appears to be disagreement between Penarth Quays and the Vale over the safety facilities needed to operate the bridge and minimise the impact on neighbouring houses and businesses.The Association is now campaigning for it to be reopened.A spokesperson for Penarth Quays Marina said: ldquoWe are obligated to operate the bridge based on an agreement made in , but the bridge was built to standards applicable in . Now, the bridge has several operational regulations like alarm levels ndash we canrsquot balance the high level of noise needed for a bridge and the low level needed for a residential area. This is the reality that the council have to consider and resolve.A Vale of Glamorgan Council spokesman said: ldquoThe swing bridge is maintained and operated by Quay Marinas, who manage the Penarth Quays Marina site.ldquoIt was closed due to a number of safety concerns, with upgrades needed before it can be reopened, including audible warnings.ldquoThe council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report following which our health and safety officers and those from Quay Marinas will discuss possible solutions which may enable the bridge to be reopened in the future. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

So many people say lsquowhy wonrsquot the council talk to us \"Cllr Steffan William askedsports pitches could be ldquofenced off to prevent dogs walking on them, but the councilrsquos operational manager Colin Smith said this ldquocould be quite costly for the council.At the start of the meeting, Mr Smith said: ldquoWe know the majority of dog owners are responsible and we donrsquot want to limit them from the green spaces the Vale has to offer.There were also calls for more dog waste bins throughout the Vale at the meeting.Councillors heard there have been just six prosecutions for dog fouling in the Vale of Glamorgan in the past year.Cardf councilrsquos PSPO against dog fouling will see dog owners fined poundtheyrsquore found without bags or the means of picking up after their pets.But Mr Smith said: ldquoThe legal team were concerned it wouldnrsquot be lawful.

Regardless of how you voted in the referendum, whether wersquore in or out we should all be proud of what we produce on this island and Irsquom here to show you that itrsquos possible to create a great product without having to go to the Far East.ldquoIt has taken me three years to develop the ZIGZAG - from the seed of an idea to the living and breathing product you can see today. I want you to support our crowdfunding campaign so we can give a boost to the factories in Wales which have supported our development. Theyrsquore ready to make your ZIGZAG now!Factory boss, Jason Keetch, who runs the factory making the ZIGZAG, said: \"It has been an absolute pleasure working on the ZIGZAG with John.The majority of our workload consists of manufacturing sub components for larger designs so we rarely get to make a recognisably finished product like this. Seeing first hand the progression of the design and working so closely with John on it has made this project feel extra special.ldquoMy whole team are proud that the ZIGZAG is a fully Welsh product and that we have been a part of its story.

In England the local government budget has seen cuts that are twice as large as here in Wales and school spending has been much better protected.When I met Penarth head teachers I was honest about our choice to protect NHS spending.Health has consistently been the top priority of the public and I still face demands from all parties to spend even more money on the NHS.To deliver signicantly more money for schools and the local government budget would mean taking money out of the NHS.Keeping our commitment to the NHS affects every other public service, including our schools. That is the reality of nearly a decade of austerity.That does not mean that schools have been abandoned.For example the Welsh Government chose to increase funding to our st Century Schools programme. That means more new schools like the Penarth Learning Community and thanks to the budget deal secured by Labour councillors more money to renovate Victorian schools in the Vale.This year changes to teachers pensions by the UK Government have created a multi-million pound hole in school budgets. The UK Government only passed on  per cent of the costs to Wales. The Welsh Government funded the missing  per cent but that is money that canrsquot be spent somewhere .Despite the fact that local government in Wales has a much better funding deal than across the border in England I recognise that our councils have an incredibly dficult challenge setting a budget.We all saw that in the Vale, where nearly half the ruling Conservative group refused to back the budget proposal from their own leadership. There is a choice to be made between reducing services or raising council tax. Even after council tax rises most councils are still reducing services.Education and social services are the largest spending areas for local councils. Each council decides their own spending priorities and dferent councils have made dferent choices.The local funding formula for schools in the Vale was reviewed and simplied by the previous Labour administration and agreed by local head teachers. Itrsquos simpler and more transparent as a result.Itrsquos disappointing that the Vale Council leadership refuses to recognise that it has any responsibility for school funding choices. For example Cardf council has put a larger proportion of its budget into schools than the Vale.I welcome the Welsh Government review into the local authority funding formula. The wider review should provide an updated picture.However that in itself does not mean that there will be more money flowing into school budgets in the Vale.That still comes back to choices about how much money we are prepared to invest in our public services rather than a competition between public services that each of us value. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He shook my hand, and showed me some of the facilities.I was shown how the ldquoMagic Carpet works, an interactive board on the floor. It lit up with a flower pattern, that moved and shimmered when stood on.I was then invited to the soft play room, where Elias flung himself over the equipment, scampering above me and the assistant. He grinned for the camera.Ysgol Y Deri particularly shines in the creative approaches it takes to putting its students first.In the big school I was shown to ldquoThe Holodeck, a Star-Trek-esque room filled with projectors and touchscreen sensitive walls.There was a French quiz projected across the walls, and the students jumped around the room selecting the correct words.The sensory experience was not only impressively creative, but vital to some studentsrsquo learning.The school has many similar rooms built to offer a multi-disciplinary team approach to the youngsters and offer a fully holistic experience.They have a large team of therapists on site, including nurses, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, music therapists and play therapists.They also offer a huge range of interventions, designed to put their pupilsrsquo happiness and education at the forefront.They offer yoga, mindfulness lessons, climbing, gardening, wood work, pet therapy, rebound therapy and hydrotherapy, as just a small example. Timetables are crafted to suit inidualsrsquo needs, as some pupils respond better than others to certain lessons.I was shown to a classroom where a group of seven students worked on their laptops.These students were proud of their work and excited to talk about maths.We were then ushered through as a group for a photo with next doorrsquos class, a group with physical disabilities.The students waited patiently as overhead cranes helped those who could not walk into position.Everyone smiled. Thumbs and peace signs were flashed.Afterwards, a Learning Support Assistant tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me to take a photo of Caitlyn.I pointed the camera at her, and Caitlinrsquos smile immediately reached her ears.Maxine, a fellow student, told me how proud her family were of her and her work.The happiness of every one of the pupils is palpable, filling every area of the school, as does the pride of the teachers.ldquoWe have our pupils come back in every now and then, said Stacey Long, the schoolrsquos transition officer.She helps pupils move on from the school and into adult le.ldquoThey always tell me how much the school meant to them, how helpful it was in getting a job.ldquoWe try hard to get pupils ready for adult le where we can.ldquoWe have a coffee shop on campus where several students get plenty of work experience.The curriculum covers both the national curriculum as well as general le skills.One interactive quiz I was shown could be rapidly switched from a lesson on the Great Fire of London, to a quiz on which materials go in which recycle bin.There are plenty of extra-curricular activities on offer too, including choir and youth club and regular trips outside of school.I was given a glimpse into a gym, along with a music recording room with plenty of recording equipment, and the school radio room.Outside, pupils are given a huge playground with an outdoor classroom, space to play sport, a climbing wall and little walled off sections for each of the primary classes.Developer Barratt Homes was also on the site, building a sensory garden for students to enjoy.Last week a group of pupils of ying abilities went on a trip to Paris, where they were involved with ious Comenius [European Union education] projects and forged links with numerous schools in other European countries. Several pupils couldnrsquot wait to tell me about it, showing off photos.Chris Britten, the head teacher of Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoWe work with every child. They are all dferent and we treat every one as an inidual. We meet their needs so they can flourish, both in school and after they leave. He is immensely proud of his staff and pupils.Itrsquos easy to see why. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Members of local chapels and churches processed from the Twyn through Dinas Powys passed Tesco at Nica, ending at Bethesda Chapel.Fish and chips sustained around  walkers by the end of the evening.Rev Jon Davis of the Baptist Church and the Revs Carole and Phil Challis of the Methodists led the service with the first hymn, Light of the World. The reading of Markrsquos gospel was by David Cocks.At Nica the hymn lsquoHere is love, vast as the oceanrsquo was sung.The next reading was given by Ciara McAlpine. Finally at Tesco the hymn lsquoWhen I survey the wondrous crossrsquo was sung, with Sarah Long reading.Matt Lewis of Bethesda commissioned the new cross and led the short service at Bethesda.Many thanks go to Councillor John Fanshaw for the loan of the excellent PA system. Everyone was kept safe by the traffic marshal Brian West.The Friends of Belle Vue Park held an Easter celebration of their own.They said: ldquoWe had a fantastic time with crafts, games, seed planting and selfies.ldquoThere were so many amazing Easter hat designs, it was hard to choose!ldquoThanks to all the hard-working volunteers who made the event possibleAs well as events held by churches and chapels, Easter egg hunts were a recurring theme for many venues.Cosmeston Lakes hosted their own hunt over the course of the weekend, inviting people to try their luck at solving clues for prizes.Llantwit Major Surf Lesaving Club held an Easter egg hunt on Easter Monday, with face painting, name the bunny, refreshments and hot drinks.St Fagans National Museum of History held their own ldquoBig Museum Easter Trail, asking visitors to solve clues and follow the trail around the museum infor an ldquoegg-citing prize. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They havenrsquot had any unpleasant encounters.ldquoBut itrsquos inevitable as a person of colour, whether they see something on the news or it happens in a social environment.ldquoBefore it gets to that point they should consciously or subconsciously have enough references to their own self worth in media, be it movies, books, or cartoons to handle it.Mr Banda was spurred into writing by a comment made by Tancho after school. ldquoI donrsquot knowit was a book or a lesson, but Tancho made a very generalised comment ndash he said they have no water in African homes so they have to walk really far.ldquoI told him: lsquoYou know Africa is not a country right  They all have their own experiences the same way Europe is made up of a lot of dferent countries.ldquoIt worried me. Especially being Cameroonian, living in a culture that isnrsquot mine, and with my kids growing up between two heritages.ldquoI didnrsquot want them looking down on one half of their heritage. I wanted to pay them a fuller narrative.No major publishers have picked up the books yet. ldquoI was disheartened early on in the process. One publisher advertised themselves as being very inclusive.ldquoI reached out to them but was disappointed by their feedback ndash all they said was a childrenrsquos book is  pages long. It felt like you can only be a BME authoryou conform to these standards. Really,yoursquore trying to promote ersity in publishing you should look outside the box!The books use the personal experiences of the boys as inspiration. ldquoTwo years ago we travelled around Europe. We found a caravan and went exploring, and the books have been inspired by our adventures ndash the first being Charlie the Fearless and Tancho the Brave.ldquoTheyrsquore all about courage, and being brave enough to admit when something scares you. They focus on looking out for one other, and how love makes you brave.ldquoA Place to Call Home deals with the anxiety of moving, and the unknown, as we travelled and settled in Penarth.ldquoTheyrsquore about making the best of situations ndash there are little anecdotes in every story, like the time we broke down in north France. It was the boysrsquo optimism that helped us through situations like that and I wanted to reflect that.The books are carried in Grfin Books on Windsor Street, Penarth on Amazon. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The officer issued an appeal for the owner, or anyone who could identy the owner to come forward: “Animals die, they get sick or old, that’s normal, however there appears to have been an attempt to bury this in a shallow grave. It’s all a bit odd. What you can see here is roughly five feetworth of snake, with plenty more buried. “If you’re the owner of said snake, or have any idea who may be, please get in touch.

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tont_1.jpg","title":"next  cde global","story":"Posted on Friday April  by Ulster Business For the last  years, Co Tyrone-headquartered CDE Global has designed and installed almost , turnkey wet processing solutions across the world.The business, based in Cookstown and headed by founder Tony Convery, has seen its turnover soar to just shy of £m – rising by more than £m in the space of just  months.

The egg processing business includes big names such as Marks and Spencer and McDonald’s among its customers.Frylite, which started le when Eamon McCay opened a cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises, has seen its turnover increase to £m, with pre-tax profits sitting at £.m. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff.And helping highlight the firms which are still based in Northern Ireland and retain ownership here, accountancy firm Harbinson Mulholland hosted its inaugural HM Homegrown event in Belfast.Showcasing the top  SMEs here, it highlighted that Northern Ireland boasts more homegrown businesses per head of population than Wales, Scotland and all regions across the north of England.And almost % of them operate in just three sectors – manufacturing, construction and wholesale retail. Of the list,  are based in Co Antrim,  in Co Down, nine in Co Tyrone, eight in Armagh and one each in Co Londonderry and Fermanagh.The firms earned just over £m in operating profit in their last reporting year on a turnover of £.bn, while almost £m in wages and salaries was paid out to , employees.  out of the  businesses are family-controlled.Professor Mark Durkin, executive dean of Ulster University Business School, which carried out the research, says the economic impact of the  companies “is considerable generating as they do £.bn in revenues and wages of almost £m”.“These companies act as key enablers of Northern Ireland’s entrepreneurial ecosystem, an ecosystem that Ulster University Business School is proud to be part of. The results of this research demonstrate that just because businesses are local in origin does not imply, they are not global in ambition that because they are from traditional sectors does not mean they are not modern in outlook. Indeed, local homegrown businesses have a sense of place and origin that can really create competitive advantage.“Northern Ireland has demonstrated its ability to sell its agri-food, manufacturing and construction products and services overseas, but internationally successful companies tend not to emerge in isolation. “Domestic competition drives innovation, efficiency and productivity improvements, which in turn develop businesses which can take on any competitor across the world. As a result, there is merit in Government identying the most appropriate ways to support the continued growth of successful clusters to help power the economy into the future.”And Darren McDowell, senior partner of Harbinson Mullholland said that homegrown businesses were the backbone of the practice’s client base.“The Top  list underlines the vibrancy of this group of companies and the spending power they give to local communities through employment.“Attention is often focused on other sectors, but this research demonstrates the continued importance of traditional businesses and industries to the local economy and the extent to which they can be successful.”There’s also a raft of multi-generational businesses here, which have kept both ownership and controlOne of those is food giant Henderson. It’s now in its fourth generation of the Agnew family, and is undergoing further expansion at its Mallusk headquarters. But while it’s very much a family affair, the company is now the sixth largest Northern Ireland business, according to last year’s Ulster Business Top  – with turnover of £m.Martin Agnew told Ulster Business: “It’s important for us as a family to continue to run our business with the same values on which Henderson Group was established by my great-grandfather, John Henderson. We’re also proud that we have built a sustainable business which continues to proactively develop and expand, and provides employment for over , people in Northern Ireland.”    More than  years ago, John Henderson set up a stall selling butter, eggs and cheese – he was a well-known figure and frequently was a judge of cheese and butter at the annual Balmoral Show.That subsequently progressed into a stall at St George’s Market in Belfast, and then in , the business was incorporated as a limited company.In , William Agnew married John Henderson’s daughter, and in  William joined the company as a salesman, taking a controlling interest when John Henderson retired three years later. A few years later in  John Henderson, founder of the company died at the age of .Now, the company owns a range of brands – notably SPAR and Vivo – and has spent millions in the last few years expanding its operations.Operating out of its head office in Mallusk, it employs , people across Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/ppb.jpg","title":"powered by talent making return to belfast","story":"Posted on Friday  April  by Ulster Business A host of top speakers will descend on Belfast in May for the second Powered by Talent event.The full day event – taking place at ICC Belfast on May  – has been signicantly expanded this year and will accommodate in excess of  attendees, making it the largest talent-focused conference on the island of Ireland and one of the highest profile events in the UK.Justin Rush, founding member of Powered By Talent and director of Abacus Talent Group, says: “Talent attraction and retention remains one of the biggest challenges businesses face.

Close to a thirdsaid their employer was less committed to achieving gender equality, with womenmore likely to believe there was a need for improvement, versus % of men. Only % of all respondents said their employer was committed to achieving gender equality, with men overwhelmingbelieving this to be the case versus % of women. There’s clearly still a long way to go.Most business leaders are well aware of the merit of employing a erse workforce. Diversity in areas including age, employee background, gender and religion affirms a message of inclusivity within the organisation and to a wider external audience, creating a strong position andHiring methods are an integral element of increasing ersity among employees, and CVs are one of the many ways in which the process can be improved. Many organisations will judge candidates based on their most recent job listing, potentially overlooking talented and competent applicants without a steady course of uninterrupted career progression. This can particularly disadvantage many women in professional sectors who have prioritised childcare at points throughout their career.Whether you believe it or not, we all have unconscious bias built in to our responses to others. So,you could eliminate those biases from the process, would you do so More and more organisations, including many here in Northern Ireland, now recruit based on blind CVs, where information such as age, race and gender is removed to prevent subconscious biases from influencing hiring decisions.Using competency-based application processes assesses essential soft skills such as communication, emotional intelligence, problem solving and self-motivation, rather than testing specic knowledge, which can be learned more quickly than soft skills. The absence of a CV can change the way you prepare questions and open interviews up to discussions that wouldn’t otherwise take place.Favouring competency-based applications or requiring blind CVs is a sign your organisation is taking steps to fairly assess candidates based on their skills and experience. These methods of talent-based hiring also demonstrate a commitment to overcoming the perceived disadvantage of career breaks which will positively contribute to erse representation across all sectors.The practice of blind hiring is not without its shortcomings. For instance a candidate’s personal information can only be withheld during the initial screening process. Once a line manager conducts a one-to-one interview there is no way to suppress a candidate’s gender, ethnicity or age. While applying the principle may result in a wider pool of first-round interviewees employers subsequently be faced with the same ersity challenges, for example, seeking graduates with a first class honours or a high :.At Hays we have trialled blind recruitment at assessment centres for a number internal of appointments. The absence of a CV opened up a depth of enquiry and supporting examples from interviewees where the receipt of a CV might not have encouraged the same level of enquiry and open-mindedness.Demand for transparency around targets and performance is also at an all-time high. So,your organisation is transparent in their ersity reporting, it proves their willingness to make a public commitment to achieving a fairly recruited workforce and makes them accountable for measuring and reporting their progress.  You’ll undoubtedly make some excellent new hires that you may not have appointedyou maintained your traditional processes.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/stats_r1.jpg","title":"statsports takes on premier leagues alex oxlade chamberlain and raheem sterling","story":"Posted on Thursday  April  by Ulster Business Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and chief global strategist Jarlath Quinn Newry firm STATSports have taken on board Premier League players Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Raheem Sterling as signicant investors as well as global ambassadors for the burgeoning tech firm.

The struggling chain has entered into a company voluntary arrangement . It follows a pre-pack administration for the high street business. Five Northern Ireland Debenhams stores are continuing to trade, but it has confirmed  other stores will shut, outside Northern Ireland. It’s thought more than , jobs could be at risk. Debenhams is the anchor tenant at five shopping centres in Northern Ireland, including Newry’s Quays Shopping Centre, Ballymena’s Fairhill, Belfast’s CastleCourt, Craigavon’s Rushmere and Londonderry’s Foyleside. The firm’s earlier administration angered shareholder Mike Ashley, owner of Sports Direct, who has called for the process to be reversed. The administration wipes out the stakes held by Sports Direct and all other shareholders. The stores that are due to close are: Altrincham, Ashford, Birmingham Fort, Canterbury, Chatham, Eastbourne, Folkestone, Great Yarmouth, Guildford, Kirkcaldy, Orpington, Slough, Southport, Southsea, Staines, Stockton, Walton, Wandsworth, Welwyn Garden City, Wimbledon, Witney, Wolverhampton. Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, director Aodhán Connolly, says \"rising costs, a sluggish economy, and changing shopping habits are making le incredibly hard for the industry\". \"Those pressures are being exacerbated by ever-increasing public policy costs which are making it more expensive to employ workers and operate from physical premises. These factors will lead to a very dferent retail industry over the next few years. \"The challenges department stores face are a microcosm of the immense changes affecting the retail industry. As more consumers shop on-line, there is a challenge to encourage shoppers into stores, and then to get them to spend when they are there. One of the big trends we are seeing is retailers innovating to try and create a number of reasons for customers to visit the store. That can be through offering food and drink, dferent services, and by investing in customer service. The big advantage a physical retailer has is those trained helpful colleagues who can provide detailed guidance on products to help customers. \"It’s notable those retailers who have invested in evolving from purely physical retail to a multi-channel offering are those who are in the strongest position. Many of the larger stores are particularly affected by government policy which has consistently made operating from property more expensive.
