Ms McNamara\u0027s mother Kylie and sister Lauren were on their way to Greece when the grim discovery was made. They are expected to bring her body back to Australia on Tuesday          Just 24 hours before she died, Ms McNamara was partying with crew members at Baroque bar (pictured) in the seaside town of Argostoli.

They were having a good time.\u0027They left at 7.30pm but some of them, including the girl who died, came back again at 1am. The last time I saw her she had got up on one of the chairs and was dancing.\u0027She must have only been here for no more than 30 minutes the second time and then she left.\u0027Some of her friends stayed until the bar shut at 3am.\u0027Ms McNamara had been working on-board the six-storey superyacht since May this year.

The company was founded by track-and-field coach Bill Bowerman and a middle-distance runner Phil Knight, from Portland.Business Insider reported that while Knight had planned to call the company Dimension 6, the name Nike was thought of by their first employee Jeff Johnson and comes from the Greek goddess of victory\u0027s name. 1971 was also the year that Bowerman had his first eureka moment while he was making waffles with his wife. Seeing the waffle iron sparked an idea for grooved patterns on the sole of trainers to help athletes grip the tracks while running and it was referred to as the Nike Waffle Trainer, patented in 1974.In addition to this, the iconic Nike swoosh logo was designed by Portland State student Carolyn Davidson for just $35, more than $200 in today’s currency, but she was later given stock that is now worth over $640,000.The Just Do It slogan was inspired by serial killer Gary Gilmore who had said ‘let’s do it’ before he was executed in 1977 by a firing squad. 11 years later, the first Just Do It campaign was launched, featuring Walt Stack, an 80-year-old runner.Nike was also the first company to use a Beatles song  in a TV commercial, their track Revolution featuring in the sporting giant’s 1987 ad for the Air Max shoes.            Colin Kaepernick kneels during the national anthem before an NFL game against the SeahawksNike adAs reported by Time, many have wondered how much Kaepernick’s deal with Nike could be worth, with some sports agents claiming it could be  millions of dollars a year, which would be a unique development considering he does not currently play for a team in the NFL.The Nike ad features the former player with a caption reading: ‘Believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything. #JustDoIt.’ Despite having signed Colin in 2011, Nike had not used him in over two years and the company agreed to an eight-year extension of the deal with the league in March.Gino Fisanotti, Nike’s Vice President of Brand for North America said: \u0027We believe Colin is one of the most inspirational athletes of this generation. We wanted to energize its meaning and introduce Just Do It to a new generation of athletes,’ adding  the campaign was aimed at those who were between 15 and 17.The full advert, which features Kaepernick for 20 seconds, concludes with the quarterback saying: \u0027So don\u0027t just ask if your dreams are crazy, ask if they\u0027re crazy enough.\u0027 The caption at the end flashes: \u0027It\u0027s only crazy until you do it. Just do it.\u0027Nike boycottAfter the Nike advert was released, protesters on social media called for people to burn their Nike sneakers and boycott the retailer after choosing Kaepernick for its signature Just Do It campaign, with shares in the company initially plummeting.In addition to a number of social media users, actor James Woods joined the many who criticised Nike on Twitter, tweeting that he emailed his wealth manager asking him to sell all of his  shares.\u0027Please est my portfolio of all Nike stock in my personal account in and the plan. Henceforth never buy Nike stock for me again.\u0027 He followed up by tweeting out a meme mocking the Nike slogan, saying, \u0027Nike: Just Sold It.\u0027Nike stockDespite Nike stock having an uptick now, after the company released their 30th anniversary Just Do It campaign featuring Colin Kaepernick, shares fell by two percent to $79.01 but have since recovered to $81.13 per share as of approximately 11:26am EST on Friday, September 7.According to CNBC calculations, if one invested $1,000 in 2008, it would now be worth $6,131.47.While it is not clear whether Kaepernick’s inclusion in the advert would affect Nike’s stock in the long term, Managing Director of GlobalData Retail, said: ‘While Nike has been doing relatively well in a sports market that is under pressure, it cannot afford to make bad decisions.‘Anything which has the potential to damage market share, such as overtly political campaigns, should be avoided.’ However, Host of Mad Money Jim Cramer, pointed out that ‘if people think Colin Kaepernick is cool,’ then ‘it’s a win for Nike.’It is estimated that Nike generated $43 million in free advertising through media coverage when the campaign collaboration with Kaepernick was first revealed at the start of the week, despite the backlash.Nike worthAccording to Statista, Nike’s global net income in 2018 amounted to $1.9 billion, which is a significant drop from $4.2 billion last year and what seemed to be a steady growth from 2009 onwards.Forbes reported that Nike was the world\u0027s leading athletic apparel maker and has a brand value of $15.9 billion. In addition to this, it increased its revenue to $24 billion from $16 billion in five years.Nike\u0027s share of the footwear market rose from 14 per cent to 19 per cent during the same period and expanded its presence in international football, as well as professional and college sports.  Prince Harry has worn the same bracelet for 20 years and this is whyFortnite Monopoly: When is it released and how is it different from the traditional board game?Who is Joe Rogan?

It has a very Mediterranean feel.’The location, close to Newmarket’s centre and racing community, is another reason why it suited her. ‘I’ve lived in Newmarket a long time and love it here,’ she explains.The property, once the stables and gatehouse for the Zetland Lodge estate, dates from 1850 and has four connecting buildings around a big central courtyard. In addition to nine bedrooms, it boasts a cinema room, large indoor pool, sauna and gym, plus a six-car garage and two-bed staff cottage.Following her orce from professional jockey Jamie Spencer, The Courtyard seemed the perfect place for Emma, 40, and her three children, Charlie, 12, Chloe, 11, and Ella, nine. ‘I was wowed by the space. It’s a large house but it’s always felt comfortable. The pool and cinema were a novelty at first, but now are mainly used when the kids’ friends visit.’Though Emma has lived here for seven years, she only recently got around to redecorating. Rooms are furnished in neutral colours. ‘A lot of the house and furniture was very dark and I like things simple and clean. This is a very light house, with about 100 windows.’          Emma is leaving The Courtyard (above) in Newmarket after seven years. The property, once the stables and gatehouse for the Zetland Lodge estate, dates from 1850 and has four connecting buildings around a big central courtyard          In addition to nine bedrooms, it boasts a cinema room, large indoor pool, sauna and gym, plus a six-car garage and two-bed staff cottage.

This year there was a £1 billion idend bonanza.The largest single payment was £180.6 million by United Utilities in early August, first revealed by this newspaper in July. The company also paid shareholders – which include American investment giant BlackRock – £90.3 million in February. INVESTMENT EXTRA: Small is beautiful for Fundsmith founder...MIDAS SHARE TIPS: Should you invest in the PCF Group - a...The high street gears up for the \u0027toughest Christmas period...Chief at the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s favourite dressmaker...Share this articleThe £180.6 million idend proved controversial as it came just two days before a proposed hosepipe ban was set to be introduced across the North West of England. The company eventually decided against imposing the ban.On Tuesday, Pennon, which owns South West Water, paid shareholders £112 million, following a £50 million payout in April. Severn Trent, the other main listed water company, handed out £123 million in July and £82 million in January.Thames Water decided to suspend idend payments and halted bonuses for bosses this year after Ofwat criticised it for failing to tackle leaks.Last week, companies submitted to the regulator their plans for customer charges between 2020 and 2025. Ofwat will publish its initial assessments of the proposals in January with its final decisions due in December 2019.United Utilities and Severn Trent said they would cut bills by 10.5 per cent and 5 per cent respectively over the period in real terms. Thames Water said it would keep bills flat but invest £11.7 billion in upgrading infrastructure, which will help to reduce leaks.Pennon suggested giving away shares to its 800,000 customers but critics pointed out that these would be worth an average of just £25 per household.Professor David Hall, a water industry expert at the University of Greenwich, is sceptical about whether the industry review will result in significant cuts to customer bills.\u0027Unless the system is torn up and is recreated – which Ofwat itself can\u0027t do – it\u0027s hard to see any significant changes,\u0027 Hall said.\u0027These companies continue to pay out high levels of idends. In fact, some of them have made a point of reassuring their shareholders that they promise they will continue paying idends at this kind of level.\u0027 Fees back in tradesFees back in tradesGood for big potsTools and fund ideas\u0026gt Compare the best investing platform for you"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/08/17/4FE2949D00000578-6146357-image-a-35_1536425642383.jpg","title":"From Game Thrones country Loch Ness 50 best British drives","story":"    High points: The soaring chalk cliffs of Tennyson Down on the Isle of WightSOUTH-EAST ENGLAND           1 The Thames Valley: Windsor to OxfordBest for: Dreaming spires and Royal-watchers.Distance: 55 milesWhat to expect: From the world’s largest working castle to the historic university city, you’ll follow smaller roads through the leafy valley of the River Thames.Route: Leave M25 at J13, and take A308 and B470 to Windsor and Eton.

Friends of Ms Symonds say she felt she had been penalised for her links to ‘Team Boris’.Tory HQ sources deny that her departure was anything to do with Mr Johnson, saying she left as part of a shake-up by Party Chairman Brandon Lewis designed to put the Conservatives on a war footing for the next General Election.          My Symonds stood down as chief of communications at Tory Campaign Headquarters after last year’s disastrous Election          Tory Party sources said Ms Symonds\u0027 departure from Conservative headquarters had nothing to do with her relationship with Mr JohnsonMs Symonds has often written positive comments about Mr Johnson on Twitter, last year posting a link to a speech of his with the comment: ‘This is really worth watching. Boris absolutely brilliant in debate on Brexit and Foreign Policy earlier this week.’ And on Valentine’s Day this year she tweeted dozens of extracts from a speech he gave to a think-tank.It was reported yesterday that Mr Johnson had been seen walking into Rules in Covent Garden, London’s oldest restaurant, on that day with a ‘young attractive’ blonde woman, then spending two hours at a corner table while a pair of bodyguards sat nearby.One onlooker said: ‘It seemed quite an intimate meal and hardly anything to do with any great matters of the state. It was quite a strange day to be meeting a young attractive woman for a meal in one of London’s most exclusive restaurants.’          Ms Symonds attended leading private girls’ school Godolphin and Latymer in West LondonThe identity of that woman has not been confirmed.Just one week before the dinner, Ms Symonds and Mr Johnson were photographed together at the Conservatives’ fundraising Black and White Ball in London.It was not until just before Mr Johnson dramatically quit the Cabinet in July that he is believed to have split up with his wife of 25 years, Marina Wheeler. The couple said in a joint statement on Friday: ‘Several months ago, after 25 years of marriage, we decided it was in our best interests to separate.‘We have subsequently agreed to orce and that process is under way. As friends we will continue to support our four children in the years ahead. We will not be commenting further.’          The blonde became a Tory press officer in 2009. She starts a new job with tech firm Bloomerang tomorrow, promoting clean oceansThe couple had been living together in his £20 million grace-and-favour home in Carlton Gardens, the official residence of the Foreign Secretary, until the end of July. They jointly own a £4 million townhouse in Islington, North London, as well as a country home in Oxfordshire.Mrs Wheeler is a successful QC while Mr Johnson has profited from writing several history books as well as his well-paid former jobs as Foreign Secretary and Mayor of London.          Boris and Carrie Symonds giggle as they leave a Tory Black and White Ball in London in FebruaryOne opinion poll yesterday said that Mr Johnson’s marriage split could make it harder for the Tories to win the next Election.

Residents of Pyongyang, North Korea\u0027s capital, trained for months for the anniversary and held up the bouquets to spell out words and slogans that can be seen from the VIP viewing area. Kim attended the Sunday morning military parade in Pyongyang but did not address the assembled crowd, which included the head of the Chinese parliament and high-level delegations from countries that have friendly ties with the North.At the end of the two-hour event he strolled to the edge of the balcony with the Chinese special envoy, Li Zhanshu, the third-ranking member in China\u0027s ruling Communist Party. The two held up their joined hands to symbolize the countries\u0027 traditionally close ties, though the absence of Chinese President Xi Jinping could indicate Beijing still has some reservations about Kim\u0027s initiatives.Senior statesman Kim Yong Nam, the head of North Korea\u0027s parliament, set the relatively softer tone for the event with an opening speech that emphasized the economic goals of the regime, not its nuclear might. He called on the military to be ready to work to help build the economy.After a truncated parade featuring tanks and some of North Korea\u0027s biggest artillery, fewer than the usual number of missiles and lots of goose-stepping units from all branches of the military, the focus switched to civilian groups ranging from nurses to students to construction workers, many with colorful floats beside them.The combining of military and civilian sections is a familiar North Korean parade format.The past two big anniversaries of North Korea\u0027s founding, in 2008 and 2013, did not feature the Korean People\u0027s Army, only the civil defense units, which are officially called \u0027Worker Peasant Red Guards.\u0027At least Kim\u0027s got his back!

Both sides are now insisting on a different starting point. Washington wants Kim to commit to denuclearization first, but Pyongyang wants its security guaranteed and a peace agreement formally ending the Korean War.With tensions once again on the rise, a parade featuring the very missiles that so unnerved Trump last year, and led to a dangerous volley of insults from both leaders, could have been seen as a deliberate provocation. The North also refrained from immediately televising the event, though North Korean media were out in force to film it, deploying booms and - for possibly the first time - drones with cameras.Pyongyang residents unable to attend at the square lined the streets around town to cheer and applaud convoys carrying the troops after they completed the parade duties.

It has a very Mediterranean feel.’The location, close to Newmarket’s centre and racing community, is another reason why it suited her. ‘I’ve lived in Newmarket a long time and love it here,’ she explains.The property, once the stables and gatehouse for the Zetland Lodge estate, dates from 1850 and has four connecting buildings around a big central courtyard. In addition to nine bedrooms, it boasts a cinema room, large indoor pool, sauna and gym, plus a six-car garage and two-bed staff cottage.Following her orce from professional jockey Jamie Spencer, The Courtyard seemed the perfect place for Emma, 40, and her three children, Charlie, 12, Chloe, 11, and Ella, nine. ‘I was wowed by the space. It’s a large house but it’s always felt comfortable. The pool and cinema were a novelty at first, but now are mainly used when the kids’ friends visit.’Though Emma has lived here for seven years, she only recently got around to redecorating. Rooms are furnished in neutral colours. ‘A lot of the house and furniture was very dark and I like things simple and clean. This is a very light house, with about 100 windows.’          Emma is leaving The Courtyard (above) in Newmarket after seven years. The property, once the stables and gatehouse for the Zetland Lodge estate, dates from 1850 and has four connecting buildings around a big central courtyard          In addition to nine bedrooms, it boasts a cinema room, large indoor pool, sauna and gym, plus a six-car garage and two-bed staff cottage.

Hand-painted murals also brighten the decadent main bathroom.‘I spend most of my time in the kitchen and smaller sitting room,’ says Emma. ‘It’s cosier and less formal than the main lounge, which is very large and grand with a big marble fireplace. It’s a great house for entertaining, as there is so much space and people can spill outside.’Having recently got engaged, Emma, who was on Channel 4 Racing from 2001 to 2016, is selling up to move in with her fiance at his home in Berkshire.Though still involved with racing in various ambassadorial roles, she is about to embark on a career in PR and marketing. ‘It’s time for a new chapter,’ she says.  More homes that started out as stablesNorfolk, £325,000           Bedrooms: 4 Unique features: Stable conversion in the village of West Bilney, near King’s Lynn attractive stone construction with arched doorway to walled back courtyard garden parking for four cars views of fields.

Friends of Ms Symonds say she felt she had been penalised for her links to ‘Team Boris’.Tory HQ sources deny that her departure was anything to do with Mr Johnson, saying she left as part of a shake-up by Party Chairman Brandon Lewis designed to put the Conservatives on a war footing for the next General Election.

She may even be quite relieved.’Leading Eurosceptic Jacob Rees-Mogg said the news of Mr Johnson’s marital separation was ‘obviously very sad news for him personally and for Marina’, but added: ‘I don’t think it makes any difference to the fine regard and admiration people in the Conservative party hold him in.’"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/05/14/49AE04A700000578-0-image-m-23_1522934606645.jpg","title":"Sandi Toksvig gets 60 Stephen Fry hosting BBC quiz QI","story":"    QI presenter Sandi Toksvig has revealed she is paid less than half of Stephen Fry’s feeJANET STREET-PORTER: Have I got news for you, ladies - if...Great British Bake Off goes VEGAN for ‘snowflake’...Share this articleFry presented QI for 13 years before Toksvig took over in 2016.

The two held up their joined hands to symbolize the countries\u0027 traditionally close ties, though the absence of Chinese President Xi Jinping could indicate Beijing still has some reservations about Kim\u0027s initiatives.Senior statesman Kim Yong Nam, the head of North Korea\u0027s parliament, set the relatively softer tone for the event with an opening speech that emphasized the economic goals of the regime, not its nuclear might. He called on the military to be ready to work to help build the economy.After a truncated parade featuring tanks and some of North Korea\u0027s biggest artillery, fewer than the usual number of missiles and lots of goose-stepping units from all branches of the military, the focus switched to civilian groups ranging from nurses to students to construction workers, many with colorful floats beside them.The combining of military and civilian sections is a familiar North Korean parade format.The past two big anniversaries of North Korea\u0027s founding, in 2008 and 2013, did not feature the Korean People\u0027s Army, only the civil defense units, which are officially called \u0027Worker Peasant Red Guards.\u0027At least Kim\u0027s got his back!

Both sides are now insisting on a different starting point. Washington wants Kim to commit to denuclearization first, but Pyongyang wants its security guaranteed and a peace agreement formally ending the Korean War.With tensions once again on the rise, a parade featuring the very missiles that so unnerved Trump last year, and led to a dangerous volley of insults from both leaders, could have been seen as a deliberate provocation. The North also refrained from immediately televising the event, though North Korean media were out in force to film it, deploying booms and - for possibly the first time - drones with cameras.Pyongyang residents unable to attend at the square lined the streets around town to cheer and applaud convoys carrying the troops after they completed the parade duties.

The larvae then proceed to feed on the leaves to produce a \u0027zigzag\u0027 pattern similar to the \u0027mark of zorro\u0027He blamed Britain\u0027s poor defences for the bugs entry into the country and added that the sawfly\u0027s eggs may have been either imported with an otherwise healthy elm or latched on to another tree species.The zigzag sawfly is also known to be a quick breeder and can reproduce asexually, which means populations can rise dramatically as females don’t have to find a mateMr Elliot told The Telegraph: \u0027You only need one female to arrive and you are off.\u0027 "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/09/14/4FEE099500000578-0-image-m-58_1536501436432.jpg","title":"Unions heap pressure Corbyn second Brexit referendum","story":"    TUC chief Frances O\u0027Grady (pictured on the BBC\u0027s Andrew Marr show today) said a fresh national ballot would be needed unless there was a deal that benefited \u0027working people\u0027Instead Mr Corbyn and other senior figures merely say the option of another vote should be kept on the table.   Theresa May has flatly ruled out holding a second referendum, and critics point out there is no time to do so before the Article 50 Brexit process is due to come to an end in March.  Speaking on BBC TV\u0027s Andrew Marr Show as the TUC congress gets under way in Manchester today, Ms O\u0027Grady said unions would never negotiate a deal and not consult members on the outcome. She said time was running out to avoid \u0027crashing out\u0027 of the EU.\u0027That would be an absolute disaster for the people we represent.

In this extract from his new memoir he reveals why slapping the strings till his fingers bled was worth it• Mark Kermode: ‘There’s magic in going onstage with a band’Hello. My name is Mark Kermode. I play skiffle. And I am not ashamed.” According to the BBC’s website, that statement was one of “eight moments that defined the Folk awards 2017”. The glitzy ceremony had been staged at London’s Royal Albert Hall and featured performances by such notaries as Billy Bragg, Al Stewart, Ry Cooder and Shirley Collins. I knew Billy was a hardcore skiffle devotee, but I’d been more surprised to hear Al Stewart announce “I love skiffle!” while receiving his lifetime achievement award. Suddenly, it seemed, everyone was jumping on the skiffle bandwagon, although some of us had been aboard longer than others.Like so many people, I started playing skiffle by accident. At the age of about seven or eight, long before I started trying to build my own electric guitar, my brother Jonny and I formed a skiffle band in our back garden in Finchley. Since Jonny is a couple of years younger than me, it’s probably fair to assume that the whole thing was my idea and he just got corralled into cooperating. But that’s not how I remember it. In my mind, we both simultaneously decided to stop messing around with bikes and Action Men and do something more expressive, more creative. Like forming a band.It wasn’t a “band” in the traditional sense – we didn’t have any musical instruments and, even if we did, neither of us would have been able to play them. Instead, we got an old trestle table out of the garage at the end of the garden and covered it in kitchen implements (pans, colanders, metal draining racks etc) which made a loud noise when struck with a wooden spoon.If you’d asked us what we were playing, we wouldn’t have known it was called skiffle. All we knew was that it was a joyous racket and that all our “instruments” would have to be returned to the kitchen before we could have our tea. Inspired by American jug-bands, who would use bath-tubs, cooking jars and washboards to conjure up raucous jazz and blues, skiffle was a forerunner of rock’n’roll with a wonderfully inclusive DIY ethos. Crucially, no matter how talented the musicians were, the underlying message was: anyone can play these songs and you don’t need proper training or fancy instruments to do so. All of which made it the perfect medium for two under-10s from Finchley to spread their fledgling rock wings.It was at the Edinburgh festival in the mid-80s that I really got the skiffle bug. At university in Manchester, having grown tired of playing guitar in noisy rock bands and performing unfunny standup musical comedy – I’d started to redirect my energies towards theatre. Most of the cool people I knew were either drama students or people who wished they were drama students. I fell into the latter category.Having no discernible talent as an actor, I had somehow managed to reinvent myself as a “musical director” – this despite the fact that I could neither read music nor direct, let alone do both at the same time. I had convinced myself that my future lay in theatre and even started wearing a hat (a battered old brown trilby) on the basis that it felt… theatrical. (I have always been a bit of an arse.)This brought me to The Death of Joe Hill, a prize-winning student play by upcoming Liverpudlian writer John Fay. Based on the life of the “Wobbly” activist and songwriter, The Death of Joe Hill had loads of musical numbers like The Preacher and the Slave and Casey Jones, all of which could be knocked out on an acoustic guitar which I played from the side of the stage – still wearing the hat. When the play went to the Edinburgh fringe, it was described by one reviewer – disparagingly, I think – as having an “off the back of a lorry” flavour.At some point in the middle of the Joe Hill run, I met Alison Armstrong-Lee. Introduced to me as “the Queen of the Washboard”, Al, who was from Belfast, had taught herself to make a fantastic din with nothing more than a portable domestic appliance, some gardening sticks and a rubber band. She brandished her washboard as if it were a weapon, exuding rocking confidence as she bashed her way through any song you wanted to play. Al had been trying to put a band together with a singer and guitarist I knew from Manchester called Matt O’Casey who owned a battered Martin acoustic that had once been played by BB King.Together with two of the actors from Joe Hill (Olly Fox, who played clarinet and John Preston, a trumpet player), I had spent several afternoons in Edinburgh trying to drum up support for the show by playing songs on the pavements around town. We soon decided it would be better to do the same thing in support of our own pockets as proper buskers. So we teamed up with Al and Matt, figured out five songs that we could busk our way through, and took to the streets.The results were impressive. Although our first set was necessarily short, we managed to make about 10 quid in loose change. By the time we had to pack up and head for the theatre to do the evening performance of Joe Hill, we’d made around 40 quid. There was a problem, however. In the course of the afternoon, I had broken every single string on the acoustic guitar I was using.This was to prove an ongoing issue. Having never been a light-handed player, my tendency to hit “all the strings all the time” was only worsened by the demands of playing outdoors. Somehow I had got it into my head that simply hitting the strings harder would make them louder. In fact, the volume of a guitar is defined by the resonance of the instrument rather than the force with which the player attacks the strings. You have to pluck, strum and generally fondle the notes out of the guitar, something which requires a level of musical skill which I lacked then and still lack today.It wasn’t until we were back in Manchester and regularly losing money, thanks to my ability to break strings as fast as I could put them on the guitar, that we started to think I was probably playing the wrong instrument. While busking in Edinburgh, we’d seen a rockabilly band draw a huge crowd largely by virtue of the fact that they had a double bass. The instrument sounded fine, but it was how it looked that was most impressive. Even when you couldn’t hear it, the sight of the bassist spinning his instrument around and merrily running up the side of it was eye-catching enough to make the crowd part with their loose change. Moreover, it was clear that the strings on the bass were big and thick and bruising – hardly the kind of thing that I could break. So, one Saturday morning, Matt and I purchased a knackered plywood bass for about £50, which we then took straight out to Manchester’s St Anne’s Square for a road test.It didn’t seem to matter that I had never played a double bass in my life – people literally started putting money in the hat as soon as we got there, clearly impressed that someone had bothered to lug such an impractically unwieldy instrument out on to the street in the first place. Over the next few years, I would get used to the string of witticisms (“You’ve been over-feeding that violin!” “Bet you wish you’d taken up the harmonica!”) which people feel positively compelled to utter when faced with someone carrying a bull fiddle. But that same compulsion also seemed to ensure that they wouldn’t walk by without chucking a few coins in your direction.The first day we busked in Manchester with the double bass, we broke £100. Part of the key to our financial success was having a “bottler” – someone who would walk around the crowd with a hat while the band were playing, ensuring that no pocket went unemptied. Legend has it that the word “bottler” came from a tradition whereby someone would go from table to table in pubs collecting money for the musicians, with a hat in one hand and a bottle in the other. In the bottle was a fly, which the bottler would keep trapped with his thumb. If they took their thumb off the bottle (in order to reach into the hat and steal some of the money), the fly would escape and they would be undone. It’s a fanciful story but one we enjoyed telling when explaining the origin of our band name, the Railtown Bottlers.Injuries were always a big part of busking. The first day that I played the double bass in Manchester, I split the ends of the fingers on my right hand and proceeded to bleed all over the instrument – something which seemed to impress the crowd mightily. For a while I tried playing while wearing gardening gloves.By the time we got to Edinburgh the next summer, I had got into the habit of rubbing surgical spirit into my hands and binding my fingers with Micropore surgical tape. None of this impressed the bassist of the rockabilly band whom we had seen busking there the year before, and who turned up one afternoon to watch us play with an air of great disdain. At the end of the set, as I attempted to clean and rebandage my bleeding hands before we started again, he came up to me and said five words which would become a band mantra.“Um, you mean can I play slap bass?”“Aye,” he said, his grin turning to derisive laughter. “Slap it, pal. Ye kin slap it, no?”I felt at once crestfallen and deeply ashamed. For all the blood and bruises, he had seen right through me. The truth was that I could “no” slap it.According to one popular folk tale, the art of “slapping it” was invented by Bill Johnson of the Original Creole Ragtime Band who broke his bow in Shreveport, Louisiana in 1911 but carried on banging away with just his hand – and really liked the resulting sound. By snapping the strings of the bass against the fingerboard and then smacking the wood with the open hand, you can effectively mimic the sound of a snare and bass drum with the added bonus of a loud bass note. It’s not pretty, but it is effective.It’s also impossible to do until someone shows you how to do it – and up until this point I hadn’t met anyone with that particular skill set. “Can you show me?” I asked, less in hope than fear. “Kin I show ye?” he replied. Then, grabbing the bass out of my bloody hands, he spun it round towards him and proceeded to slap the hell out of it, producing runs, triplets and mind-bending paradiddles with his right hand with an effortless ease that made me shiver with envy. The sound was astonishing, as if he’d suddenly been joined by a drummer who was even now hiding within the body of the bass. It was like watching a magic trick, and I was utterly mesmerised. “How do you do that?” I asked, genuinely baffled. “S’easy!” he said.He was lying. It wasn’t easy. In fact, it was very hard and very painful. At one point, while learning to slap, I pulled a flap of skin off the end of my middle finger that was so sizeable I thought I might have to go to hospital. In the end, I reattached it with superglue. Later on, I briefly lost the feeling in my right hand and had to gaffer tape a fork to my palm so that I could eat. Every night, I would bathe my knuckles in surgical spirit and every morning I’d wake up with a headache caused by inhaling those toxic fumes. For years, I had been breaking strings now the strings were breaking me.It was horrible. But it was worth it. Gradually my hands hardened up and my slapping technique improved. And once I’d got the technique, nothing could stop me. I felt like I’d been inducted into some super-secret society – given the key to a life-changing knowledge which had been passed down from generation to generation, from master to pupil. The next summer, the Bottlers played a residency at Edinburgh’s Pleasance theatre and the jazz-musician-turned-journo Miles Kington came to review a show. Afterwards, he came up to me and asked me to explain how I made all “those percussive noises” with my bass, and then he wrote a lovely column in the Independent which made me sound like the best slapper in the world – in a good way.The downside of slapping, of course, is that it takes its toll on the instrument. One evening in the early 1990s, the Bottlers were playing a gig at the Trolley Stop in Hackney, a venue which had become our second home in the south. Towards the end of the gig there was an ominous cracking sound from the place where the neck of the bass meets the body and, a few thumps later, my instrument – named Eileen – exploded. The weighty wooden headstock flew out into the crowd and struck a guy with a particularly splendid quiff squarely in the middle of the forehead. It hit him hard enough to draw blood that was still trickling down his forehead into his eyes when he came to speak to me after the gig. I thought he was going to hit me instead, he hugged me.“That was amazing!” he groaned, as his blood seeped on to my shoulder. “I have never seen that happen before! Never!”I looked at his forehead, which had a nasty headstock-shaped gash.“You should get that stitched,” I said. “It’s going to leave a scar.”“I bloody well hope so!” he roared, before embracing me again and heading towards the bar to show off his war wound. For sentimental reasons I kept the broken neck of that bass. I still have it in my office where it sits next to the neck of the Delta guitar I built as a child. Since then, I’ve trashed another two double basses, one of which was actually built out of a wardrobe by a jazz musician in Manchester named Les, who had made it his mission to create an instrument which I could not break. Inevitably, I turned it into firewood. For my 30th birthday, I drove out to Thwaites music store in Watford where I bought a lovely old 1950s ply-job that did grand service before finally giving up the ghost just before I turned 50. At which point, Thwaites set about building me an entirely new instrument, which is my current weapon of choice. (I fully expect it to fall apart by the time I turn 70.)But for me, skiffle has always been more about attitude than the instruments. Having shambled my way through any number of musical genres, I felt at home with something which celebrated the triumph of amateurish enthusiasm over technical skill. Here at last was a musical form in which my total lack of proficiency was an asset rather than a hindrance – a type of music in which hitting an instrument rather than playing it was seen as a plus.My wife Linda and I recently celebrated our 26th wedding anniversary. Whenever I ask her (as I often do) what it was that finally persuaded her that I was indeed the man of her dreams, she always shrugs and gives me the same answer: “It was the double bass.”The more I think about it, the happier I am that I turned out to be such a rubbish guitarist. As a kid, I’d never really thought of being a bassist as something to which to aspire. When I saw bands like Slade or the Rubettes on Top of the Pops, my attention was always on the guitarist or the singer, the two people who traditionally vied for the spotlight. In the house where I grew up in Finchley, there was a wardrobe with a mirror on the inside of the door, and when everyone else was out I’d practise rock star poses in front of it. I thought that owning and playing an electric guitar would open the door to my dreams. Later, I’d invested every penny I had in overpriced guitar amps and effects pedals. At school I’d organised entire weeks of music concerts just so I could get the chance to play my Westbury Deluxe in front of an audience. At university in Manchester I’d charged around stages with someone else’s black Stratocaster, convinced that it held the key to eternal happiness.It sounds pitiful, but the fact is that, for a great portion of my life, I believed that an electric guitar could win me the adulation I so sorely craved. When it finally transpired that I was simply never going to be a heroic axe-wielder, my disappointment was crushing.And yet, as it turned out, my incompetence was entirely providential. If I’d ever been any good at the guitar, I would never have wound up playing the double bass. The fact that I never rose above the level of cack-handed chord-basher led me to abandon the guitar in favour of an instrument which was tailor-made for someone for whom enthusiasm had always outstripped technique.And, as it turned out, playing that instrument made the girl of my dreams agree to marry me. For that I will always be the world’s most militant and most grateful bassist.How does it feel? It feels wonderful.How Does It Feel?

It also increased its in-house design and buying teams for own-label goods. In total there are now just over 700 fewer employees across the group than a year ago – taking the total to just over 83,000 staff.The business, which owns a string of department stores and the Waitrose supermarket chain, is preparing to report on Thursday that it did not make any profit in the first six months of this year, compared to a £26.6m profit last year, as tough trading conditions on the high street take their toll.The company warned of the likely profits fall in June, blaming Brexit-fuelled inflation and the extra costs of investing in IT at a time when it has been forced to cut prices because of widespread discounting by ailing competitors such as House of Fraser. It expects full-year profits to be significantly down.Earlier this week, the  revealed the department-store side of the group planned to cut about 270 more jobs, just as it changed its name to “John Lewis \u0026amp Partners” to highlight ownership by its employees.The Gazette indicated that the number could be higher, as it revealed that 350 staff are being consulted about the changes which affect back-office jobs in IT, finance and store security for its 50 department stores.The group is also cutting costs at its head office, stopping investment in new stores, reviewing its pension arrangements and reining in marketing spending. At the same time, it intends to pump up to £500m a year into refurbishing its stores and website, as well as developing new products and services.Speaking last week, John Lewis department store boss Paula Nickolds said that despite the job cuts, the company was aiming to improve service in store.“We are determined to play the long game and our ownership model means we can,” Nickolds said on a tour of John Lewis’s revamped Oxford Street store in London.“While others are investing in drones, we are investing in people. Where others are cutting back, we are investing in the very thing that is our point of difference.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e33a9b85b3af415903e4e0164eeb5438a93b70a/0_343_5749_3449/master/5749.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f3d7f878fe5f76642ea462f5a836e9b","title":"green cars get green number plates clean boost sales","story":"Electric and other ultra-low emission cars, vans and taxis could be given special green number plates to boost awareness and increase the use of environmentally “clean” driving.Green plates are already used in Norway, Canada and China on green vehicles including electric and hydrogen cars, making them both distinct and visible to other road others.The plans are contained in a government consultation announced on Sunday that seeks views on the design of green plates, and opinions on which cars and other vehicles they could be fitted on.The consultation comes as prime minister Theresa May prepares to address the first ever zero-emission vehicle summit in Birmingham and Buckinghamshire this week, which will bring together nations from across the globe to pledge collective action towards zero-emission\u0026nbspjourneys.Elisabeth Costa, director of the Behavioural Insights Team, a “social-purpose company” partly owned by the government, said: “Simple changes based on behavioural science can have a big impact. Green plates would be more noticeable to road users, and this increased attraction can help normalise the idea of clean vehicles, highlighting the changing social norms around vehicle ownership.”The government is searching for ways to boost the take-up of low emission cars both for environmental reasons and in order to develop the UK as a country of emission innovation. In July transport secretary Chris Grayling announced plans to introduce more charging points for electric vehicles across the country after reports that a shortage was holding back efforts to get more electric vehicles on the roads.A study for the RAC Foundation found the mass-market appeal of ultra-low emission vehicles may be restricted without widespread, reliable and easy-to-use charging points. Separate AA research showed eight out of 10 drivers see the lack of charging points as a stumbling block to them buying an electric vehicle.Announcing the new consultation, Grayling said the UK was already at the forefront of innovation and the testing of clean vehicle technology. “This new cleaner, greener transport has the potential to bring with it cleaner air, a better environment and stronger economies for countries around the world,” he said.“Adding a green badge of honour to these new clean vehicles is a brilliant way of helping increase awareness of their growing popularity in the UK, and might just encourage people to think about how one could fit into their own travel routine.”A spokesman for the Environmental Transport Association said: “While green number plates will be positive PR for low-emission car makers and early adopters of the technology alike, to be truly effective any such initiative will need to at the same time shame the drivers of the most polluting vehicles an electric or hydrogen-powered vehicle might sport a green plate, but the biggest gas guzzlers should have theirs branded red.“Some French cities have already adopted an emissions-based vignette window sticker scheme using a range of six colours that recognises the fact that it is clumsy to simply brand one class of vehicle as being ‘clean’.”Last month two London councils announced plans to ban all but the cleanest vehicles from some areas at peak times to help tackle the city’s air-pollution crisis. In the UK’s first scheme of its kind, only ultra-low emission vehicles such as electric cars, e-bikes, and the newest hybrids and hydrogen vehicles will be allowed on nine streets in Hackney and Islington from 7am-10am and 4pm-7pm on weekdays."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/743800206f82387c0b37208e436f64992398b356/0_305_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08171df32103e3195a806512e5693345","title":"sse claims london councils are holding up rollout of electric car charging points","story":"Energy company SSE claims thousands of new points are in bureaucratic limboBritain has thousands fewer electric car charging points than required because councils are frustrating their rollout, according to one of the country’s biggest energy companies.Big six energy firm SSE said that when it started work three years ago, it had hoped to install 6,000 charging points in London by now, but had fitted just 762 because of delays by local authorities.The company is the contractor putting in the chargers for the Source London network, run by French firm Bolloré.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed electric vehicle infrastructure to help clean up the capital’s dirty air, but his rhetoric has reportedly not filtered down to the local level.Slow decision-making and bureaucracy in councils, coupled with different approaches to charge points across the capital’s boroughs, are understood to have hamstrung the rollout.Kevin Welstead, the sector director for electric vehicles at SSE Enterprise, said: “Progress has not been rapid. The issue is that we have to effectively negotiate with each of the 33 inidual London boroughs so we can install charge points alongside their parking bays and some are more progressive on the electric vehicle agenda than others.” understands that 130 charging points are in limbo in Southwark, a borough which is otherwise seen as good on electric cars. While the points were given planning approval in 2016, permission has not been given by highways management, meaning they cannot be installed. Planning permission expires next year.Welstead said ministers and Khan had rightly supported electric vehicles, but added: “Our experience as an infrastructure provider on the ground is that this message has not seeped all the way through.”One possible reason for holdups could be the financial problems that austerity has imposed. Cuts to central government grants have led local authorities to shed staff, including those on transport teams, and remaining staff are understood to be stretched to capacity.We’d like your help to find out more about current or future cuts to UK council services.

There are nearly 4,000 charging points in London, according to Zap Map.London Councils, which represents the city’s 33 boroughs, denied holding back the switch to electric cars.Councillor Julian Bell, who chairs the group’s transport and environment committee, said: “London boroughs are committed to supporting environmentally friendly transport and are leading the way in delivering an effective network of electric vehicle charging points across the capital.”He added that boroughs also had “a duty to consider the needs of pedestrians and other road users and to make sure these services are delivered to high standards”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90dfe1d8c7e7625ed3dbc4e66e05fb67784f9c39/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=783fb52764959e3e22436c1d27d43f85","title":"halloween review jamie lee curtis is back but this time no tricks or treats","story":"Director David Gordon Green returns us to Haddonfield for a slasher reunion but the much hyped face-off between two old foes is frustratingly routineIn making the decision to carve out a new Halloween timeline – in what’s arguably become the most messily handled franchise in film history\u0026nbsp– a rather bold reason is required. Pre-publicity assured us that this was the case with Undertow and Pineapple Express director David Gordon Green and co-writer Danny McBride insisting their follow-up to the 1978 original would justify ignoring the many sequels that have come since. Similarly bold reinventions have paid off handsomely before, like when Ryan Coogler pitched Sylvester Stallone with a fresh way into the Rocky saga and Creed was the niftily conceived, remarkably entertaining result. But a niggling question hangs over the entirety of Halloween H40: why?It would be kind to call Halloween sequels patchy, truer to refer to them as mostly heinous, but there’s a fanbase regardless, even for the series’ lowest points. The inarguable highlight was 1998’s Halloween H20, a thrilling return for Jamie Lee Curtis to the role of Laurie Strode in a pacey post-Scream sequel that took a rare examination of the PTSD that would afflict the “final girl” when she becomes a woman. In Green and McBride’s new universe, another 20 years on, that chapter has been cast aside and a similar attempt at considering the after-effects of surviving a run-in with a masked killer has replaced it.But the plot begins with a British podcast duo, keen to explore the story of Michael Myers, the real-life boogeyman who killed five people in Haddonfield, Illinois 40 years prior. They encounter him at a high-security facility and the film decides to show us more of Myers than we’re used to seeing. He’s unmasked and while we don’t see his full face, we see enough for it to feel like a departure, for superfans at least. Soon though, in a rather poorly handled set of events, Myers has escaped and makes his way to the one that got away.Returning to the role that launched her, Curtis plays Strode as something close to a doomsdayer, whose life since that fateful night has been devoted to preparation. She’s a survivalist who’s armed, trained, ready for his return and it’s meant that the rest of her life has inevitably suffered as a result with broken marriages and a fractured relationship with her daughter, played by Judy Greer, and granddaughter, relative newcomer Andi Matichak. Although given the runtime (a pace-killing 109 minutes), there’s precious little depth afforded to her character. Admittedly, Strode was hardly a well-drawn figure in John Carpenter’s original but there’s so much potential here to explore the psychological damage of early trauma that’s tossed aside for a one-note action hero.Halloween struggles most with justifying its existence. Given that Rob Zombie’s take on the franchise (his moderately successful remake and its disastrous sequel) had dissolved back in 2009 and given that Strode had been killed off in the regrettable Halloween: Resurrection back in 2002, there was no great need to bring back Myers yet again. This lack of commercial pressure could have led to a more radical new route but despite the aforementioned sequel amnesia, Green and McBride haven’t brought enough to the table to explain why we’re here again.There are some effectively nasty kills (this is no PG-13 reboot) and Green’s visual eye often results in some impressive imagery but both the look of the film and the script feel confused. Green can’t seem to decide whether he wants it to be gritty and lo-fi or slick and cinematic and so ends up awkwardly between the two, anything resembling an atmosphere sorely missing. Similarly, much of the clunky dialogue is clearly the result of McBride’s comedic background but the comedy is pitched somewhere between self-referential snark and broad silliness, never struly finding its groove.Where the film does come alive is in the final scenes, as three generations of Strode women turn the tables on Myers and there are some smart reversals along with a number of fan-serving Easter eggs. But it’s too little too late and doesn’t provide enough of a catharsis for Curtis’ long-suffering heroine. She’s solid but it’s not quite the comeback one would have hoped for, her portrayal in the shorter, sharper Halloween H20 filled with more nuance and depth.For many, the thrill of seeing Michael Myers stalk the streets of Haddonfield will be enough to forget the many flaws. But in forgetting what came before, Green and McBride have positioned Halloween 2018 as somehow better, bolder and more necessary than those sequels and the scariest thing about it is that it really isn’t."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b27c806a0d8bda433175401c8a08ac412813a05/0_424_6364_3819/master/6364.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4627ebbb5c817214d023a6f492d1a9c6","title":"adrian chiles top 10 alcohol free beers","story":"The broadcaster is trying to moderate his drinking, so who better to sample the growing range of low- and no-alcohol brews?Moderating your drinking is a tricky business. I wondered many times this summer if it might be simpler just to give up alcohol completely. This isn’t because I’m getting into trouble when I do drink, or craving it when I don’t. It’s just that it takes so much more mental effort to organise yourself to drink less when your social life has, it turns out, been entirely constructed around social drinking.I’ve heard many a problem drinker say they were forever working out when they could next get a drink. I’ve been there too. But now I find myself constantly working out when I can next not drink. There is always somewhere I’ve got to be or something I’ve got to do with somebody or other, which, in the normal run of things, would involve drinking.Alcohol is the one drug you have to apologise for not taking. If you go teetotal and everybody knows it, you are in effect issuing a blanket apology for not drinking. If you’re just moderating, it’s more complicated: you kind of have to issue separate apologies for each episode of non-drinking. I feel as if I might be causing offence to friend A for not drinking alcohol with him when I was drinking with friend B the night before and plan to drink with friend C the following weekend.The psychology of it is fascinating. Last week, I didn’t drink on Wednesday or Thursday and planned not to do so on Friday. However, Friday came and I met a mate for an early drink. I asked for alcohol-free beer but there wasn’t any. So I had a small bottle of Kronenberg. I really enjoyed it. And then I had another, which I also enjoyed. And then another, which was still nice. But when the fourth one appeared in front of me, I looked at it solemnly, realising that this bottle was the turning point. This bottle was the moment at which I stopped enjoying it and was just drinking for the sake of drinking. I shudder to think how many of the drinks I’ve drunk in my life came after moments like this. Drinking for the sake of drinking. What a waste.Six months ago, I would have hung around and drunk at least another six bottles. On this occasion, I downed half of that fourth bottle and got the bus home. This is what I believe is known as mindful drinking: drinking only as much as you really enjoy. Now there’s a radical idea.The annoying thing is that if the bar had had any alcohol-free beer, I would have stuck with that and barely missed the real thing at all. It’s worth trying, it really is. On a hot day when I might otherwise demolish a couple of pints of Stella to slake my raging thirst, replacing it with, say, Beck’s Blue, saves me nearly six units of alcohol, almost half the recommended maximum weekly dose.I once asked the cycling coach Dave Brailsford how his doctrine of “marginal gains” in sport might be applied to everyday life, for example in giving up smoking. He said that smoking even one fewer cigarette a day would constitute a marginal gain. So, in the spirit of that if nothing else, it’s worth switching to alcohol-free some of the time.I have no idea why we’re so behind on this in the UK. In Germany, a nation of enthusiastic beer-swillers, there is a roaring trade in alcohol-free beer. In Moscow for the World Cup this summer, almost in jest I asked a bartender in our hotel if they had any alcohol-free beer. Sure, she said, putting a nice, Siberia-cold bottle in front of me. Not long after that, I went to Croatia. There was plenty on offer there, too. All the major Croatian beer companies have decent alcohol-free versions of their brew. Importantly, they all come in proper 500ml bottles, which make them feel like substantial drinks, unlike the piddling little 330ml helpings our stuff usually comes in. Ožujsko Cool is my favourite, by the way, if you happen to be in the area.“What’s the point?” is often the response when I ask someone if they’ve tried alcohol-free beer. “Might as well drink water.” Point taken, but for me this is rather sad, implying that beer is consumed only for the purpose of intoxication. I happen to like the taste of beer. I have no sweet tooth, and water is all very well but – newsflash – doesn’t actually taste of anything at all. Next to water, alcohol-free beer must be the healthiest thing to drink in a pub. Think about it: no alcohol, no added sugar and not many calories.The market has grown by about a fifth in the past two years but still, too often, all most British pubs offer is a few bottles of Beck’s Blue or Heineken 0.0 huddled apologetically together in the bottom of a fridge. It is time they came in bigger bottles, out and proud in the higher reaches of those fridges.One more thing: so you know what kind of unsophisticated palate we’re dealing with here, in pubs I generally drink Guinness, Stella or a bitter such as Landlord, or, if I’m in the West Midlands, Bathams. Bearing that in mind, here are the alcohol-frees (or low-alcohols) I suggest you try.It has got a slightly metallic taste, but otherwise hits the mark. Being the only alcohol-free beer available in many pubs, it’s a slightly dreary choice, but I feel a certain loyalty to Beck’s Blue. It has seen me through many a Lent.35The company is going big on this and it’s perfectly good. In fact, I probably prefer it to the Beck’s. If only it came in big bottles or cans as though it really believed in itself.45I put this one in the same category as alcohol-free offerings from Budweiser (called Prohibition), San Miguel and Estrella. None of them have a whole lot of taste, but I’d still take them over water, coke or other soft drinks. Properly chilled, they will do nicely.25Now this is in the hallowed 500ml bottle that is so important to me. It has got words such as “isotonic”, “vitamin B12” and “essential nutrients” on it, so that’s probably good, isn’t it? It has got a distinctive, vaguely sweet taste that I’m sometimes not sure about. But, after a round of golf on a hot day last week, I demolished two bottles in quick succession and enjoyed them very much.35This is my hands-down winner. You can taste hops and it is in that all-important big bottle, so just bang on for me. I feel a bit bad for Tesco here because my friends at the mindful drinking organisation Club Soda tell me it is the supermarket with the best selection of alcohol-free beer. I came across this lager because I happen to live next door to a Sainsbury’s, but I’ll give Tesco’s wares a try soon.55They call it a “full-flavoured craft beer” and I can’t disagree. And, encouragingly, Brewdog is doing really well with it. In its pubs, on draught, I’m told it is the fourth-biggest seller.35This won an award at the 2018 World Beer awards and you can taste why. I’d feel something of a fraud banging on to you about maltiness and hops and whatnot, as I’m no expert. But the blurb says it is a “smooth six-grain beer, double dry-hopped to give maximum flavour and aroma”, which sounds about right to me.35Big Dropspecialises in alcohol-free beer and it’s all good. I tried the pale ale and the lager, too, and both are excellent, but the stout really is the business.45"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b4a88aed193c243db95680bb186805354fab0c9/113_2370_3817_2290/master/3817.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f74d98868f31b0a2b8431001bc82bb39","title":"anja dunk cucumber soup chicken schnitzel and rhubarb tart recipes","story":"A second helping of our guest food writer’s German-inspired, tasty, comforting home cookingMy maternal grandparents – Omi and Opa – would arrive from Germany in a car laden with salami, pâtés, pickles, bread, biscuits, sweets, jams, meat, sauerkraut, butter… you name it and I’m sure they had it packed in. Everything in the car was wrapped in newspaper so that it stayed cool, or frozen in some cases, for the journey to Wales. We made a human chain and passed the bundles to each other along the driveway to the kitchen table, until the car was empty and we could all finally sit down. Opa would unwrap the rye bread and slice it thinly Omi would spread the sweet unsalted butter, then we would all help ourselves to pâté and mustard, possibly gherkins.It isn’t what we ate each year on their arrival that I recall, so much as the feeling of affection expressed through the journey this food had travelled. There is a wonderful German word, gemütlich, which when translated into English loosely means “cosy”, though in fact it means much more but is hard to put into words. To me it really means feeling at home. So, wherever we are in the world, I try to make it gemütlich – and the best way I know is to do this through cooking.My grandmother used to bake cucumbers with butter and serve them warm at the table, strewn with dill and a splash of vinegar, and this is my version of that. cucumbers 2, large, peeledunsalted butter 80gplain flour 3 tbspvegetable stock 1 litre, hotvinegar from a jar of gherkins, 4 tbsp or 2 tbsp white wine vinegarchives 4 tbsp, fresh, finely chopped dill 2 tbsp, fresh, finely choppedpink peppercorns ½ tsp, crushedSlice the cucumbers in half lengthways, scrape out the seeds, then cut them into thin slices. Heat the butter in a large saucepan and, once bubbling, add the flour. Stir and allow to brown just slightly, then add the stock. Whisk to avoid lumps, bring to the boil, then add the cucumber. Turn the heat down and simmer for about 6 minutes, until the cucumber slices are translucent and tender. Now add the vinegar and chives.Blitz the soup using a blender or pass it through a mouli. Be careful, as it is very hot. Taste and season accordingly. Stir in the dill, then ide the soup between your bowls.

Mix the oats, almonds, baking powder, flour and salt together in a shallow dish.Heat 1cm of sunflower oil in a large frying pan. Place each piece of chicken in the flour mixture, turning gently to ensure they are completely coated. Once the oil is hot, put the chicken into the frying pan and fry for 3 minutes on each side, until golden brown. Although they should be done in this time, it is always good to check that the chicken is cooked all the way through. Drain on kitchen paper and serve alongside a green salad.This is a dish of opposites that attract: sweet and sour, crunchy and soft, earthy and meaty.

Pour enough boiling water into the pan to just cover the meat (around 600ml). Bring to the boil, then turn down the heat, cover and simmer for an hour.If you are using dried beans you will need to cook them while the pork is boiling. To do this, rinse them then place in a large saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring to the boil, then turn the heat down and simmer for half an hour. Check to see if the beans are cooked by biting into one. After an hour, take the pork out of the saucepan and set aside on a plate. Drain the liquid though a sieve into a jug – it will be used for the beans. Pick the prunes and garlic pieces out of the sieve, as these, too, will be used shortly.Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan, then add the shallots and fry for 5 minutes, stirring from time to time. Add the garlic and prunes and mash them slightly with the back of a wooden spoon, stir, then add the greens. At this stage they will crowd the pan, but they soon wilt down. Add 250ml of the reserved liquid and gently move the greens around the pan for a few minutes until they have collapsed. Now there is more room in the pan, add the cooked beans and the white wine vinegar. Stir everything together and turn the heat down.Slice the pork into little pieces, the thickness of a £1 coin. Heat the oil in another pan, then add the pork and fry for about 3 minutes on each side. Divide the beans and greens between 4 plates and top each with some crispy pork.Rhubarb and black pepper are a good combination.

Denmark may have only had 72 hours together following their bitter fallout with their FA, but the Tottenham midfielder needed only 90 minutes to outshine Gareth Bale.Wales’s 4-1 destruction of Ireland on Thursday seemed like a distant memory as they felt the pace against their fresher opponents. A first-half goal against the run of play continued Eriksen’s hot streak for his country, before he fired home from the spot to take his scoring run to 15 goals in his last 18 matches.“Physically, with the quick turnaround, we found it difficult against a very good team,” said Giggs. “For the young players it’s a learning curve. I tried to freshen it up after the highs of Thursday, but it’s not easy. We got plaudits on Thursday but now we have to answer questions. When you give Eriksen that space on the edge of the box you are in trouble. We kept him quiet but he has quality and makes the right decision and the right execution.”The Nations League chaos looked to have subsided after Denmark’s players agreed a temporary agreement with the Danish Football Association after a team made of internet football freestylers, lower league players and futsalers went down fighting in a 3-0 defeat in Slovakia last Wednesday.But Wales were hit by travel chaos and only arrived in Denmark’s second city after midnight on Saturday as their plane had been grounded due to technical problems.They showed no signs of fatigue in the opening stages at Ceres Park, however. And the new aggressive pressing approach almost paid idends them after Aaron Ramsey won possession in midfield and released Bale to run at the defence.Denmark’s captain, Simon Kjaer, was immediately back-pedalling before giving Bale enough space to send a shot past Kasper Schmeichel but just past a post as well.But Giggs’ men were undone by their opposition’s main man Eriksen after 32 minutes. Lasse Schöne sprayed a searching ball out to the right-back Henrik Dalsgaard, who cut a square pass across the edge of the box for the Spurs man to hit a low shot across goal and into the back of the net via an upright.It put the Danes in a commanding position and it could have got even worse for Wales had it not been for the goalkeeping heroics of Wayne Hennessey. The ball sat up perfectly for the winger Pione Sisto to fire a rising drive towards goal, but the Crystal Palace No\u0026nbsp1 ed full stretch to paw it away and keep the deficit to a single goal at half-time.A Bale free-kick took Kjaer off his feet after half-time, but Wales were no closer to testing Schmeichel. And tiredness looked to be creeping when Chris Mepham was dispossessed in his own box by Martin Braithwaite, who could only find the side-netting with a shot.But the pressure finally told as Denmark made the most of a dubious penalty decision to double their lead. Ethan Ampadu jumped to block a Viktor Fischer cross but was adjudged to have made a deliberate movement with a hand towards the ball despite being only three yards away. The call may have been disputed but there was no indecision from Eriksen, who fired his penalty past Hennessey to continue his remarkable run.Braithwaite almost made it three as hope fizzled out for Wales, but Hennessey once again proved to be their saviour at the back as Denmark coasted to victory.“No matter how the week developed this is what we wanted,” said Eriksen, the man of the match. “We wanted to play some football, to win, and to get a good start in this competition. It was a good start and a very good finish to a weird week.“You could see Wales were tired after Thursday and they gave us a lot of space to play in midfield. We’re good at using it, but we got lucky with the penalty. We had chances to do more, but we did well.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed8c59f6d63bc799cab970b193df8cbc03875e77/0_164_3458_2075/master/3458.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc2082b2e3d7f8ab0b19b2998dd6921d","title":"denmark v wales nations league live","story":"Peep peep!

As its top 500 power list is published, we ask how he’s got designers and editors hanging on his every wordPing! Six days a week, just before 6am BST, nearly half a million people receive an email from Imran Amed. Among these recipients are the most influential designers, CEOs and mavens in the fashion industry. They are based in around 190 countries around the world and, tellingly, almost two-thirds are under 34 years old – the cherished, all-important millennials.The message – sent under the banner of Amed’s company the Business of Fashion, or BoF – contains a series of links, simply presented. Some stories are generated by BoF staff, the rest are aggregated from external media companies, from Vogue and the New York Times to the Chinese dailies. Sometimes there will be a global exclusive: Kate Moss chose to launch her new modelling agency on the BoF website the exits of designers Jenna Lyons and Phoebe Philo from J Crew and Céline respectively were revealed first on the site. Alternatively, the email might direct the reader to one of their long reads: a three-part investigation into the merger of Yoox and Net-a-Porter, for example, or a report into the Royal Academy of Fine Arts Antwerp, which uncovered depression, drug abuse and suicide at the prestigious fashion school.Amed, the effusive, 43-year-old British-Canadian founder and CEO of the media and technology company, is often told that BoF’s daily email is “an addiction”. The accessories designer Anya Hindmarch said in Vogue: “It’s the first thing I read every day in bed before I even see my children, I’m ashamed to admit.”But as much as people come to BoF for a digest of what’s happened, they also now look to it for insight on what’s going to happen. Amed started the website in early 2007 as a blog that he would write in his spare time at night in his flat in Notting Hill. Until 2013, he was the sole contributor to BoF. The rapid growth of the company and interest in its content – it now has 75 employees spread between London, New York and Shanghai – has coincided with a deeply precarious period for the fashion industry.“It’s been a very challenging 12 months,” sighs Amed. “A very challenging three years. A very challenging decade. Fashion is no different from any other industry in that respect. A lot of the forces that are shaping the world we live in, whether that be technological disruption and the resulting changes in consumer behaviour, the globalisation of the economy, particularly the rise of China as a huge force in consumption, geopolitical forces, the election of Donald Trump and the resulting trade wars, the onset of Brexit here in the UK. Turmoil in major markets like Brazil and Turkey, and social currents, like the #MeToo movement. All of these things are shaping the world we live in and they are also shaping the fashion industry.“And I think our role has been really from the beginning to help the industry and the people who work in it to navigate these changes,” he goes on.Today, BoF is a many tentacled operation. Some articles on the site are free, but in October 2016 it launched paid subscriptions for full access to the content. This costs £216 annually, or £18 a month. Amed declines to reveal exactly how many subscribers BoF has – only that the numbers have exceeded his wildest expectations. “It’s already by far the core driving force of our business,” he says. “It was a risk, of course. But it turns out people find they can’t get content like ours anywhere else. They trust what we have to say.”That’s not the only revenue stream for BoF. It has a Careers section where brands pay to advertise jobs, an events wing called Voices, and an Education department offering online courses delivered by fashion insiders. There’s a biannual print magazine that has high-end advertising: the last issue had a double cover featuring Kim Kardashian West (interviewed by Amed) and the activist Sinéad Burke. Then, every September, the company announces the BoF 500, a power list for the fashion industry. It’s a validation to be included and embarrassing to drop from the line-up (as 99 people did last year). The selection for 2018 is revealed tomorrow.“Our competitors really differ, depending on what part of the business you look at,” says Amed. “Our events business competes with TED. Our online recruitment business competes with LinkedIn. Our online education business competes with business schools and fashion schools. And our content competes with everyone from Women’s Wear Daily to the New York Times to the Economist. And Instagram. And Facebook. We live in the attention economy. You have a limited amount of time in the day, you have a limited real estate on someone’s phone. So that’s the way I think about it: there is no single competitor.”I meet Amed first at his offices in central London, and we go for lunch at a Greek restaurant, where he talks so much he scarcely eats a mouthful. He has a slight build and favours capacious knitwear this afternoon, it’s ajumper by the LA-based label The Elder Statesman. He travels relentlessly and his outfit shows it: T-shirt (Japan), jeans and slippers – yes, slippers (France), necklace (Bali) and rings (India).Amed’s own background is something of a mish-mash, too. His parents are of Indian descent, but were both raised in Africa and met in Nairobi. Shortly before Amed was born, they moved to Calgary and that’s where he grew up. He studied in Canada (McGill University), the US (Harvard Business School), but when it came time to pick somewhere to work he chose the UK and the management consultants McKinsey \u0026amp Co. Every three months or so, he would be parachuted into a new industry and have to ascertain, very quickly, why a company was not reaching its potential. It might seem a long way between corporate life and what he’s doing now, but Amed insists it’s very similar: it’s just his “client” is not one firm, but a whole industry.McKinsey seemed a perfect fit for Amed and he rose quickly. But then one day he was sitting in a meeting with eight colleagues and he realised three things: one, all of them were men two, they were all wearing blue checked shirts and three, the bigger the checks on their blue shirts the more senior they were. “And I was wearing an orange shirt,” he says, smiling. “I’m a very analytical person and I was like, ‘Wow, I’m a real fish out of water here.’”Furthermore, Amed was borderline depressed. “I was 29 and I was waking up in the morning and feeling deeply unhappy and unfulfilled,” he recalls. “Although I had ticked off all the boxes of going to the right schools, working in the right companies, I wasn’t happy.”Amed gets miffed sometimes when people call BoF an “overnight success”. It’s been anything but, he insists. The kernel of an idea came in 2006 when he took a sabbatical from McKinsey and went on a 10-day silent retreat at a Vipassana meditation camp in South Africa. “Ten days, that’s hard,” he sighs, “but I’m fairly certain that was the most transformative experience of my life. If it weren’t for that, I wouldn’t be doing what I’m doing today.”Fashion wasn’t an obvious pick for Amed. But he had friends in the industry, and he started to realise that there might be a place for someone like him who was obsessed with data and market trends. “There was a gulf,” he says. “The creative people kind of looked down their nose at the business people. The business people were really fascinated by the creative people, but they didn’t really understand the creative process. And those two things are absolutely essential and they need to work together.”Amed’s initial idea was a bust: an incubator for young, British fashion designers. But it got his foot in the door and meetings with industry titans, such as Net-a-Porter founder Natalie Massenet. Amed began consulting for LVMH, and writing a blog called the Business of Fashion on the side. “Natalie was the first person to tell me, ‘This little blog of yours, it could become really big,’” he says.Looking back, Amed realises his timing was propitious: 2007 saw the launch of the first iPhone and the dawn of social media the financial crisis of 2008 rocked everyone in the fashion industry and focused attentionon the bottom line. But BoF’s main leap didn’t come until 2013, when Amed raised £1.25m investment from sources including LVHM and Carmen Busquets, adirector of Net-a-Porter.Amed is clearly no longer an outsider: BoF has the ears of everyone important in the industry. Last year, he was awarded an MBE for services to fashion. The question is then: would he still be prepared to criticise, say, LVHM or report negative stories about a brand that he has built a relationship with? Amed insists he would. He does.“With a lot of fashion media, there’s this tacit, unspoken agreement about how the exchange works between editorial and advertising,” he says. “The very reason why we’ve moved this model around, having our subscribers pay for the content, is because it focuses our attention on satisfying those inidual readers. If a big brand gets upset with a major fashion magazine because of something, they call and say: ‘We’re cancelling 50 pages of advertising’ – which happens – that is a big deal. If one of our subscribers gets upset because we’ve written something, but it’s a service for our larger community for that information to be out there, it’s not an issue for us. Our accountability is to our community.”Amed is serious on this point, and he clearly takes his work very seriously. “No partner, no children, no pets,” he says. “But I have lots of people in my life who support me and care for me. I’m very well loved.” Being an entrepreneur doesn’t allow much time for hobbies, but he still meditates, exercises and is early to bed, early to rise: “My team sometimes gets emails from me at 4am and they’re not surprised because they know that’s when I do a lot of my thinking.”What keeps Amed awake, right now, is Brexit. “I’ve been really thrown by it,” he says. “If we crash out of the EU with no deal, there are all sorts of trade barriers and issues that are going to arise. Let alone the lack of access to talent: go into any of the young fashion businesses here in London or even the big behemoth ones like Burberry, they are filled with creative people from all over the place.”The same is true of the BoF offices: at one point Amed worked out that there were 17 different nationalities among a team of 25. He’s yet to decide where he will be based after the UK breaks from Europe, but, wherever it is, he’s confident of one thing. “We will continue to grow – rapidly,” he says. “I’ve no doubt about that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7289c288ede69e2e8b85a37244a2db9406187502/0_545_4650_2790/master/4650.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75a884829a07c5ae29ce8dc7ddf9b4ae","title":"should i limit the amount of time my child spends with their mobile phone","story":"Children and parents may not agree on how much screen time is acceptable, but some ground rules about usage and online security will make for a more harmonious householdIt’s an argument virtually every modern parent has had with their child: the battle to prise them away from the mobile phone they’re glued to. For children, a smartphone is a window to games, videos and constant interaction with their friends. But for parents, it can feel like a minefield, raising questions about whether their access should be restricted and how to keep them safe as they learn to navigate the digital world. But who’s in the right?First, it’s worth bearing in mind that screen time can be beneficial. Peter Twining, professor of education (futures) at the Open University, conducted research between 2015 and 2017 into mobile phone use among five- to 11-year-olds, and his findings about what children use phones to access may surprise parents who assume they’re just playing games. “We tend not to recognise the value of what they do on their mobile devices, but they often use them to extend an interest – for instance, if they’re interested in gymnastics, they’ll watch videos of routines and try to learn from them,” he says.This difference in understanding of children’s mobile phone usage may help to explain the substantial disparity in opinion between children and parents about how much screen time is acceptable. According to a survey of 1,000 adults and 1,000 children aged nine to 15 conducted by Tesco Mobile, the mean amount of screen time that adults thought appropriate for children was 1.75 hours, with children believing it to be 3.34 hours.But at least both parties do recognise that there should be limits. However, recent research suggests that instead of setting specific time limits for usage, such as a maximum of two hours per day, it’s actually the nature of the screen time that matters. For instance, passively flicking through social media posts is less beneficial than actively playing games, which can improve problem-solving skills and persistence. A study conducted by the University of Michigan on four to 11-year-olds found that “how children use the devices, not how much time they spend on them, is the strongest predictor of emotional or social problems connected with screen addiction.”Twining agrees, saying: “I’m less concerned about screen time than about the nature of the interactions around the screen. The screen should become a shared focal point for interaction within the family rather than an inidual activity. The screen shouldn’t be an alternative to socialising with your child, it should be an enhancement to it.”Some experts believe that rather than setting concrete limits to screen time, it may be more useful to establish general house rules about the context of phone use. “Many families find a unified screen time approach beneficial,” says chartered psychologist Dr Sarah Kuppen, author of Little Kids, Big Dilemmas: Your parenting problems solved by science.“A media plan sets limits on screen usage to ensure children access a wide range of daily activities. Restrictions sometimes include screen-free zones, screen-free times or device curfews. However, these should be adapted and updated over time.”According to Dr Linda Papadopoulos – a child psychologist and ambassador for Internet Matters, a not-for-profit organisation dedicated to children’s online security – these family guidelines are crucial. “You need to set a good example with your own device and any rules you create, be careful not to break them yourself. For instance, we never have our phones at the dinner table so we can all interact together offline.”Other suggestions from Papadopoulos include only letting children have their phones after their homework, and never allowing them to sleep with the device. She advises explaining the reasons behind these rules. “We know it’s a bad idea to use the phone just before bed because it causes sleep disturbance, so they need to get off it at least a couple of hours before. Equally, we know if a child is studying and their phone is pinging next to them, they won’t consolidate memory, so the chapter they’re reading will take twice as long to absorb. The more kids understand why you’re making these rules, the more they’ll live by them.“And if you still feel they’re using their phones too much, technology can actually help – there are apps where children are rewarded for taking time away from their tech.”Twining believes that parents know what’s appropriate, so they should trust their instincts. “They’re sometimes nervous about exercising it, but parents usually have really good common sense,” he says. “If children are on their phone all the time, clearly that’s too much – you want them to do other activities, too. The key is finding a balance.”Visit Tesco Mobile for more information and content on families and mobile"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5274848e4e0be4abbac76fb3a11e637550fbba17/0_22_6303_3783/master/6303.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d31787af8e7df2e4256f038aef4a2611 1400w","title":"fastest bicycle world record nevada","story":"Most cyclists tootle around town at something like 10mph. Competitive amateurs might double that, while elite professionals can exceed 30mph on the flat in events such as the Tour de France.So spare a thought for Russell Bridge, a 41-year-old amateur cyclist and father of twins who will this week lead a British challenge to break the world record for the fastest speed achieved on a “human-powered vehicle” (HPV), which stands at a white knuckle-inducing 89.6mph (144kph).Adding to the challenge is the fact that Bridge has barely ridden the vehicle, a recumbent bicycle housed in a super-smooth shell made out of fibreglass and Kevlar that bears a passing resemblance to a dolphin.“We did a test day at Rockingham Speedway two weeks ago, and I’ve had all of about six minutes in it,” Bridge said. “We got up to 37mph on the first run and 47 on the second but that was without the top bonnet on.”He admitted to feeling nervous as the Aim 93 team (the number represents the maximum miles per hour the team believe the vehicle can theoretically achieve) prepare to fly out to the International Human Powered Vehicle Association competition at Battle Mountain in Nevada.“I’m anxious about it,” he said. “I’ve ridden at reasonably fast speeds on recumbents before but I’ve bought motorycle clothing to protect myself so if the worst happens, and we slide down the road at 70 or 80mph, I’ve at least got some resistance between myself and the road.”Aim 93 is a joint collaboration between two of the giants of Britain’s HPV scene, Glen Thompson and Mike Burrows, long-time rivals who put aside their differences in an attempt to bag a world record for Britain.Thompson is a senior lecturer at London South Bank University who specialises in aerodynamics and as a racer won a silver and four bronze medals at the World HPV championships. Burrows, 75, designed the revolutionary Lotus 108 bicycle on which Chris Boardman won gold at the 1992 Olympics and has built Aim 93’s chassis.Pip Piper, whose company, Blue Hippo Productions, is making a documentary of Aim 93’s quest to break the world record, said the relationship between the two men was crucial to the team’s dynamic.After meeting up in 2013 at the funeral of Richard Ballantine, a legendary cycling writer and key player in the HPV movement, Thompson and Burrows got talking, according to Piper. “They said ‘look, we’ve been rivals for 40 years, trying to outdo one another in terms of human-powered vehicles. Why don’t we have one last hurrah? Let’s get together and do something.’ Glen is more the academic while Mike is a bit more Heath Robinson, building things in his shed.”In this week’s competition, riders from some 20 teams will make their record-breaking attempt on a 200m stretch of highway after cycling more than five miles along it to get their vehicles up to top speed. The location is chosen because it is at altitude and the air is thin.The HPV championships, which date back almost half a century, have changed down the years, said Thompson. “It used to be people building their own things in garages but it’s all got a bit more technical, and you need the resources of a university to build it. You need a lot of computer power to do the computational fluid dynamics to get the aerodynamics right.”Despite it’s futuristic look, much of what was under the shell of Aim 93 was relatively simple, said Thompson. “We’ve gone right back to the roots of cycling to develop this thing. It’s a single speed and it has a very fine chain, much thinner than a normal bicycle chain.“We’ve had special tyres made and we’ve tried to make it as minimal as possible, whereas the other teams tend to be highly complex in terms of transmission.”Thompson, who hopes that the team’s exploits will encourage interest among students in science and technology, said he was not expecting to break the world record. “We are going out there to gather data, do the research, and sort out what we need to do. You can’t go out to Battle Mountain and do it in your first year. No one’s ever done that.”Bridge agreed. “If we get to two-thirds or three quarters of that speed (93mph), we’ll see it as a positive. If we get down the course and arrive safely back home in one piece, then I’ll take that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a1de7d5a3dfbefbe489543f089249ff90539854/0_0_4280_2567/master/4280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e439a223903be9b666b8f507f37314ba","title":"in transit eight of the best audiobooks for long journeys","story":"That hefty tome you’ve been meaning to read for years?

Paul McCartney could spend his time lounging about on the supplest of vegan pleather ans, getting wavy on the finest marijuana strains ever crossbred. He could feel satisfied that semi-legalisation – at least for the likely joint pain of a 76-year-old – was nigh, and that his status as the patriarch of western popular culture was secure.But Macca doesn’t get high any more, he confides on Happy With You – a deceptively simple ditty on Egypt Station, his latest album. You know it’s McCartney from the first acoustic guitar figure. He used to lie to his doctor, he sings, but that’s no longer necessary either. He likes his life with Nancy Shevell, we learn. He takes solace in nature.All the more reason, you could argue, for this chilled version of the most try-hard of the Fab Four to eke out the time teaching his eight grandchildren yoga postures, or Stormzy the piano, or lend his clout to issues such as gun control, as McCartney did earlier this year on the New York March for Our Lives. As per the title of another Egypt Station song, Fuh You, he could give precisely no “fuhs” about any further aural output.And yet here he is, roping in American A-list pop producers, subjecting himself to Carpool Karaoke, and generously feeding the publicity machine such catnip as “McCartney saw God on DMT”, as the headlines had it last week – all for another spin around the whirligig, just, you assume, to see if any of his stuff still registers.Spoiler: it does. The finest songs here land immediately and hum with urgency. There’s Do It Now, a super-Beatley minor key carpe diem that passes on the advice McCartney’s father used to give him. “Do it now, while the vision is clear,” he sings, in a timbre that doesn’t overmuch betray the slight diminution in his vocal range. Then there’s Despite Repeated Warnings, another highly characteristic McCartney piano ballad gone funny, about the political fixes of the current age. Brexit, Trump: they can all be read into a parable about a deranged captain piloting a ship into perilous straits marred by just one godawful rhyme – “Janet”, to go with “planet”.Most immediate of all is I Don’t Know, as raw and human an offering as McCartney has written in some time. “I got crows at my windowDogs at my door,” sings Sir Paul, an English bluesman wrestling with an intractable situation. “I don’t think I can take any more What am I doing wrong?” One of the very greatest strengths of the Beatles’ songwriting was the vulnerable querying of both Lennon and McCartney, men who displayed hurt, empathised with others and sought to give wise counsel where they could. Here, McCartney self-flagellates at the piano. “Where am I going wrong?” he gnashes – no potentate, “only a man”, one who can’t make everything OK in his extended clan.Given McCartney’s high emotional IQ, the strangest of all of the publicity-seeking compulsions that surround Egypt Station is probably his desire to throw his muse into the hands of a couple of super-producers de nos jours.With Egypt Station, McCartney is specifically interested in playing with the new breed. You can understand the attraction of teaming up with Kanye West, a fellow creative all-rounder – words, music, contemporary ubiquity – as he did in 2015 for the Rihanna-fronted FourFiveSeconds.And you’d also understand if the author of Hey Jude wanted to trade top lines (AKA melodies) with his modern-day equivalent – someone like Swedish eminence grise Max Martin, the man who writes the tunes of the early 21st century (and if he doesn’t write them, his acolytes mimic his style).Instead, Egypt Station is an extended dalliance between McCartney and Greg Kurstin (Lily Allen, Kylie, Britney, Adele, Chvrches) and, briefly, between McCartney and Ryan Tedder (OneRepublic, Leona Lewis, Beyoncé, Adele, Taylor Swift). It’s held together by a flimsy conceit that these songs are stations on some kind of journey.The Tedder collaboration – Fuh You, released as a single – is the album’s nadir, like matter meeting anti-matter: McCartney on the melody, deploying little harpsichord parps, and Tedder, laying the production out on a stifling computer grid, smothering all spontaneity with a hypoxic density of instrumentation, making for an overweening scent of Coldplay. It is one of two songs on Egypt Station in which a septuagenarian flaunts his libido, and that’s not the reason it’s buttock-clenchingly uncomfortable. According to a recent interview, McCartney’s crash course in how Tedder works – throwing out pat phrases over hooks until something sticks – was a salutary eye-opener.Happily, Kurstin proves a more interesting foil. With a background in jazz, Kurstin is the sort that won’t flinch if McCartney throws a little backwards guitar at him, as he does on Caesar Rock, or bloopy space-lounge bossa nova, as he does on Back in Brazil. Kurstin has said that McCartney wanted to avoid anything sounding “ordinary”, and significant portions of this album really don’t, privileging the off-piste-veering, experimental McCartney. Even when the song is a pleasant, common-or-garden Wings-like chug such as Who Cares, an oscillating intro, or a giant wasp outro, makes you prick up your ears appreciatively.Nowhere is this playful imperative more evident than on the closing triptych of Hunt You Down Naked C-Link. Hit songwriting is one thing, but if the Beatles did anything, it was to nail their populist tune-making to the mast like few before or since, then disrupt the whole paradigm.There’s undimmed brio on the juicy free-for-all that is Hunt You Down, jolly baroque introspection on Naked, and an unexpected closing blues, C-Link, where some orchestrated strings, sounding like horns, join McCartney’s lascivious, lurking electric guitar.“I’m not quitting while people are crying for more,” he sings on People Want Peace.

They argue that the promise to maintain a common rulebook for goods and other continued alignment will mean a post-Brexit UK is tied to the EU without having a say on future rules, rather than being a free-trading independent nation.Labour has also disparaged the proposal, expressing deep scepticism about the so-called facilitated customs arrangement system.Brussels has sought to stay positive, but has deep concerns about elements of the plan viewed as overly pick-and-mix, and thus potentially incompatible with EU principles.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, says he opposes both the customs plan and the idea of alignment for goods. He also makes plain his contention that the Chequers plan contains no workable idea for the Ireland-Northern Ireland border.But at the same time the EU has been careful to not entirely dismiss the proposals, raising the possibility it could accept some adapted version.Officially, May and her cabinet, though even here the backing can seem lukewarm at times. Asked about Chequers, the home secretary, Sajid Javid, said it was the government’s plan “right now”, indicating alternative ideas could be considered.Even May’s allies concede it will be a hugely difficult task to get the plan through parliament. Damian Green, the PM’s close friend and former de fact deputy, described the process as “walking a narrow path with people chucking rocks at us from both sides”.On the remain side of the Conservatives, the former education secretary Justine Greening called the Chequers plan “more unpopular than the poll tax”, saying May should start again from scratch.If anything can save the plan – and it’s an outside shot – it will be a combination of the hugely tight timetable and the fact that, as yet, no one else has yet produced a plan with a better chance of being accepted by parliament.On 20 September, an informal gathering in Salzburg, Austria, will provide a snapshot of current EU thinking. Then, 10 days later, the Conservative conference could show the Chequers plan is holed below the waterline.If it survives these tests, the proposals will then reach the crucial EU summit Brussels on 18 October, with something final needed, at the very latest, in the next two months. PETER WALKERAs expected, the reported leaked version would see the UK propose a Canada-style trade deal with the EU, with none of the alignment or common rules proposed by Chequers. If that was rejected, the paper says, the UK would leave without a deal, on WTO terms.A no-deal Brexit would mean the estimated £39bn final payment to Brussels would instead be largely used for the NHS, the document argues. Another “Brexit bonus” would come from cuts to income and capital gains tax, business rates and stamp duty.Less expected was a plan to create a rapid reaction military expeditionary force to allow swift deployment to protect places such as the Falkland islands.There is also a proposal for a defence planning to include “the insurance of a nuclear missile shield to deter aggression”, the Mail on Sunday said, an idea seemingly based on the US strategic defence initiative, commonly known as “star wars”.The bulk of scrutiny of any final ERG plan is likely to focus on plans to prevent a hard Irish border after Brexit. The leaked reports give few details beyond the idea of carrying out checks away from the border.Rees-Mogg told the Mail: “That was an early draft. The key thing which the papers will address is that there is nothing to be concerned about the UK trading with the EU on WTO terms.”On Tuesday, Rees-Mogg is due to speak at an event arguing for the economic benefits of a no-deal Brexit. It is organised by the Economists for Free Trade group, which has repeatedly argued that the UK economy would thrive on WTO terms.The UK, he said, has nothing to fear from trading on WTO terms. “Let Brexit mean Brexit and let us flourish under the auspices of the WTO,” he added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a8d6027b1a3ee1335c8febac8751c4722a5ec40/0_45_1731_1039/master/1731.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6ccf1943b5b7344bb826edcfdd3579f","title":"feline hungry an expert guide to feeding cats","story":"Your cat may act like it can look after itself but, like a teenager, it’s definitely underselling how much it needs you – especially when it comes to nutrition. Here’s how to get it rightCats are masters of being able to wind their owners around their little claws, and as a result they make us believe they are desperately in need of feeding when in fact, they’re not. Despite what we think, cats have no social aspect to eating. In other words, they don’t love us for it.Portion sizes should be followed according to the type of food you are feeding (most feeds have a guide for portion sizes on the pack, or offer a nutritional advice helpline) and according to the breed, build, age and activity level of your cat. A rough guide would be an urban outdoor cat that weighs about 4kg would need about 300kcal a day. If your cat is an indoor-only animal of about the same weight, this would reduce to 200kcal a day.The type of cat you have will affect what they need to eat to stay fit and healthy. Long-haired cats benefit from a different food to their shorter haired cousins, while bigger breeds such as Maine coons have a larger skeleton, so benefit from more joint support than others.The shape of the cat’s jaw can determine how and if they eat a kibble, which is why different breeds benefit from a specific shape. Cat jaws are designed to move up and down, not side to side, so they can tear at food rather than chew – and you’ll find cats eat in one of three different ways:Cats are very fussy about how food feels in their mouth and texture is very important to cats – more so, in fact, than taste, as they have relatively few taste buds compared with humans. They also need fresh drinking water at all times.SiameseThese animals are long, lean and athletic, and benefit from a diet to support muscle tone – one that has more protein and less fat. Their jaw is a specific triangular shape, so they need a kibble that works with their natural eating action, encouraging them to crunch their food.Bengal An athletic breed that benefits from a higher level of protein but also fat to fuel their activity. A diet that will help maintain its very distinctive coat is also desirable containing specific amino acids, vitamins and omega fats aimed specifically at skin and coat health.Maine coon Maine coon owners should have an awareness of the heart health issues associated with this large, heavy breed. Make sure its diet has the right energy density so that you’re not encouraging weight gain.Norwegian forest catLike other cats with longer coats, the Norwegian forest cat often needs a food that contains specific fibres such as psyllium, which help to naturally move hair swallowed during grooming through the digestive tract – as without the right care and nutrition, hairballs can be an issue.SphynxThese hairless cats are covered with a light down, but they can struggle to maintain their body temperature and so benefit from a food with a higher fat content to provide extra energy for their active metabolism. Keeping their skin healthy is also a priority. RagdollAnother long-haired cat with a broad jaw, these benefit from a pyramid-shaped kibble that is easy to grasp and encourage crunching. As with other heavier cats, they benefit from food with additional health nutrients, such as glucosamine and chondroitin to support joint health.Whatever the breed, Royal Canin offer a wide variety of wet and dry foods tailored to your cat’s inidual nutrition needs.

The match is progressing fast enough to avoid that modern rarity, a draw – in the 20 Tests when Joe Root has been in charge there have been only two of those. With two days remaining England lead by 154 with eight wickets in hand and the pitch is becoming ever more worn: a slow burner is becoming a slow turner.The subplots, at least for English followers, centred on the opening batsmen. For a start Alastair Cook is playing his final Test match, though one would not have guessed it from watching him play there is no sign of any demob-happiness. He batted in exactly the same way as in his previous 291 innings and that was very handy for England. He was still there at the end on 46.However, Cook’s entry on to the playing surface as England began their second innings was unusual. As he walked out alongside Keaton Jennings all the spectators at the Oval were on their feet and applauding throughout his journey to the middle. Here was another clip for Cook to cherish on long winter evenings along with the tributes gathered from (nearly) all the England players who have accompanied him on to the field.For the moment he remained steely-eyed – and dry-eyed, one presumes – and began clipping the ball through square-leg whenever the opportunity arose. So much for all the hullaballoo, this was just the sort of innings England needed to consolidate a modest lead of 40 runs. Obviously Cook should have announced his retirement sooner – since this is the best he has batted this year.The same cannot be said of Jennings, who failed again. For the second time this summer he was out not playing a shot, to allow Mohammed Shami his well-deserved first wicket of the match. Shami was bowling round the wicket at the time and the ball jagged in to hit the top of middle and off stump, a miserable way to go. This leaves Jennings with an unwanted record: no England opener has previously gone 18 innings without scoring a half-century. It has been a tough summer for openers, as Ed Smith pointed out at lunchtime when he hinted that Jennings might survive for the winter tour of Sri Lanka. Even so, an average of 18 in a five-Test series is not reassuring. There is surely a strong case to explore alternatives.Cook’s retirement might aid Jennings’s survival but the oddity is that Surrey’s Rory Burns, who has never been in a Test squad, must now be a strong candidate to tour. No doubt the selectors will intensify their scrutiny of him, especially when Surrey are at Taunton on Tuesday week on a surface that sometimes resembles what is anticipated in Galle in England’s next Test match.Moeen Ali, the latest No\u0026nbsp3, was a bit more convincing. He was dropped on 14 by KL Rahul, a rare aberration from the best slip fielder of the series, but soon afterwards Moeen was bowled through the gate by a fine delivery from Ravindra Jadeja, who had a busy day at the Oval – earlier he had hit an unbeaten 86.Enter Joe Root who, on a pair, proceeded to produce a regal cameo until the close of play. Immediately he took 10 runs off Jadeja, all from deftly placed cut shots, and there were a couple of princely drives, one down the ground against Shami and an IVA Richards-style whip through midwicket against Jasprit Bumrah. Like Cook, Root was batting with more authority than at any time in the summer. An India pace attack that has performed heroically throughout the series began to look a little weary as two proper batsmen went about their business.Admittedly wickets had also been elusive in the morning, when Root soon rung the changes. He even allowed Adil Rashid an early bowl, his first of the innings, but Hanuma Vihari and Jadeja survived without too much bother. Two edged boundaries to third man by Jadeja did little to enhance Jimmy Anderson’s joie de vivre while Vihari was more in control than on Saturday night and managed to register a worthy half-century in his first Test innings.The solitary wicket fell to the rejuvenated Moeen, who dismissed Vihari just before lunch. He found the outside edge and Jonny Bairstow held a fine catch, which applies to just about every one taken by a keeper when standing up to the wicket. After the break Ishant Sharma fell in identical fashion. At a guess these deliveries were off-breaks that declined to turn but Moeen, the least Macchiavellian of spinners, should not tell anybody. Instead he should allow any notion that he has discovered an extremely cunning drifter, “Mo’s meanderer”, to persist.Soon afterwards Jadeja reached his half-century, which is always an occasion. He dusted off his bat, now transformed in everyone’s mind into a gleaming sword, and then he performed his traditional dance, which requires iron wrists and considerable chutzpah. The England players did not seem to enjoy this much but everyone else at the Oval did.Shami, one of the least calculating batsmen in the world, quickly holed out to Broad at long-on against Rashid. Next ball Bumrah was dropped by Jennings at silly point, which was an expensive error. Bumrah did not score any runs before he was run out but by then Jadeja had conjured another 32 from the last-wicket partnership, during which the taking of the second new ball proved a waste of money."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e16e0125de026719e6331c532a2d3c5c042f9be/0_277_4247_2547/master/4247.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8360055e34219c022a2b288fd62e4e21","title":"arthur ashe legacy activism tennis","story":"We remember Ashe for his electrifying talent. But he had a social conscience that was way ahead of its timeFifty years ago this week, Arthur Ashe shocked the tennis world by winning the men’s singles at the first US Open.No one had expected a fifth-seeded, 25-year-old amateur on temporary leave from the army to come out on top in a field that included the world’s best pro players. The era of Open tennis, in which both amateurs and professionals competed, was only four months old. Many feared that mixing the two groups was a mistake. Yet Ashe, with help from a string of upsets that eliminated the top four seeds, defeated the Dutchman Tom Okker in the championship match – in the process becoming the first black man to reach the highest echelon of amateur tennis.As an amateur, Ashe could not accept the champion’s prize money of $14,000. But the lost income proved inconsequential in light of the other benefits that came in the wake of his historic performance.He became not only as a bona fide sports star but also a citizen activist with important things to contribute to society and a platform to do so. Ashe began to speak out on questions of social and economic justice.Earlier in the year, the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy had shocked Ashe out of his youthful reticence to become involved in the struggle for civil rights. Over the next 25 years, he worked tirelessly as an advocate for civil and human rights, a role model for athletes interested in more than fame and fortune.“From what we get, we can make a living,” he counseled. “What we give, however, makes a life.”Ashe’s 1968 win was truly impressive but his finest moment at the Open came, arguably, in 1992, four and a half months after the public disclosure that he had Aids and nearly a decade after he contracted HIV during a blood transfusion. If we apply Ashe’s professed standard of success, which placed social and political reform well above athletic achievement, the 25th US Open, not the first, is the tournament most deserving of commemoration. Without picking up a racket, he managed to demonstrate a moral leadership that far transcended the world of sports.On 30 August, on the eve of the first round, a substantial portion of the professional tennis community rallied behind the stricken champion’s effort to raise funds for the new Arthur Ashe Foundation for the Defeat of Aids (AAFDA). The celebrity-studded event, the Arthur Ashe Aids Tennis Challenge, drew a huge crowd and nine of the game’s biggest stars. The support was unprecedented, leading one reporter to marvel: “The tennis world is known by and large as a selfish, privileged world, one crammed with factions and egos. So what is happening at the Open is unthinkable: gender and nationality and politics will take a back seat to a full-fledged effort to support Ashe.”Participants included CBS correspondent Mike Wallace, then New York City mayor David Dinkins and two of tennis’s biggest celebrities, the up-and-coming star Andre Agassi and the four-time Open champion John McEnroe, who entertained the crowd by clowning their way through a long set. To Ashe’s delight, McEnroe, once known as the “Superbrat” of tennis, even put on a joke tantrum against the umpire.Several days earlier, on a more serious note, McEnroe had spoken for many of his peers in explaining why he felt passionate about Ashe’s cause.“It’s not something you can even think twice about when you’re asked to help,” he insisted. “The fact that the disease has happened to a tennis player certainly strikes home with all of us. I’m just glad someone finally organized the tennis community like this, and obviously it took someone like Arthur to do it.”Ashe was thrilled with the response to the Aids Challenge, which raised $114,000 for the AAFDA. One man walked up and casually handed him a personal check for $25,000. Later in the week the foundation received $30,000 from an anonymous donor in North Carolina. Such generosity was what Ashe had hoped to inspire, and when virtually all of the US Open players complied with the foundation’s request to attach a special patch – “a red ribbon centered by a tiny yellow tennis ball” – to their outfits as a symbolic show of support for Aids victims, he knew he had started something important.This awakening of social responsibility – among a group of athletes not typically known for political courage – was deeply gratifying to a man whose previous calls to action had been largely ignored. Seven years earlier he was fired as captain of the US Davis Cup team in part because leaders were uncomfortable with his growing political activism, especially his arrest during an anti-apartheid demonstration outside a South African embassy. This rebuke did not shake his belief in active citizenship as a bedrock principle, however, and as the 1992 Open drew to a close he demonstrated just how seriously he regarded personal commitment to social justice.When his lifelong friend and anti-apartheid ally Randall Robinson asked Ashe to come to Washington for a protest march he immediately said yes, even though the march was scheduled four days before the end of the Open. The march concerned an issue that had become deeply important to Ashe: the Bush administration’s discriminatory treatment of Haitian refugees seeking asylum in the US. With more than 2,000 other protesters, Ashe gathered in front of the White House to seek justice for the growing mass of Haitian “boat people” being forcibly repatriated without a hearing.In stark contrast to the warm reception accorded Cuban refugees fleeing Castro’s communist regime, the dark-skinned boat people were denied refuge due to a blanket ruling that Haitians, unlike Cubans, were economic migrants undeserving of political asylum. To Ashe and the organizers of the White House protest, this double standard – which flew in the face of the political realities of both islands – smacked of racism.“The argument incensed me,” Ashe wrote. “Undoubtedly, many of the people picked up were economic refugees, but many were not.”Ashe knew a great deal about Haiti: he had read widely and deeply about the island’s troubled past he had visited on several occasions he and his wife had even honeymooned there in 1977. More recently, he had monitored the truncated career of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, a self-styled champion of the poor whose regime was toppled by a military coup with the tacit support of the Bush administration. Ashe felt compelled to speak out.“I was prepared to be arrested to protest this injustice,” he said.Considering his medical condition, he had no business being at a protest certainly no one would have blamed him if he had begged off. No one, that is, but himself. At the appointed hour, he arrived at the protest site in jeans, T-shirt and straw hat, a human scarecrow reduced to 128lbs on his 6ft 1in frame, but resolute as ever. Big, bold letters on his shirt read: “Haitians Locked Out Because They’re Black.”The throng included a handful of celebrities, but Ashe alone represented the sports world. He didn’t want to be treated as a celebrity, of course he simply wanted to make a statement about the responsibilities of democratic citizenship. While he knew his presence was largely symbolic, he hoped to set an example.Putting oneself at risk for a good cause, he assured one reporter, “does wonders for your outlook … Marching in a protest is a liberating experience. It’s cathartic. It’s one of the great moments you can have in your life.”Since federal law prohibited large demonstrations close to the White House, the organizers expected arrests. The police did not disappoint: nearly 100 demonstrators, including Ashe, were arrested, handcuffed and carted away. Ashe, despite his physical condition, asked for and received no favors. After paying his fine and calling his wife Jeanne to assure her he was all right, he took the late afternoon train back to New York.The next night, while sitting on his couch watching the nightly news, he felt a sharp pain in his sternum. Tests revealed he had suffered a mild heart attack, the second of his life. Prior to the trip to Washington, Jeanne had worried something like this might happen. But she knew her husband was never one to play it safe when something important was on the line.On the tennis court, he had always been prone to fits of reckless play, going for broke with shots that defied logic or sense. Off the court, particularly in his later years, Arthur Ashe almost always went full-out. He did so not because he craved activity for its own sake but rather because he wanted to live a virtuous and productive life. Even near the end, weakened by disease, he still wanted to make a difference. And he did, as he always did."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c62c3b47d8cb42870943dea832460df77eb70483/0_200_5519_3313/master/5519.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6397c766a4279ce4e69e26888be85014","title":"julian alaphilippe tour britain win streets london","story":"• Australian Caleb Ewan takes final stage in centre of capital• Alaphilippe among favourites for Road World ChampionshipJulian Alaphilippe brushed shoulders at high speed with the Italian Paolo Simion just metres from the finish in Lower Regent Street, but that was as nervous as the final stage of the Tour of Britain got for the Frenchman, who clinched overall victory as expected and will be hotly tipped to win the Road World Championships in Innsbruck in three weeks’ time.The Australian sprinter Caleb Ewan needed to salvage something – anything – from a bitterly disappointing season, and he was ecstatic after emphatically repeating his central London win of 2016 ahead of Fernando Gaviria and André Greipel. His last victory of any note was the Almeria Classic in February, which is an eternity ago for an ambitious young rider.Two years ago Ewan was still emerging as a sprinter, but this victory had a very different backdrop: his surprise non-selection for the Mitchelton-Scott’s Tour de France team, his public disappointment, and his obvious desire to get the season finished and move on, he hopes, to happier times with the Belgian squad Lotto-Soudal.The central London stage was as spectacular as ever, with crowds estimated by police at 150,000 lining the 5.5-km circuit, taking in Whitehall, Trafalgar Square, Piccadilly Circus and Regent Street.The field stayed largely together in a single high-speed string, with breakaway attempts short-lived due to the high speed and the constant succession of tight corners. The 77km were marked by the sight of Chris Froome in one escape – a rare event in a flat race – and a tight battle for the intermediate sprints jersey between the British riders Matt Holmes and Ben Paton, with the latter ultimately successful.Alaphilippe had looked a likely overall winner from one particular moment last Monday in Devon, when he surged out of the main group on the Challacombe climb in pursuit of Hugh Carthy, and closed a 30sec gap on the Preston rider in just over a kilometre. That made it obvious he was the strongest climber on the race. He followed up with a stage win in Bristol from a select lead group of around 30 in a finish made for the stronger riders, before taking the yellow jersey at the summit finish on Whinlatter Pass in the Lakes on Friday.The Frenchman’s career has been disrupted by glandular fever in 2015 and a major knee injury in 2017, but his victory tally for the year is now into double figures, quite something for a rider who is not a specialist sprinter. It also continued the dominance of his Quick-Step Floors team, now heading remorselessly towards 70 wins for 2018.He has lost no momentum since his triumphant July, where he landed two mountain stages and the best climber’s prize in the Tour de France, following through with the San Sebastián Classic. With 20 days until the Road World Championships, on a particularly hilly course, victory on British roads earmarks Alaphilippe as one of the favourites.Alaphilippe had almost a month away from racing and began training only shortly before travelling to Britain, hence his surprise. “It’s about being fresh again, on top of the form I had before I took the break, so I feel so good. It’s just really enjoyable, it’s all a bonus and I hope I can keep going like this right up to the world championships and maybe get even better.”Froome and Geraint Thomas drew immense crowds all week. On Sunday afternoon, the fans had a chance to hear this year’s Tour de France winner announce that he has signed with Team Sky for another three years, before nipping up to their bike supplier’s central London store to pore over jerseys and winners’ trophies from the last three grand tours, and the machines they were won on.While the two Tour winners were riding out their last race of the season and were low-key presences on the road, the home riders have enjoyed a good week. Saturday’s stage win marked Ian Stannard’s return to something like his old self, while the young Great Britain team showed no inhibitions alongside the World Tour riders, with Ethan Hayter particularly strong for a 19-year-old.The Londoner’s fifth place in Sunday’s finish underlined that, as did his team’s ambition in leading out the sprint on the final lap. But for other Britons the future seems less rosy, with several domestic teams likely to be shutting down at the end of the season.Geraint Thomas has signed a three-year contract extension with Team Sky, ending speculation that the Tour de France champion could seek a leader’s role with another outfit. “I’m pleased it’s sorted - and delighted to be staying with the team,” the 32-year-old Welshman said. “It’s been a great journey for me with Team Sky and the last few months have been crazy.” Thomas joined Sky in 2010 and his contract was due to expire at the end of the year. Last month he said he was open to listening to offers from other teams.

This week brings the 40th anniversary of Wiltshire’s landmark achievement and she is dismayed by the lack of progress that women have since been able to make.“The only way to fast-track that is a quota system. If the trainers aren’t going to give women chances at a higher level, perhaps that’s the only way.”While Wiltshire would like the sport to insist on female participation in the very best races, she does not deny the practical difficulties facing such a scheme, for which an inventive solution would be required. “Do you say there’s got to be at least one woman jockey in each Classic or Group race? It’s very difficult.” But she feels action is now required and is not in favour of the French solution of a weight allowance for horses ridden by women, as she dislikes the implication that female jockeys might be less capable and in need of some kind of advantage.Wiltshire’s win, on The Goldstone at Salisbury on 14 September 1978, gets remarkably little attention in view of its significance. The annual Leger Legends race, in which the runners are ridden by retired jockeys, is due to take place at Doncaster on Wednesday, just two days before the 40th anniversary of her success, but she has not been invited to take part in this or any previous year.In part, she suggests, this is because she was discouraged from seeking publicity at the time. “The papers would want you in a bikini,” she was told by senior staff at the stable of Bill Wightman, to whom she was apprenticed. Remarkably, a report on the Salisbury action in the following day’s Sporting Life did not mention The Goldstone’s jockey.Wiltshire is less shy of publicity now. She gave a long interview to the Racing Paper last week, and has begun work on a book. “I feel people have got to know the history because it shows how long it’s been and that women should have progressed a lot more than they have.”Wiltshire recalls that, at Wightman’s insistence, she cut her hair short, wore no make-up and generally avoided calling attention to herself as different from her male rivals.

A grey, slightly damp afternoon in Eccles is not the most reliably irresistible of televisual backdrops and comparisons with Manchester’s round-ball theatre of dreams up the road were less than striking.Pending the day they change the laws completely, however, rugby beauty still resides in the eye of the beholder. For Sale this was a decidedly welcome outcome, a relieving win to banish the opening weekend disappointment the Sharks endured at Harlequins. For Worcester, 18-0 down at the interval, there was at least the consolation of a second losing bonus point in successive weeks as a reward for their trip north.This will not be the easiest place to come when Chris Ashton, Faf de Klerk and James O’Connor are restored to the Sale lineup, with Jono Ross always a willing presence in the back row and both Marland Yarde and Denny Solomona looking dangerous on the wings in front of the watching England head coach, Eddie Jones. On this occasion they were also indebted to the fit-again Josh Beaumont, the scorer of their opening try, and fly-half AJ\u0026nbspMacGinty, a calming tactical presence who also kicked 11 points.Then again, as the Sharks’ director of rugby, Steve Diamond, was quick to point out, tougher obstacles than Worcester still lie ahead. Sale’s defence was frequently excellent but it will need to be even better at Exeter, the early leaders, on Saturday. “If we play like we did in the second half we’ll get killed at Exeter,” said Diamond. “We made the mistake of underestimating Quins last week and we got put back on the coach with tears in our eyes. It was embarrassing and won’t happen again.”The competitiveness of the league is certainly on the increase, with the race to avoid bottom set to be as intense as it has ever been. Before it sits contentedly back puffing on a big fat cigar and counting its potential idends, however, professional rugby really needs to get its act together in terms of the consistency of its concussion protocols.Nowadays if a player is visibly knocked cold the consequence should be permanent removal. The sight of Nick Schonert, Worcester’s tighthead, returning to the field having apparently lost consciousness for several seconds following a nasty first-half collision therefore raised a number of questions, particularly as each Premiership club is now supposed to have a dedicated pitchside video reviewer with access to eight different camera angles.Worcester’s Alan Solomons said he had not seen the incident but his opposite number was more forthcoming. “I thought it was strange he came back on,” said Diamond. “He did look as if he’d had a bad knock but we trust the fact their medical people know what they’re doing.”There was also the grim case of the 38 fruitless phases during which the Warriors, on the verge of half-time, were guilty of one of the most brainless attacking “red zone” sequences. Endless one-out passes inviting yet another poor sap to run straight into the exact same brick wall is not only dull thinking but reliably ineffective, particularly against muscled-up modern defences. The only possible conclusion was that Worcester’s forwards did not entirely trust their backs not to mess it up, hardly a good sign just two weeks into a new season.Their second-half revival, consequently, was more than a touch unexpected given Sale’s comfortable early cushion. A clever swivel pass from Yarde had set up Beaumont for the home side’s first try before Solomona intercepted an attempted long pass from Ryan Mills to extend the margin even further. Diamond insisted there was no complacency – “We weren’t swinging from the chandeliers at half-time” – but tries from Bryce Heem and Chris Pennell ensured a tauter finish than anyone could have envisaged.It might have been closer still had Jonny Arr’s close-range lunge for the goalpost padding been given the green light by the television match official, rather than being adjudged a fraction short. Worcester did come away with three points via a consolatory penalty but, after losing a winnable game at home to Wasps in\u0026nbspround one, Solomons wants to see\u0026nbspgreater accuracy.The marketers who think English club rugby union could soon be wowing huge new audiences in China and the US every week should not get too far ahead of themselves just yet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f5c67a1a2ba025a64360ba3d914b1b7d238e73c/0_248_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01364e8e1fb81ba8bb5868707c4cf427","title":"nfl stadium food 2018","story":"With the National Football League season kicking off this week, here’s a sampling of what the fans will be eating in the stands"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9a8d8bb88911aa3e2068df57390c4d89803f822/916_410_4524_2715/master/4524.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6c0efa3819a6c8e86b9de534be5038b","title":"england v india fifth test day three live","story":"Alastair Cook moved to 46 not out in his final innings as an international cricketer on day three of England’s fifth Test against IndiaRead Vic Marks’s report from The Oval:England win the final session. The visitors did very well to add 118 runs either side of lunch to win the opening half of the day, largely thanks to Jadeja’s 86, but the home side have taken control of the final session, swelling their first innings lead from 40 to 154 by the close. The best news of all is that Cook will continue his final Test innings at 11am tomorrow, not out on 46. His captain, Root, is batting very nicely and will resume on 29. The bad news is that battling opener Jennings (10) was bowled without offering a shot and Moeen Ali, the new number three, was bowled through the gate by his opposite number for 20. But in terms of where this game is positioned with two days to go, they are well placed to stick the landing and take the series 4-1. That’s it for me. I’ll be back with you tomorrow, alongside Rob Smyth. Have a nice night. Bye! 43rd over: England 114-2 (Cook 46, Root 29) Six balls for Cook to navigate to reach stumps and the first of those beats him! By the proverbial coat of varnish, no less, the TV replay confirms. Wow. Bumrah has the chance to make life difficult for the opener but instead gives him one on the pads next up, which he tucks away with glee to get down the other end. That’s the way! There was no urgency for a second run from the retiring man - he is very happy to leave the rest to his skipper and he does it well, even taking a single past point to finish. Stumps!42nd over: England 112-2 (Cook 45, Root 28) Jadeja begins his over at 6:27pm and concludes it at 6:28pm. There is nobody better in world cricket to have the ball in their hands when you want to sneak an extra one in, and India have. From the final delivery, he slips past Root’s defence - possibly into an edge? - but it isn’t gloved. Maiden.41st over: England 112-2 (Cook 45, Root 28) Half a shout from Bumrah for leg before but it has struck Cook after pitching outside leg. He gets off strike with a compact push to cover from the next ball - the job is almost done now. Root picks up one to backward square, leaving Cook one ball to negotiate and it ends up down at the rope for four byes after swinging wildly past the wicketkeeper Pant! At the end of the over, Root calls for the twelfth man to bring out some bat tape. That’s a new way to kill a minute close to stumps. 40th over: England 106-2 (Cook 44, Root 27) It is Jadeja, in what will be his penultimate offering of the evening, returns to the attack in place of Shami. I’m not sure about that - why take off the bloke who has caused Cook nightmares? Anyway, the veteran does it well in defence before nudging a single to keep the strike. He knows the plan here, better than just about anyone to ever play the game: no risks, get to stumps. “I didn’t expect him to throw it away but Alastair has clearly been heeding the Dylan Thomas admonition ‘Do not go gentle into that good night’,” says Brian Withington. “Will be interesting to see if he gets the opportunity to ‘rage, rage against the dying of the light’. I expect if it were darker and offered he would take it though and come back in the morning.” If he does, it will mean another capacity crowd tomorrow. Come on, Cookie. Get there.39th over: England 105-2 (Cook 43, Root 27) There is a bit going on here with the ball again requiring a change, so out comes the box. For reasons that I cannot comprehend, people are starting to file out rather than staying to stumps. Anyway, we’re back with a third ball and unlike the second, it doesn’t bring a wicket straight away. Instead, Root deploys his rubbery writsts to flick Bumrah with supreme timing to the rope behind square.“A rhyming haiku for Sir Cookie,” emails Phil Keegan.Cook, batsman uniqueNo sweat, no fear, just techniqueSmile, mission complete38th over: England 101-2 (Cook 43, Root 23) For the second time in his stay Root strikes two boundaries in the over. The first, through the cordon, is nothing to get excited about - Shami again unlucky. But the straight drive that follows is a beaut. With it, England reach three figures and lead by 141 with 20 minutes to the close.37th over: England 92-2 (Cook 43, Root 14) Cook looks liberated by Root’s presence, going very nicely since he walked out. He tucks two early in the new Bumrah over then flicks another single. Root does the same to keep the strike. The hosts are winning this final session, which was important after India took the points earlier in the day.36th over: England 88-2 (Cook 40, Root 13) Shami is back, I am afraid to say. This will be, without doubt, most difficult period ahead of Cook if he is to return on day four to bat again. But he starts well, taking a single to square leg, Root then pushing one down the ground. A third single for the set, again from Cook, finishes it off. And yes, that is to midwicket as well. Cook is into the 40s, only 10 runs away from finishing with a career batting average of 45. I’m fairly invested in that bit of this equation.35th over: England 85-2 (Cook 38, Root 12) It is getting dark at The Oval with all the floodlights now on. But we should be right getting through to the 6:30pm close. Cook is enjoying Bumrah this time around, pushing into the covers with a nice straight blade as though he’s having a net in front of 30,000 people. He also keeps the strike with one around the corner. More tidy batting. 34th over: England 84-2 (Cook 37, Root 12) Ravindra, if you are going to bowl your overs in 60 seconds you aren’t getting much said about you on the OBO. Cook grabs a single to keep the board ticking over, as it has nicely since Root’s arrival.I’ve been asked for the overseas TMS link. A friendly reminder: it is always the same. 33rd over: England 83-2 (Cook 36, Root 12) Five runs from Bumrah, albeit the first coming off Cook’s leading edge but not to hand, then Root off an inside edge when the quick sent an inswinger down. The senior pro is in better shape later in the set with (another) tidy clip for two. He’s into building mode. “A clerihew in honour of Cook,” offers Aditi Capam. Okay, let’s have it:Farewell Alastair “Cookie” CookYou smashed records book by bookDignity, style, grace: you are a good eggBut what I loved most was your selfless fielding at short leg32nd over: England 78-2 (Cook 32, Root 11) Cook (possibly) dropped by Kohli! Nah, TV confirms that he didn’t get any glove on it but the Indian captain couldn’t complete the catch with a ing one-handed effort at leg slip. Still, a nice bit of drama as the crowd thought, for the moments that the ball climbed through the air, that they might be seeing his final moment. The opener is credited a run for it and two other singles are added. “Why is Root wearing stokes shirt?” asks Loretta Bogard. “Do we think they are transforming? Haircut first, shirt next? Or just extended bromance?” I’ll make sure we find out at the press conference after the Test. A good use of a question. 30th over: England 75-2 (Cook 30, Root 10) Cook collects his 99th, 100th and 101st runs of this Test Match with the clip through midwicket that must be responsible for half of his Test runs. They come off Bumrah, who is back into the attack from the Vauxhall End this time around. He nearly castles Root next ball! An inswinger, Root was driving and missing, the ball just avoiding his woodwork on the way through. Phew.A quirky one from James Debens and I’ll go with it: “On the 60th anniversary of Richie Benaud taking up the Australian captaincy in 1958, I’ve bought this splendid figurine of the much-missed voice of cricket. Great stuff.” Bargain at twice the price?30th over: England 72-2 (Cook 27, Root 10) That’s the Joe Root we enjoy most. Much like Steve Smith, at his best, the England skipper is known for getting off to flying starts to immediately transfer the pressure back onto the fielding side after taking a wicket. We haven’t seen that often from him this summer but with two boundaries through point off Jadeja - the second a classic from the balls of his feet - he’s already into double figures. 29th over: England 64-2 (Cook 27, Root 2) Back to Ishant vs Cook, such a fine rivalry over the years. The retiring opener would give anything, I am sure, to go to bed with a fresh day at the crease ahead of him. To do so, he’ll need to get through 16 further overs in this final hour. Make that 15, there is nothing going on here with Cook in control. 28th over: England 64-2 (Cook 27, Root 2) The wicket came the delivery after they changed the ball, which was after Cook took three out to cover earlier in the over. Root, entering on a pair, gets off the mark second ball with a late cut down to third man.Bowled through the gate! It is a lovely delivery from Jadeja bringing Moeen forward to play the wrong line. India’s good day three continues. 27th over: England 59-1 (Cook 24, Moeen Ali 20) Ishant to Moeen now, who gets down the non-strikers’ end early with a tickle fine. Cook looks to drive a couple of times, picking out fielders, but he does get one to square leg from the final ball.“I’ve just had a look at the odds for Strictly with a view to having a flutter, given the good record of former cricketers on Swanny,” writes Michael Keane. “However, having perused the runners and, ahem, gliders, I can tell you that I’ve only heard of 4 of them and I genuinely thought one of them was dead. So I’ll spend the money on a pint instead.”Yes, one thing I did learn last night is that the celebrity status of some of the 2018 participants has been widely questioned. But you can’t be too big and get a gig? Something like that - right?“Have we had a drinks break that I’ve missed?” he continues. “And if not, why didn’t they do it when they looked at the balls. The over rate, even with Jadeja, is a disgrace.”Don’t be daft, of course they didn’t. That would require demonstrating some flexibility and this is cricket. It is drinks now, though. For those catching up, this was the one dismissal of the session so far. And it wasn’t a nice one, Jennings bowled without offering. 26th over: England 57-1 (Cook 23, Moeen Ali 19) Singles for Cook then Moeen off the set-and-forget spin machine that is Jadeja. He gets one to turn big, nearly through Moeen’s gate, but hits him high on the pad. 25th over: England 55-1 (Cook 22, Moeen Ali 18) Moeen is dropped! It’s quick and just to the left of Rahul at second slip, who has caught magnicently this series. Not this time though, the ball going through his hands and down to the rope. Ishant is the unlucky bowler, bringing Moeen forward before skilfully shaping the ball away.“No, Swann will buckle under Oti’s demands as he’s probably a little too self-reliant to learn the finer dancing nuances,” John Starbuck reckons. “I’d like to see The Cat from Red Dwarf (Danny John-Jules who also played one of Maid Marian’s Merry Men - you do have a lot to catch up with) succeed, though he might be distracted by the glitter.”24th over: England 51-1 (Cook 22, Moeen Ali 14) The England 50 is raised with a push to point from Cook for one. Moeen keeps the strike with a single of his own off Jadeja, through midwicket. The daily briefing is in from the cool stats dudes at CricViz. 23rd over: England 49-1 (Cook 21, Moeen Ali 13) Shami is out of the attack! Maybe it was Cook’s perfect on-drive from the final delivery of his previous over that did it. The respite is only minor, with Ishant Sharma now back into the attack with all his experience and all his success against Cook in particular. But still, they can take plenty from surviving a spell that deserved to collect a lot more than 120. Moeen is happy enough in defensive mode, much as he was on Friday. Good batting. At the end of the over the box of balls comes out, suggesting that the current rock is out of shape. While we wait, how’s Swanny going to go? “If he’s anything like as fleet-footed as Fast Eddie Hemmings is on the salsa dance floor, then Swanny is evens to scoop up the Strictly gong,” emails James Debens. “Goughie and Ramps both won the comp at a similar age, and FEH is far more agile than them both - he shimmed under the all-time-lowest limbo in Antigua 25-30 years ago* and is a kabbadi fan.” (*wine-assisted, though)I feel like this is a story I now need to read up on. Thank you for bringing it to my attention.“Swanny isn’t going to win it sort of sums it up,” argues James Tumbridge. “ seems fairly sure it will be Dr Ranj, there is always someone who quickly gets booted out, and unlike Prescott or Ann Widdecombe there wont be any sort of affection or recognition of him as almost no one will have heard of him.”Grim! I’m sure there is a gag here about John Cena. 22nd over: England 49-1 (Cook 21, Moeen Ali 13) Jadeja is playing his part, again scampering through six balls in double time so that the interrogation can continue from the northern end. Moeen picks up a single to keep the strike. Cook can thank him for that.21st over: England 48-1 (Cook 21, Moeen Ali 12) Shami’s eighth over of the spell and he’s showing no signs of dropping off in the slightest, winning an outside edge form Moeen - albeit through the cordon for four, of course - then cutting him in half on the inside edge when moving it the other way. Quite magnificent. As is Cook’s on-drive to end the over, running away to the rope. With the shot he passes 12,345 and moves to 12,346. It is a stroke reminiscent, as Boycott says on TMS, of those he played in Melbourne during last year’s Boxing Day Test. 20th over: England 38-1 (Cook 16, Moeen Ali 8) Moeen takes one down the ground to begin. Cook changes gears against Jadeja, trying to sweep the spinner a few times in a row without making contact. Reverting to the straight bat, he then also grabs one to mid-on before Moeen finishes with a couple turned out to midwicket. That’ll do. The lead is 78, by the way.“They should call Mohammed Shami “Bono”,” writes Anthony Bradley. “As he plays so often with The Edge.” Very good. I’ve taken to referring to him around the press box as DJ Shami.19th over: England 34-1 (Cook 15, Moeen Ali 5) I don’t need to tell you that Shami beat Cook again outside the off-stump, do I? The opener responds well with a compact clip through his happy region for two but is beaten again by the final delivery. It isn’t fair, of course, but he’s bowling too well and moving it too much. 18th over: England 32-1 (Cook 13, Moeen Ali 5) Another maiden from Bumrah, who has conceded just five runs in five overs. Moeen looks to have enough of the pieces in enough of the right places to make this a decent stay at the crease here. We’ll see.“Barber’s Adagio was Platoon,” says Danny Ecclestone. It is fair to say quite a few of you have dropped me a line to relay this and I’m glad to set the record straight. “But its distillation of unbearable futility might have suited the Jennings dismissal better than Cook’s retirement.” In an effort not to kick a bloke (too much!) when he’s down, I’m going to take that as a comment. He’s a really nice bloke, so I hope he finds a way to make it work. 17th over: England 32-1 (Cook 13, Moeen Ali 5) Cook has to find a way to get out of this Shami shift or he won’t be adding to his 13 runs. His outstanding spell, running away from us at the Vauxhall End, includes two further deliveries that Cook plays out without making contact outside the off-stump. Granted, the second of those he could have let go comfortably but that’s the nature of the pressure that Shami is building. “Jennings might start the series in Sri Lanka (even though I would drop him without hesitation) but England surely have to take a genuine third opener and not rely on Mo or Vince to do it once Jennings fails once more,” says Kevin Wilson “With a few Championship games to go, someone could really sneak in at the last moment.”True. Burns is a certain starter, it would seem. But there is a bit of a race to the finish line for other openers around the country. A couple of big hits and they get to visit Kandy, which is one of my favourite places in the world. Incentive enough. 16th over: England 32-1 (Cook 13, Moeen Ali 5) Jas Bumrah’s back and you’re gonna be in trouble  Hey-la-day-la Jas Bumrah’s back. On theme, no? Moeen does a good job defending his first over back as the big quick works into the fresh spell. Maiden.15th over: England 32-1 (Cook 13, Moeen Ali 5) Shami to Cook remains compelling viewing. By my count, he went by the champion’s outside edge six times before tea - as you do. And sure enough, he’s at it again this time around with a ball that Cook simply had to play at. The good news is that when Cook is getting bat on ball, it is hitting the middle.“A bit unlikely, Boris Johnson actually singing the national anthem as if he meant it, when he’d want it to be something like God Save Me,” quips John Starbuck. “I understand Graeme Swann will be giving us his samba in a couple of weeks, providing analysts with a lot of data about using his feet properly. We already know he has some affinity for dance and music, being not only a famous Sprinkle Dancer, but also posing as Dr Comfort \u0026amp the Lurid Revelations.”My girlfriend had to school me on the finer points of Strictly last night as I’ve never watched it. My view on this, of course, means absolutely nothing. But does anyone who knows the programme have a feel for whether he’s going to run the table and win it?14th over: England 32-1 (Cook 13, Moeen Ali 5) Moeen is away with a lovely sweep off Jadeja, nailing the timing. But he plays and misses his finger-spinning counterpart later in the set when giving the ball is given a fraction more air. Yep, this should be a good old stoush. “My Shakira-fan wife approves of the Shakira references so far during this afternoon’s commentary,” begins Edmund King, “but suggests there are songs other than “Hips Don’t Lie” that we could use to serenade Cook’s particular batting genius. How about “Cut Me Deep,” which is clearly about all the runs Cook has scored over the years in the backward point area? And then there’s “23,” Shakira’s ode to Keaton Jennings’s test batting average.”After that dismissal, Janice Ian might have the song closer aligned to KJ’s average.13th over: England 27-1 (Cook 13, Moeen Ali 0) Andrew Samson tells us on TMS that Jennings concludes the series with 163 runs at 18.1. He’ll still get a gig in Sri Lanka - I can’t see them starting with two new openers - but he will arrive under immediate pressure. Bowled not offering a shot! It has came back a mile but it doesn’t make it any better to look at on replay. The second time in as many Tests that Jennings has been dismissed shouldering arms. Shami, at long last, is into the book. IS COOK LBW? A carbon copy of the previous over, in that, Jadeja was turned down and convinced Vohli to push the button. And once again, IT IS NOT OUT! Ball tracking confirms that contact was made outside the line, just as it was last time. India, thanks to Jadeja, have burned both of their referrals in the space of six balls. Madness. 12th over: England 27-0 (Cook 13, Jennings 10) Cook defended the first five balls with a degree of ease, patting the spinner on the head out to cover time and again. The unsuccessful lbw shout came when he tried to cut off the back foot, but as the technology confirmed, he was quite right to do so.11th over: England 27-0 (Cook 13, Jennings 10) Keaton’s turn to deal with Shami, which will be cool with Cook. And goodness me he’s done it again, this time beating Jennings with yet another beauty. It juuuust misses the off-stump after passing his blade, doing so much that it also gets through Pant’s gloves too. Four byes. Too good.10th over: England 23-0 (Cook 13, Jennings 10) The usual OBO caveat for when Jadeja is operating: these will be brief updates as there isn’t a bowler in the game who gets through their overs quicker. Jennings gets the sweep straight back out again after it nearly brought him undone earlier in the set, connecting well to pick up two runs. He then keeps the strike from the final ball, carving a single to point.IS JENNINGS OUT LBW? Second ball back after tea, Jadeja is convinced he has him! It has been given not out on the field they have gone upstairs. Stand by... NOT OUT! The ball was spinning back a long way, hitting the left-hander when missing his sweep, but it it made contact with his pad well outside the line of the off-stump. All told, a poor review. Sandwich devoured, ready to go! Not quite Obamaesque as far as slogans go, but it’ll do ahead of this final session as the players return to the field. A reminder that Cook is seven runs away from having 12,345 in his career, which I’ll probably make quite a big deal of ifwhen it happens.“Not sure if the the adagietto from Mahler’s 5th symphony was used in Gallipoli,” begins Pete Wood, “but it was famously used in Visconti’s dreadful overblown, Death in Venice. A film, which from memory, chiefly consisted of an elderly man sitting for hours at a time watching young men besports themselves, much like many of the members of the Oval cricket ground at present. The symphony begins in C minor, befitting, perhaps, the Chef’s final repast.” You’ve been storing that up for a while, I suspect? On music, I caught the finale of The Proms on telly last night after Swanny did his thing on Strictly. Not having lived here for that many years, it was my first experience of it. All I could think of was Boris Johnson at home after his big day at the cricket, sitting on his couch in his pants singing along. Maybe a bit emotional during God Save the Queen? Welcome to my brain.9th over: England 20-0 (Cook 13, Jennings 7) Shami gets the ball in his hand at 3:39pm, so the plan has worked. And boy, it nearly worked big time with Cook beaten three times on the bounce from balls directed in at him from round the wicket before jagging away wildly off the seam. It’s truly outstanding fast bowling from a man who, somehow, is yet to claim a wicket in this Test Match. Cook gets the middle of his bat on the final delivery before the break, the crowd applauding as one. That’s tea! I’ll be back shortly. 8th over: England 18-0 (Cook 12, Jennings 6) While I was tending to your emails, Ravi Jadeja came on and raced through one of his 45-second specials in order to get Shami another chance to bowl another before tea. That’s clever captaincy from Kohli. Both batsmen picked up singles to midwicket along the way. “Think this is the Gallipoli music,” replies Brian Withington. “Also unbearably moving.”‘What are your legs? Steel springs.’ “Brian Withington’s choice of exit music is surely far too morose,” adds Fraser Padmore. “I prefer to imagine Chef walking off (after a 200) into a setting South London sun to the gibberish music at the end of Gladiator, begloved hand brushing golden ears of barley. Presumably off his hips.”Hips don’t lie. And yes, that is the second time I’ve worked that into the OBO this weekend, for the Shakira statisticians out there.5th over: England 6-0 (Cook 4, Jennings 2) Jennings takes a singlewide of mid-off - the first runs off Bumrah today. But it is Cook the crowd are here to see and they respond in style when he gets off the mark with a shot we’ve seen him play a thousand times before: the clip through square leg for four. It races away too, beautifully timed.“Why is it that bowlers are not alternated from one end during a session?” asks Mark Slater, noting that he has also been pushing for ‘keeper rotation session to session in this series. “I would suggest that, say, Anderson and Broad may be used in rotation at one end for their second spell - the ball will still be relatively hard - with perhaps the 5th bowler such as Ali operating at the other end. The quicker bowlers gets to rest for 3 overs, using sweaters to make sure they do not get cold, and then can put together a spell of 8 or more overs each, and the batsmen has to face a rotating attack of two different pacemen plus the guile of a spinner. Any thoughts?”Only that with T20 cricket conditioning bowlers to operate for spells of one over routinely, I’m sure this sort of thing will becoming part of Test cricket soon enough. “I would like Cookie to score 143 and end up with a total of 12,468... because it means getting a century!” Mark adds. If he does, that will be his 33rd, taking him past Steve Waugh. But one thing at a time.6th over: England 10-0 (Cook 5, Jennings 5) A nice clip from Jennings earns him three runs to start the new over, giving the strike back to Cook too. He’s in much better shape than in the previous over where he faced the bowler who has picked him up more than any other, defending with the middle of the bat then leaving confidently. Into the covers, he collects a single from the final ball. 4th over: England 1-0 (Cook 0, Jennings 1) In the air off Cook’s edge but not to hand! Ishant draws the false stroke, landing where a conventional gully would be if they were in position, Michael Vaughan says on TMS. With backward point doing the tidying up, he’s not able to get off the mark from it either. Earlier in the over Ishant beat the outside edge with a ball that hooped a long way from the left-hander from round the wicket. We’ve said it all series but how wonderful have these Indian seamers been? If England do get up here to win the series 4-1 it won’t do these visiting bowlers any justice.3rd over: England 1-0 (Cook 0, Jennings 1) Bumrah gets his first chance at Jennings, a man he has dismissed plenty of times in this series. It’s a good contest from the get-go, the opener getting into position to play before leaving late by pulling inside the line on a couple of occasions. Lovely shape from the Indian attack-leader. “Hankies at the ready,” emails Brian Withington. “Cue Barber’s Adagio for Strings (or the fourth movement from Mahler’s 5th). Very slowly.” I don’t have time to check this, but is that the piece from the final scene in Gallipoli? 2nd over: England 1-0 (Cook 0, Jennings 1) Cook is also within striking distance of Kumar Sangakkara, requiring 75 runs to overtake his career tally. All of this is not to forget Jennings, for whom this is a big afternoon as well. I think it is safe to assume that he is on the plane to Sri Lanka regardless, but what he would give for a meaningful contribution in the final innings of the summer. But he’s nearly edging the first ball with a nervous waft at a ball he did not need to have anything to do with from Ishant Sharma. With that out of the way, he deals competently with the rest, turning a single behind square to open his, and England’s, account.1st over: England 0-0 (Cook 0, Jennings 0) He’s struck on the pad first ball! Half an appeal from the cordon but Bumrah isn’t interested. Blimey - imagine that? Cook deals with the rest in the usual way, defending then leaving with calm. He’s squared up by a good’un but plays with nice, soft hands. Take a breath, everyone.

As with the recent version of A Monster Calls at the Old Vic, however, I found I was less moved by the content than mesmerised by the presentation. For me, it’s the skill of Melly Still’s production, Ana Inés Jabares-Pita’s design and Matt Haskins’ lighting that makes the evening work.Sebold’s novel is not the easiest to stage. It views earthly life from the vantage point of Susie Salmon who, as a 14-year-old, was raped and murdered. In the book we share Susie’s heaven’s-eye view as she witnesses her dad’s possessive grief, her mother’s fretful isolation, her sister’s experiments with sex. While Susie craves the life she has lost, she looks benignly on her old school friends, views the tortured progress of her killer and even becomes, through her unseen presence, a means of healing family isions.Sebold writes at one point that “the line between the living and the dead could be murky and blurred”. Lavery and Still shrewdly seize on this to show Susie moving easily among the earthbound rather than occupying some heavenly perch. While Lavery deftly condenses the action into 100 minutes, what she can’t reproduce is the book’s eye for prosaic detail. In part, this is a story, reminiscent of Thornton Wilder’s Our Town, about American suburban life where the plop of the daily paper on to the porch or a shy boy’s determination to wear gym shorts over his jeans are part of the fabric. Compared with Lavery’s Frozen, which entered the mind of a sexual predator, the killer also seems a one-dimensional figure.What fascinates is the verve with which the story is told. The design is dominated by a vast tilted mirror that gives the audience a dual perspective: at any one moment, we are watching events as they unfold and seeing them reflected from above. Key events are also ingeniously presented. Susie’s rape and murder are evoked through the random dispersal of her clothes and, when her father angrily smashes a snow globe, the cast brandish shards of broken glass. Even the potentially mawkish moment when Susie meets her killer’s fellow victims is subtly done with the actors, like puppeteers, projecting their arms through the dresses of the violated.This is the kind of show that directors such as Sally Cookson and Marianne Elliott have helped make popular: the highly theatrical novel adaptation. I still prefer the messy complexity of original plays, but this piece is extremely well done. Charlotte Beaumont is excellent as Susie in that she eschews cuteness and lends her a teenage stroppiness as well as seething with rage at the police’s incompetence. She even cheerfully announces that “sometimes heaven is a shit-hole, too”. Jack Sandle as a father poleaxed by loss, Emily Bevan as a mother seeking refuge in flight, and Ayoola Smart as a gifted sibling are equally good in a busy 10-strong cast.If I came out of the theatre dry-eyed, I was still impressed by the evening’s ensemble vigour and collective cleverness. • At Royal and Derngate, Northampton, until 22 September.

At category one status on Sunday, it was predicted to reach category four status, with winds of 130mph or more, while moving over the Atlantic.On Sunday morning the storm’s sustained winds reached 75mph, just over the threshold for a hurricane, as it was about 750 miles south-east of Bermuda. It was moving west at 6mph.The National Hurricane Center (NHC) said it was too early to predict the hurricane’s path, but a huge coastal area from northern Florida to North Carolina should prepare for a major hit.Florence was forecast to become a “major hurricane” on Monday, travel between Bermuda and the Bahamas on Tuesday and Wednesday before approaching the south-eastern US coast on Thursday, the Miami-based NHC said.It later added: “All indications are that Florence will be an extremely dangerous category four hurricane while it moves over the western Atlantic toward the south-eastern United States.”A category four storm has the potential to cause catastrophic damage. Officials in the Carolinas warned residents to prepare and to brace for impact. Governors in South Carolina and Virginia declared states of emergency.On Friday, North Carolina governor Roy Cooper urged residents to use the weekend to prepare for the possibility of a natural disaster.“We are entering the peak of hurricane season and we know well the unpredictability and power of these storms,” Cooper said.McMaster told a Sunday news conference people should “pretend, assume, presume that a major hurricane is going to hit right smack dab in the middle of South Carolina and is going to go way inshore”.Residents should count on “a lot of wind and a lot of rain” , he said.\u0026nbspIn Charleston, city officials were offering sandbags for residents to fill.

The US Fleet Forces Command said in a release on Saturday ships would get ready in anticipation of getting under way on Monday to avoid storm damage.Adm Christopher Grady said the decision was based on Florence’s current track, which indicates the area could see strong sustained winds and storm surges.

Navalny was jailed for 30 days on 25 August on a separate protest-related charge in a move that he said was aimed at preventing him from leading the rallies on Sunday.In Moscow, where protesters gathered on the city’s iconic Pushkin Square, about 2,500 people ignored police warnings to disperse. They chanted “Putin is a thief!” and “No increase in the pension age!” Although the demonstration was largely peaceful, violence erupted when some protesters tried to march towards parliament, where they were beaten back by police with truncheons.The protests came as Moscow held mayoral elections that the Kremlin-backed incumbent, Sergei Sobyanin, was expected to win easily. Critics accused officials of barring genuine opposition candidates. Russians also went to the polls in regional elections.Authorities did not give permission for the vast majority of the protests and some Russians told the  they had stayed away because they feared arrest. Dozens of members of Navalny’s opposition movement were detained before the events on charges of organising illegal rallies.Earlier, Navalny’s aides condemned Google after it removed his adverts from YouTube urging Russians to protest against the pension changes.Russian officials sent a letter to Google last month asking it to block Navalny’s videos because it said they were illegal under the country’s election laws, which bar political campaigning 24 hours before elections.Google confirmed it had pulled the videos. “We consider all justified appeals from state bodies. We also require advertisers to act in accordance with the local law and our advertising policies,” the company told the .Leonid Volkov, an aide to Navalny, said Google’s decision “presents a clear case of political censorship.” He said it was the first time the internet firm had complied with a request by Russian authorities to block opposition content. He also accused officials of misleading Google: “The rallies do not have anything to do with the elections.”Under government plans, the age at which Russians can retire and claim a state pension will gradually rise from 60 to 65 for men and from 55 to 60 for women. Putin scaled back the government’s original plans to increase the pension age for women to 63 during a televised address to the nation last month.Putin, who pledged in 2005 that he would never increase the national retirement age while president, says the country risks economic collapse and hyperinflation unless urgent action is taken.The government’s plans are widely unpopular because many Russians fear they will not live to see their pensions. Although life expectancies are rising in Russia, they are still relatively low, especially for men, for whom the average age of death is 66. Russian women can expect to live to 77, but many say widespread discrimination in the workplace means they fear being left without a job or a pension."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/221bab664fbce1cb89742baccf597d8fb399611d/0_56_2888_1734/master/2888.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ef4d65b3f774634b1f28fad827a5af5","title":"greek pm promises relief measures after years of austerity","story":"Alexis Tsipras pledges to raise wages, cut taxes and boost welfare spendingGreek prime minister Alexis Tsipras has announced a raft of relief measures “to mend wounds” created during Greece’s prolonged economic crisis, as he attempts to recover the popularity he has lost since enforcing contentious austerity measures.In his first major policy address since debt-stricken Athens ended more than eight years of foreign tutelage under international bailout in August, the leftist leader pledged to raise wages, cut taxes and forge ahead with welfare spending. Far from backsliding on the fiscal progress the crisis-plagued country has made, the counter measures would help kickstart growth, Tsipras said, hailing a “new era of rebirth”.“Higher wages, labour market regulation and respect for labour rights … are a prerequisite for growth,” he told delegates attending the Thessaloniki International Fair where annual economic policy goals are traditionally laid out.“The Greek economy is stabilised … we are a normal country now.”Other measures ranged from reinstating collective wage bargaining – a highly sensitive point among international creditors who have sought to trim the power of unions – and applying retroactive pay rises worth €1bn for university professors, the police, military and judiciary.Shut out from capital markets, Greece has been forced to rely on emergency rescue funds totalling €288bn – the biggest bailout in global financial history – since run-away deficits triggered its near economic collapse in 2010.In power since 2015, the price for Tsipras and his leftist Syriza party has been enormous even with joblessness easing and the country no longer dependent on bailout aid.With his four-year term due to end next September, the promise of less austerity and improved lifestyles has kicked off a protracted pre-electoral period.On Sunday, in his annual state of the nation press conference, Tsipras said because Greece was “outperforming all fiscal targets” his government would not only meet the new goals but argue that other cuts Athens has committed to were no longer necessary. At the behest of eurozone creditors the government has agreed to further scale back pensions in January 2019.“The economy is doing well,” Tsipras told reporters assembled in Thessaloniki. “I don’t know if you understand that, but the economy is doing well.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b43cc455579bd9c53fb12708cccb04a70a37c40c/353_104_4428_2657/master/4428.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0e904d0055ec36cdd5550dd2cfd0433","title":"swedish election far right on course for sizeable gains in vote","story":"Exit polls suggest Sweden faces uncertain political future, with two main blocs now sitting neck-and-neckThe far-right Sweden Democrats were on course to make sizeable gains in Sweden’s election as exasperated voters retreated from the major parties, leaving the two main blocs neck-and-neck and the country facing weeks of political uncertainty.But the outcome, if the polls are proved correct, leaves the centre-right and centre-left blocs that have defined Swedish politics for decades neck-and neck, and well short of a parliamentary majority in the 349-seat Riksdag.The new government, which could now take weeks to form, will need either cross-bloc alliances between centre-right and centre-left parties, or an accommodation with the Sweden Democrats, long shunned by all the other parties because of their extremist roots, to pass legislation – potentially giving the populists a say in policy.The election was Sweden’s first since the government allowed 163,000 migrants into the country – the most per capita of any European nation – during Europe’s 2015 migration crisis, polarising the nation’s 7.3 million voters and magnifying popular concern about a welfare system many felt was already under strain.Long waits for operations, shortages of doctors and teachers and a police force that has had difficulties dealing with a spate of gangland shootings and grenade attacks – often in deprived areas with high concentrations of immigrants – have all shaken faith in Sweden’s prized model of generous welfare and inclusiveness.The often antagonistic campaign was largely dominated by themes of immigration, integration and welfare, with the Sweden Democrats repeatedly presenting the vote as a straight choice between immigration and welfare spending.“This government we have had ... have prioritised, during these four years, asylum-seekers,” Jimmie Åkesson, the far-right party’s leader, told his final election rally this weekend. “Sweden needs breathing space. We need tight responsible immigration policies.”Casting his ballot in Stockholm on Sunday, Löfven, whose government radically tightened immigration laws in 2015, also described the vote as “a referendum about our welfare”. But, he said: “It is also about decency, about a decent democracy ... and about not letting the Sweden Democrats, an extremist party, a racist party, get any influence in the government.”The centre-right Moderate party leader, Ulf Kristersson, said he was well aware Sweden would need “a strong cross-bloc cooperation to isolate the forces ... pushing for Sweden to withdraw from international cooperation”.Analysts predict long and complicated negotiations are now likely to build a majority, or – more likely – a minority that will not easily be sunk. The Moderate party is determined to oust Löfven, with some openly entertaining the once-unimaginable idea of bringing the Sweden Democrats in from the political cold if that would help.But such a move could spell the end of the centre-right alliance since two of its members, the smaller Liberal and Centre parties, are fiercely opposed to any normalisation of relations with the populists. None of Sweden’s seven other parties will countenance any form of cooperation with the Sweden Democrats.Far-right parties have made significant gains at the expense of the political mainstream across western Europe in recent years in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis and the 2015 refugee crisis, and are now in government in Italy, Austria, Norway and Finland.“Traditional parties have failed to respond to the sense of discontent that exists,” said Magnus Blomgren of Umea University. “That discontent maybe isn’t directly related to unemployment or the economy, but simply a loss of faith in the political system. Sweden isn’t alone in this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cde7cc255696dd9b1d3339c3c3ff6bcc39d02bf0/0_0_4906_3224/master/4906.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f575f875056c1568c341e061d16472b 700w","title":"sweden election live","story":"Follow the latest in Sweden’s general election, as exit polls suggest it is a bad result for mainstream parties while smaller parties make gainsWe are nearly there. Deadlock it is. The far-right Swedish Democrats in Malmo, Sweden’s third largest city, are feeling bullish.There’s some really interesting analysis on tonight’s exit polls on the thelocalsweden liveblog about what Sweden’s next government could look like. Political scientist Stigbjörn Ljunggren says that a government compromising of the Moderate party and the Christian Democrats backed by the support of the Sweden Democrats could take power.He tells their reporter James Savage:If you’re just joining us, take a read of the latest analysis from our European affairs correspondent Jon Henley at the bottom of this post to get up to date. We had the first of two exit polls about an hour and a half ago, which showed stalemate between the left and right blocs and sizeable gains for the far-right Sweden Democrats.But the outcome, if the polls are proved correct, leaves the centre-right and centre-left blocs that have defined Swedish politics for decades neck-and neck, and well short of a parliamentary majority in the 349-seat Riksdag.The new government, which could now take weeks to form, will need either cross-bloc alliances between centre-right and centre-left parties, or an accommodation with the Sweden Democrats, long shunned by all the other parties because of their extremist roots, to pass legislation – potentially giving the populists a say in policy.Read more here:The excitement has boiled over on the Swedish election commission website, which has crashed. The potential permutations required to form a government in Sweden might get complicated in the coming hours. Richard Orange is here to help, however.Polling stations have now closed and votes are being counted. We are expecting a partial tally of the vote from Sweden’s Election Authority between 9pm and 10pm UK time. Final results should follow a couple of hours later. There does not appear to be a Swedish David Dimbleby equivalent who will have to talk into the early hours while results trickle in.Richard Orange has been speaking to the mayor of Malmo following the exit polls. It appears that Sweden’s political parties might take a while to form a government if the exit polls play out as projected. Both the FT’s Nordic and Baltic correspondent Richard Milne and CNN’s Max Foster, who is half Swedish, describe the exit polls as a “dead heat”. Richard Orange notes that the Green party appear to have only just made it to parliament. Political parties in Sweden must get at least 4 percent of the vote to be assigned a seat under their proportional representation system. Here is some important context from journalism professor and  contributor Christian Christensen. The first exit poll is traditionally less accurate. Here is the second exit poll from Swedish Television, traditionally more accurate at predicting the outcome. Both polls appear to show a dead heat between the left and right blocs, with the Social Democrat winning more votes than in 2014 but far less than some had feared. Here’s some immediate reaction from the ’s European affairs correspondent Jon Henley. Forming a new government in Sweden might take some time. But here’s the big news... The anti-immigration, populist Sweden Democrats have done far worse than they had hoped. There was silence in their HQ when the result was announced, according to the FT’s Richard Milne.Here is an extract from Jon Henley’s excellent Sweden election explainer on the complex political situation and what could happen next. Analysts believe that could clear a path for Moderate party leader Ulf Kristersson to become the next prime minister, perhaps at the head of a single-party minority government, with ad hoc, informal support from the Sweden Democrats – for which the far-right party would expect some influence over policy.A strong performance by the Sweden Democrats could create its own problems for the anti-immigration party, however: although it might force mainstream parties to engage, compromising on their fundamental principles for a share of power has rarely won populist parties more votes.Sunday’s vote is the first since the 2015 migrant crisis. Sweden has taken in around 163,000 asylum seekers since then, the most per capita of any EU nation. The issue has proved isive in Sweden, also hitting international headlines. In July, a video from student activist Elin Ersson preventing the deportation of an Afghan asylum seeker from Sweden by refusing to sit down until the man was removed from the flight went viral. Not everyone agrees with Ersson. The Sweden Democrats have done much to capitalise on the discontent and for voter Eleza Blostain, the far-right party must be stopped.Richard Orange is in Malmo speaking to voters for the , some more stylish than others. Emil Jönsson turned up to vote for the Green Party dressed in a jacket, trilby hat and bow tie.“It’s voting day. You have to dress yourself up,” he explained. “It’s a festival like Christmas or Midsummer.”He said he was worried about the situation.“It’s very unclear, it feels pretty scary that so many will vote for the Sweden Democrats.”He said that he would support the Green Party’s leaders if they joined a centre-right bloc to prevent the Sweden Democrats having leverage over the government.“That would be better than that Sweden Democrats have influence,” he said.Mac Tamandi, who came to Sweden from Cameroon 40 years ago, voted earlier in the day at the polling station at Stenkulaskolan, where he works as a janitor.“I haven’t voted for a right-wing party at any rate because they’re after my ass,” he said. “They’re the ones who want to to kick me out of here. They have a different tone now, but I know what they were like in the beginning.

The information was released by the department to Fine Gael Senator Neale Richmond, the chairman of the Seanad’s special committee on Brexit and his party’s EU affairs spokesman in the Seanad.“Such a spike is clearly tied to the Brexit referendum and the uncertainty that has prevailed since the vote,” Mr Richmond said. There are more than 300,000 British nationals living in the State, he said, and estimated that about a third of these would not qualify for an Irish passport through lineage.The Fine Gael senator said many who had applied for Irish citizenship had done so because they were “very worried that they would find themselves high and dry” after the UK leaves the EU next March.“I do get quite a lot of representations, an awful lot of my constituents who are English or Scottish and working in good jobs who are not going back to the UK at this stage,” he said.There was still strong and growing interest in applying for citizenship, even though the cost of applying for citizenship, about €1,100 was the second highest in the EU after Austria, he said. The Department of Foreign Affairs said earlier this year that Brexit was “undoubtedly” the reason behind a 25 per cent rise in applications for Irish passports in the first four months of this year compared with the same period in 2016.

He was said to be in a stable condition.Monkeypox is a rare viral infection, similar to smallpox but not as deadly. It is usually mild and self-limiting with most people recovering within a few weeks, but severe illness and death can occur.It does not spread easily between humans but can be transmitted via close contact. PHE has contacted 50 people it considers to be at risk, including those sitting closest to the patient on the flight from Abuja to Heathrow on Sunday September 2.A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said “all necessary steps” were being taken but that no other personnel had developed symptoms.The initial symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion.In humans, the signs and symptoms of monkeypox are similar to those of smallpox, but usually milderA painful rash with open sores can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body.The rash changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off. If the disease infects the eye it can lead to scarring of the cornea and, in some cases, blindness.Dr Michael Jacobs, clinical director of infection at the Royal Free said: “Monkeypox is, in most cases, a mild condition which will resolve on its own and have no long-term effects on a person’s health. Most people recover within several weeks.Countries reporting monkeypox cases in humans and animals“It is a rare disease caused by monkeypox virus, and has been reported mainly in central and west African countries.“It does not spread easily between people and the risk of transmission to the wider public is very low. We are using strict isolation procedures in hospital to protect our staff and patients.” Dr Nick Phin, deputy director of the national infection service at PHE said:“It is important to emphasise that monkeypox does not spread easily between people and the overall risk to the general public is very low.“Public Health England is following up those who have had close contact with the patient to offer advice and to monitor them as necessary.“PHE and the NHS have well established and robust infection control procedures for dealing with cases of imported infectious disease and these will be strictly followed to minimise the risk of transmission.”Monkeypox was first observed in the 1960s in monkeys brought to Europe from Africa, with the first human case diagnosed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1970.Nigeria is experiencing a particularly virulent outbreak with 89 people infected and six deaths since 2017.Scientists are still unsure if the disease is transmitted by monkeys or via rodents.Please review our commenting policyThe X Factor, week 2 auditions, Sunday: a familiar face returns, Robbie brings his dad and the producers try to make Ayda jealousI\u0026#39ll take lie-detector test over unsigned article, says Mike PenceGreece will not cut pensions or raise taxes, Tsipras says Germany pleads for calm as two Afghans detained over death of 22-year-old man Serena Williams winning the public relations battle after she accused a male US Open umpire of sexismSweden\u0026#39s nationalist party comes second place in elections - exit pollRoyal Navy sailors arrested after drunken fights on Florida shore leave during HMS Queen Elizabeth\u0026#39s first voyageComment: The Last Night of the Proms – why Remain fanatics just don\u0026#39t get itMore than 80 people arrested in Russia pension protestsThe last British army theatre still standing in Germany rises from the ashesThe Humans, Hampstead Theatre, review: tricksy Tony-winning portrait of the \u0026#39just about managing\u0026#39V\u0026ampA Dundee director: New museum is not a London \u0026#39outstation\u0026#39Ruth Davidson to call baby Fionnuala if a girl as she describes \u0026#39fearful and hopeful\u0026#39 IVF pregnancyComment: A no-deal Brexit will cripple Formula 1 and horse racing in Britain, and ministers are totally unpreparedForeign Office accused of failing over corrupt Russian officials using London as a \u0026#39playground\u0026#39North Korea stages huge parade but holds back on top missiles to focus on the economy Comment: Britain is an island of contentment in an EU driven by Brussels to populist revoltUniversities spent £10m on unions in year strikes brought teaching to a standstillWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"used dorks now people notice us swedens nationalists took election","story":"Head down and hands stuffed in his pockets, the leader of Sweden’s nationalist party rolls nervously back and forth on the balls of his feet as he waits backstage at a rally in the working-class town of Motala. As his name is called he jolts into action, strutting onto the stage to roaring applause, wearing a headset microphone and a broad grin.Jimmie Akesson is the fresh new face of Sweden Democrats, a party with roots in neo-Nazi movements that is set to make huge gains in elections this Sunday.According to the some polls, the nationalists could take up to 25 per cent of the vote, making them a potential kingmaker in coalition talks with the country’s centre-right parties.To continue reading this articleStart your free trial of PremiumAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekAccess one Premium article per weekRegister for freeAlready have an account?

The US wants Kim to proceed with denuclearisation first, but North Korea wants its security guaranteed and a peace agreement to formally end the Korean War of 1950-53. North Koreans wave flowers at Kim Jong-un as he surveys their procession from a balconyHowever, the stalemate has been showing signs of softening in recent days. On Friday President Trump told reporters on Air Force One that a personal letter from Kim Jong-un was going to be delivered soon. “I think it’s going to be a positive letter,” he predicted. Earlier the president had tweeted his thanks to Kim for his “unwavering faith” in him, adding “We will get it done together!” in reference to denuclearisation. “Kim and Trump are trading gestures to appease the US Congress and show to the world that the deal is on. And, indeed, the deal is on but Kim will not fully denuclearise,” North Korea analyst Loretta Napoleoni told The . Analysts have repeatedly warned that despite the current thaw on the Korean Peninsula, Kim has never committed to fully surrendering his nuclear weapons.  Jeffrey Lewis, a nonproliferation expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, tweeted that the understated nature of the Pyongyang parade indicated that North Korea “wants a version of the Israel deal.”He explained: “They don’t test nuclear weapons or show them off at parades we pretend they don’t exist.”According to reporters at the scene, the parade was split into two sections, civilian and military. The military segment featured soldiers wearing uniforms from different periods of national history, then switching to civilian groups, ranging from nurses to construction workers alongside colourful floats. Kim Jong-un clasps the hand of Chinese envoy, Li Zhanshu during the paradeKim surveyed the procession from a balcony in Kim Il Sung square, at times locking hands with Li Zhanshu, a senior envoy sent by Xi Jinping, the Chinese president. Foreign delegations from Russia, Syria, Vietnam and African nations reflected Kim’s concerted push this year in terms of promoting his own personal diplomacy and trying to cultivate a more statesman-like image.In a break from recent tradition, he did not address the crowd. Instead Kim Yong Nam, the country’s ceremonial head of state told the audience that North Korea had achieved status as a military power, and would now pursue efforts to strengthen its economy.The anniversary celebrations also mark the revival of North Korea\u0027s iconic mass games after a five-year hiatus. The mass games involve tens of thousands of people performing precisely choreographed dancing in a symbol of national unity.  This year\u0027s spectacle - tickets start at just over $100 and go up to more than $800 per seat - also has a strong economic theme.The X Factor, week 2 auditions, Sunday: a familiar face returns, Robbie brings his dad and the producers try to make Ayda jealousI\u0026#39ll take lie-detector test over unsigned article, says Mike PenceGreece will not cut pensions or raise taxes, Tsipras says Germany pleads for calm as two Afghans detained over death of 22-year-old man Serena Williams winning the public relations battle after she accused a male US Open umpire of sexismSweden\u0026#39s nationalist party comes second place in elections - exit pollRoyal Navy sailors arrested after drunken fights on Florida shore leave during HMS Queen Elizabeth\u0026#39s first voyageComment: The Last Night of the Proms – why Remain fanatics just don\u0026#39t get itMore than 80 people arrested in Russia pension protestsThe last British army theatre still standing in Germany rises from the ashesThe Humans, Hampstead Theatre, review: tricksy Tony-winning portrait of the \u0026#39just about managing\u0026#39V\u0026ampA Dundee director: New museum is not a London \u0026#39outstation\u0026#39Ruth Davidson to call baby Fionnuala if a girl as she describes \u0026#39fearful and hopeful\u0026#39 IVF pregnancyComment: A no-deal Brexit will cripple Formula 1 and horse racing in Britain, and ministers are totally unpreparedForeign Office accused of failing over corrupt Russian officials using London as a \u0026#39playground\u0026#39Universities spent £10m on unions in year strikes brought teaching to a standstillComment: Britain is an island of contentment in an EU driven by Brussels to populist revoltDonald Trump nearly declared war on North Korea with proposed tweet, Bob Woodward book revealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 9 september 2018","story":"Servicemen march during a military parade marking the 70th anniversary of the foundation of North KoreaThe X Factor, week 2 auditions, Sunday: a familiar face returns, Robbie brings his dad and the producers try to make Ayda jealousI\u0026#39ll take lie-detector test over unsigned article, says Mike PenceGreece will not cut pensions or raise taxes, Tsipras says Germany pleads for calm as two Afghans detained over death of 22-year-old man Serena Williams winning the public relations battle after she accused a male US Open umpire of sexismSweden\u0026#39s nationalist party comes second place in elections - exit pollRoyal Navy sailors arrested after drunken fights on Florida shore leave during HMS Queen Elizabeth\u0026#39s first voyageComment: The Last Night of the Proms – why Remain fanatics just don\u0026#39t get itMore than 80 people arrested in Russia pension protestsThe last British army theatre still standing in Germany rises from the ashesThe Humans, Hampstead Theatre, review: tricksy Tony-winning portrait of the \u0026#39just about managing\u0026#39V\u0026ampA Dundee director: New museum is not a London \u0026#39outstation\u0026#39Ruth Davidson to call baby Fionnuala if a girl as she describes \u0026#39fearful and hopeful\u0026#39 IVF pregnancyComment: A no-deal Brexit will cripple Formula 1 and horse racing in Britain, and ministers are totally unpreparedForeign Office accused of failing over corrupt Russian officials using London as a \u0026#39playground\u0026#39North Korea stages huge parade but holds back on top missiles to focus on the economy Comment: Britain is an island of contentment in an EU driven by Brussels to populist revoltUniversities spent £10m on unions in year strikes brought teaching to a standstillDonald Trump nearly declared war on North Korea with proposed tweet, Bob Woodward book revealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/09/09/TELEMMGLPICT000075733407_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqvWdfq-a34Yz0x6lFPidU73BN7wquremafcWvM6jFD-I.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"remain fanatics wrong last night proms think eu europe","story":"The last night is an end-of-term jamboree, which speaks to the BritishThey flooded the Royal Albert Hall for the last night of the Proms with EU flags, and declared it a success.

The attraction is expected to draw visitors from all over the world when it opens on September 15Victoria and Albert MuseumThe director of the new V\u0026ampA Dundee has spoken of the challenges and the thrill of setting up the design museum as it prepares to welcome the public.The Kengo Kuma-designed building will open its doors on Saturday, the striking centrepiece of the ongoing £1 billion regeneration of Dundee\u0027s waterfront.More than a decade after the idea of establishing a V\u0026ampA in Scotland\u0027s fourth city was first discussed, director Philip Long said everything is in place to make it a must-see destination for visitors from all over the world.Mr Long said: There have been lots of challenges along the way, and I\u0027m very pleased and proud that we\u0027ve seen our way through those. The biggest challenge has been the magnitude of the project overall.V\u0026ampA Dundee is not an outstation of the V\u0026ampA in London. As one of the founding partners V\u0026ampA is a core part, but we here in Dundee are a new team that has come together to develop this project and lead it long into future.Philip Long, director of the V\u0026ampA Dundee, who has spoken of the challenges Ð and the \u0026#34thrill\u0026#34 Ð of setting up the design museum as it prepares to welcome the publicMuseum bosses anticipate high volumes of visitors, and entry over the opening weekend is reserved for those who have pre-booked tickets.Access is otherwise free and non-ticketed, with the exception of major touring exhibitions. The first, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, looks at the design and cultural impact of cruise ships and travel.The museum\u0027s Scottish Design Galleries, meanwhile, celebrate the influence of Scottish design at home and abroad, from Beano artwork to Hunter wellies and the Fair Isle jumper.The jewel in the crown is Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0027s Oak Room - the conserved and painstakingly reconstructed interior of Miss Cranston\u0027s Ingram Street tearoom which has been unseen for 50 years.Mr Long, who came to V\u0026ampA Dundee from National Galleries of Scotland, admits that laying his eyes on the exhibit for the first time was quite an emotional moment.He said: It\u0027s one of his great, but lost to view, interiors that is now compete and in the museum.It brings back to public view after nearly 50 years - in fact it\u0027s 70 years since it was used as a tearoom - one of this great architect and designer\u0027s works.I can tell you, it is a thrilling, quite emotional thing to walk in and see after all of these years.The interior is on long-term loan following discussions with Glasgow Museums several years ago.Joanna Norman (left) Senior Curator, V\u0026ampA and Alison Brown Curator, European Decorative Art from 1800 with a scaled model of the Oak Room. The piece which has been unseen for 50 years will be put on public display, in the 150th year of Mackintosh\u0026#39s birthMr Long said: The thing I\u0027m especially proud of is the conservation and restoration of this original Mackintosh room.Mackintosh is, after all, one of the world\u0027s greatest architects and designers and happens to be part of Scotland\u0027s design heritage.When we set about developing the Scottish Design Galleries, one of the things we needed to ensure was to represent Mackintosh as part of the work we were doing.The question has been asked why V\u0026ampA chose Dundee to set up home, but Mr Long suggests it was the city that chose V\u0026ampA. Representatives from the University of Dundee got the ball rolling back in 2007, suggesting to the institution it might like to be part of the waterfront regeneration.Mr Long said: Dundee really gets the importance of cultural facilities and activities as part of the life of its citizens - that\u0027s been clear over the last 20 years through the investment in new organisations like Dundee Contemporary Arts, or whether it\u0027s the ongoing success of places like Dundee Rep Theatre or the Science Centre or the redevelopment of the McManus.All of these things demonstrated to the leadership here that investment in culture is the right thing to do. All of that helped set the scene and the understanding that a discussion about the V\u0026ampA might be a very exciting thing to think about as a new presence on the waterfront.Victoria and Albert MuseumThe X Factor, week 2 auditions, Sunday: a familiar face returns, Robbie brings his dad and the producers try to make Ayda jealousI\u0026#39ll take lie-detector test over unsigned article, says Mike PenceGreece will not cut pensions or raise taxes, Tsipras says Germany pleads for calm as two Afghans detained over death of 22-year-old man Serena Williams winning the public relations battle after she accused a male US Open umpire of sexismSweden\u0026#39s nationalist party comes second place in elections - exit pollRoyal Navy sailors arrested after drunken fights on Florida shore leave during HMS Queen Elizabeth\u0026#39s first voyageComment: The Last Night of the Proms – why Remain fanatics just don\u0026#39t get itMore than 80 people arrested in Russia pension protestsThe last British army theatre still standing in Germany rises from the ashesThe Humans, Hampstead Theatre, review: tricksy Tony-winning portrait of the \u0026#39just about managing\u0026#39Ruth Davidson to call baby Fionnuala if a girl as she describes \u0026#39fearful and hopeful\u0026#39 IVF pregnancyComment: A no-deal Brexit will cripple Formula 1 and horse racing in Britain, and ministers are totally unpreparedForeign Office accused of failing over corrupt Russian officials using London as a \u0026#39playground\u0026#39North Korea stages huge parade but holds back on top missiles to focus on the economy Universities spent £10m on unions in year strikes brought teaching to a standstillComment: Britain is an island of contentment in an EU driven by Brussels to populist revoltDonald Trump nearly declared war on North Korea with proposed tweet, Bob Woodward book revealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/30/15/scarlett-moffatt.jpg","title":"great north run 2018 scarlett moffatt newcastle gofundme sir mo farah","story":"Created with Sketch.She had raised £150 of a projected £5,000 on a GoFundMe\u0026nbsppageClick to followThe Independent CultureFormer Gogglebox star\u0026nbspScarlett Moffatt\u0026nbsphas pulled out of the Great North Run just moments before taking part in the marathon.The 28-year-old has revealed on her GoFundMe page that she will embark on the 13-mile Newcastle\u0026nbspcourse next year instead.Moffatt had raised a total of £150 over the course of three months and initially had hoped to raise £5,000.\u0026nbspUnfortunately, I can no longer take part in this year\u0027s run, she wrote on the fundraising page.

The rupee fell to 71.785 per dollar on Wednesday, although it recovered somewhat to trade at 71.915 to the dollar in early Thursday trading.This follows a previous drop to a record low of 69.62 rupees per dollar last month, in the wake of the Turkish economic crisis.Decline in the rupee came as investors abandoned emerging market assets - EM equities entered a bear market this week, marking a 20 per cent decline from their peak in January. “Investors who have been on the sidelines may think of the selloff as a good opportunity to start accumulating some oversold emerging market assets,” said Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM. “However, the prospects of more US interest rate hikes, and continuing global trade tensions make it difficult to jump in.” \u0026nbspPresident Trump is expected to announce another round of tariffs on $200bn (£155bn) worth of Chinese goods in the coming days. “Going ahead with these tariffs (will) suggest that a full-blown trade war has just kicked off and more pain will be felt across the globe,” Mr Sayed added. John Ferguson, global economist at The Economist Intelligence Unit, said: “Most emerging-market economies should be able to weather this pace of economic tightening, provided that their trading conditions remain favourable. However, investors are on the alert for financial, economic or political weaknesses.”“The turbulence experienced by Argentina and Turkey in mid-2018 is a reminder of how difficult it can be for policymakers to regain market confidence where external imbalances are large and macroeconomic policy frameworks are fragile.”Mr Ferguson added: “For now, a full-blown emerging-market crisis should be averted, but we expect the number of countries seeing their currencies come under pressure to rise over the next two years. It is likely that we will see periods of volatility as the global trade dispute interacts with the shift away from easy money.”Trump’s unrelenting trade war won\u0027t push us into a recessionSouth African rand weakens as economy enters recessionChaos in Turkey feeds fears of wider emerging market crisisMeanwhile, Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, noted that the selloff in emerging markets has spread beyond Turkey and Argentina to some of the developing world’s largest economies such as Russia, Mexico, Indonesia and South Africa - the rand dropped on Wednesday after it emerged the South African economy had entered recession.“These economies are seeing a sharp selloff in both stocks and currencies which is unnerving investors, with fears of contagion sending European shares lower and contributing to a softer open on Wall Street,” said Ms Cincotta. “Whilst Turkey and Argentina started out as the weakest links in the EM space, investors have been shaken and are broadly looking to reduce their exposure with investors questioning which economies are most vulnerable and where is spill over likely.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/30/13/frestonia-1.jpg","title":"frestonia squatters london declare independence uk 1970s free independent","story":"Created with Sketch.The Free Independent Republic of Frestonia was born of a generation who knew counterculture as much as precarious living. Now a new book collects photography and stories from the communityClick to followThe IndependentThe community designed a flag, appointed ministers of state – including actor David Rappaport as foreign minister – made their own postage stamps and issued visas for visitorsThere was a lot of talk, in the wake of the Brexit referendum, suggesting that London should stage its own exit from the United Kingdom, declare independence, and ask to rejoin the EU as a nation state.Ignoring for now the fact that not everyone – though\u0026nbspit might seem that way to London – outside the capital voted to leave the EU, it seemed a satisfying, though jokey, postscript to the Brexit vote. Indeed, more than 180,000 Londoners signed an online petition calling for the mayor, Sadiq\u0026nbspKhan, to “declare London independent, and apply to join the EU –\u0026nbspincluding membership of the Schengen zone”.But what a lot of the signatories might not have realised was that there was indeed a precedent for London seceding from the UK. Or at least, one street of the capital.\u0026nbspWelcome to the Free Independent Republic of Frestonia. Or, what’s left of it, which these days amounts to the Frestonian Gallery, keeping the name and spirit alive of one of the most curious episodes in London’s history. It\u0026nbspbegan on Halloween\u0026nbsp1977, when the residents of Freston Road in Notting Dale, West London, which was largely comprised of squats and communes, declared independence.Threatened with eviction, the squatters said they were no longer part of the UK and appealed to the United Nations to send in peacekeeping forces to prevent Greater London Council turfing them out of the homes they had claimed. They designed a flag, appointed ministers of state, and even made their own postage stamps and issued visas for visitors.The short-lived story of the Free Independent Republic of Frestonia has now been documented in a new book of photographs by one of its residents, the photographer Tony Sleep, who was resident on Freston Road from 1974.\u0026nbspSleep describes the Frestonia experiment as “part publicity stunt, part theatrical protest”, and adds that while it wasn’t a serious attempt to break away from the UK, there was never any need to, because what became Frestonia “was already on a different planet”.He writes in the lavish book: “Frestonia was rooted in the counterculture of the time. The period is now dismissed as little more than daft clothes and hair, accompanied by a great soundtrack and the invention of sex and drugs.“It was, we are told, youthful self indulgence that ended badly because it was irresponsible and naive.”Frestonian Gallery)Frestonia was born out of problems that young people will recognise today: the lack of affordable accommodation. Sleep points out that the millennial generation might have a beef with the baby boomers who grew up in the 1960s and 1970s because they had it easy, and accommodation was cheap and plentiful. Not a bit of it, he says.“Rented flats were in very short supply, and mostly slum standard. You might achieve a rented bedsit as long as you weren’t black, Irish\u0026nbspor a dog. Then, as now, landlords wanted ‘professional’ people.“Council housing lists were only for families, and backlogged for decades. Despite what now seem like absurdly low prices, only the wealthy and secure could obtain mortgages at a time before easy mass debts. Less than half the population owned their own homes at the start of the 1970s.”Freston Road, where squatters and activists founded housing coop and community Frestonia\u0026nbsp(Getty)Many of the houses on Freston Road were empty, having been condemned as unfit for human habitation, and most of the residents had been relocated to the new highrise blocks of flats that began to go up in the 1960s and 1970s. There had been a move to demolish the vacant properties, but residents in neighbouring communities had complained that they would be looking out onto swathes of barren, rubble-strewn land that would encourage flytipping, so the authorities decided to take the cheaper option and just leave the buildings standing for a while.Freston Road might have been abandoned, but that didn’t mean it was unused. From 1974, squatters began to break into the empty houses and set up home there Tony Sleep, aged 24 at that time, was one of them.He recalls:\u0026nbsp“Squatting is distinctly equal opportunity. If you can gain possession, it’s yours. This led to an interesting mix of people who had little in common except needing somewhere to live and being poor for one reason or another. While some tried to make their new homes habitable, several houses were quickly wrecked.”Sleep remembers well his first sight of Freston Road. He’d been living in a “dismal rented basement” in west Kensington, but as he and his girlfriend parted company, he needed somewhere else to live, and heard about a street of empty houses. Some of his friends went to have a look and broke into two of the houses.“That night I paid them a visit,” writes Sleep. “Eight people, four guys, four girls, in one candlelit room, the only one that had windows. There was no toilet, no water, no electricity.”But his friends set to work installing plumbing and wiring as best they could, found an old toilet, rescued carpets and furniture from skips, and Sleep asked if he could move in with them.By 1977 Freston Road had settled into an unorthodox community, of sorts. But the attention of the GLC wandered back to these old, abandoned homes, and the squatters were told that they were to be evicted from these properties.The council offered to place the squatters in what were considered “hard to let” properties dotted around London, and some took the flats –\u0026nbspand, says Sleep, were promptly replaced in Freston Road by other people desperate for somewhere to live.\u0026nbspThe GLC announced its intention to bulldoze Freston Road after all, and a meeting was called, attended by 200 people. They decided – inspired by the Ealing comedy Passport to Pimlico – to go it alone. The Free Independent Republic of Frestonia was born. And the battle was on.The Frestonian National Anthem was written (“Long live Frestonia! Land of the free – not the GLC”) and a community newspaper, The Tribal Messenger, was distributed. Frestonia made the international press, and the Daily Mirror ran a piece declaring “All Hall, Frestonia”. The actor David Rappaport was made foreign minister, and playwright Heathcote Williams became ambassador to the United Kingdom.It was all a bit jolly and, of course, more than a pinch of Ealing comedy. But, Sleep points out, Frestonia was also an interesting way of putting British society under the\u0026nbspmicroscope.“Communities are defined, more or less, by what people have in common,” he writes. “That’s usually class, background or aspiration, sometimes race or religion. What people have in common helps them feel safe and valued. What is different can be threatening or isive.Frestonian Gallery)“Families, on the other hand, are a matter of being stuck with people you sometimes struggle to tolerate, let alone like. Frestonia was a bit of both.“Frestonians were, beneath the veneer of pragmatic anarchy, from different cultures. There were the hippies, idealists of a sort. There were the punks, nihilists of a sort. And there were the itinerant street people, whose lack of youth and lost changes gave them a thread of bitterness to chew on together.”Over the next couple of years, fighting the threat of the GLC bulldozers, the anarchic squat collective organised itself more seriously, forming the Bramley Housing Cooperative with an aim that was less about the fun of independence and more about securing the future of the Freston Road community.Eventually, the GLC won the war, and demolition of the squats began in 1983. But the Bramley Housing Cooperative, working with the Notting Hill Housing Trust, continued to fight for Freston Road as a residential area. And, ultimately, they won.Sleep says, “Frestonia didn’t cease when the squats were demolished. How could it? They were only useful ruins. Frestonia was about the people, its improbable family.“If you walk through Frestonia now, there’s little to suggest it is much different from anywhere else. You’ll find a street of small, but perhaps unusually pretty houses, built in the mid 1980s. They look carefully designed, a bit too inidual to be social housing. You may not notice the enclosed communal gardens, or the sheltered housing scheme that the coop insisted on, you won’t know the coop ensured housing for some of the more vulnerable Frestonians.”It might be that Frestonia would be forgotten all together, but for Tony Sleep’s photographic record of the people, events and houses on Freston Road in the late 1970s and early 1980s.‘Pop-up squat’: Activists occupy property to protest Housing BillNew photography exhibition shows the tough reality of squattingChallenging consumption and overwork in a Danish communityThe name does linger on in the form of the Frestonian Gallery, opened in 2017 by Matt Incledon and Rollo Campbell, who have published Tony Sleep’s photographs and recollections in Welcome To Frestonia.

They write in their foreword: “It was an exhibition unlike anything either of us had worked on previously. Each day at the gallery provided a steady stream of visitors keen to revisit and share their own personal memories of Frestonia. It would be a nice point at which to say ‘We then decided a book of Tony’s work needs to be published...’ but again, in truth, the decision had been made for us already by the sheer emotional response to this unique exhibition.”Was it all worth it for the Frestonians? Did it make a difference? Tony Sleep closes his remarkable document of this time by musing, “Forty years on, the UK seems to have travelled in a large circle and arrived little the wiser, but probably angrier, more cynical and more ided than ever.\u0026nbspWe are all Frestonians, on this small blue dot in the middle of nowhere.

One believes that the Labour leader’s radicalism in this area is a political weakness or a distraction that should be set aside to ensure focus on domestic policy, the party’s strength. The other side takes the view that not only are there important principles at stake, but that in fact Corbyn has some compelling iding lines to draw here with his opponents and predecessors.\u0026nbspSo long as Corbyn remains leader, it is the latter camp that is likely to win out. The prominence of foreign policy is simply an unavoidable fact of life for any British government or opposition, irrespective of any desire to focus on the domestic. The UK is a permanent member of the UN Security Council, a nuclear power, one of a tiny minority of states capable of projecting military power on an intercontinental basis, and one of the largest economies in the world.\u0026nbspCorbyn’s stances in this area will continue to be shaped by his longstanding worldview, and the fact that the recent furore over his participation in a Palestinian wreath laying ceremony in 2014 has had no discernible effect on Labour in the polls means that there is little incentive for him to change course.\u0026nbspIt may be, however, that the underlying premise of this disagreement at the top of the party is a faulty one. Because when we look seriously at the actual substance of Labour’s foreign policy, what we find is not particularly radical. Corbyn’s personal philosophy on international affairs may be sharply different from that of the political class, but the concrete set of policies Labour espouses under his leadership are (to make a strictly analytical rather than a value judgement), mildly reformist, not revolutionary.\u0026nbspLabour’s current policy position is set out in four key texts: Corbyn’s speech to the foreign policy think tank Chatham House in May 2017, his brief speech in response to the Manchester Arena bombing that same month, a speech to the United Nations in Geneva in December 2017, and the party’s 2017 election manifesto. The defining themes throughout are the importance of international law and the UN system, the value of multilateral and inclusive dialogue to avoid or de-escalate conflict, and the urgency of tackling global poverty and inequality. Scholars of international relations looking to categorise this overall stance are likely to find liberal multilateralism –\u0026nbspa conventional tradition in the academic literature –\u0026nbspto be the closest fit.\u0026nbspThis is not to imply any sense of business-as-usual. Corbyn’s strongly sceptical view of western military interventionism, together with his critique of corporate-friendly globalisation, situate his policy platform firmly on the left-hand edge of the liberal multilateralist paradigm, and at odds with a great many of its adherents. But these are hardly off-the-wall positions in the context of numerous western policy failures (from the Iraq war to the financial crisis) over the past two decades, and align to some degree with a growing disquiet in the centre left of established thinking.\u0026nbspOne of Corbyn’s most ostensibly challenging positions was the one articulated after the bombings in Manchester during last year’s general election campaign, when he argued that a connection exists between western military interventions in the context of the “war on terror”\u0026nbspand the persistence of the terrorist threat. Again, within the academic literature on non-state violence this is an entirely mainstream and unremarkable analysis\u0026nbspwhen taken with Corbyn’s acknowledgement of the importance of other factors, such as the ideological outlook of the terrorists and their socioeconomic backgrounds. It is also a common view amongst the general public, with 53 per cent of those subsequently polled agreeing with Corbyn’s analysis versus 24 per cent who disagreed, and with voters across all parties more likely to agree with him than not. What generates near hysteria from media pundits and political opponents elicits merely a shrug elsewhere.“Radicalism”\u0026nbspis a relative term. While the formal foreign policies of Corbyn’s Labour are hardly radical when set against the spectrums of expert or public opinion, the underlying view of the international scene that guides Corbyn personally on these matters is very much at odds with that of the political class, and this perhaps is the real source of tension.AFPGetty)Like many on the left of his generation, Corbyn is a product of the 1960s peace movement, opposition to the Vietnam war, and the global campaign against apartheid. His worldview is one that sees modern international relations – specifically the large imbalances in military power and economic autonomy – as the product of centuries of formal empire, out of which a more informal system of quasi-imperialism has evolved in recent decades.\u0026nbspThis sharply contradicts the conventional wisdom of the political establishment, articulated by former Labour foreign secretary David Miliband, that “if the world is increasingly ided between firefighters and arsonists then Britain has, for centuries, been a firefighter”. Many in the global south do not recognise this version of history, to put it mildly. For them, and for much of the grassroots left in Britain, global north states such as the UK are not inherently benign actors, and have in fact long presented a challenge, and even a danger to, the nations and peoples of the south. Evidently Corbyn shares this view – an authentically radical one in relative if not objective terms – and this rather than his formal policy programme seems to be the actual cause of the resentment from his opponents and detractors. There is a palpable sense that Corbyn is regarded by a significant number of them as not just mistaken but treacherous – his crime being a refusal to uphold the official faith in the inherent virtue of British power in the world.\u0026nbspUK news in picturesGreg Rutherford after his last ever long jump competition as a professional athlete during the Great City Games in Gateshead.

Corbyn’s vision of future UK relations with the global south were set out most clearly in his December 2017 Geneva speech to the UN, where he advocated for British participation in UN peacekeeping missions, a crackdown on tax havens to help protect the fiscal autonomy of developing states, a marked increase in support for refugees, and a stronger response to global warming. There is little reason to suspect that this is a mild veneer disguising a revolutionary reality. Those who knew Corbyn best during his days in the political wilderness affirm that he could never be heard expressing support for violent struggle, with the hard-left former MP George Galloway referring to him rather sniffily as a “woolly Californian”. So even in that area of foreign relations most closely associated with his radicalism – relations with the global south –there is little in his formal policy stances to seriously offend the average genuine liberal, whatever deeper philosophical differences they may have with him.This potential, practical common ground between Corbyn and more pragmatic elements of the centre left is reflected in the resemblance between his preference for dialogue over conflict and that of Barack Obama. In the American context, Obama was the reaction to George W Bush, just as Corbyn was a reaction in the British context to Bush’s valet, Tony Blair. Although each come from different political starting points, they share a scepticism that conflicts can be solved militarily, and a willingness to point to the experiences of the 2000s to underline the point.\u0026nbspObama’s presidency should not be sentimentalised in hindsight, given, to take one example, the active enabling role his administration took in Saudi Arabia’s devastating war on Yemen, and his culpability in the resulting humanitarian disaster. But on Iran at least, Obama took a view (under considerable fire from his opponents) which Corbyn would recognise, namely that diplomacy is most required precisely with people we dislike, and is almost always preferable to military conflict.\u0026nbspHere, Obama’s approach was a direct rebuke to that of his predecessor. When Iran offered a “grand bargain”\u0026nbspto the Bush administration in 2003, offering to withdraw support for Hamas and Hezbollah, sign up to the Arab peace initiative for a two-state settlement to the Israel-Palestine conflict, and submit to nuclear inspections in return for a normalisation of relations, the offer was summarily rejected by Washington on the grounds that “we don’t talk to evil”. It is likely that a lot of subsequent pain in the region could have been avoided had that door not been slammed shut, and Obama’s push for the nuclear deal during his presidency was part of an effort to revive these possibilities, reintegrate Iran into the international system and thus de-escalate wider conflicts and tensions. The other parties to the deal have worked hard to maintain it after President Trump walked away, demonstrating the fact that its strategic wisdom remains widely appreciated.Miliband (pictured with Hillary Clinton) said: ‘If the world is ided between firefighters and arsonists then Britain has\u0026nbspfor centuries\u0026nbspbeen a firefighter’ – a view sharply contradicted by the Labour leader\u0026nbsp(AFPGetty)Obama was notoriously careful about spending political capital, and his drive to secure the Iran deal resulted in weaker stances elsewhere, not least on Israel-Palestine where he showed a consistent unwillingness to apply the serious pressure on Israel that any fair resolution to the conflict will require. Israel-Palestine is the issue area where Corbyn is politically weakest due to Labour’s much discussed problems with anti-Semitism, but his policy stance itself is an entirely conventional one: support for a two-state settlement with “a secure Israel alongside a secure and viable state of Palestine”. Moreover, the wisdom of emphasising diplomacy over the “we don’t talk to evil” approach is clearly one that could be usefully applied to this case.When Hamas won the 2006 Palestinian elections, a hypothetical Prime Minister Corbyn at that time might have urged the west to take the approach it eventually took with Iran on the nuclear issue: one that says “we don’t like your ideology or your policies, but we recognise that it’s better to talk through our problems if possible”. Instead, the new government was cast beyond the pale and sanctioned, leading to a civil war between the key Palestinian parties, the isolation of Gaza, over a decade of immiserating siege, several rounds of devastating violence between Hamas and the Israeli military, and the total collapse of the peace process. The recent acceptance from Hamas of a two-state settlement (a position long in gestation within its leadership) hints at the possibilities of what might have transpired had the diplomatic approach been taken from the start. Again, a good deal of pain over the past decade might have been avoided.\u0026nbspOne of the reasons that Obama, a cautious moderate, arrived at a similar place to the more philosophically radical Corbyn in respect of the question of diplomacy over conflict is the experiences of the past decade and a half in Iraq and Afghanistan, and in Libya on his own watch. While Corbyn and Obama would disagree about whether these ventures were crimes or merely mistakes, the upshot places them in the same reality. The application of western military force is repeatedly showing itself in practice to be a futile and destructive endeavour, making the search for negotiated settlements, even in situations as unpromising as Syria, the more attractive or least unattractive proposition. Whether one likes it or not, the west is apparently unable to impose its will militarily on the global south as it once could, forcing a shift of emphasis to diplomacy irrespective of whether that is taken up with reluctance or enthusiasm.\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn should back a Final Say on the referendumTrump and Obama’s foreign policies are unexpectedly similarThe deeper trends in international relations are also driving in this direction. The end of the Cold War may have given the west a deceptive notion of its own omnipotence, but the slow and steady return of global south powers such as China and India to the levels of international prestige they enjoyed before the ravages of European colonialism only serves to further underline the point that a reliance on mere strength – military, diplomatic or economic – will not serve the global north states well going forward.\u0026nbspAdjusting to these new realities is proving challenging for some in Washington and London. Senior Obama aide Ben Rhodes referred contemptuously to the US foreign policy establishment as “the Blob”, in his frustration with its resistance to his boss’s approach. Across the Atlantic, one senior British general went so far as to threaten a mutiny if Corbyn made any attempt to “emasculate and shrink” the armed forces. Quite the revealing turn of phrase. But the fact remains that the experience of the “war on terror”\u0026nbsphas been a political disaster for Anglo-American militarism, creating space for less chauvinistic figures –\u0026nbspfrom Obama to Ed Miliband to Corbyn – to emerge from various points on the liberal-to-left spectrum, and raising the prospect of some significant policy changes in the future.\u0026nbspNotwithstanding the current right-wing moment in both the UK and the US, the long-term demographic trends point to an inexorable shift in the political balance of power in favour of the Democratic and Labour parties, both of whom have been experiencing internal left-wing insurgencies to varying degrees. There is now a fair prospect of a future President Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren making some degree of common cause on the international stage with a future Prime Minister Corbyn. And while this would not herald a strictly revolutionary change in Anglo-American foreign relations, it would represent a very real and important departure from the days of Bush and Blair.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2016/10/20/16/qi-toksvig.jpg","title":"sandi toksvig qi equal pay stephen fry alan davies","story":"Created with Sketch.\u0027I temper this with the fact I love this show and am the first woman to host such a show\u0027Click to followThe Independent CultureSandi Toksvig has revealed she receives less than half of Stephen Fry’s fee for hosting the BBC show QI.While presenting an economics session at the Women’s Equality party conference on Saturday, the 59-year-old\u0026nbspwas questioned about her pay.Toksvig told an audibly shocked audience that she is paid 40 per cent\u0026nbspof what Fry – who previously hosted QI – was paid. She\u0026nbspreceives\u0026nbspa figure equal to Alan Davies, the show’s regular panellist.“I took over in 2016,” she told the\u0026nbspaudience.\u0026nbsp”I didn’t know the facts about pay transparency and I also never wanted the argument about me, because I spent my life trying to fight for the greater good. I have a nice living and I do very well, So I was much keener to focus on the women in supermarkets.\u0026nbsp“I get 40 per cent\u0026nbspof what Stephen used to get and I get the same pay as Alan Davies who is one of the hosts. I temper this with the fact I love this show and am the first woman to host such a show.”Catherine Mayer,\u0026nbspwho co-founded the\u0026nbspWomen’s Equality party with\u0026nbspToksvig\u0026nbspin 2015, tweeted a video of the comedian making the revelation on stage.“People just did not know,” Mayer she told . “Sandi has always been clear that this is not about her pay, but she had to answer the question given that the issue of equal pay is at the centre of our party’s policy.”Toksvig\u0026nbspsaid after the event:\u0026nbsp“I love QI and the brilliant team who produce it. John Lloyd and the team champion women on the show. I was asked a question at the Women’s Equality party conference that I felt I had to answer, because the issues with equal pay and the gender pay gap cut right across the media and all industries and all areas of life.“Until now I had held back from talking about this because this is not about me. However, the lack of transparency around pay is a big part of the problem and I hope that being open, I can support women across the country whose work is undervalued.”Questioned about whether she would demand the same pay as Fry by Radio Times\u0026nbspin 2016,\u0026nbspToksvig\u0026nbspsaid: “If you are doing the same job it seems a bit absurd if you’re not paid the same.”The current Great British Bake Off presenter later told BBC Radio 5 that she does not worry about the disparity. “I wasn’t concerned about that because it is done through an agent\u0026nbspand I am paid by an independent production company that makes the show, and not the BBC anyway,” she said.Before taking over QI,\u0026nbspToksvig\u0026nbspwas a well-known name, having already hosted various quiz shows including Radio 4’s The News Quiz and\u0026nbspChannel 4’s 1001 Things You Should Know.

When we do a deal, we go back to the members and have to get their approval.\u0026nbsp“Whether it’s through a general election or\u0026nbspa popular vote, Ms May should take her deal on the terms of Brexit and put it back to the people, so the people can decide whether that deal is good enough.”Demanding the prime minister adopt a softer stance and keep Britain closely tied to the EU, Ms O’Grady said: “No deal would be devastating for working people, but so would the prime minister’s proposals.\u0026nbsp“And if Theresa May takes a ‘my deal or no deal’ approach, she won’t be giving parliament a real choice.“She is holding the country to ransom, and no one voted for that. So today I want to give the prime minister fair warning. I am serving notice: that if her deal doesn’t deliver for working people, if it doesn’t protect jobs, rights at work and peace in Northern Ireland, then the TUC\u0026nbspwill throw our weight behind the call for a vote on the terms of Brexit.”People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchSeveral unions, including the GMB\u0026nbspand TSSA,\u0026nbsphave already called for a second vote on Brexit, while more than\u0026nbspthree-quarters of a million people\u0026nbsphave now backed\u0026nbspThe Independent’s campaign for a Final Say referendum.And a new poll today revealed members of Britain’s three biggest unions – Unite, Unison and the GMB – back a new referendum by a margin of more than two to one.Arguing that the Brexit process is now at “crisis point”, Ms O’Grady said Ms May had “let Conservative Party politics take priority over the interests of working people” and accused her of being “too weak to stand up to the hardliners in her party”.She called on the government to try to extend the Article 50 period\u0026nbspto allow more time to avert a no-deal Brexit.Ms O’Grady, who\u0026nbsppreviously said she has\u0026nbspmet German chancellor Angela Merkel more than she has\u0026nbspMs May,\u0026nbspalso said she was “disappointed” at the prime minister’s lack of engagement with Britain’s unions on Brexit.\u0026nbspShe said: “It’s more than disappointing that\u0026nbspunion leaders, representatives\u0026nbspof nearly 6 million workers, have not yet been heard\u0026nbspon\u0026nbspBrexit. Where is the voice of workers?”She was speaking after the TUC’s general council\u0026nbspagreed a lengthy statement outlining its position on Brexit.The council said: “In the face of so much instability and mistrust in the ability of politicians to deliver, it comes as no surprise that polls show a growing number of people want a say on the Brexit deal.“Given the real risk of a collapse in the talks, or a deal that does not deliver on the TUC’s priorities, whilst respecting the result of the 2016 referendum to leave the European Union\u0026nbspwe do not rule out the possibility of campaigning for people to have a Final Say on the Brexit deal through a popular vote.”On Monday, union members at the conference will vote on a motion\u0026nbspcalling for a Final Say vote regardless of the deal Ms May brings back from Brussels.The draft text, tabled by the transport workers union TSSA, calls on the TUC “to campaign for ordinary people to have a Final Say through a referendum on any Brexit deal agreed so that people can make an informed decision on the deal on offer”.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/08/00/sophie-walker.jpg","title":"final say womens equality party sophie walker peoples vote second referendum","story":"Created with Sketch.‘The government is expecting women to drop out of work to prop up a\u0026nbspbad deal.

The 2019 European elections will decide the future of the EU“Europe is at a turning point. The 2019 European elections will decide the future of the EU,” Mr Weber said in a statement on social media.“Today is about the self-assertion of Europe and the defence of our values, because we are being challenged from the outside and the inside. It’s about the survival of our European way of life.“We cannot go on as we are now in the EU. I will help bring Europe back to the people and re-establish the bond between citizens and the European Union. I want to kick start a new chapter in the EU.\u0026nbsp“I want to become the EPP\u0027s lead candidate for the 2019 European Elections and be the next President of the European Commission.

This is a fight for the soul of our party and the future of our democracy, Ms Pressley said. That movement is reshaping a Democratic Party still searching for leaders and identity in the era of Donald Trump.\u0026nbspGrassroots activists on the left have a mixed record in Democratic primaries this election year, but the self-described progressive movement has scored enough victories to suggest its popularity is based on more than just protesting the Trump White House. The movement is also remoulding the Democratic Party into a younger, more erse and decidedly liberal party.\u0026nbspAyanna Pressley and New York\u0027s Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, two women of colour, both defeated Democratic incumbent congressmen in their primaries. The progressive movement has helped nominate three black Democrats for governor\u0027s seats, including a clear upset in Florida, where Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum knocked off establishment favourite Gwen Graham. Mr Graham\u0027s establishment credentials could not have been stronger. Her father, Bob, is a Florida icon who served as governor and US senator.\u0026nbspGeorgia\u0027s Stacey Abrams, meanwhile, trounced a primary opponent recruited and backed by much of her state\u0027s Democratic old guard. Ms Abrams would become the first black woman elected governor in any US state.\u0026nbspScores of other down-ballot candidates are running for local, state and federal offices with backing from grassroots groups like Inisible, MoveOn.org, the Working Families Party and the offshoot of Bernie Sanders\u0027 2016 presidential campaign, Our Revolution.\u0026nbspWhy it mattersThe ersifying, more liberal slate will be measured by the outcome in the November vote.\u0026nbspRepublicans — and some Democrats — argue that the party is going too far to the left for American voters, particularly outside of the cities and close-in suburbs where Democrats\u0027 base of white liberals and non-white voters is concentrated.\u0026nbspProgressive nominees like Ms Pressley and Ms Ocasio-Cortez are running in Democratic strongholds, so their wins in November are all but guaranteed. But Republicans will use the rise of the left — and its support for policies like single-payer health care and scrapping US Immigration and Customs Enforcement — to tar all Democratic candidates.\u0026nbspThe counter argument from Democrats and activists on the left is two-fold: 1) Many issues that more liberal candidates support — some gun regulation, expanding Medicaid, raising the minimum wage — actually have widespread public support, even among independents and some Republicans and 2) the more openly liberal candidates from outside the old-guard establishment can bring in new voters who do not regularly cast midterm ballots.\u0026nbspBeyond November, the new generation of Democrats will have a say in how the party governs. Ms Pressley and Ms Ocasio-Cortez will not determine whether Democrats pick up the 23 new House seats they need for a majority, but they will help shape the arguments within the Democratic caucus.\u0026nbspThey and their fellow freshmen will have a say in whether a new Democratic majority returns Nancy Pelosi to the speaker\u0027s chair. They will have leverage — much like the arch-conservative Freedom Caucus does with the House GOP leadership — over every debate, from health care to the potential impeachment of Mr Trump.\u0026nbspSo, for example, while there might not be enough support for a real push toward single-payer health care, the movement could draw the party toward supporting a public health insurance option to compete alongside for-profit companies selling policies in Affordable Care Act exchanges. And, even if an immediate $15 minimum wage is too heavy a lift, perhaps the left-flank forces a compromise of graduated raises over time.\u0026nbspWhat to watch out for\u0026nbspDelaware Democrat challenges incumbent as part of \u0027blue tsunami\u0027Democrats take double-digit lead over Republicans ahead of midtermsDemocrats need to focus on young people in the 2018 midterm elections Trump unprepared for impeachment and Democratic takeover: reportSanders-backed progressive could become Florida\u0027s first black governorBefore primary season concludes, there are a few more key match-ups to measure the left\u0027s influence. In Delaware, military veteran and activist Kerri Evelyn Harris is aiming on Thursday to knock off moderate Democratic Senator Tom Carper. She is a big underdog, but even a competitive finish will serve notice anew that incumbents must at least contend with the left base. Similar dynamics exist in New York, where actress Cynthia Nixon is trying to topple Governor Andrew Cuomo in a 13 September primary.\u0026nbspSome of the most intent observers of the party\u0027s evolution are the gaggle of aspiring presidential candidates. Certainly, some of those figures have helped drive the shift — Mr Sanders and his 2016 campaign, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and her outspoken economic populism.\u0026nbspBut Mr Sanders, Ms Warren and the rest are also careful to watch the base and not get caught flat-footed as it evolves. That is one reason potential candidates like Senators Cory Booker and Kamala Harris and former Vice President Joe Biden have made sure that their endorsement and campaign finance activity this midterm cycle has ned the spectrum of the party\u0027s down-ballot candidates: If the so-called progressive movement becomes the centre of the party, no one who wants to be the Democratic presidential nominee boxed out.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/04/14/xi-jinping-china-africa.jpg","title":"china africa bejing forum investment interest free loans","story":"Created with Sketch.China\u0027s Xi Jinping\u0026nbspsays\u0026nbspinvestment comes with \u0027no political strings attached\u0027Click to followThe IndependentChinese President Xi Jinping, centre, with South Africa\u0027s Cyril Ramaphosa, centre left, and other leaders behind, attend the 2018 Beijing FOCAC summitRepresentatives from\u0026nbspalmost every country in Africa dined with Xi Jinping on Monday night as they attended what is believed to be the largest gathering of African heads of state ever staged\u0026nbspoutside the continent.They had plenty to toast, after China’s President Xi pledged new infrastructure investments in their countries of $60bn\u0026nbsp(£46bn) ning the next three years.The latest investment\u0026nbspis in addition to the $60bn\u0026nbsppledged back in\u0026nbsp2015, and promises to continue the remarkable growth of China-backed building projects across the African segment, known as the Belt and Road Initiative.China now far outstrips the economic clout and engagement in Africa of either the US or Europe, and its involvement has inevitably sparked criticism.Malaysia’s prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, warned against what he called a “new version of colonialism” last month when he cancelled a $20bn Chinese-backed rail project.And in his speech addressing leaders at Beijing’s Great Hall of the People, Mr Xi appeared to acknowledge these concerns, saying Chinese investment came with “no political strings attached”.“China does not interfere in Africa’s internal affairs and does not impose its own will on Africa,” he said. “More than 1.3 billion Chinese people and more than 1.2 million African people have always pursued a shared future.“We respect Africa, love Africa and support Africa.”Since Mr Xi’s announcement, African heads of state have similarly sought to play down any suggestion that China’s interests are in anything other than mutual economic growth.Zimbabwe’s newly elected president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, hit out at critics of China in an interview on state TV.“There is now a transition to a new world order and those who don’t see it are blind,” he said.Cyril Ramaphosa, South Africa’s president, said the Forum on China–Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) in Beijing was working towards “a vision that has been crafted in Africa, by Africans… of an integrated, prosperous and peaceful Africa”.May overlooked a vast humanitarian crisis on her Africa tourNever mind Brexit, the South Africans will love us after May’s dancingTheresa May’s visit to Robben Island is insultingThe UK securing trade deals in Africa doesn’t make much senseMay makes ‘unashamed’ vow to use aid to boost UK firms in Africa“FOCAC refutes the view that a new colonialism is taking hold in Africa, as our detractors would have us believe,” he added.Rwanda’s Paul Kagame, the current African Union chairman and a fierce critic in the past of foreign aid, said he considered China to be a “more respectful partner” than either Europe or America.“The relationship between Africa and China is based on equality, mutual respect and a commitment to a shared well-being,” he said. “Our growing ties with China do not come at anyone’s expense.”Some experts are not so sure. The International Monetary Fund warned in April that at least 40 per cent of low-income countries in Africa are either in debt distress or at high risk. Since the last FOCAC forum in South Africa in 2015, a number of countries have attempted to restructure their debt.But Chinese officials have previously denied taking part in so-called “debt trap” diplomacy, and on Monday Mr Xi said government debt from China’s interest free loans due by the end of 2018 will be written off for indebted poor African countries.“Unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise,” Mr Xi warned, an apparent reference to an ongoing trade war between his country and Donald Trump’s America.“China-Africa cooperation under the BRI (Belt and Road Initiative) is a way to common prosperity that brings benefits to both our peoples.”The only African country not represented in Beijing at the summit, which continued on Tuesday with meetings between business leaders and entrepreneurs, was newly-renamed eSwatini, formerly Swaziland.That’s because it is now the only nation left in Africa still conducting diplomatic relations with Taiwan, the self-ruled territory claimed by China. Beijing refuses to do business with any country that maintains ties to Taipei – business which the rest of the African continent has decided it cannot afford to lose.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/09/21/sweden-election-democrats.jpg","title":"swedish election exit poll latest sweden democrats far right result votes","story":"Created with Sketch.Anti-immigration nationalist party would be second-largest in parliamentClick to followThe IndependentYoung members and supporters of the far-right Sweden Democrats react to the results of the exit polls at their party election centreNearly a fifth of Swedish voters have backed the far-right Sweden Democrats in the country’s general election but the anti-immigration group lags behind the ruling party, an exit poll suggests.The poll had the\u0026nbspnationalist\u0026nbspSweden Democrats on 19.2 per cent support but found the ruling Social Democrats gained the backing of more than a quarter – 26.2 per cent – of the public.If the exit poll results carry over to the official count, the Sweden Democrats would be the second-largest party in parliament.Broadcaster SVT’s exit poll showed Jimmie Akesson‘s\u0026nbspfar-right group, which has\u0026nbspwhite supremacist roots, making slight gains compared with\u0026nbspexpectations amid apparent deadlock between the two largest coalitions.Prime minister Stefan Lovfen and his left-leaning parliamentary allies including the Greens garnered a total 39.4 per cent of votes, SVT’s\u0026nbspexit poll suggested, while the centre-right alliance won 39.6 per cent, a tiny lead.However, a separate voter poll by national broadcaster\u0026nbspTV4\u0026nbspput the Sweden Democrats on less, at 16.3 per cent.\u0026nbspTV4\u0026nbspfound the Social Democrats had 25.4 per cent of the vote, the Moderates 18.4 per cent and the Greens 5.8 per cent.That analysis suggested the worst-ever showing for the Social Democrats, though it suggested\u0026nbspMr Lovfen’s\u0026nbspparliamentary coalition had won 41 per cent of votes compared to 40.1 per cent for the right-leaning group.The process of forming a stable government may take weeks and, potentially, end in failure.Acrimony between the two main political blocs has defined Swedish politics for decades, and the rise of the Sweden Democrats – considered pariahs in parliament\u0026nbsp- has complicated the political landscape.In 2015, the Swedish government allowed 163,000 migrants into the country with a population of 10 million.The number was far lower than the asylum-seekers Germany accepted that year, but the highest per capita of any European nation.Before the election, promising prospects for the Sweden\u0026nbspDemocrats had many Swedes worried about an erosion of the humanitarian values that have long been a foundation of their country’s identity.World news in picturesParticipants wave flowers as they march past a balcony from where North Korea\u0027s leader Kim Jong Un was watching, during a mass rally on Kim Il Sung square in Pyongyang.

We need Britain, We need a deal.

They do not like Jews.The evidence for that is so categorical and so widespread across the left of the party that nobody can doubt it now.Certainly I don’t. Nor does our Jewish community, which is genuinely worried by the ­hideous Corbyn.If you’ve got your doubts then I just don’t know what WOULD convince you.Maybe CCTV of Corbyn torching a synagogue and screaming “Intifada!” Would that do it? Or would you respond by saying, ah, he was actually worried that the people inside the synagogue might be a bit cold. That’s why he threw the firebomb in.Or maybe the excuse Corbyn himself comes up with, every time. It wasn’t me! I wasn’t there!Then, when it’s proved that he was: “Oh, um, yes. But I didn’t really know what I was doing.”As I’ve said before, Corbyn’s defence is always to portray himself as a complete moron who doesn’t know where he is or what he’s doing. It doesn’t wash. He’s an anti-Semite.But there’s another group of people who know this only too well. And they’re doing very little about it.That’s the Labour MPs. The ones who cannot abide Corbyn and Momentum and want him gone. The Old Labour Party, the one we used to have before the lefty infants took over.But they do nothing. Not a thing, apart from moan quietly in the background.If ever there was a time for a split, for a new party to be formed which might capture the attention of the voters, this is it.But they don’t have the balls. Or they are scared to lose their safe seats and their nice incomes. That’s probably a false hope too, mind. Corbyn isn’t going anyplace anytime soon.And if he did another lunatic would take over who might conceivably be worse. And Momentum now control the entire party. So, one after another, the moderate Labour MPs will be deselected and lose their seats anyway.The ones who think Israel has a right to exist.The ones who don’t think Cuba and Venezuela have particularly brilliant governments.The ones who don’t want to police newspapers which don’t agree with them.The MPs whose first consideration is poverty and inequality, not identity politics and fatuous agitprop grandstanding.So far only one of these has made a stand — the excellent Frank Field. He has resigned the Labour whip, disgusted at ­Corbyn’s anti-Semitism.All it would take is three or four more and suddenly we would have a new political party.So, what about it, Kate Hoey? And the former Blairite, Caroline Flint? And Ben Bradshaw? And John Mann?Are you telling me you’re happy where you are, in today’s Labour Party?

Neo Nazis. People with posters of Hitler in their bedrooms.I daresay there are a few nasty types on those marches who wish there was still a Gestapo. But I think the vast majority of those demonstrating are ordinary German citizens, sick of what has happened to their country.And the same thing has been happening across Europe.It’s not the far right at all, no matter how often the liberals tell you it is.GREAT call from the President of the Philippines, a bloke called Rodrigo Duterte.According to him, if women want to avoid being raped they should not be so beautiful.Maybe they should have all their teeth removed?

But Rodrigo is right there near the top.SO the latest plan is to put road markings on the pavement.It’s so zombies attached to their iPhones, staring at the ground, don’t walk into the middle of a road or off the edge of a cliff.There has been a rise in accidents involving pedestrians who are locked tightly into their own little world.I have been nearly flattened by joggers immersed in some crap pounding through their thick skulls.

Both Labour and the Tories have let down the steelworkers, who are no more.But there are plenty of new businesses thriving, beyond the BBC’s cameras.Redcar will be just fine in the end, just as it was when I lived there in the Seventies.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Raising it further will kill aspiration, investment and jobs.To help the poor, CUT their taxes instead.WE’RE not swallowing the Treasury scares about jobs being at risk if restaurants are made to put calorie counts on their menu.Food apps can assess a dish’s calories in moments.

The stitch-up reeked.When MEPs found out, even the European parliament was appalled.The improper manoeuvre will keep Selmayr, a devout federalist, at the centre of power for years to come and long after his patron Jean-Claude Juncker has retired to spend more time with his wine cellar.How did they pull it off?The outgoing secretary-general had told Juncker, privately, he would retire this year.Armed with Juncker’s inside knowledge, Selmayr successfully applied to be deputy.Then, at a meeting of commissioners, Juncker revealed the secretary-general post was suddenly vacant and that, as luck would have it, Selmayr was ready to fill it.The ombudsman’s conclusions on what the pair did are scathing. Four serious breaches of protocol and maladministration are listed.Selmayr did not take appropriate measures to avoid conflict of interest. The rules of procedure were broken.“A situation of urgency to fill the post of secretary-general was created artificially,” O’Reilly says, and: “The commissioners  responsible for the maladministration in this case. It is extraordinary that no commissioner seemed to question the secretary-general appointment procedure, which in the end raised valid widespread concerns.”Extraordinary is putting it mildly.The report makes for shocking, if not surprising, reading. The rules-based Brussels order and its highly paid apparat behave like a gangster racket.Just to be helpful, I’m going to send a copy of O’Reilly’s report to every EU flag-waving “People’s Vote” campaigner and to Gary Lineker, the crisp- toting TV football host, who has emerged as a leading voice in the campaign for a second referendum.Needless to say, Selmayr and Juncker face no sanctions or punishment.Instead, O’Reilly recommends that the commission should develop a new procedure — I’m sure that will help — for appointing the next secretary-general.My first thought on reading her report was that the commission is an even more appalling and arrogant organisation than it looks, sitting at the heart of an imperious EU wedded to ever-closer integration.Thank goodness we’re leaving. But are we?To listen to the hysterical wailing of the People’s Vote crowd in recent weeks, you would think that Brexit is about to be stopped and a grateful public will beg to be bossed around by Selmayr and his goons for years to come.There isn’t the parliamentary time for another referendum before we leave on March 29 and it’s an exceptionally duff idea regardless.If there can be two referendums, why leave it at that? Why not make it best of three or five? The decision to leave has been taken. Britain is quitting the EU.Thank goodness, in my view a shame, in the view of others — what matters now are the terms.Here, the Tory party is engaged in a row with itself over the Prime Minister’s Chequers proposal, which envisages Britain sticking with the EU’s rule book on goods.It is astonishing to see how purist this has made some of my fellow-Brexiteers who spent years before the referendum acknowledging in private that there would have to be compromises.Not long ago, Boris Johnson was so torn by the nuanced arguments on either side that he plumped for Leave by the narrowest of margins. Now he plays the zealot.But contrary to the prophets of doom, the Chequers proposal isn’t dead yet.No10 is adamant that it has “unlocked the talks” and that, beneath the rhetoric of the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier, progress is being made that may become apparent at the Salzburg meeting of EU leaders on September 20.In a weird way it might work. With Theresa May’s internal critics split and producing almost as many alternative Brexit plans as there are Tory MPs, Labour divided, and other EU member states anxious that we don’t leave without a deal, something like the Chequers plan remains the best one on offer.It would satisfy non-obsessives like me to just agree a deal, improve it as we go along, and get on with life beyond Brexit.

They were repeatedly warned to stop their unjustified price hikes — and laughed in the Government’s face.Yes, customers should switch supplier. But it’s not easy and many don’t, or can’t.

A Corbyn Britain would thus abandon our deterrent, whatever Labour’s manifesto says.Will they ever be honest enough to tell voters they would unilaterally disarm, just as the world gets more dangerous?Honesty, though, is not their strong suit.Yesterday McDonnell repeated the absurd lie that he only wanted “peace” in Northern Ireland. He and Corbyn wanted IRA victory, achieved through ­murder. McDonnell wanted Provos “honoured”. He praised them for bombing their way to the negotiating table.As for the anti-Semite Corbyn, how chuffed he must be that 40 per cent of Jews could flee Britain if he wins power. How proud that Corbynite racists plaster Jew-hating posters across London.It’s what happens when you campaign, as Corbyn did, for the right to be more racist towards Jews than the international anti-Semitism definitions allow.And then there’s Brexit, and the insanely dangerous second referendum he seems increasingly ready to back.But at least Leavers would then know who betrayed them.

But the British won’t do that.One Brexit red line that Theresa May is adamant that she will never cross is her insistence that no British PM could sign the EU’s proposed text on the Irish border, which would see Northern Ireland become part of the customs territory of the EU.But the two sides need to sort this issue out. For the alternative is no deal, a scenario that neither side is prepared for.One Cabinet minister tells me that “no deal would be almost a state of economic war” between the UK and the EU.This is an exaggeration. But it does show the tensions it would lead to. No deal would also result in the kind of Irish border that both sides say they are keen to avoid.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, is prepared to ­produce a de-dramatised ­version of the backstop.This would concentrate on the 16 areas where the EU thinks there would need to be checks between Britain and Northern Ireland.The hope is that the dry, technical nature of this ­document will make it less controversial.But the UK will still struggle to sign up to this backstop.Why? Because it would still leave the threat of a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the country. The Government COULD accept some regulatory checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. But it COULD NOT accept Northern Ireland being part of a different customs territory to the rest of the country.Senior figures on the UK side are instead mulling an approach where the checks are split three ways between the UK, Northern Ireland and the Republic.Their thinking is that the point of the backstop is to keep the Irish border as it is today but not to create a back door into the EU for goods.If the responsibility for that was split three ways with the UK doing regulatory checks on goods going into Northern Ireland and the Republic taking care to ensure that all goods from the North exported via its ports are properly declared, then you would have a solution that was acceptable to the UK.The EU will be very wary of this idea. It doesn’t want the Irish to have to carry out any additional checks.It also wants to keep the UK in a customs union with the EU, and the Northern Ireland question helps them in their attempt to do this.But the UK should point out that if disagreement over the Irish border prevents any kind of deal, then there will have to be a hard border.The Government is hopeful of making some progress on a deal with the EU at the Salzburg summit later this month. One of those closely involved in the negotiations tells me: “Salzburg won’t be dramatic. But look for a shifting of the plates. They need to give her something to stand up and point to.”What May must avoid is being faced at the end of the negotiations with a choice between staying in a customs union or no deal.A customs union would send Britain out into the world with one hand tied behind its back while no deal would cause real problems in the short-term.BORIS Johnson has received multiple ­communications from the Tory inquiry into his newspaper column on the burka.I understand that the former Foreign Secretary received an initial letter asking him if he wished to say anything in his defence. Those with knowledge of the inquiry say that he responded to that with a vigorous defence of free speech and the need for politicians to be able to take part in these debates.Johnson’s response was met with a further ­communication from the party asking him if he wanted to say anything about his particular ­comments about people wearing the burka ­looking like letter boxes and bank robbers. My information is that Johnson has not responded to this letter. The Tory inquiry simply says that it does not ­comment on ongoing investigations.In truth, this absurd exercise should be dropped. The Tories having an inquiry into the newspaper column of a backbench MP is ridiculous. If it is still dragging on by conference, it could become yet another thing that causes trouble there.Of course, the reason so much attention is paid to Boris Johnson is his status as the members’ favourite to be the next Tory leader. Since quitting over Chequers, he has enjoyed a resurgence in popularity with the party rank and file.Oddly, though, his status as favourite might help Theresa May if a vote of confidence in her was called. As one Cabinet minister explains: “At the moment, there’s a majority against Boris having the top job. So you have to vote for Theresa as you can’t risk him being in the final two.”IN the event of no deal there would be 12 weeks of disruption at the border, ministers will be told on Thursday.Ministers will be summoned to Number 10 for a two-hour Cabinet meeting on no-deal planning.Originally, it had been expected that this meeting would take place at Chequers. But it was then pointed out that this would look like a crisis summit and the idea was shelved.It will be emphasised to ministers that no deal means no deals. In other words, don’t expect a series of workarounds to be agreed between Britain and the EU to keep things ticking over.At best, the Government is hoping for a couple of bilateral deals in areas that are of overwhelming importance to the EU. If no deal does become the most likely scenario, I am told no-deal readiness will become pretty much the sole activity of the civil service.Ministers will also get to discuss a Treasury forecast of the short-term economic impact of no deal. But, rather absurdly, these papers won’t be circulated until Tuesday.THE police and intelligence work that has enabled two Russian operatives to be identified as the lead suspects for the Salisbury attack is impressive.But we shouldn’t kid ourselves that this public exposure will put a stop to Russian mischief.The very decision to use Novichok in the attacks shows that Moscow really didn’t care if it was traced back to Russia.I AM told that the Budget this autumn will not be a dramatic affair.With better than expected tax receipts, Chancellor Philip Hammond should be able to fund an increase in NHS spending without raising the headline rates of tax.However, other tax changes – including to the Enterprise Investment Scheme – are being discussed.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But now The Sun on Sunday has learned that THOUSANDS of families have ­contacted Facebook since it launched in 2004, complaining it has prevented them from accessing their loved ones’ pages after they have died.Using Facebook’s “legacy” option, users can name a family member to help turn their page into a memorial when they die, or delete it altogether.If the nominated person chooses to keep the page going, they can share a final message with friends or change the profile photo.But many of the social network’s 1.23billion users do not use this option, which results in grieving parents and partners being locked out of their loved ones’ accounts.And with an estimated 8,000 users dying EVERY DAY, the media giant is struggling to resolve thousands of complaints from families.Last night a Facebook spokesman said: “We always try to ­protect the wishes of those who have died. If they didn’t specify any final ­instructions on their profile, we leave the account exactly as that person left it.We add ‘Remembering’ above the name on the person’s profile to make clear that the account is now a memorial site and to stop any new attempts to log into the account.“Once we’ve done this, the profile remains on Facebook and is visible to the people who could already see it before it was memorialised.“We don’t remove or change anything. This is our way of respecting the choices someone made while alive.”Here, we reveal the heartbreaking testimonies of three people who felt let down and hurt by Facebook while they were grieving.MUM Louise Palmer, 53, was heartbroken when Facebook blocked her from accessing her dead daughter Becky’s page just 12 weeks after she died from a brain tumour.They turned the account into a “memorial page” without consulting Louise – which meant all her daughter’s treasured last messages vanished.Epilepsy nurse Louise said: “I was given no warning at all. Facebook messed with my life.”Becky, 19, had battled a brain tumour for less than 12 months when her life was cut short in December 2011.In the weeks before her death she had lost the ability to speak and type – so Louise would log into her daughter’s account for her and write messages on her behalf to the teen’s friends.After Becky died, grieving Louise would go into the account and be comforted by reading the ­tributes to her only daughter.But three months after Becky’s death, Facebook changed the account to a memorial page – which ­prevented her mum from viewing private messages, changing photos and ­liking comments.Despite her best efforts, which included emailing Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg directly, Louise was denied access on the grounds it was invading Becky’s ­privacy. Louise, from Dudley, West Mids, said: “I was facing every parent’s worst ­nightmare but then I had Facebook to deal with too.“Getting Facebook to give me access to Becky’s account became the focus of my life for months.“I understand that not all teenagers would want their parents reading through their private messages.“But we were incredibly close and shared everything, which is why she gave me her login details.“I pleaded with Facebook but nothing worked.“I spent hours crying over not being able to access her account but as time has passed I’ve had to learn to cope without it.”“I have no idea why her page was closed down and we still don’t know now.“Other families have since come forward with similar ­stories. Something needs to change.”DISTRAUGHT dad Nick Gazzard was sickened when Facebook turned his dead daughter’s page into a memorial featuring nine images of her with her killer.Hollie, 20, was brutally stabbed 14 times by ex Asher Maslin, 26, in February 2014.Nick repeatedly appealed to Facebook to remove the chilling images from the hairdresser’s memorialised page – but the US media giant refused.It eventually relented after Hollie’s grieving dad set up a petition which received 11,000 signatures.Nick, from Gloucester, said: “I was so distressed. Facebook needs to change its policy.”Hollie’s sister Chloe, 28, said: “I just wanted to remember her in happy times without seeing the face of her killer. We’re looking into changing Facebook rules for other families.”A Facebook spokesman said: “In this case we received a report of copyright infringement and we removed the content in response to that report.”FACEBOOK refused to tell grieving Azra Sabados who had asked for her late partner’s Facebook profile to be erased – with the loss of treasured mementoes.Jazz musician Mirza Krupalija suffered a fatal heart attack just after his 57th birthday in 2016 and six months later his account was taken down.Azra, from London, pictured with Mirza, said: “You lose someone you love and you try to hang on to everything, and then something ­happens and you can’t explain that either.“Lots of Mirza’s profile included me and our travels, our photos, music he shared. They could have sent me an email to check before deleting it all.”Instead, Azra spent a year talking to Facebook before taking legal action which forced the company to tell her who was responsible.But she added: “It wasn’t right, it wasn’t fair, it caused a lot of distress. We want Facebook to say exactly what their process is when they get such a request.”Tory MP Simon Hart, of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee, said: “I find it mystifying that Facebook thinks it can still come up with excuses.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He claims to have perfected his nuclear arsenal enough to deter US aggression and devote his resources to raising the nations standard of living.This years celebrations also mark the revival of North Koreas iconic mass games after a five-year hiatus.The mass games involve tens of thousands of people holding up placards or dancing in precise unison and are intended to be a display of national unity.This years spectacle tickets start at just over £75 and go up to more than £600 per seat also has a strong economic theme.The economy was also a big part of a concert held on the eve of the anniversary for foreign dignitaries and a large foreign media contingent allowed in for the events.French actor Gerard Depardieu was spotted at the parade although it is not known whether he was there as a tourist or as a guest of the regime."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000432374804.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"scout leader brian walker niqab muslim face veil","story":"Brian Walker, 63, received the out-of-court settlement after launching a discrimination claim against the organisation he spent more than 50 years representing.He was expelled after flagging safety concerns over a fellow master - a Muslim woman - who planned to lead activities wearing a niqab face veil.Mr Walker questioned how she could rescue a young Scout from water, take part in physical tasks such as abseiling or canoeing and be sure her instructions were being heard.He went on to say Zaina Kothdiwala, head of an all-girl Scout pack in Heckmondwike, West Yorkshire, looked like Darth Vader.The Scout Association ruled Mr Wilson was in breach of its diversity and equality rules and dismissed him from his post.Mr Walker sent an e-mail to the Scouts official magazine in March 2017 to complain it was promoting Islam while neglecting its Christian origins before singling out an article about Ms Kothdiwala.He wrote: “You spend more time promoting Muslims, lesbians, homosexuals, bisexuals, transgender.

Contingency plans drawn up by police chiefs include the real possibility of calling on military assistance and preventing officers taking leave around the date of the UK\u0027s withdrawal in March 2019. The document prepared by the National Police Co-ordination Centre  warns of traffic queues at ports with unprecedented and overwhelming disruption to the road network. Concerns around medical supplies could feed civil disorder, while a rise in the price of goods could also lead to widespread protest, the document obtained by the Sunday Times said.  The potential for a restricted supply of goods raised concerns of widespread protest which could then escalate into disorder. It could also trigger a rise in non-Brexit related acquisitive crime such as theft. The document, set to be considered by the National Police Chiefs\u0027 Council  later this month, also sets out concerns about:  EU police officers losing their legal right to carry a warrant card, potentially affecting 750 officers in the politan Police alone.  Increased data costs hitting the budgets of forces which rely on mobile communication.  Disruption potentially lasting for three months either side of the March 29 Brexit day, rather than the six weeks planned for by the Government.  A perceived lack of communication between the Home Office and the Brexit department.  The impact of the Operation Stack arrangements for queuing traffic at Channel ports being used at docks around the country.

Last week amid claims that he and his wife Marina Wheeler split because he was cheating on her with a young Tory aide the document began to circulate around Westminster. The 4,000-word war book was drawn up by Theresa May\u0027s aides during the Conservative leadership election in 2016. But the current Number 10 administration denies any role in updating or distributing the dossier. The litany of claims include accusing Johnson of lying about his affair with the socialite Petronella Wyatt, who had to abort his child. It alleges he had an affair with the journalist Anna Fazackerley on one occasion visiting both her and Petronella Wyatt on the same night.  Other claims include that the former Foreign Secretary began seeing his current wife Marina while he was still with his first wife Allegra. Reports of a \u0027special friendship\u0027 between Mr Johnson and Ruzwana Bashir, the \u0027stunning\u0027 president of the Oxford Union in 2004. It also details his numerous gaffes including saying that the Queen likes the Commonwealth because it supplies her with regular cheering crowds of flag-waving piccaninnies. It details his reputation for playing fast and loose with the truth - which got him sacked from the Times and from the shadow cabinet in 2004 by Michael Howard.  The paper was drawn up by Nick Hargrave, who served as deputy head of May\u0027s policy unit at No 10 before joining the Portland PR firm last autumn. Hargrave\u0027s name is listed as the original author in the document\u0027s data files but there is no suggestion he was involved in distributing it last week. He admitted he had written the Boris dossier telling the Sunday Times: During the course of the 2016 Conservative leadership campaign, I was responsible for desk research. Notes on opposing candidates are a fairly standard practice. I no longer work in politics and am thankfully no longer involved in the twists and turns of party leadership matters.

Parents Louise and Nikki Draven – who told their unusual story in the Sunday Mirror last year – are set to undergo gender reassignment surgery. Dad Louise, 32 – whom Star calls his mummy – is to become a woman. Mum Nikki, 31 – called daddy by the child – will be a man called Charlie. Even five-year-old Star has cut his hair to look more like a boy than a girl. “It’s been a long time coming,” said Louise – born a man and Star’s biological dad.  “I started my transition in 2011 but things, mainly weight, held me back.” She shed 16st – slimming from 25st to a slim 9st – to avoid complications so she can have the December op. She added: “It took a lot of self-discipline after bariatric surgery.”  Louise said of the swap op: “I have doubts all the time but that’s just part and parcel of my transition. “No one chooses these feelings but when people do, they need the outside of their bodies to match the inside.” Louise has also ditched her striking red and black hair – shaving it off after hormone treatment left her thinning. She said: “The hair doesn’t make the woman – the woman makes herself.” Meanwhile Nikki – born a female and registered as Star’s birth mother – now calls himself Charlie and is planning a female-to-male operation soon. The ex-pub bouncer said: “I’ve never been comfortable being female but it’s taken me a while to admit that. “I was never happy about having periods or growing breasts. It felt all wrong. So I did some soul-searching and realised I’ve always wanted to be male.”  Last year he revealed he was pansexual – some days he would dress as a woman, and others as a man. Now he only ever dresses as a man and binds his breasts every day. The couple say Star is “still gender neutral” and is happy and well-adjusted. Charlie said: “He has a five-year-old’s understanding of our situation. “I’ve always been daddy and Louise has always been mummy and that’s never going to change. “Star sometimes asks questions. Recently he asked why I had to wear a swimsuit at the pool and not trunks like other daddies.  I tell Star mummy is going to a special doctor who will take away her ducky, which is Star’s word for penis. “I say that when I go to the special doctor I’ll be getting a ducky of my own then I’ll be just like him.” Star’s school is supportive. He wears a boy’s uniform but can accessorise. At home he is free to wear make-up, paint his nails, wear boys’ or girls’ clothes and play with dolls.  In January, he cut his long hair and Louise said: “He’s in two minds now about whether or not he wants it long again.” "},{"url":null,"title":"british beautician ruined 3000 cosmetic","story":"NewsBritish beautician \u0027ruined by £3,000 cosmetic surgery in Turkey which led to mis-shapen bum and gastritis\u0027Michelle Thomas, of Birmingham, travelled to Turkey in search of the perfect beach bodyShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByMike LockleyBradley Jolly12:17, 9 SEP 2018Updated14:02, 9 SEP 2018Newsthis.style.display=\u0027none\u0027\"/Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror/news/uk-news/video/wanted-perfect-beach-body-bum-13216161,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-M3TH25P,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail/F/QVgi9PbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_/,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail/F/QVgi9PbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_/,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA beautician who travelled to Turkey in search of the perfect beach body claims an expensive bum lift operation has ruined her derri\u0026egravere and led to three UK hospital visits. Michelle Thompson, 31, has spent \u0026pound3,800 in a bid to craft her dream body but says she\u0027s since had to cover up her shame. The clinic involved, Mediface Surgical Centre in the Mediterranean coastal city Antalya, strenuously deny causing Michelle’s problems. The beautician though faces a third operation to rectify damage which happened to her body since her procedures.  They have ruined me, she told Sunday Mercury .   I wanted a smaller waist and a little bit of a bigger bottom – I wanted a bit more definition and shape, I wanted to feel a bit more secure. The reality is that my body is a lot worse now my body is terrible and the one side is still sore. I was promised a dream body, but the nightmare continues. I had a big holiday in a few weeks and was told I’d look perfect. I don’t, and I’m still in pain. Online adverts for the company\u0027s Brazilian buttocks lift Michelle underwent are illustrated by close-ups of perfect Coke-bottle curves barely covered by skimpy bikinis. But pictures taken after the procedure show a large lump on Michelle\u0027s right thigh, a huge dent in one of her buttocks and discoloured skin. Michelle, who has asked for her face to be hidden because close friends and family are unaware of the surgery, also claims liposuction has left her with prominent love handles.  The clinic strenuously denies botching the surgery. It admits offering free, follow-up procedure, but stated that is a standard goodwill gesture to dissatisfied customers. But Michelle, from Edgbaston, Birmingham, alleges she was vomiting hours after the buttock lift on April 4. She said: I was really sick, and there was a huge lump on my thigh. It hurt and I was panicking. I was in pain, really bad pain. They assessed the lump and assured me it would go down. Michelle left the clinic the following morning, but was re-admitted after staff at the hotel where she was staying raised the alarm about her condition. She was given tablets, returned to the UK and immediately attended Birmingham’s City Hospital. The flight was awful. I was still really ill and in too much pain to sit down. Staff at City Hospital said I was suffering from gastritis and an infection. Doctors put her on a drip and kept her in overnight. The beautician was assured by Mediface that, given time, the unsightly lump would settle down. It didn’t.  And Michelle took herself to Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham.  They referred me to the plastic surgery team who said that because the treatment took place in Turkey, they couldn’t do anything.  I had to pester and pester Mediface and even threaten legal action. The clinic\u0027s website states: One of the trendiest procedures right now is also one of our most popular. The Brazilian Butt Lift involves removing fat from large areas and transferring it into your buttocks. This gives a flatter stomach, much smaller waist and fuller, more shapely, butt – all in one procedure. We do it all with no needle, no scalpel and no stitches. Our patients are typically back to work within 48 hours and have minimal downtime. And to its credit, Mediface agreed to carry out further work, free of charge, although flights and accommodation left Michelle \u0026pound400 out-of-pocket. But that April 27 cosmetic work has only added to Michelle’s woes. It has, she claims, left her with a large indentation on one buttock. I woke up, looked in the mirror and knew something was wrong, something didn’t look right, she said. The nurse was lovely and was pointing at the dent and I still had swelling on the thigh. They said it would go down, they said it was normal. An April 30 text from Mediface assures: I clearly understand your concerns, but, as the doctor said, we should wait for the swelling to go down and see the results. As I told you, please wait and massage that place to  go down slowly.  The following day, Michelle was back at hospital and this time diagnosed with seroma, a build-up of fluid on the thigh, which was drained. They also said skin discolouration was permanent and caused by having one procedure straight after another, she said. Without the cash to pay for repair work in this country, Michelle is pondering a third trip to Turkey on September 22, with Mediface again paying for the work. I’m nervous, very nervous, she admitted. I could’ve had the butt lift done in Britain, but it was so much cheaper over there. Now, because the surgery took place in Turkey, no law firms will take up my case on a \u0027no win, no fee\u0027 basis. I’d tell any woman thinking of going to Turkey for this – \u0027Don’t do it. It’s more money in the UK, but you get better prior and after-care\u0027. I’m proof of what can go wrong. They promised me a perfect body, but I ended up a mess. A Mediface spokeswoman told the Sunday Mercury: There is nothing wrong, there is nothing wrong in our clinic. She had options, she signed our list. If our patients are not satisfied, they come again.

Seven-year-old Jenson Lindop Lamens\u0027 frustrated parents, Richard and Jenny, took him out of school in December because they say he was not receiving the help he needs. He requires specialist signing and bilingual help but he was becoming increasingly upset at not being able to communicate with his teachers or friends. But fast forward eight months and he has still not been given a place. His family have accused Cheshire East Council for failing to complete vital paperwork that stopped them getting a new school place for Jenson. The local authority is legally required to keep an up-to-date ‘manual’ of the education and health care requirements for every special needs child. Richard and Jenny say this has not been updated since December 2015 and therefore doesn’t include a later review which stated he needs sign language support. They claim that stopped a school just four miles from his old one taking Jenson on because they needed to see evidence in his plan that he needs British Sign Language support.  Jenny told the Crewe Chronicle : “The paperwork from the meeting last September, where it was agreed that Jenson would be entitled to full-time one-to-one signing support, seems to have mysteriously gone missing.   So that information is not going to be put into his plan because, according to Cheshire East, it doesn’t exist. “But it does exist. We’ve got emails from his old school to say that they were trying to put it in place because of the meeting, but Cheshire East are just refusing to put it in his EHCP  because apparently they don’t have any evidence he needs to sign.” She added: “The school can’t accept him until his paperwork says this child needs this. If I consult with another school they’re going to say exactly the same to me and its not because that school is not appropriate for Jenson, it’s because his paperwork doesn’t reflect the child that he is.”  Jenson suffered brain damage and hearing loss when he contracted meningitis when he was just 16 months old.  Jenny also claims the local authority made no contact despite Jenson being taken out school. She said: “We took him out of school without one single email or phone call from Cheshire East to say ‘why’s your son out of education?\u0027 “I reported myself to child welfare in March to say, ‘can you please come and prosecute me or do something because my child’s out of education and Cheshire East won’t do anything’. “I don’t think it should take three months for somebody to chase up the safety and welfare of a child.” "},{"url":null,"title":"diana marriage letters philip prince","story":"NewsDiana\u0027s letters from Prince Philip reveal he and the Queen \u0027never dreamed\u0027 Charles would leave her for Camilla\"I cannot imagine anyone in their right mind would leave you for Camilla\"Share\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByBronwen Weatherby22:46, 8 SEP 2018Updated11:29, 9 SEP 2018NewsPrincess Of Wales, the People\u0027s Princess was loved by a nation but not by her husband Charles \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPrince Charles and Princess Diana\u0027s split 26 years ago shocked the world. It is believed that the Queen wrote to the unhappy married couple to recommend they divorce. But Prince Philip openly took his daughter-in-law\u0027s side when things got messy between her and Charles, and unearthed correspondence between himself and Diana show what he really thought of his son divorcing the People\u0027s Princess. In a letter written in 1992, Philip told Diana of his and the Queen\u0027s disapproval of their son\u0027s love life, RSVP live reports .  The unearthed letters, set out Philip\u0027s disapproval of his son\u0027s love life, calling him silly for risking everything with Camilla for a man in his position. Signed lovingly with fondest love, Pa, Philip wrote: We never dreamed he might feel like leaving you for her. I cannot imagine anyone in their right mind would leave you for Camilla. Such a prospect never even entered our heads. Philip also expressed his sympathy and support to Diana and offered to become a mediator in the war that raged on between her and her estranged husband Charles.  He mentioned in the letter: I can only repeat what I’ve said before, if invited, I will always do my utmost to help you and Charles to the best of my ability. But I am quite ready to concede that I have no talent as a marriage counsellor. Diana confided in her private secretary at the time Patrick Jephson, who said the support of her in-laws had meant a lot to her. Patrick said: Here at last was written proof that this was acknowledged, recognised, and there was sympathy for her. Although Philip was sympathetic to the situation, he also made it clear to Diana that he would not support her having new romantic relationships.  He wrote: We do not approve of either of you having lovers. He also said Diana was partly to blame for the breakdown of her and Charles\u0027 marriage. Can you honestly look into your heart and say that Charles\u0027s relationship with Camilla had nothing to do with your behaviour towards him in your marriage?” he added.  Details of Charles and Diana\u0027s rocky marriage was revealed to the public for the first time during the period these letters were written. And in 1992, a number of royal scandals took place, keeping the family in the public eye for the rest of the year. In March of that year, Prince Andrew and Sarah \u0027Fergie\u0027 Ferguson separated, and a couple of months later Fergie was photographed sucking American tycoon John Bryan\u0027s toes while on holiday.  In April, Princess Anne announced that she would be divorcing Captain Mark Phillips. And if all of this wasn\u0027t dramatic enough, intimate telephone conversations between Princess Diana and close friend James Gibney were leaked and published by The Sun. In the private phonecalls, Diana suggested to James that her situation with Charles and Camilla was like something that would happen to a character in EastEnders.

The cutting-edge accessory has a mood-boosting scent scientifically designed to help tackle Britain’s gloomy autumn weather. Every time its canopy is opened, \u0027micro-encapsulation\u0027 technology releases a memory-triggering scent called ‘Balance’. And it’s even being trialled with a light therapy bulb, which gives Brits an uplifting glow to further soothe the post-holiday comedown.  Sensory fragrance expert Dawn Goldworm – who possesses the rare neurological condition of synaesthesia, meaning she can SEE and FEEL scents – developed the brolly’s scent at TUI’s Sensatori Resort in Negril, Jamaica. She said: “The senses play a crucial part in storing and reliving holiday memories. Olfactory bulbs are part of our limbic system transmitting smell information from the nose to the brain, and directly connect to areas of the brain that process emotion and memory. “The TUI Sensatori ‘Balance’ scent has also been customised to instil feelings of contentment - blended from juicy fresh citrus, white jasmine and delicate soft musk, also known for their calming and stress-solidifying properties.”  The updated umbrella was created after research polled UK holidaymakers to find out the worst things about coming home from a break. Three quarters of Brits admitted suffering from some form of post-holiday blues after getting back from a trip abroad. And one in four cited leaving glorious sunshine behind and returning to British drizzle as the hardest post-holiday adjustment. Other things Brits dread after getting back from a holiday include finally tackling tasks that had been put off before leaving, and having to wake up early again.  Helen Morgan, Head of Concept for TUI said, “For the past decade, TUI Sensatori has prided itself on developing five-star resorts to truly fuel the senses. We’d like the Holi-Brolly to transform any trudge home from work into a more colourful and sensory awakening experience that extends the good times of a well-earned holiday well beyond your flight home.” A limited number of ‘Holi-Brollies’ will be available to trial from TUI stores in some of the wettest cities around the country, including Bluewater, centre, The Trafford Centre, Hempstead and Coventry Superstore.

And next month the royal family will celebrate yet another wedding when one of the Queen\u0027s other grandchildren, Princess Eugenie, marries her long term boyfriend Jack Brooksbank .   The loved up couple will tie the knot at St George\u0027s Chapel at Windsor Castle, the same venue as Meghan and Harry\u0027s wedding.   Despite being much further down the line of succession, Eugenie and Jack\u0027s wedding will actually be bigger than the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u0027s - and they\u0027ve invited 850 guests compared to Meghan and Harry\u0027s 600, reports the Mail on Sunday .

The couple are hoping some of their guests won\u0027t be able to attend, but if everyone can make it they will have to find 50 extra chairs and squish them in somewhere. A source told the Mail on Sunday: The wedding itself is going to be huge and they are hoping quite a few people they\u0027ve invited won\u0027t be able to come because of the capacity issue.  The bride and groom both have large families, which any married couple will know can make organising the guest list tricky.

Charlton Taylor plays a key role in the high street chain’s pre-Christmas campaign, showing a school production of Queen song Bohemian Rhapsody. The nine-year-old emerges from a box to sing a line in the ad, which made its debut during Great British Bake Off last Tuesday on Channel 4. But as mum Sonia Fleming watches Charlton with pride, she is devastated that his dad, Royal Marine Lance Corporal Michael Taylor, cannot.  Sonia, from Rhyl, Denbighshire, said: “Michael didn’t sing or dance, he was shy like me, so I have no idea where \u0026shyCharlton’s talent comes from. “But Michael would have been so proud. He does ask about his dad a lot, it is hard because he has no memory of him.” Michael was serving with Charlie Company, 40 Commando Royal Marines, when he was killed in a gun battle in the Sangin district of Helmand province in June 2010, aged 30. Charlton was just 10 months old and his brothers Ethan and Wesley were 13 and 11.  Sonia, 38, said: “It’s heartbreaking he never got to know his great dad like the others did but me and his older brothers tell him all about Michael. “We also set up the Rhyl Commandos Junior Football Club in Michael’s memory and Charlton watches the match every Sunday. “And every year, around the time of Michael’s anniversary, some of his friends from the Marines come down and have a game. Then they all tell Charlton stories about his dad.” Charlton, who dances at a local stage school, already has an agent – who landed him a part in the John Lewis advert, filmed at a school in London.  Sonia said: “It was amazing to see Charlton in the advert. We had to wait like everyone else to see what it was going to be like.” To promote its new black logo and company name John Lewis \u0026amp Partners, the high street chain has created its biggest marketing campaign to date outside the festive season.

The 17-year-old didn’t know if he could carry on – not only with the surgery but with life itself. For all his young life Rory had put up with being called “freak” and “alien”. The constant insults had become so bad that in his darkest hour he thought dying on the operating table would not be the worst thing that could happen. Rory, now 24, described that shocking moment. He says: “I felt so low at that point I thought if I died, all the mental pain I’d had to endure would be over. “For someone at 17 years old that’s obviously an awful way to be thinking. I was told I was a freak. I was compared to an alien. I don’t think people realise how much that can get to someone, especially a young boy.” Rory, from Ayr in west Scotland, is recalling that time to remind bullies of the harm they inflict and, importantly, to assure others in his situation that there is always hope.  With astonishing resilience and strength, and the support of friends and family, Rory endured 20 operations. But, most bravely of all, he is \u0026shyovercoming those who mocked him by campaigning for more awareness of the effects of bullying, educating on discrimination and inspiring others. He is highlighting the prejudice he has faced by fronting the Changing Faces Hate Crime Campaign. Rory is working with the police to raise awareness of how people with \u0026shydisfigurements are protected by UK hate crime law. Now he has been \u0026shyshortlisted for Young Upstander at the No2H8Crime Awards. Thursday’s awards ceremony, hosted by TV presenter and social commentator June Sarpong MBE, is held to reward people and organisations which have been exceptional in fighting hate crime.  For Rory, born with a venous malformation on his lip, caused by abnormally formed veins that can enlarge as the body grows, it is a \u0026shybrilliant platform to highlight again how devastating hate can be. He says: “I haven’t had it easy over the past few years, juggling lots of \u0026shyoperations with having to deal with ignorance and prejudice because I look a little different. “The mental side of the abuse I had to face really halted my \u0026shydevelopment from a teenager into a young man. On the morning of my 21st birthday I spent around two hours crying. “Because it is seen as a big milestone age that is normally celebrated in a big way. But, instead, I was upset I had reached that age and was still having to go through prejudice. “I didn’t have the confidence to go out. If I did go out, I’d experience prejudice and that would make me feel really bad about myself. It was really hard to deal with the constant staring from people of all ages. But now I’m at the point where I accept what I look like. “I’m trying to teach people that no matter what you look like you shouldn’t put anyone through any sort of prejudice.” A big part of his acceptance has come from wanting to educate those who tormented him, rather than seeking revenge.  He says: “I’d try to educate them, to make them see the error of their ways. I’d tell them what they did to me really, really hurt me.” Now, alongside his campaign work, Rory lives a full life, working for a medical \u0026shyinsurance company, as well as enjoying his passion for golf. He also has a supportive girlfriend, Isabel, 20, who will be attending the awards with him. He says: “I’m really excited and overwhelmed to be shortlisted. “I’ve had a look at the other people who are up for nominations and they’re all so inspirational. They do such great work that I’m just happy to be mentioned in the same sentence as them.

The Duchess of Sussex and her dad, 74, haven\u0027t spoken since shortly after her wedding to Prince Harry in May when he famously pulled out of walking her down the aisle following a heart scare.

Runners, cyclists, triathletes, rowers and others over 35 who push themselves to the limit are not immune to the condition that can trigger a heart attack, angina or stroke.  And often they don\u0027t have any symptoms of the condition that involve narrowed or blocked blood vessels.  Instead moderation was key to minimising the risk of sudden cardiac death .  The findings were based on 798 recreational and competitive Canadian athletes dubbed masters athletes who do moderate to vigorous physical activity at least three days a week. Results suggested these middle-aged exercisers should have check ups for cardiovascular risk factors, especially if they have high blood pressure, high cholesterol or a family history of cardiovascular disease.  Lead author and PhD student Barbara Morrison at the University of British Columbia said: We all know that exercise is good for us - it can help prevent a range of health problems and diseases, from cancer to depression. However, even if you are really active, our findings suggest that you still can\u0027t outrun your risk factors. She explained: Coronary artery disease  is the primary cause of sudden cardiac death  in athletes over 35 years old, with symptoms preceding the event in only 12 to 36 per cent of cases. Although regular physical activity reduces cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, athletes may possess cardiovascular risk factors or underlying cardiovascular disease , putting them at heightened risk for SCD during periods of vigorous-intensity activity. The risk of SCD transiently increases during vigorous-intensity activity compared with mild or no physical activity, with the greatest risk in inactive men  compared with those who exercise frequently . Masters athletes over 35 years old are a growing population that require dedicated attention to identify at-risk individuals in order to ensure their safe participation in competitive sports, which often demand sustained vigorous to maximal intensity effort. The study participants were asked a range of questions about their health, family history and physical activity levels and had their blood pressure checked and waist circumference measured. Some also took part in an exercise stress test. Those with abnormal results underwent further testing, such as a CT coronary angiogram, to determine if they had cardiovascular disease. Of the 798 athletes, 94 or 11 per cent were found to have significant cardiovascular disease. Ten participants were found to have severe coronary artery disease - a blockage in their artery of 70 per cent or greater - despite not having any symptoms.  The results build on previous research that found masters athletes have a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease than non-athletes of the same age with similar risk factors. However, previous research has also found that, compared to non-athletes, masters athletes typically have more calcified plaque, which is known to be more stable and less likely to cause a heart attack. While the findings may seem alarming, Morrison emphasised that it doesn\u0027t mean masters athletes should stop exercising. She said: The good news is that cardiovascular disease is treatable. Medication has been proven to reduce mortality risk, and even more so in people who are active.

Joanne Wharf had her children Thomas, 3, and Ella, 9 and a friend of her daughter\u0027s in the car when the accident happened. She had to swerve to prevent a head-on collision as the two girls screamed in fear. Joanne told Cambridgeshire Live: It was terror, it was terrifying, I knew there was going to be an accident. I know the two girls were screaming, they were screaming before the car hit us.  Joanne felt like her only hope of avoiding a fatal accident was to swerve and hope to lessen the impact, Cambridge News reports.  She said: I knew this was coming I didn\u0027t even have time to warn the kids like they do in films. I swerved the car. Before I\u0027d even swerved the car properly they were there, boom.  Joanne believes the other driver was doing at least 70mph when they smashed into the driver\u0027s side of her car, which was only travelling at round 20mph. Joanne was driving on Mouth Road in Guyhirn near Wisbech, a road that she says is narrow, windy and like a single track road. Vivid images of the accident on Wednesday night still flash through her mind. She says she still hasn\u0027t been back in a car since because she\u0027s still haunted by the accident and images of the other car \u0027flying\u0027 towards her. I avoided the head-on collision which was amazing, we were on the side of the road, his car was in the middle of the road. I got out my car to talk to them they drove off as fast as they could. She added: They didn\u0027t even stop to see if anyone was hurt or OK, just flew off as fast as they could. As grateful as the family are to be alive Joanne says she\u0027s still haunted by thoughts of what could have happened. The speed he was going I don\u0027t think we would have all got out the car and that\u0027s the most terrifying thing, she said. The what ifs are playing in your head.  Joanne and the three children in the car all suffered minor injuries, but the mental toll has been harder to deal with. She says her daughter Ella is struggling to shake her fear since the crash. She said: My little girl was in the front seat, she saw the car coming, she knew what was going to happen, she\u0027s quite badly affected but it. She\u0027s very scared, very upset. She hasn\u0027t slept in her own bed since, she won\u0027t be alone. Joanne says when she called police she was told officers would not come to the site because the road wasn\u0027t blocked. Joanne says were it not for the kindness of passing strangers she would have been sitting on the side of the road alone.  A spokesman for Cambridgeshire Constabulary said: We were called at 8.05pm on Wednesday  with reports of a collision in Mouth Lane, Fenland.   One of the vehicles left the scene, but there was no immediate danger or threat to life. Information from the ambulance service suggested there was no injuries, but the victim was shaken up.   The victim was advised to report the incident online.  Joanne said: There were people that stopped to help. They were helping sort out the car and phoned my boyfriend and looked after the children. One of the drivers took the family to hospital where they were treated for whiplash and other minor injuries. The 34-year-old added: We were out the car, sat on the grass verge, a lady came out her house, she got blankets for us all. After it happened and we were all ok then I was just angry, for them to come flying down like that. I thought \u0027what were they doing?\u0027 I wanted to yell at them, what are you doing, I\u0027ve got three kids in the car.\u0027 I was so confused, how can anyone do that and just leave? I was completely baffled.

The National Lottery offers mega-money prizes, with previous winners scooping up to \u0026pound33 million each in the past.  Here\u0027s how the Lotto transformed the lives of a Gloucester taxi driver, a modest mum-to-two and a supermarket assistant among others over the years. Some of the biggest UK winners since the National Lottery began back in 1994 celebrated in style.  1. David and Carol Martin - \u0026pound33 million   The couple were both 54 when they were unveiled as winners of half of a record National Lottery jackpot of \u0026pound66 million. It happened after 14 consecutive rollovers in January 2016. David and Carol, from Hawick in the Scottish Borders, were relaxing at home with the lottery ticket on their mantelpiece and only checked it when a friend urged them to do so. Mr Martin soon quit his job with Borders Care and Repair, which helps elderly and disabled people fit specialist equipment in their homes. And Mrs Martin retired after working at a chemist for most of her working life. 2. Lisa and Jerry Cannings - \u0026pound32 million  The teachers scooped a \u0026pound32.5 million rollover Lotto jackpot but waited a week to claim their winnings in 2016 as the decorators were in. Gerry Cannings, then 63, and his wife Lisa, then 48, from near Peterborough, Cambs., only bought the ticket after popping out for fish and chips. The couple had been together for 13 years when they won. 3. Amo Riselli - \u0026pound24.5 million   The taxi driver, from Gloucester, won his sum despite not having all of the numbers in January.  The 50-year-old, who has five kids, planned to quit his job and buy a Ferrari. The grandfather-to-nine also planned to move house to a home with a swimming pool. I may now be a multi-millionaire but I am still the same normal person I always was, just with a bit more loose change in my pocket, the cabbie said. 4. Mark Gardiner and Paul Maddison - \u0026pound22.5 million  Business partners Mark and Paul landed the then Britain\u0027s biggest ever single lottery win in 1995. They invested it and, in 2005, it emerged Mark had bought Caribbean beach houses and a fleet of Aston Martins. It is unclear how Paul spent his money. 5. Anonymous - \u0026pound21.3 million  A lucky winner scooped \u0026pound21.3 million in June 2017 but decided not be publicly named. All winners get the option to avoid being named publicly when they scoop a big prize. 6. Donna and David Stickley - \u0026pound21 million  The married couple, of Slough, Berks., went for a week without checking their \u0026pound21 million jackpot-winning lottery ticket. Donna Stickley, then 48, and David, then 58, said they might spend some of their winnings on a beach honeymoon and making sure that elderly relatives are looked after, but they planned to go back to work. It emerged Donna had left the winning ticket in the bottom of her handbag in May this year. David said he wanted to buy a sports car. 7. Iris Jeffrey - \u0026pound20 million  Iris, then 58, was battling cancer when she won \u0026pound20 million in 2004. The mum-of-two, of Belfast, bought the ticket from Tesco and forgot about it. It turned out she left it in a cupboard. The modest housewife wanted to buy a new washing machine. 8. Ken Henry - \u0026pound13 million  The Liverpool FC fan, then 62, shared his fortune with partner Sandra Fosbrooke in 2003. Sandra and her man, then 48, lived the life of luxury for years. But the former supermarket assistant, of Carmarthenshire, south Wales, decided to become landlady of her village pub in 2010. She said: I was determined to keep my feet on the ground and at the same time put something back into the community.  9. John Stinchcombe and John Ackerman - \u0026pound11.5 million   John Stinchcombe, then 59 and John Ackerman, then 63, from Crumlin, near Newbridge, south Wales, initially thought they had won \u0026pound50 in the lottery in 2006. But the former miners split a huge lot more between them. The friends treated their partners after the win.  10.

A further one in ten have never made their own bed and 17 per cent have never operated a washing machine. A survey of the nation’s young adults has revealed how totally unprepared modern youngsters are for leaving home. Some 11 per cent admitted they have no idea how to operate a washing machine and a further one in ten not knowing how to cook a simple pasta dish. And it seems modern mums and dads are to blame for mollycoddling, with seven in ten of those polled said their parents make every meal for them and that they are waited on hand and foot - with washing and ironing and even cleaning their own bedroom falling to their parents.  The nationwide survey of 1,000 youngsters who are about to leave home to start university, found as many as half admit they are completely unprepared to fly the nest for the first time. As many as 17 per cent have never cleaned a bathroom in their life. The study by Iceland, showed nearly a third of prospective undergraduates said their lack of basic skills has left them unable to sleep at night in the run-up to them leaving the comfort of the family home and 18 percent are fearful that university will be a disaster. Of those quizzed 43 per cent said they are worried about handling their own finances for the first time, while more than one in ten astonishingly said they couldn’t make their own bed - while a further one in ten can’t even boil an egg.  According to the survey, 17 per cent are apprehensive about working a washing machine when they are living in students digs and 14 percent of university students say their parents do absolutely everything for them when they lived at home. Just 53 per cent percent are expected to help out household chores when living at home. To help unprepared students, Iceland is launching a 10 per cent discount off its entire range, both in-store and online, to help youngsters settle in to life away from home and ease the pressure of managing their finances for the first time. Marketing Director at Iceland Neil Hayes said: “It’s only natural for students to be apprehensive about leaving home for the first time and we want to make the transition easier. “Our research has shown that students feel they are somewhat unprepared to fend for themselves when they leave home, especially when buying food. “We are offering a 10 per cent off discount for students to use in store from the 17th of September. “This will hopefully relieve some of the pressures that students are facing and to give them money off our range of great value and convenient foods such as frozen avocado and pizzas.” "},{"url":null,"title":"pontins cleaner given 20 minutes","story":"NewsPontins worker \u0027given 20 minutes to clean filthy chalets with vomit-filled sinks and towels covered in POO\u0027Joel Leaver, worked at the Pontins Prestatyn Sands site in Wales from 2013 to 2015, and says cleaners faced an \u0027uphill battle\u0027 as some rooms hadn\u0027t been updated \u0027in 40 years\u0027Share\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByElaine McCahill18:30, 9 SEP 2018Updated18:39, 9 SEP 2018NewsA Pontins cleaner has told of how he was given \u002720 minutes\u0027 to clean \u0027filthy\u0027 chalets \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA former cleaner at a Pontins resort has told of how he was given just 20 minutes to clean \u0027filthy chalets\u0027. Joel Leaver worked as a cleaner at the Prestatyn Sands site in Wales from 2013 to 2015 - and describes cleaning sinks \u0027blocked with vomit and towels covered in faeces\u0027 - sometimes with NO gloves. It comes after numerous complaints throughout the summer regarding hygiene standards at the holiday operator\u0027s sites. Just days ago, council chiefs ordered for the pool at the Prestatyn resort to be closed with pictures showing the state it was in before being shut down. Another family claimed their chalet at the same resort in Wales was \u0027like a crack den\u0027 .  Writing for Wales Online , Joel told of how he started as an accommodation assistant or cleaner at the complex when he was 17. Joel worked there during school holidays and odd weekends between 2013 and 2015, originally earning \u0026pound3.72 an hour, which was increased to \u0026pound5.03 when he turned 18. Joel said: In my opinion, the site was out-dated and a little decrepit and needing serious attention. The general feel was that it wasn\u0027t very well looked after, and it seemed like a set from a drama televised decades ago.  Whilst I was employed there, I watched Holiday on the Buses, which was filmed there in the 70s. Some of the bathrooms I was cleaning were identical to those in the film. Rooms appeared to have been left untouched, in some cases, for at least 40 years. Joel said he and his fellow cleaners were fighting an uphill battle every day and had just 20 minutes to clean each chalet. He said: Ovens, for example, were already so dirty that we couldn\u0027t possibly get them looking much better.  We could clean the floor and wipe down surfaces, but that was the extent of our role we glossed over the cracks and problems that were already present. It would take more than some diluted cleaning spray or a mop to fix the major issues. Cleaners at the camp were paired up on most shifts, and it was expected that each chalet would be cleaned within 20 minutes. On average, most chalets included a bathroom, kitchen, big living room space and between one and two bedrooms. Staff were also expected to stock up the chalets with pillows and any missing kitchen utensils as well, and bedding needed to be rolled up neatly. Recalling a particularly gruesome incident, Joel said: One time myself and my partner found a sink blocked with vomit.  As well as time consuming, this is also unacceptable - nobody should be left to clean that up except the person themselves. It was probably one of the many chalets left with cans and bottles scattered all across the floor from yet another group of partying guests. Another time, we turned up to find several towels in the bath that were covered in faeces. I\u0027ll never know what really happened although I had to clean the mess up, gagging during each second of it. There were numerous occasions when gloves would be out of stock - and so we cleaned this sort of thing without them sometimes.  Even though he was 17 and fairly physically fit at the time, Joel said it was hard to get everything done in the allotted time and that it was particularly hard on older staff members. He continued: Most people could easily spend the whole 20 minutes on a bathroom or kitchen, especially if particularly dirty. Cleaners were poorly equipped, lacking the supplies that we needed. Cleaning products were weak, and when we did receive some branded alternatives once, they were scarce and their inclusion didn\u0027t last long.  The vacuum cleaners were outdated, to the extent that they were pretty heavy and fairly useless. I remember at a training session, probably in 2015, I was told that \u0026pound1 million had been made in the last year. Did I see a pay rise because of it? No. Did the site get any major revamp? Absolutely not. This wasn\u0027t a business that was struggling to stay afloat. It was making money, yet the site and staff never reaped any benefits from this.

The 33-year-old told Birmingham Live the yob brandished a hammer then tried batter down her door in front of three of her children.  They were reportedly singing along to songs on YouTube at the time.  Sarah, from Bournville, Birmingham, said: We had just eaten dinner and my children were listening to songs on You Tube. The next thing I hear is loud banging on the door and a woman\u0027s voice. I opened the door and she was screaming that she was fed up and that she was \u0027going to get me.\u0027 My children were really frightened. There was no way I was going to stay there while I was being threatened in this way. Sarah says the woman approached her again and was threatening her with a knife but she said she dropped it when she started to record the incident.   West Midlands Police are investigating the disturbance.  It was just a terrifying experience. My little boy Kamran was murdered back in 2007 and it brought it all back to me. My children were scared and I feared for their safety. I left the flat after that incident and I haven\u0027t been back since. I rang police who have been to see me to take a statement. I am currently living with my mother but I can\u0027t do that forever. I won\u0027t go back until the woman is removed or I am rehoused elsewhere, Sarah added.  Sarah\u0027s 15-month-old son Kamran was battered to death on May 2007 by her partner Nicholas Kirnon, who was supposed to be looking after him while she was at work.

The sick and disgraceful remake featured a smashed up vehicle imitating the crashed Mercedes that Diana was travelling in when she died in Paris. It included a Jimmy Savile impersonator and writer Jonathan Meades played the role of Diana\u0027s brother Charles, Earl Spencer - who read his original funeral speech in full. The coffin arrived in an Uber, mourners threw broccoli and flowers as it was carried into a warehouse and a Mexican mariachi band performed Elton John\u0027s Candle in the Wind.  The event was organised by artist Stanley Schtinter at The White Hotel, a rundown popular rave warehouse in Manchester located yards away from Strangeways prison. Around 160 people attended - and many of the mourners were no older than 30. Photographer Karen Priestley, 49, attended the event on Thursday on the 21st anniversary of Diana\u0027s funeral. She said: There must have been around 160 people there and some of them looked emotional.  People were carrying flowers and broccoli - a lot of those attending would be too young to remember the original. It was sick and disgraceful - there was a smashed up car imitating the vehicle Diana was in when she died. It was covered in flowers and they had a picture of Diana with roses next to it. The final service was a word for word reenactment of her funeral - and they even had an actor playing Diana\u0027s brother to read his speech.  They had somebody dressed up as a priest and a man dressed as a high priest. The White Hotel is a disused warehouse where they hold raves - it\u0027s white but that\u0027s the only thing that is true to the name. The procession started at 6.30pm and the route wound its way through the backstreets of Broughton in Salford. The White Hotel said of the event: The World Cup may not be coming home but our Queen of Hearts has just ordered a taxi and she\u0027s on her way.

Brian Walker, 62, was dismissed by the Scout Association but is now said to have received a payment of \u0026pound1,500 in an out-of-court settlement.  He has also withdrawn a discrimination claim due to go to court in Bristol in November, the Sunday Times reports.  The Scouts today told The Mirror: “We can confirm we have come to an out of court settlement with Mr Walker regarding his claim. This settlement does not imply that we accept Mr Walker’s claim made against us or his view of the world.  The Scouts do not accept Mr Walker was right when he made his offensive comments.    As a charity, we had to weigh up whether it was worth using our limited time and money on a costly and prolonged legal dispute. In this case, we decided it was in our best interests to settle this matter out of court.”  The Christian Legal Centre said in a statement today Mr Walker would donate the sum to the Centre to spend on cases challenging anti-Christian discrimination. The Scout Association has agreed to settle a discrimination claim of Mr Brian Walker, a veteran scoutmaster expelled from the Association last year for criticising its official magazine for “promoting” Islam and LGBT pride events. Mr Walker, 62, supported by the Christian Legal Centre, brought a claim alleging discrimination on the grounds of his Christian beliefs. In August, he accepted the Scout Association’s offer to pay damages and compensate his legal costs in an out-of-court settlement. Mr Walker intends to donate the entire sum of the award to the Christian Legal Centre, to be spent on similar cases challenging anti-Christian discrimination.     As the Bristol Post reported in February, Mr Walker, an assistant Explorer Scout leader from Bristol, wrote to Scouting magazine to complain after it featured a Muslim leader who was also a scout leader.  The woman, named as Zainab, told the Spring 2017 edition of the magazine: “A couple of times we’ve been out on hikes in our hijabs and neckers, and people have come up to us and given us a lot of positive comments. “It is not a barrier it doesn’t stop me from doing anything. I’m bossy. Nobody can say I’m repressed.” But Mr Walker, a canoeing instructor, wrote to the magazine to say they would “most likely drown wearing that Darth Vader tent”. In his letter, which was unpublished, he said her “outward appearance is enough to frighten children and animals”.  Mr Walker told the Bristol Post he believed the scouting movement was “moving away from its Christian roots” and that it had become “fluffy”.   But the association said “inclusivity is at the heart of modern scouting” and an important value to them. The editor of the official magazine wrote back to say he disagreed with the letter, and Mr Walker was dismissed from the association four days later. The district commissioner for Bristol South also told Mr Walker his views “did not reflect the inclusive nature of scouting” and that his membership would be cancelled with immediate effect. The 63-year-old, who lives in Brislington, started his membership with the association when he joined the cubs as a boy. He became a scout leader after his children became scouts themselves.  He told the Post : “It was just a quip, meant to be tongue in cheek. Communication is paramount when you are a scout leader, but if they can’t see your face, how do they know who you are?  “People are so fearful of speaking out. I’ve got two special needs kids with Asperger Syndrome and cerebral palsy, so I know all about exclusion.” "},{"url":null,"title":"sinead mcnamara devastated friends defend","story":"NewsSinead McNamara: Devastated friends defend model who died on £104m superyacht from sick trollsThe tragic 20-year-old was found dead tangled in ropes on the Mayan Queen IV in GreeceShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByBradley Jolly10:17, 9 SEP 2018Updated13:20, 9 SEP 2018NewsSinead McNamara was found dead on the superyacht in Greece in the early hours of last Friday \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailDevastated friends of a young Instagram model who was found dead on a \u0026pound104 million superyacht have defended her memory from attacks by cruel online trolls. Sinead McNamara, 20, was found dead tangled in ropes on the billionaire\u0027s boat on which she was working in Greece. Authorities believe she took her own life last Friday, and vicious trolls have since targeted her social media to post vile comments. You lived for attention, now you\u0027ve got it, one Instagram user wrote. Unfortunately the steep price you pay with lifestyles like this, added another.  But Sinead\u0027s 20,000-strong Instagram following hit back yesterday with heartfelt messages of support and tributes. A friend wrote: To the people who really knew and loved you the most, you were so much more than an Instagram model. You were a best friend, a daughter, a sister, and someone who always went out and chased what she wanted. Thank you for helping to shape me into the person I am today... we will meet again someday. Another described the model as a free spirit.  She posted: This morning I woke up to some very devastating news, that I had lost a friend of mine. I\u0027ll never forget spending our time surfing together, tanning and getting absolutely smashed in the shore breakers.  I am lucky to have spent my last years of high school with you - and you sure as hell made your short time on earth one to remember. Fly high you free spirit. Another heartbroken pal wrote: It\u0027s as if it were yesterday that we were chasing waterfalls in the nude, climbing the highest tree we could find, dancing in summer rain and surfing before the sun came out,\u0027 she wrote. You never said no, meaning you were the best and most spontaneous influence at the tender age of 14.

At just 10-years-old, they have each landed big contracts with Marks \u0026amp Spencer and both are naturals.  But their futures were not always this positive when they were each diagnosed with Down\u0027s Syndrome at birth, their families were terrified.  Cora\u0027s mother was advised to have an abortion because doctors mistakenly thought her baby\u0027s heart and brain were not developing properly.  Lucas was diagnosed with Down\u0027s Syndrome the same week that his brother was diagnosed with cerebral palsy, Wales Online reported.  Now fast forward a decade later and they are minor celebrities - juggling their modelling duties alongside going to primary school.  Lucus’s story   Until six-year-old Lucus was born, proud parents Kellie and Dominic Evans had no idea their child would have Down’s Syndrome. No sooner had the family taken home their newborn son than they were faced with another discovery – a week later their older son Alexander was diagnosed with cerebral palsy. Since then, however, the two boys have only gone from strength to strength and now hold their own alongside their two sisters modelling for a number of mainstream agencies. “In two weeks I discovered my two boys had disabilities,” saiid Kellie, 40, from Bridgend. “I knew nothing. Where we were living a child paediatrician was leaving and another one was starting and we were in the couple of weeks where there wasn’t one.  “I was at home when Lucus was about seven days old and I remember looking at things online. I phoned the doctors and just said ‘I don’t want to read about the fact that my son might be infertile online, I need someone to sit down with me and tell me’. “When you have a child their future isn’t mapped out, they can do anything. “I remember crying saying to Dominic that Lucus will never be a fireman – I didn’t even want him to be a fireman. “I wasn’t being negative, I was just being a realist.” Kellie said: “She did the sign for Clean Bandit’s Rockabye – I think then she had been learning sign language for about a year. It got 30,000 views. Now she does pop songs and will do her word of the day videos. People will message her through me to say they are learning to talk to their child through it.  “She taught herself and we are learning from her. I can sign ‘I love you’ to Lucus and we’re not disturbing anyone. Lucus loves it, it’s like his secret little language.” So far Lucus has starred in campaigns for the likes of Thomas and Friends and the NSPCC followed by a TV debut on Hollyoaks. He has also been featured on National Trust and Royal Mints adverts alongside brother Alexander, eight, and sisters Isabella, 12, and Indiana, four. For Kellie the decision to use a mainstream agency for all four siblings stemmed from her concerns over pigeonholing children with disabilities. She said: “He loves it. For Lucus as much as he doesn’t talk a lot he is really sociable and as soon as that camera comes out he will start to interact with it.” She added: “Overall people are really positive – so many people tell me how beautiful Lucus is – but there has been the odd one. “You have people staring as they are curious or have a personal story or know someone who is disabled but they are too shy to ask anything. “You can tell those from people with a grimace.  “I remember I was in Bristol about two and a half years ago and a lady came from a behind a coffee table. “She said ‘Do you realise that things have come on so much now that you can fix his eyes?’. I just remember looking at her.” This summer being chosen for the Marks \u0026amp Spencer back to school campaign marked Lucus’ biggest work yet thanks to child agency Kiddiwinks. For his family the work represents an important step in including people with Down’s Syndrome in the mainstream media. Since then family and friends have sent Lucus pictures of his posters from all over the world, including as far as Dubai. Kellie said: “Lucus loves seeing himself on TV and seeing his siblings but with Marks \u0026amp Spencer it was the first time he was shocked. “He did the shoot and they took the photos and they came back and said they want to use it worldwide. “It’s just so great to see a child with Down’s Syndrome in shops like M\u0026ampS.”  You can follow Lucus and his siblings on their Instagram page.   Cora\u0027s story      At 21 weeks pregnant Sheryl Bishop was told there were complications with her unborn daughter Cora. Refusing the option to terminate the pregnancy, the 32-year-old and her partner Daniel went forward not knowing what to expect. “We knew there were complications with the pregnancy from 20 weeks,” Sheryl, from Brymbo, said. “We were told her heart hadn’t developed, her brain hadn’t developed, and her face hadn’t developed so we were expecting something much worse. “All the way through we were pushed for a termination before any sort of diagnosis, even at 37 weeks. “We were made aware of our options including tests and terminations and made it clear that the only way we would consider a termination was if our daughter was at risk of organ failure and would suffer from birth.”  At 39 weeks Cora was born after an emergency C-Section. Sheryl said: “Daniel was the first to hold her and his face said it all – he was smiling but he looked concerned so I knew something was wrong. “As soon as I saw her little face I knew that Cora had Down’s Syndrome. I felt a pang of pain and then a huge sense of relief that all the things we’d have been expecting were wrong.” ora is now seven years old and a pupil at Gwersyllt Primary School. Last April her family heard about Zebedee Management agency, who specialise in working with children with disabilities.  After being signed up Cora was soon invited to a casting for the River Island ‘Labels Are For Clothes’ campaign to celebrate diversity.  Following a 10-hour round trip and 10-minute audition Cora was selected together with other children aged between three and 10 for the campaign.  Mother-of-two Sheryl said: “Cora absolutely loved it – she was in her element being the centre of attention and making everyone laugh. “She loves all the big bows and girly things. “They took her to the set where they film the video and she just ran on and started playing with the balloons – they didn’t need to give her any direction.” Since her work for River Island, Cora has made an appearance on This Morning as well as starring in a video collaboration between Calpol and BuzzFeed. For her appearing in the M\u0026ampS campaign marked her greatest success yet. Sheryl said: “Holly [Willoughby] and Phil [Schofield] are so lovely – everyone said they would be but they were genuinely so nice. They were so complimentary to Cora, saying how beautiful and shiny her hair was.

The chain said there would be no dogs allowed from Monday, September 10 in any branch across the country. As well as being banned indoors, dogs will also not be allowed in outside areas around its pubs, such as beer gardens.  A JD Wetherspoon spokesman said that the group\u0027s hard-working staff had grown tired of picking up poop.  The company said it had been lenient with dog owners in recent years but would be strictly prohibiting all pooches from now. The exception to the rule is assistance dogs who will be allowed inside and beer gardens.   Announcing the news last month, a statement from Wetherspoons said: Please note that Wetherspoon has a policy of not allowing dogs in its pubs, including all outside areas. .  This policy was introduced shortly after the company was founded in 1979, although in recent years we have allowed a few exceptions. After much consultation, we will now be strictly enforcing this policy everywhere. In order to give those affected time to adjust we have set a deadline of Monday, September 10, 2018.  Wetherspoons, founded in 1979 by Tim Martin, has just under 1,000 outlets around the country.   Spokesman Eddie Gershon added: Even well behaved dogs can be unpredictable, every dog owner thinks their dog is perfect. We welcome a lot of children and families and younger children in particular can be unpredictable around dogs and many are scared of dogs. We serve a lot of food. Unfortunately not all owners are diligent over cleaning up dog mess.

Laura Beattie, who has cystic fibrosis , carries an oxygen tank around almost everywhere but now her health is gradually worsening.  She is one of 354 people in Britain waiting for a lung transplant - a list that is getting longer each year - and without one she could die. She was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis as a baby and while she was able to cope relatively untroubled as a child, it has gradually declined during her adult years. Now, she has just 24 per cent lung function.  “When I’m sat down it’s okay,” she told the Manchester Evening News.  “But it’s everything really - getting changed, just moving around in my seat can take it out of me.  “Even just going to my car I use oxygen. “I have the tank in a wheeler trolley, that takes the strain off my back, or if I’ve got someone with me who will carry it it’s easier for me. “It’s just an added extra in the day. I do panic a little bit. Sometimes you’re just trying everything to get your breath back.” Laura credits the support of her family and friends for getting her through the day. She recently set up a fashion business called Careaux with her sister Rachel Beattie, 23, who knows when Laura needs to take a break. “My family are amazing,” said Laura. They look after me so well. If I’m feeling unwell my sister can come and take over and let me do what I need to do.” The NHS say the biggest barrier to organ donation and transplantation remains family refusal.

The move on Saturday came as part of a bid to promote tourism after falling visitor numbers in the country, which suffered following political upheaval in 2011 and the downing of a Russian plane in 2015. The tomb, discovered in 1940 by Egyptologist Zaki Saad, belongs to an ancient Egypt high-ranking official named Mehu who was related to the first king of the 6th dynasty. The tomb included two chambers, both with wall inscriptions of the owner of the tomb hunting.  There are also drawings showing aspects of Ancient Egyptian lives such as hunting and acrobatic dancing. Mehu lived during the reign of King Pepi and held 48 titles, found inscribed on the walls of his chamber. The head of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, Mostafa Al-Waziri, said: It is a 4500-year old tomb from the 6th dynasty.  It is during the King Pepi rule,  he continued. It is a family tomb of a father, son and grandson. We are seeing Mehu, his son Meren Ra and his grandson Heteb Kha. The tombs owner had 48 titles. Archaeologists have so far this year excavated a number of relics that include a 4,400-year-old tomb at the Giza plateau and an ancient necropolis in Minya, south of Cairo. Egypt is hoping these discoveries will brighten its image abroad and revive interest among travelers who once flocked to its iconic pharaonic temples and pyramids but who have shunned the country since its 2011 political uprising.

I think it might be good for both of us.”While Kamara has remained in Scotland this week for treatment, Kallman is off on international duty, though not with the full squad.But while, after winning his first full cap earlier this year, he appears to be dropping a level as he joins the U/21 squad for two vital Euro qualifiers, he’s happy.The 20-year-old is very much of the opinion that his near-certain involvement against Denmark and Poland will be a case of taking one step back to make two forward.The Dens loan signing from Turku doesn’t hide from the fact he would love to have competed at the higher level.For him, though, time on the park is what matters most and that’s why he’s more than happy to be representing his country in the younger age group.“Of course you always want to go forward and I heard back in Finland they were looking to put new players into the team and the manager said I was one of the options,” he said.“However, then again you have to think about that. Now I am in the U/21s and we have two qualifier games.“I’ve played with them all the time and am going to play as the first striker for them. You have to know which are the best moments to go to the first team because, if I go to the U/21s, I’ll get playing time and we have two games to try to qualify with them.“For that reason I think it might be better to be with the U/21s to get playing time. If I got called up to the first team, yes, I would be there but how much playing time will I get, I don’t know.“It’s easier to say afterwards because you don’t know how much time you will get but with the U/21s I know I am guaranteed playing time.”And the benefit to Dundee of his trip back to the continent should be the competitive nature of the action he sees.Not only are the opposition he’ll face of a decent standard, there’s plenty of stake in the fixtures.If the young Finns can win both, they would still be in with a chance of qualifying for the Euro finals, though the history of the group so far does suggest they will have their work cut out.When they faced the Danes at home last year they were on the wrong end of a 5-0 drubbing, so to beat them in the away tie will be a big ask.Kallman, though, is up for the challenge and is determined to do all his can to at least extend Finnish interest in qualification.“These will be a tough two games. They are the deciders for us because teams are four and five points ahead of us in the table with Poland first and Denmark second.“We have to at least not lose these game to still have a chance to proceed.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"craig easton sees irn bru as a chance for dundee united kids to get their fizz back","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United reserve team boss Craig Easton believes Saturday’s Irn-Bru Cup clash with Alloa will be the perfect test for his young team.The Tangerines second string were on the wrong end of a 5-1 score in the Reserve League at Hearts on Monday.But Craig believes the margin of the home team’s victory was not a fair reflection on his side’s play and is viewing the weekend tie as a chance to show that.“We are looking forward to the game even though it comes on the back of what wasn’t a good result for us against Hearts,” he said.“It wasn’t a 5-1 performance, though. We missed two penalties and we were always in the game until the last two goals went in later in the second half.“So, I think the score was harsh on us in the end but you still don’t want to lose five goals in any game and you want to defend better.”Looking forward, he suspects Alloa will not be much changed from the side that drew with United in the Championship last weekend“I think they don’t have a massive squad so it could be similar to the league game against us on Saturday. They are a good, fit and organised outfit. It will be a hard game.”As was the case in the first-round victory over St Johnstone Colts last month, the United ranks at Tannadice on Saturday are likely to be bolstered by several first-team men.And young midfielder Archie Thomas is back in contention for a starting place.He was injured in the first minute of the first-round victory but returned for half an hour of Monday’s game.United have set the entry price for Saturday’s game at £10.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b618c05b50b5-923x564.jpg ","title":"csaba laszlos new boys are showing some promise at dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIt remains early days so far as judging new-look Dundee United goes but there is no question Csaba Laszlo’s team are getting to know each other.After a sticky start to the season, there have been definite signs over the last three, unbeaten, Championship outings that the team is coming together.And the Tele takes a look and how the new men have contributed, so far.Matej RakovanAfter joining up on the same day as fellow-goalie Benjamin Siegrist, one of the big questions going into the campaign was which of the pair would get the nod. It was the Slovakian and, so far, he’s justified the faith shown in him with a string of impressive performances. He did make an error for the goal lost against Partick, but by then the game had been comfortably won.Frederic FransThe Belgian was added to the squad to provide steel in central defence and the fact he had experience of the Scottish game from a spell with Partick made him a sensible addition. So far he’s lived up to expectations and looked a strong and calming influence.Paul WatsonProbably the most low key signing, at first it seemed doubtful if the man who was a squad player at Falkirk would feature too often. Given his chance at Queen of the South last month, the powerful centre-half grabbed the opportunity and impressed in each of his three league games to date, scoring three goals in the process. With the arrival of Rachid Bouhenna, he still faces a challenge to keep his place.Christoph RabitschThe Austrian has had a robust start to his United career and a couple of rash tackles when he was already on a booking have seen him subbed to prevent the team being reduced to 10 men. The 22-year-old was publicly slapped down by Csaba for that. He appears to have taken it on board and there’s no question his ability to get in about opponents is an asset.Adam BartonCaptured from Partick Thistle just before the Betfred Cup games kicked off, the tall Englishman has added to United’s new-found aerial strength. Most of his appearances so far have been in midfield, so he’ll face a challenge once skipper Fraser Fyvie returns from injury, but he’s also been used in central defence and that versatility has given the manager more options.Fraser AirdOne of the first signings of the summer, the Canadian has added pace in the wide areas. He earned his move on the strength of performances against United for Dunfermline last term and, so far, he might just have been the best of the new bunch.Yannick LoembaThe winger was an unknown quantity who hadn’t had much football in the last year or so. However, there’s been no evidence of that and he’s made a lightning start to his time with United.

I reckon Dundee have a real gem.“He went on to the pitch and scored straight-away, which was a terrific way to introduce himself.”There was little time to rest for the 19-year-old signed from Huddersfield in January.On Monday, he was in action for the Dark Blues’ second string as they chalked up a 4-0 success over Rangers in the Reserve League.He came off the bench to score after replacing Sofien Moussa, who also got on the scoresheet.Elton Ngwatala and Jean Mendy got the other goals.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundees first brewing operation in more than 30 years to expand","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee’s first brewing operation in more than 30 years is set to expand its facilities after a planning application was approved by the city council.71 Brewing, based in Bellfield Street, had applied to the local authority to build three additional tanks outside its main building.Detailed diagrams included with the application, submitted by local architect Jon Frullani, showed that each of the three 1,092kg tanks could hold almost 8,000 litres of beer.

Because it was the first time it was exciting, but I soon realised it did not appeal to me any more.”Victoria said she didn’t like the sensation of drinking alcohol as it triggered feelings of anxiety.“Most of my friends drank at that point, so sometimes I felt left out,” she said.“But I soon decided I didn’t need to drink just because everyone else was.“It is hard not to feel pressure sometimes so I had to stay with the friends who didn’t care if I was drinking or not.“I have lost friends through my decision not to drink.“Sometimes it would be my friend’s 18th birthday party and I would say I was not going out drinking.“I naturally became distant from those friends who expected me to drink.“I’m quite lucky to have some supportive people around me now.”Victoria admitted that it has not always been easy to avoid being a part of the drinking culture.She said: “I am very aware of the pressure but I am quite honest about it when I am asked why I do not drink.“It is my personal choice not to and it’s not like I try to change what others do if they want to drink.”Although students coming to Dundee for the new university year may be mostly looking forward to enjoying lively nightlife, Victoria, who is studying English and history at Dundee University, says she has still been able to enjoy the experience without alcohol – and still goes on nights out.She said: “I’ve managed to make friends with people who don’t expect me to drink.”The confidence to say no is something which may not come naturally to everyone, but Victoria encouraged others to stand up for what they believe in.She said: “I have always been quite confident and outgoing but it becomes easier to not drink as you grow older.“I am happy to go to a bar with friends and still not drink.“I don’t worry about it too much.”Speaking about what other young people should do if they are thinking about giving up alcohol, she added: “Just give it a go and don’t be scared.“Imagining what it would be like is always worse than reality.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b8e4d427df01-507x564.jpg ","title":"dundee united must win dirty games laments csaba laszlo","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIn the wake of Saturday’s 1-1 draw at Alloa, Dundee United boss Csaba Laszlo still cuts a frustrated figure.The Terrors, and Csaba, had been on a high after comfortable wins over Queen of the South and Partick Thistle saw them, seemingly, turn a corner.United controlled and managed those matches well but all their good work came undone as they laboured to a point at the Indodrill Stadium at the weekend.Csaba had spoken at the start of the season about his side’s need to start grinding out results if they want to win the Championship.And his disappointment and anger was evident as they couldn’t dictate what he called a ‘dirty game’ in Clackmannanshire.“It was a dirty game but one which really, if you want to make the top league, you have to manage all the time and finish,” he said.“This is not about dominating the game, it’s about winning the game.“It is clear for us that this was an artificial pitch and even it was seven, eight yards shorter than usually.“So I wait for my team and it’s clear, in this case, you have to circulate the ball quicker, you have to move the ball out quicker to have the possibility to move up the pitch.”United had opened the scoring in the second half through a Paul Watson header on 71 minutes, his third goal in two games, and it could have been more.Yannick Loemba had what would have been his first strike for the Tangerines ruled out for offside and Csaba felt 18-year-old Declan Glass could have played in fellow-sub Callum Booth to put the game beyond doubt.As it transpired, the kid gave away possession and Alloa broke to win the free-kick which Iain Flannigan curled home on 82 minutes to earn the Wasps a point.It was no less than the home side deserved but Csaba couldn’t help scrutinise his team’s game management.“We were in front, you have just to keep the ball and keep the result,” he added.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"it could be all change in the dugouts as dundee

Saturday.The pair drew 1-1 at the Indrodrill Stradium in the Championship at the weekend with Csaba Laszlo and Jim Goodwin occupying the technical areas.As is the Tangerines policy for the Irn-Bru this term, it will be reserve team boss Craig Easton who takes charge for the coming second-round tie.And there could also be a change in the Wasps’ dugout after their manager Goodwin was tipped to succeed Alan Stubbs at former club St Mirren.Stubbs was sacked by the Buddies yesterday after just nine games and a run of just one win in four Premiership outings, against bottom club Dundee, so far.If Goodwin does return to the team he has such strong links with, it could see former United favourite Paddy Connolly, his assistant at Alloa, put in charge at Tannadice.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"i was looking to see if i could go elsewhere ex celtic kid paul mcmullan back from the brink at dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWinger Paul McMullan has revealed there was a real chance of him leaving Dundee United before the transfer window closed a week ago.And the former Scotland U/21 international can’t rule out being on the move when the next window opens in January.However, between now and then, the former Celtic kid, who was brought to Tannadice by Ray McKinnon before the start of last season, insists his only focus will be on winning back a regular first-team place.That fight will continue in today’s Irn-Bru Cup second-round clash with Alloa, a game McMullan concedes he might not have been involved in.“The speculation last week, it was true. I was having a look to see if I could go elsewhere because the playing time here has been limited,” he said.“In the end there wasn’t anything that I felt attracted me more than Dundee United did, so that’s why I’m still here.“The club had made it pretty clear to me that, if I wanted to move on, they weren’t going to stand in my way, they’d let me go.“Between now and January I’ve got to get my head down and try to get time on the park.“And when it comes to January I will re-evaluate because I will only have six months on my contract left. I will have to look at it.“Right now, though, I’m just doing my best to try to get back into the team and see how that works. I’m not looking at anything else, I’m just focused on getting in the team and contributing.”With that in mind he is not looking at tomorrow and the Irn-Bru Cup, a competition United have made clear is not a priority this term, with any sense of disdain.He sees it as another chance to show manager Csaba Laszlo, who’s likely to be watching from the stand as reserve manager Craig Easton takes charge of the team, he should be in the starting line-up every week.For fans turning up, history suggests McMullan’s presence could mean they will be in for another late show.When the teams met at the same stage this time last year, he and Willo Flood struck deep in injury time to earn United victory.And in the first round this season, it was McMullan’s last-gasp strike that secured a remarkable comeback win over St Johnstone Colts, who’d been two up late on. This time he’d settle for the winner to come a little earlier than that.“I’ve done that a couple of times with late goals in this cup,” he added.“Hopefully, we don’t leave it until that late again and the boys can do well and get into the next round.“It would be nice to have a more straightforward victory but it is going to be a hard game and we saw at the weekend how tough it is playing against Alloa.“We just have to take it as it comes and see how we get on.”With Alloa expected to be along the same lines as when they lined up against United in the Championship last Saturday, McMullan knows making the third round could be a big ask.“I wouldn’t think they will make too many changes but it’s an opportunity for us to show what we do and we will try to take it.“It will be a good learning process for the younger ones in our team and a good test against seasoned pros who know what the game is all about.“For me, it’s an opportunity to show what I can do and that’s what I have to keep on doing.“I feel I’ve done OK, it’s just the chances haven’t been there for one reason or another and there’s not a lot I can do about that.“All I can do is stay patient and, if an opportunity comes, do all you can to make sure I take it as best I can.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b8e4d5611cad-e1536054160536-814x564.jpg ","title":"no excuses for display at alloa says dundee united midfielder adam barton","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United midfielder Adam Barton insists they can have no excuses for their poor performance at Alloa despite the tough conditions.The Terrors drew 1-1 with Jim Goodwin’s side on Saturday in a game they were expected to win.The synthetic surface at the Indodrill Stadium was narrowed for United’s visit and the hosts made life difficult for Csaba Laszlo’s men throughout.Despite opening the scoring through a Paul Watson header on 71 minutes, as well as enjoying some bright spells in the second half, the Wasps were always in control.A sublime Iain Flannigan free-kick earned Alloa a well-deserved point and it could’ve been more.Barton said: “If we want to win the league, these are the places you’ve got to go and do the job.“What frustrates me is people on the outside, particularly the fans, who were there in good numbers on Saturday. They don’t understand how difficult it is to go to places like Alloa and do what you usually do.“Looking at the pitch, compared to Tannadice it’s completely different altogether, so you have to adjust your game. Alloa are playing there nearly every week so they’re used to it.“You’ve got that against you but it’s not just us, it’s going to be every team that goes there.“It was a difficult task on Saturday but again that’s an excuse and we shouldn’t have excuses.“We should be going there and doing the job.”Barton and central-midfield partner Christoph Rabitsch endured a difficult afternoon as Alloa’s Allan Trouten and Steven Hetherington engaged them in a physical battle.And the 27-year-old Englishman admits they lost control of the match.“We didn’t control the game at all, it’s as simple as that, we tried and couldn’t. It’s just the way the game was,” he added.“I’m sure at home it will be a completely different game but we weren’t used to the conditions and the width of the pitch, so it was tough.“I thought we deserved a point. I don’t think we deserved to win the game and fair play to them because they gave everything they’ve got.“We went to Alloa knowing it was not going to be easy. We didn’t underestimate them but they just played their game very well.“Even in midfield I drop in to get the ball and we mostly look like a back three.“We couldn’t do that against Alloa because it would give them a chance to press us and we were unable to do that.“That was one way in which we were affected in the way we like to play but I’m sure a lot of teams will go there and struggle to play their game.”Barton was honest in his assessment of the performance and says United’s players are not used to a more physical game but insists he knows they’ll need to get used to it.“It turned into a bit of a scrap. We don’t set up to play that kind of football and we don’t have the players who do that.“A lot of people would say you need to be able to adapt to most games but even the best players in the world don’t do the scrappy side of things. It’s just the way it is.“It’s in your nature, you can’t work on the physical side on the training pitch, you can work on being organised and having a better structure but you can’t go into training and work on aggression.“It just doesn’t happen and if you’re an aggressive person, great – if you’re not then you’re not.“You can’t wake up one day and say ‘I’m going to be aggressive’.“We’re not bothered about the play-offs, we want to win the league and we need to go to Alloa and win.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b92481636507.jpg ","title":"one of scotlands only heavy metal vocal tutors to give free sessions in dundee this weekend","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFrom demonic highs to guttural lows, the exact science behind the perfect heavy metal “scream” is something few people have studied.However, this niche interest is the speciality of Sam Field, who is believed to be Dundee’s only metal vocal tutor and one of a few in the whole of Scotland.The 25-year-old has been playing in bands for almost a decade and recently joined the Dundee Music Academy to teach budding vocalists how to scream on stage without hurting themselves.Sam has been giving lessons for about six months and mentors a number of students in the city.His sessions will be among a number of free tasters on offer as the music academy opens its doors to the public this weekend.Sam, of city band Black Blood, said he was inspired to start the lessons as a result of his own tough, and often painful, experiences fine-tuning his voice early in his career.He said: “People are quite surprised when I say I’m a metal vocal coach because they assume people are just shouting.

Detailed measures will be presented next week.Leaders of the minority independent administration said every attempt would be made to minimise the impact on services but \u0026ldquosome impact on service is inevitable.Budget leader Alister Mackinnon said: \u0026ldquoOur  reserves of \u0026pound8 million are well below the minimum recommended by Audit Scotland and it\u0027 vital that they\u0026rsquore not depleted further. The committee agreed stricter controls on recruitment and overtime, a review of all agency appointments and tighter controls on staff travel.The \u0026pound5.1 million figure equates to one per cent of the total budget and compares with a \u0026pound2.7 million estimate at this stage last year. The potential overspend is blamed on high cost placements for \u0026lsquolooked-after children\u0026rsquo, lower income from new parking charges and fewer savings from toilet closures because those two policies have not yet taken full effect.Council chiefs insisted no staff jobs were at risk.Finance director Derek Yule, however, warned there were \u0026ldquono more rabbits to be pulled from hats to tackle the problems.Black Isle Liberal Democrat Gordon Adam blamed Scottish Government grant cuts while SNP city councillor Richard Laird said the crisis was \u0026ldquoentirely of this council\u0027 making.Council leader Margaret Davidson claimed local government services were \u0026ldquonot a priority for the Scottish Government.The budget leader angered the SNP benches, accusing group leader Maxine Smith of not fully participating in budget discussions. He said he invited her to meetings but had been turned down \u0026ldquobecause she views her private commitments more important than reorganising her diary.She was not in the chamber to respond. In a later statement she said: \u0026ldquoOn Friday, I received a request to attend a meeting on Monday to discuss the budget. I had commitments but they were pre-arranged meetings with constituents. I\u0026rsquove sent him a meeting request for tomorrow. I\u0026rsquom available any time, so hopefully he\u0026rsquoll re-arrange his diary.

It will receive over \u0026pound487 million Scottish Government funding in 2018-19.n Support was voiced for a city councillor who has quit as the SNP\u0027 deputy leader on Highland Council.Richard Laird  cited health reasons for his decision. He will remain a Central Ward councillor. He said: \u0026ldquoMy health isn\u0026rsquot good enough. That\u0027 the reason I\u0026rsquom stepping down.

But Cllr Gowans added: \u0026ldquoInverness schools are one of the biggest budget pressures we\u0026rsquore going to face. The last estimated cost to resolve the issue would be something like \u0026pound200 million.\u0026ldquoThat would affect every single service within this council \u0026ndash not just Inverness. But they\u0026rsquove been restricted to Inverness members.\u0026ldquoI cannot fathom why such important issues as Inverness schools, and the implications that has for the resources of Highland Council, are not being brought forward in an open, transparent way in the chamber so they can be discussed.\u0026ldquoThat way, we could reassure communities that this matter is being addressed.Ross and Cromarty area committee chairwoman Fiona Robertson, an independent councillor, did not join the chorus but, speaking after the committee meeting, said: \u0026ldquoWhen it comes to the allocation of the grant, then all councillors need to be involved at a much earlier stage.Sunday 9 Sep 2018 9:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117364.jpg","title":"New service gives job hunters a Fair Start","story":"\u0026nbspScottish Government ViewpointFAIR Start Scotland is the country\u0027s new devolved employment support service.It is focused on supporting unemployed people who have challenges in accessing the labour market for whom work is a realistic prospect.Launched in April, earlier this year, it is an example of one of the first uses of newly devolved powers under the 2016 Scotland Act.The service will run until 2023 and aims to provide tailored, flexible and person-centred support to at least 38,000 people across Scotland who want help to find work, and stay in work.Fair Start Scotland is distinctive in that participation is purely voluntary.This means that people have everything to gain and nothing to lose \u0026ndash choosing to participate will not affect existing benefits or be driven by fear of benefit sanctions.The service is delivered locally, meaning that no participants are left without the support they need.Delivery is over nine geographic areas including the Highlands and reflects local area economies, meeting the needs of employers, disabled people and those at risk of long-term unemployment.Jamie Hepburn, Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, said: \"What\u0027s crucial about Fair Start Scotland is that it treats people with fairness, dignity and respect and that it is focused on the needs of the individual.\"We are dedicated to delivering a high quality employment support service that will lead to real and sustained job outcomes and help people to achieve their full potential.\"As well as meeting the needs of unemployed people, Fair Start Scotland also seeks to help businesses find the skilled and committed employees they need to thrive.\"One of the many now benefitting is Highlander Alan Cairns .He has not worked for over a year and his biggest barriers to work have been low confidence and computer skills but now he has secured 16 hours of work per week.Alan started on the Fair Start Scotland service in the middle of May and has been attending the service for the past 12 weeks.

And McInnes hailed Shinnie for retaining his spot in McLeish’s squad.He said: “Hopefully Graeme can continue to establish himself with Scotland not only through training with them but out on the pitch with game time.“With the squad Graeme was involved in at the end of last season there were a lot of the Celtic players and established players left out.“It was an opportunity for Graeme to go and show Alex his capability through his training and through games.“He has obviously done that and has also started the season well for us, especially in the two games against Burnley in the Europa League.“He was very influential in those games against Burnley.“Graeme has got the recognition for that by remaining in the squad and I am delighted for him.”Shinnie is the only Aberdeen player in McLeish’s Scotland squad that will face World Cup semi-finalists Belgium tonight.That friendly is a warm-up for the UEFA Nations League opener against Albania on Monday.Aberdeen centre-back Scott McKenna would have been named in the squad if fit.However, the 21-year-old missed out with a hamstring tear that has ruled him out of Aberdeen’s last four games.McInnes anticipates McKenna, who captained Scotland in the 2-0 loss to Mexico, to return immediately after the international break.The subject of a rejected £7 million transfer deadline day bid from Aston Villa, centre-back McKenna is set to return for the trip to St Johnstone on Saturday September 15.McInnes hopes club captain Shinnie can face a Belgium side packed with world class talents such as Eden Hazard , Romelu Lukaku , Marouane Fellaini  and Vincent Kompany .He reckons facing opponents of that calibre can only help Shinnie’s own game improve.McInnes said: “Any time you go away to be involved with your country is a brilliant experience.“Graeme will be involved with some of the countries’ top players.“Then he will also hopefully get the games on top of that.“Ideally he can get game time against Belgium and Albania.“Belgium have some top class players involved and all of that is great for any player’s development.”McInnes and Aberdeen aim to tie up skipper Shinnie on an extended contract.The midfielder’s current deal expires at the end of this season and Shinnie would be free to speak with any interested club from the start of the winter transfer window on January 1.McInnes recently confirmed he would sit down with Shinnie and his agent to try to thrash out a new extended contract.The Aberdeen gaffer also confirmed he has been in regular contact with McLeish regarding Scotland internationalists.He said: “I spoke to Alex after the two Scotland games in the summer and a few times since.“Graeme has made a good impression and it is great to see him in the squad.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dons looking to benefit from us soccer boom","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAberdeen aim to tap further into the lucrative United States market to secure financial backing in a bid to help take the club to another level.Pittodrie commercial director Rob Wicks hopes the Dons can secure new opportunities across the Atlantic, where soccer is booming.American-based businessman Tom Crotty invested £775,000  into Aberdeen last November after buying up shares.US-based software entrepreneur and investor, Dave Cormack, made a substantial seven-figure investment in the Dons last June through the acquisition of shares.Life-long Aberdeen fan Cormack, who had previously held the role of Pittodrie chief executive from 2000 to 2001, was also appointed to the Dons board.Wicks said: “Football is doing some amazing things in the United States.“We have Dave Cormack, a major shareholder at the club and also a board director who is based over there.“Dave is very well placed within the United States market to look at new opportunities for us.”Aberdonian Cormack introduced venture capitalist Crotty to the Dons.Crotty is a board member and major donor to US-founded charity Grassroot Soccer which was set up by Tommy Clark, the son of legendary Dons keeper Bobby.Aberdeen, AFC Community Trust and the now global-based Grassroot recently entered into a formal partnership that focuses on adolescent health and well-being.Through the partnership a football-inspired education programme for young people around mental health will be piloted at Aberdeen’s new £47m super academy at Lochside.On confirmation of his investment last year Crotty admitted his first experience of Aberdeen was golf and playing the north-east’s courses. Cormack utilised that link and made a compelling case about Aberdeen’s future plans.Wicks said: “There is such a strong relationship with the US and Scotland as we have the likes of Donald Trump and his golf.“If you look at the visitor statistic of people coming into Scotland a very high proportion are Americans.“They love golf, the whisky trail and there are some really interesting opportunities for us to broaden that relationship and look at new ideas and partnerships.”Football, or “soccer”, is thriving in the United States and is closing in on the big three of American football, basketball and baseball.A Gallup poll recently found 7% of Americans named soccer as their favourite sport to watch.That represented a 3% gain from four years previously.Soccer was the only sport to post such a large increase.Gridiron was at 37%, down from 39%, basketball 11%, down from 12%, and baseball 9%, down from 13%. Ice hockey was at 4%, up from 3%. Only 1% of those polled over 55 named soccer as their favourite sport while the figure was 11% between those aged 18-34.It is expected soccer will surpass baseball in popularity.The rise of soccer in the United States also came despite the national team’s failure to qualify for the World Cup in Russia – the first time they had not been at the finals since 1986.The MLS recently signed an historic eight-year TV deal with ESPN, Fox Sports and Univision worth 720m with games now broadcast in 140 countries.“You look at some of the clubs out there in the MLS and what they are achieving and the fan experience that they are able to deliver,” said Wicks.“There is a lot we can learn and we have to be cognisant of that. There are wider opportunities.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"charming home in great location259000","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWhen the Andersons were house-hunting in Aberdeen 13 years ago, there were only two criteria on their wish list – charm and location.The lucky pair weren’t waiting long as 15 Affleck Street suited Gillian and Trevor right down to the ground."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/09/2657358-846x564.jpg ","title":"four properties that could be your new home in aberdeen from just 100000","story":"\t\t\t\t\tEvery week we feature a selection of our favourite properties on the market in Aberdeen.Today we’ve picked these three properties, all available from just £100,000. 100vw, 620px\" /This one-bedroom mid terraced bungalow is situated in a well-established residential area with easy access to all local amenities.The property has a spacious lounge with a feature fireplace, fully fitted kitchen, double bedroom and a bathroom fitted with a three-piece suite incorporating a shower over the bath.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

A glass pane at Belleisle pro Richard Gordon’s shop was smashed in the 4am raid. Titleist and Wilson clubs were taken, in addition to Richard’s Ping bag and clubs. Police told the pro there’s been around 25 similar thefts in Scotland since April. And they are working with the Scottish Professional Golfers’ Association to track down raiders. “It’s absolutely gut-wrenching,” said Richard, 45. “The bag and clubs were presented to me in April in Phoenix, Arizona,” he said. The pro was given the accolade of being named Ping Custom Fitter of the Year for Scotland. His precious set of clubs includes a titanium driver, along with a three-wood, hybrid clubs, a full set of irons and a putter. All are high-end, high-value clubs - as are the other makes taken in the raid. Richard and his staff moved into the new South Ayrshire Council shop facility around two-and-a-half years ago. “It’s fully alarmed, and has CCTV cameras,” he said. “Security is excellent, but these raiders are prepared to go to any lengths.” It’s been reported, in other raids, that thieves have smashed through metal shutters, and even brick walls. The pro shop at Dundonald Links, between Troon and Irvine, was also targeted in a recent raid. Richard praised the way the police are conducting their inquiries. “They’ve been highly forensic in their investigation - even trying to get DNA,” he said. “The CCTV shows hooded figures, but it’s something the police are still looking at,” he added. Richard has been associated with Belleisle for 25 years, and has been head pro for 11 years. Richard’s wife Vikki works with him in the business, and Lee Hughes is his assistant pro. Richard said: “I love Belleisle, and it’s great that South Ayrshire has invested so much in municipal golf facilities.” “I think South Ayrshire runs the best municipal golf course in Britain if you exclude St Andrews.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrGet into GolfAyr NewsSouth Ayrshire CouncilSt AndrewsTroonDundonald"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13191066.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_IBP_AYP_290818CHAMPION_11JPG.jpg","title":"hundreds flock welcome back inspirational","story":"NewsHundreds flock to welcome back inspirational world record breakerPupils, parents and teachers surrounded the car park of Kyle Academy to show their appreciation of Gavin Drysdale, who smashed a world record at the European World Para Athletics in Berlin.Share\u0026nbspByLochlin Highet14:05, 4 SEP 2018NewsKyle Academy pupil Gavin Drysdale \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHundreds of people flocked to a school to welcome back an inspirational hero. Pupils, parents and teachers surrounded the car park of Kyle Academy to show their appreciation of Gavin Drysdale, who smashed a world record at the European World Para Athletics in Berlin. S6 pupil Gavin, of Ayr, brought home the gold in the race running 100m category with an incredible time of 17.37 seconds. And he was given a hero’s welcome as he was led in by a bagpipe performance. He made his way round the hundreds of emotional crowd, and there was barely a dry eye to be seen. It was clear to see how much Gavin had brought the community together, and how immensely proud they were of the superstar. A teacher was even seen asking “is my mascara running?”, which summed up the emotional parade for Gavin. And it was so clear to see how delighted Gavin was with the turnout, with pupils even running over to grab selfies with him. A buzzing Gavin said: “The reception I got coming back to school was overwhelming. “I wasn’t expecting anything like that reaction I got, it was great. “Kyle Academy are always very supportive of any competition I am doing.” Gavin, 17, has cerebral palsy and has been race running for 10 years. He trains at Dam Park, and when he started way back in 2008 he was the only race runner from Scotland. Now there are over 100 competitors from the country.  He is part of the race running club which is supported by Blue Rock Insurance Brokers. The race club is a branch of Ayr Seaforth and is coached by David Phee. Gavin also trains at Red Star in Glasgow with Janice Eaglesham. And the race running has came so far since he started, and these games have helped it get well on its way to being a part of the Paralympic games. Gavin competed in a special racing trike, which has impressive Continental tyres on it. Gavin is still on cloud nine after bagging the top prize in Berlin. He said: “When I won I was totally stunned. “I felt like I had already won a gold medal just by being there, so the fact I actually won was amazing!”  All the way through Gavin’s journey, his mum Margaret and dad Peter have been there supporting him. His family and friends have helped him along the way, and his sister Natalie even had banners up at the family home to celebrate his success for when he got back. Dad Peter said: “We are just so proud of Gavin. “We were so relieved when he won the gold - as we knew how much hard work he put into his progress. “The games went great, and it’s incredible to see how well the Scottish athletes done at the games.  “We have to extend our thanks to Kyle Academy for being so supportive and for this spectacular welcome they have given us.” Gavin isn’t just a star on the track, he has just sailed through S5 picking up an impressive five highers at A and B grades. He was also a part of the Commonwealth games baton relay in 2014. Headteacher for Kyle Academy, Mary Byrne said: “The whole school is so proud of Gavin. “We are delighted that we are able to show our support for him, and everyone at the school is delighted for him.” "},{"url":null,"title":"prestwick airport could used free","story":"NewsPrestwick Airport could be used as free parking base for ScotRail passengers on Ayr to Glasgow Central lineGovernment officials have pledged to examine the possibility of using the airport - which they own - for free parking relief to help ease the pain of commuters.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson16:08, 6 SEP 2018NewsPrestwick Airport could be used for free parking \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPrestwick Airport could be used as an unlikely saviour in the ongoing crisis at Ayr Railway Station. Government bosses are examining a plan to utilise the flight hub - which they own - for free parking. A number of services on the Ayr to Glasgow Central line will start and terminate at Prestwick Town from next Monday. But with concerns over a lack of parking in the town, transport chiefs have begun scrambling for other options. Ayr MSP, John Scott, led calls for the move to be considered during First Minister\u0027s Questions today in Holyrood. After raising the issue with Nicola Sturgeon, he told the Ayrshire Post: This is now a crisis situation and we should be looking at all available options. Parking in Prestwick is at a premium as it is, so if the airport can provide free spaces until this situation is resolved, it is something we should look at. Responding to Mr Scott\u0027s idea in parliament, Ms Sturgeon said: It strikes me as a very good suggestion and I can\u0027t think of any immediate objection anyone would have. We know the pressure this is putting on commuters. The First Minister has pledged to explore the option with her officials. Four carriage services will continue to operate between Ayr and Glasgow, but six carriage trains will be halted at Prestwick as part of ScotRail\u0027s plan to combat overcrowding on the line.

Some owners just need to be spoken to and advised of their responsibilities.\nDog control orders allow Scottish Borders Council to impose certain conditions on dog owners. For example, a dog which frequently runs away may be required to be kept on a lead at all times, or an aggressive dog may have to be muzzled when in public spaces.\nThe control orders can also be used to compel dog owners to seek training for themselves and their pet. Failure to adhere to a dog control order could lead to a ban from keeping animals or the dog being put down.\nA Scottish Borders Council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe council is currently reviewing its responsible dog ownership strategy, which will aim to remind owners of their social and legal responsibilities.\n\u0026ldquoAs part of this strategy, the council works in partnership with local and national charities to promote responsible ownership and dog control by educating the public at ious events across the Borders.\n\u0026ldquoThe council responds to all complaints received concerning out of control dogs, but in order to assist us in investigating each complaint fully, we ideally require the dog owner\u0026rsquos details.\n\u0026ldquoMembers of the public can contact 0300 100 1800 or visit www.scotborders.gov.uk if they have a concern about a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour.\nMs Grahame added: \u0026ldquoMy main concern is that members of the public may not be aware that if a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour is causing concern, for example being allowed to be out of control, they can report it to the council through this route.\n\u0026ldquoThe police, of course, deal with the most serious incidents. However I brought in my bill establishing dog control notices as a way of intervening before a dog bites or attacks and becomes dangerous.\n\u0026ldquoOnce a dog control notice is issued, the council will regularly check up to ensure it\u0026rsquos being followed.\n\u0026ldquoI would encourage anyone concerned about a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour whether in public, in its garden or indeed any other private place to get in touch with the council.

said demolition was the only economically viable option left.\nHe said: \u0026ldquoThe building is not physically incapable of repair, therefore the overriding principle that needs to be satisfied is one of economic viability.\n\u0026ldquoThis application is supported by feasibility reports and valuations which estimate the building is beyond the point of economic repair.\n\u0026ldquoVarious

scheme for a development which would retain the front facade of the church and the spire was also evaluated, and this would potentially result in a loss of around \u0026pound1m.\n\u0026ldquoThe applicant provided subsequent figures that would need to be invested in order to make a profit. \u0026nbsp\n\u0026ldquoThese assessments conclude that in order to make a reasonable profit, 29 units would be required on site, with 24 units behind the facade and five on the site behind the church.\n\u0026ldquoIt is accepted that not all options have been explored, but it is reasonable to assume that the applicant has demonstrated that a substantial and likely inappropriate development would be required to make the scheme viable.\n\u0026ldquoI am satisfied that the viability argument has been met.\nSpeaking in favour of allowing the demolition, East Berwickshire councillor Helen Laing said: \u0026ldquoI just think this is really, really sad to lose this fabulous building.

Both present geological challenges but they can be overcome.\u0026#8216Today, I\u0026#8217ve asked for a feasibility study to look at these issues and move things forward.\u0026#8217In February, the Courier compared a potential bridge from Kintyre to Northern Ireland, to the Øresund bridge, which connects Copenhagen in Denmark with Malmo in Sweden.Professor Dunlop drew on this comparison during his speech, referencing the fact that the Øresund bridge links two separate countries, each with their own distinct identifies but sharing a cultural heritage, similar to Scotland and Northern Ireland.He pointed out the political benefits of linking the two UK countries, especially post-Brexit.He believes a bridge may re-balance the concentration of power held by Westminster and be an investment in what he considers to be the true north.Argyll and Bute MSP, Michael Russell, said of the plans: \u0026#8216A bridge, together with better road links to the central belt, would open up Argyll in a dramatic new way.\u0026#8216I would be keen to see public bodies investigate the feasibility of such a link.\u0026#8217The Øresund bridge, linking Denmark and Sweden, could be similar to a structure linking Kintyre with Northern Ireland.

Airships in the Great War and the Story of Major J G Struthers\u0026#8217 exhibition in Campbeltown Library features a trove of items belonging to the late Major Jim Struthers, formerly of Ardmaddy Estate, near Oban.The items, including a dummy shell, gas goggles, badges and medals, a uniform and original airship banners and propellers, were collated, over the course of a year, by Eleanor McKay, bibliographic and local studies librarian at Live Argyll, after a conversation with Major Struthers\u0026#8217 son Charles.\u0026#8216He said he had \u0026#8216one or two things\u0026#8217 belonging

collections from the First World War that we have seen.\u0026#8217There are parts of shot-down airships, a parachute, fragments of a radiator from a zeppelin and much more.Accompanying the artefacts, are photographs, many taken by Major Struthers himself, documenting his personal life and military career, as well as the history of airships.Major Struthers, who was mentioned in dispatches, was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, with two bars later added, for his missions with the Royal Naval Air Service, which amalgamated with the British Army\u0026#8217s Royal Flying Core to become the Royal Air Force in 1918.Major Struthers was recognised for flying more hours than any other airship pilot during the war.Aged 52 by the time the Second World War broke out, Major Struthers was too old to serve but he was in the Royal Observer Corps, his patch stretching from Sutherland to Machrihanish.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s local to Oban but it\u0026#8217s an Argyll story,\u0026#8217 said

One that people don\u0026#8217t really think about.\u0026#8216They think about later aircraft, especially in World War Two, but I don\u0026#8217t think they know the role they had in World War One.\u0026#8217Councillor Donald Kelly, who attended the opening, said he thought it was essential to engage with local school children: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s important that youngsters today know

Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

And it takes the masterplan a stage further with more detailed ideas for each of the zones proposed in its vision, including calling for the Scottish Government to be invited to base its HQ for its proposed state company on the site, as well as suggesting offshore windfarm company Inch Cape \u0026ndash which wants to place a substation on the land to bring energy ashore from proposed turbines \u0026ndash should also be encouraged to put its Scottish base there.  The community council document comes in the wake of a brochure produced by neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council promoting its vision of a Port of Prestonpans cruise terminal at the former power station site.  That proposal sparked anger among supporters of the masterplan vision, who accused the Prestonpans group of ignoring the views of the local communities.  It led to the launch of \u0026lsquoGreenhills: delivering the Masterplan\u0026rsquo, a campaign by local groups and businesses backing the consultation document.  Now Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council has drawn up a draft brochure which sets out why it supports the plans and proposes a range of detailed ways it could be taken forward.  That includes putting head offices for Inch Cape and the Scottish Government energy interests in one part of the site, identified as its \u0026lsquoEnergy Quarter\u0026rsquo.  It also floats the idea of flooding the power station footprint to create a marina \u0026ndash as suggested by a local fisherman \u0026ndash with associated retail and leisure facilities, attracting businesses such as a film studio or 3D printing innovation to the site, or even creating a brewery.

ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.

Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.  Ward councillor Lachlan Bruce welcomed the announcement.

If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.

All four have confirmed they will be attending the hearing.  In a statement following the visit, it was announced: \u0026ldquoThe reporter considers it would be helpful to have some wider community participation at the hearing and suggests that these views might be represented by one or both of the local community councils.

A planning statement submitted as part of the application for the site, reads: \u0026ldquoThe proposal is to restore and convert a redundant and roofed-over water reservoir into a residential dwelling and improve the quality of this site.  The report adds that the house would be \u0026ldquodesigned so that the proposal provides an acceptable solution, preserving and enhancing the character and appearance of the building, which is category B listed.  The application is for a two-storey house, with disabled access from the first floor and a car park on land adjacent to the ground floor.  It is proposed that the upper floor will contain an entrance hall, family  shower room, three bedrooms and an open-plan kitchen/dining room and sitting room, as well as stairs to the ground floor. On the ground floor, there will be a guest bedroom, family shower room, access to the cellar and garage and a drawing room.  The plans have been submitted by agent Tom Pyemont of Hawick-based firm Pyemont Design greenarchitecture on behalf of applicants James Barbour and Alex Dale.  However, when they were discussed by members of North Berwick Community Council earlier this month, members felt that they did not have enough information to make any detailed comment on the planning application.

The agricultural land has been earmarked by East Lothian Council for business use but Barratt claimed the council\u0026rsquos vision was financially unviable.  They said the only way to make the \u0026ldquonumbers add up was to create a mixed use site with housing and industry.  But their claims were rejected by councillors after Provost John McMillan , cabinet spokesman on economic development, insisted: \u0026ldquoIf we build it, they will come.  The quote, paraphrasing one made famous in the US baseball movie Field of Dreams starring Kevin Costner, came as he backed council officials who recommended the plans from Barratt and site owners The Co-operative be thrown out.  Jason Watt, from Barratt, told a meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington last Tuesday that site drainage and geology issues meant it would cost \u0026pound1.5m to get ready for development.  Once general costs were taken into account, the total development bill would be \u0026pound2.25m \u0026ndash yet the value of the land was estimated at only \u0026pound1.1m.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe numbers clearly do not add up and never will unless there is cross subsidising with a mixed use development.  Ward councillor Kenny McLeod  backed the Barratt proposal, highlighting the lack of council housing available for rent in Tranent: the proposed Barratt development included 25 per cent affordable housing.  Mr McLeod said: \u0026ldquoWe need to keep the local connection and they are not building housing for rent in this area.  \u0026ldquoIt must be 50 years since a house was put in the area for rent.  However, fellow Tranent, Wallyford and Macmerry councillor Colin McGinn  said he was concerned about the traffic that would be created by more than 100 homes on the site, which is on the opposite side of the town\u0026rsquos Haddington Road from Steading View.  He added: \u0026ldquoWe have a responsibility within Tranent to increase employment and opportunities for our young people.  Councillor Brian Small , opposition leader, told the committee: \u0026ldquoThere is no point in having a [Local Development] Plan if at the first turn we think we can turn it over. We need to give this business land the opportunity to develop.  The committee was told that while the district valuer had agreed with developers that the land was not financially viable as a single business plot, they had said it could be made financially sound by developing it in phases.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoWe have enough land set aside for housing.  \u0026ldquoPeople want \u0026ndashand need \u0026ndash local employment and if we build it they will come. This is a signal to developers we want to grow the number of jobs around the county.  The committee voted by nine votes to two to support the officials\u0026rsquo recommendation to refuse the plans."},{"url":null,"title":"transport-co2-emissions-on-the-rise-in-east-lothian","story":"  The latest data from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy has revealed that CO2 emissions from freight and passenger transport rose by 4.2 per cent in the county between 2011 and 2016.  That means traffic was responsible for 18.5 per cent of the total amount of carbon dioxide released in East Lothian in 2016.  But in total, CO2 emissions in the county fell over the same period.  Jason Rose, from East Lothian Greens, blamed more housing developments in East Lothian for the rise in CO2 from emissions relating to transport.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoTo live [in the new developments], you need a car. More houses means more cars.  Mr Rose also highlighted the fact that nearly half of East Lothian residents commute to Edinburgh every day for work.  \u0026ldquoThe main issue is half the people who live in East Lothian work in Edinburgh, so they have to commute, he said.  \u0026ldquoBuses take a long time, you want cheap and reliable.  \u0026ldquoWith trains, there definitely needs to be more of an effort to improve length and frequency.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council should be trying to increase employment in East Lothian, so people don\u0026rsquot need to commute.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove heard some people say, \u0026lsquooh what if you open a bridge here or build another road?\u0026rsquo but creating more roads just increases traffic and spreads the problem around.  Overall, emissions from transport, both private and for business purposes, increased by 3.5 per cent in the UK over the period between 2011 and 2016.  However, total CO2 emissions fell by 4.6 per cent over the five years in East Lothian.  The county was responsible for releasing 1.1 million tonnes of CO2 in 2016 \u0026ndash down from 1.15 million tonnes five years earlier.  But Mr Rose highlighted that it was not just CO2 emissions that needed to be monitored.  \u0026ldquoWe need to watch for NO2  and PM10  \u0026ndash those are the pollutants that can cause health risks, he added.  In East Lothian, industrial and commercial activities are by far the main producer of CO2 emissions, releasing 63.9 per cent of the total. In 2016, households produced 16 per cent of the CO2 in the county, lower than five years earlier.  The Department also takes into account the amount of CO2 produced by farms and through other rural activities and the CO2 removed from the air by trees.  According to its estimates, these agricultural activities produced more greenhouse gases than forests removed, and so were responsible for 1.6 per cent of the carbon emissions in East Lothian in 2016.  Overall, the UK reduced its carbon emissions by 15.4 per cent over the five years."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  We\u0027ll also reveal the Top 25 in this year\u0027s Pet Idol competition.

Jane said: \u0026ldquoWhat I have been really impressed with is the way the club and coaches have adapted to him.  \u0026ldquoThere is mainstream gymnastics but they have adapted lessons for his needs.  \u0026ldquoIt has made him not feel different and he still feels part of the club \u0026ndash he really enjoys it.  \u0026ldquoCameron\u0026rsquos disability comes under Global Development Delay.  \u0026ldquoHe has a real difficulty with comprehension and understanding what is being asked of him, following instructions.  \u0026ldquoHe is also very sensitive to noise and sudden loud noises.  \u0026ldquoThat is what they have managed to do really well, break it down into small parts for him.  \u0026ldquoThrough time, it becomes a routine and he understands what is being asked of him.  Jane, who lives near Gifford, has been a keen swimmer for a number of years and represented Scotland in the 1994 Commonwealth Games, in Canada.  However, after a break from swimming she returned to the pool at the beginning of the year before swapping the pool for the sea earlier this summer.  She said: \u0026ldquoI kept swimming as a hobby and to keep fit.  \u0026ldquoI have always swam but it has always been indoor swimming.  \u0026ldquoI started looking about and had always had an interest in open-water swimming but never did it.  \u0026ldquoI came across the Firth of Forth swim and that quite appeals to me and thought I would give it a go.  The mum-of-two signed up in March for the swim, which sees swimmers head off from Hawes Pier and swim alongside the Forth Bridge towards North Queensferry.  Swimmers set off at 2.10pm and have an hour to complete the 1.4-mile swim.  In preparation for the fundraiser on September 22, Jane has taken to the waters off Dumfries and Galloway\u0026rsquos coast and has also linked up with the Bass Rock Swimmers, who are based in North Berwick.  Despite being an accomplished swimmer, Jane said there were still challenges.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe currents are certainly a big factor.  \u0026ldquoIt is just your awareness and you can go off track very easily and just that anticipation of what is below you and what you are swimming over.  \u0026ldquoI have enjoyed the challenge and it has certainly put me out of my comfort zone.  \u0026ldquoI have really enjoyed it and met some really lovely people.  \u0026ldquoMy thanks go to my husband, Garry, and family for support and encourage to take on the challenge and to Duo Gymnastics Club for the support and help they have given Cameron.  Pamela Fletcher, from the gymnastics club, said: \u0026ldquoThanks to Jane undertaking the swim, the club can purchase a new and much needed vaulting table for the gymnastics at Aubigny Sport Centre. Due to local support we have now met our target however donations continue meaning we can hopefully purchase some more equipment.

I\u0026rsquom now in my late 50s, and 60 is looming ahead of me like a cat waiting to pounce and have cruel fun. Yet I know people who are in their 30s and 40s who are much older than me, and folk in their 60s and above who are younger. My oldest daughter is in her early 20s and is already lamenting the fact she is no longer \u0026lsquoyoung\u0026rsquo.  The truth is that age is a mentality or, as is often said, \u0026lsquojust a number\u0026rsquo. Of course, deteriorating health and pain can come with age, as I have experienced, but even then, getting this far makes me very thankful despite the wear and tear.  I often say that life is like toothpaste: we use it with abandon at first and then, as we realise it\u0026rsquos running out, each squirt becomes increasingly more precious and satisfying.  \u0026ldquoA whole summer seems nothing these days, it\u0026rsquos over before you get used to it, a friend said to me recently. And indeed it is nothing if we measure it by days passed.  Yet if we measure not the passing of hours, days or years but the accumulation of memories and experiences, then time seems longer, both in quantity and quality. The trick, then, is to make those experiences and memories, and to truly live in them as they happen. This means understanding what is truly meaningful to us, and what gives genuine joy and fulfilment.  I think that is the secret to a long life, regardless of what number you reach. It\u0026rsquos not just about how much toothpaste is in your tube, it\u0026rsquos about how much you savour and use the amount you have. All of us savour key moments, of course. The first day at school for our children, our holiday time, time with friends or spent doing things we enjoy.  Yet inevitably such moments are less common than what we might call the daily routine of life. I suppose that\u0026rsquos what makes them stand out. Thus the daily routine of \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo life shoots us by, almost without us noticing. And that\u0026rsquos most of our life.  And so I am now more determined than ever to make my life \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo for as long as I may have left. This isn\u0026rsquot a commitment to hippy living in a campervan  but a conscious decision to savour every day as if it were my last. And what really helped me in this realisation was a conversation one day while waiting for a train. . .  One spring morning just before this summer, I was standing on the platform at Prestonpans station waiting for a train. I was not used to getting this early train and was surprised how busy it was. I was heading into Edinburgh to do some storytelling and so unusually sharing my journey with commuters.  It was a beautiful warm sunny morning, the herald of the heatwave soon to arrive. As I waited for the train I scrolled on my phone. Then I heard a voice behind me saying: \u0026ldquoOn your death bed, will you really look fondly back on the countless hours, equivalent to years of your life, spent scrolling on a phone? Will you remember just one per cent of that activity, or even want to?  I turned round to see who was speaking to me there was nobody. Then I noticed the hawthorn tree.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos better, the hawthorn said. It was resplendent with blossom, leaning over the edge of the side of the bridge which takes the cars below the station.  Perhaps I had seen it before, but this time I really noticed it because it had spoken to me. I studied its flowers and took in the immense beauty of it. It\u0026rsquos perfectly situated to admire, but the hawthorn seemed sad.  \u0026ldquoCan you imagine the effort it takes to get this magnificent and beautiful? it said. \u0026ldquoYet nobody seems to notice me.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure they do, I replied. \u0026ldquoNo, they don\u0026rsquot watch, insisted the tree. And so I did.  The hawthorn was right. People walked past the tree, stood next to it, but nobody seemed to notice it, and certainly nobody took any time to admire it.  \u0026ldquoBut they are busy, I said in our defence.  \u0026ldquoWe are all busy in different ways, said the tree. \u0026ldquoBut we can choose to be \u0026lsquotoo busy\u0026rsquo for some things while being busy doing others. Often you decide what is important to be busy with so you exclude what you think are the less important things.  \u0026ldquoLike looking and admiring you? I replied sarcastically.  \u0026ldquoPrecisely, said the hawthorn, perhaps not understanding a sarcastic tone.  Suddenly the train arrived. People put away their phones and I bade a hasty farewell to the tree. We all crammed into the carriage and it filled up to the brim. I saw the blazing white of the hawthorn\u0026rsquos blossom through the window. Then we headed for Wallyford.  The train ground to a halt and the doors opened. There was a crush and people calling out politely \u0026ldquoplease move up. I wondered if everyone would get on, and I think they did, but only just. Now the train felt overloaded and it literally ground its way out of the station.  When it arrived at Musselburgh, the doors opened to present a human wall made of commuters from the Pans and Wallyford. There was simply no way anyone was getting on. I watched from the privilege of my seat. Two young men with suitcases, obviously going on holiday had no chance, and didn\u0026rsquot even try.  As the train pulled away, leaving dozens of people stranded on the platform, I felt a sense of guilt at having a seat. At Waverley we were trapped in a bottleneck by ticket collectors, ensuring that none of the lucky ones who had actually managed to get onto the train would escape paying for their good fortune.  When I returned I had to cross the bridge to my car. And there was the hawthorn tree, showing off its blossom like a peacock trying to impress a mate with its feather display.  And I have noticed the hawthorn ever since. The blossom faded as summer arrived and now it bears it berries. Its haws glisten where once there was blossom, reminding me that summer has had its course, and asking the question of how I made it memorable.  I am so thankful for the hawthorn\u0026rsquos advice. It was simple but so important. The trick is to live in the moment to notice that which makes the mundane and normal extraordinary or beautiful or special.  We can pepper our daily life with simple but extraordinary moments of connection, so a day never really remains \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo. We just have to truly live in that moment, to come out of our busyness and worries, and savour it.  Maybe the hawthorn tree will speak to you if ever you find yourself at Prestonpans train station. Or maybe someone else will your child, your grandchild, your partner, friends, your grandparents, your work colleague, or perhaps your inner self.  Maybe it wasn\u0026rsquot actually the tree which spoke to me. Perhaps it was my inner self. But then again, perhaps it was a speaking hawthorn, and you have to be \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo to hear it!"},{"url":null,"title":"leader-of-councils-conservative-opposition-steps-down-after-health-issues","story":"  Councillor Brian Small, who has held the position since being one of seven Conservative councillors elected in May 2017, stood down for a brief period last year following a severe bout of sepsis before returning to the post.

Charles Church, from Mactaggart and Mickel Homes, told the committee concerns had been raised about issues with the building contractors used on the site and they were looking at possible penalties for any future breaches of the agreed construction management plan.  Mr McMillan asked if it would be possible for any financial penalties paid to be put towards local community groups or projects. Mr Church told him that was a consideration, adding that Mactaggart and Mickel Homes \u0026ldquoalready has a fund called building communities where we invest in local communities.  The revised plans were approved unanimously.  Councillor Norman Hampshire, planning convenor, said: \u0026ldquoIt is good to see Letham Mains moving forward and the site coming together.  Following the meeting, Craig Ormond, director of Mactaggart and Mickel Homes, said: \u0026ldquoLethington Gardens already features Design Collection properties, so we wanted to ensure that these neighbouring houses have a similar look and feel in design terms. We are delighted that the council have agreed with us.  Lethington Gardens is part of a wider masterplan by a number of housing developers in the area.  The plans include a new primary school at the heart of the development \u0026ndash to be home to nearly 500 pupils \u0026ndash sport pitches and changing facilities, as well as a new park running east/west alongside the Letham Burn."},{"url":null,"title":"rugby-club-needs-cctv-after-licence-change","story":"  North Berwick RFC  applied to East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board for the licence, which allows it to welcome non-members to events. But it was granted with several conditions, including that the club must tell police about any 18th or 21st birthday parties being held in the Recreation Park clubhouse at least two weeks in advance.  They were also ordered to use plastic glasses in an outdoor marquee at the club and banned from playing music on a planned new patio area.  A Police Scotland request for the club to install CCTV \u0026ldquoof a standard approved by police inside and outside the venue was also granted by the board.  Rudi Fruzynski, the council\u0026rsquos licensing standards officer, told the board that the club had changed into a community hub in recent years and had been moving towards changing its licence for some time.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is not just a rugby club any longer \u0026ndash it has several different aspects to it as a community hub.  \u0026ldquoI do not see a problem in relation to the licence.  Iain Dove, NBRFC president, told the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe are pleased with the news that the licensing board have approved our application for a full licence, along with an identified area to the front of the club that can be used for drinks in good weather.  \u0026ldquoThis will be a fenced area, secure for children, and we hope it will prove to be popular with families. We hope to continue to grow the use of our facilities by the North Berwick community.  At the meeting, Mr Fruzynski criticised the club for not sending anyone to attend the hearing, at Haddington Town House last Thursday.  Highlighting that they were not the only applicants to fail to attend the hearing that day, he said: \u0026ldquoIt is disappointing so many applicants have not turned up to answer questions of the board because they are all advised that someone should be available to attend.  Mr Dove apologised to the licensing board, via the Courier, and added: \u0026ldquoThis is the first time that we have changed our licence and we simply didn\u0026rsquot know that it was possible to attend.  Councillor Jane Henderson, a North Berwick Coastal ward member who sits on the licensing board, pointed out that the club\u0026rsquos failure to represent itself could prove financially costly as they were not able to challenge conditions attached to the licence. The board granted the licence with a condition that CCTV must be in place within three months."},{"url":null,"title":"food-and-drink-taste-testers-wanted-for-queen-margaret-university-panel","story":"  Aimed at people aged 18 and upwards, the short tasting sessions will be held during weekdays in the evenings and at weekends \u0026ndash with participants receiving a \u0026pound10 gift voucher at the end of each.

The Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland  told East Lothian Council the plans to build next to medieval Dirleton Castle, which dates back to the mid 13th century, were too \u0026ldquomodern and suburban.  The association said the new development,\u0026nbspproposed at Castlemains Farm immediately to the east of the castle, would \u0026ldquoirreparably damage the setting of Dirleton, destroying the important edges that define the village and separate it from the surrounding countryside.  And at a meeting of the local authority\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington, councillors voted by seven to four to reject the plans, which had been recommended for approval by their own officers.  Local ward councillor Jane Henderson said that the intervention from APRS had been \u0026ldquocritical as she criticised Historic Environment Scotland, which is responsible for Dirleton Castle, after it\u0026nbspfailed to formally object to the proposals.  The public agency, who were consultees on the application, told the local authority that while they acknowledged the development might have an impact on the castle, which is a scheduled monument, they considered the proposals\u0026nbspnot to have an impact of \u0026ldquonational significance.  Councillor Henderson said: \"I am particularly disappointed in Historic Environment Scotland. How they can hold that name and come through so weakly on the setting of a castle, you have to ask questions about that.  However, the agency said it had already responded to a previous application for housing on the same site which had later been withdrawn.  They said: \u0026ldquoWe were consulted by East Lothian Council on the planning application for Castlemains Farm in January 2018, on the potential impact of this application on the setting of Dirleton Castle and Gardens which is a scheduled monument.  \u0026ldquoThis second planning application addressed the concerns that had been raised when the first planning application was submitted, primarily the impact of the development on the relationship between the castle and the land to the south and east. As a result, we did not object to the application.  \u0026ldquoWe did, however, highlight a risk of impact from landscaping and lighting, and have recommended further mitigation.  Developers Queensberry Properties told the committee they had held extensive consultations with council planners and the local community but they admitted they had come to an impasse with Dirleton Village Association and had to \u0026ldquoagree to disagree.  Their spokesman told the committee that while they wanted the new houses to face outwards on the edge of the village instead of presenting visitors with a view of \u0026ldquogarden sheds and trampolines, the village association wanted the houses to \u0026ldquoturn their back on the outside world.  Architect John Finlay, who helped produce the Dirleton Expects document outlining the village association\u0026rsquos vision for its future, said: \u0026ldquoThe design is as alien as if it had landed from outer space. It even has a suburban road, with all the clutter that entails, in the forefront of the castle.  Martin White from Gullane Area Community Council said the group was opposed to the development because \u0026ldquoyou do not hide castles.  He said: \u0026ldquoDirleton Castle is one of East Lothian\u0026rsquos top five visitor attractions. It may not be of national impact but it certainly matters in East Lothian.  The council received 71 written objections and only one representation supporting the development, which cited a need for affordable housing in the village.  Dirleton Castle is a medieval fortress which dates back to the mid-13th century and has been at the centre of numerous sieges. At one point it was owned by the Ruthvens, who were involved in several plots against Mary Queen of Scots and King James VI.  Councillor Stuart Currie, planning committee member, raised concerns that the development appeared to bear little resemblance to the original development brief for the site that the local authority had consulted on with the community.  However, planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire said the fact those opposing the development did not have the support of Historic Environment Scotland and the council\u0026rsquos own heritage officer led him to back the planning officials\u0026rsquo recommendation to approve it.  The committee voted to reject the recommendation to approve the plans by seven votes to four."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/7640045.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"scotland-women-qualify-for-world-cup-for-first-time-in-20-years","story":"  IT was, set against the magnificent backdrop of the Albanian Alps, a very un-Scottish ending. Instead of glorious failure, events conspired to send Shelley Kerr and her players to next summer\u0026rsquos World Cup in France.  The final whistle, and the players\u0026rsquo unbridled joy on learning that Switzerland had simultaneously failed to win in Poland, confirmed Kerr\u0026rsquos long-held belief that it would be the top seeds who faltered at the last hurdle.  The win over Albania at the Lori Borici Stadium was somewhat laboured, but neither the head coach Shelley Kerr nor her players were concerned about that after the team\u0026rsquos historic achievement.  The two results left Scotland on top of Group 2 for the only time since the qualifying campaign began last September. They can now look forward to next summer\u0026rsquos finals in France while the Swiss contemplate the four nation play-offs.  \u0026ldquoYou could see our energy was zapped tonight after the win over Switzerland on Thursday night and the pitch here wasn\u0026rsquot great, Kerr said. \u0026ldquoBut that\u0026rsquos why I knew it would be the same for the Swiss against Poland.  \u0026ldquoThe team are going to celebrate for sure because they deserve it \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos not every day you get to a World Cup, is it? Nothing compares to this. I\u0026rsquom delighted for all the players, the organisation and all the other people who support us. We had seven or eight good chances, we\u0026rsquove hit the post again and we should have made it more comfortable but I\u0026rsquom no going to dissect the performance.  \u0026ldquoThe whole week has been so tense and I\u0026rsquove tried to keep calm as a coach. I\u0026rsquove just told the players to try and win the games and they\u0026rsquove done it magnificently.  Top scorer Jane Ross, who was left out of the starting line-up for the previous two games, returned, while Manchester United\u0026rsquos Lizzie Arnot was also given her first start since returning from an ACL injury in April.  Christie Murray and Claire Emslie dropped down to the bench.  With the home side expected to get as many bodies as possible behind the ball, Scotland\u0026rsquos game plan was to stretch them on both flanks and it didn\u0026rsquot take long to pay off. After nine minutes of probing, Lisa Evans got clear on the left and sent over a cross to the far post which Arnot sent back into the paths of Kim Little and Erin Cuthbert. The Arsenal captain claimed it and crashed a volley past Viona Rexhepi.  It looked to be a non-contest as the Scots created chance after chance but they lacked the sharpness to take advantage. Rexhapi was also doing her part and made a terrific double save from Cuthbert and Ross six minutes after the goal.  The pattern continued until the half hour when the Albanians started to find some confidence. They found an equaliser just before half time, and just minutes after Rexhepi had made an even better save from Emma Mitchell \u0026ndash Megi Doci sending a low shot past Lee Alexander, who had been redundant for most of the 45 minutes.  Left-back Mitchell came even closer with a shot which hit the post and Cuthbert drew out another fine save from Rexhepi, but it was starting to look fraught midway through the second half when the much-needed goal finally arrived.  Caroline Weir took a free kick which her Manchester City team-mate headed back into the path of Ross and the striker scored her 57th, and most important, Scotland goal.  After that there was no way back for Albania, who spent most of the remaining time pinned back in their own half. News filtered through that Switzerland had been held by Poland and two minutes later Scotland had booked their place in the 2019 World Cup."},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  Salmond   s determination to clear his name could tear the SNP apart","story":"  The former First Minister is the most formidable fighter in politics and will not to go quietly into that good political night. His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In lengthy posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be, if not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to return to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But if this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But if Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":null,"title":"40-photographs-of-scotlands-coolest-people","story":"                        The Cool List:Cara Ellison, 33Games developer and                        The Cool List: Tom Harlow, 29                        The Cool List: John Robertson, 33                        The Cool List:Hannah Dines, 25                        The Cool List:Calum Maclean, 29                        The Cool List:Eunice Olumide, 39                        The Cool List:Geoff Ellis, 68                        The Cool List:Ellora James, 18                        The Cool List:James Robertson, 30                        The Cool List:Charlotte Brimner, 20                        The Cool List: Alister Mackie, 48                        The Cool List:Leah Hutcheon, 38                        The Cool List: Usman Mohammed, 25                        The Cool List:Josh Taylor, 27                        The Cool List:Celia Hodson, 56                        The Cool List:Tom Kitchin, 41                        The Cool List: Jordan Young, 38                        The Cool List:Nightwave, 35                        The Cool List:Jon McKellan,                        The Cool List:Sara Sheridan, 50                        The Cool List:Niamh Nic Daeid, 50Professor of Forensic                        The Cool List:Nico Simeone, 29                        The Cool List: Erin Cuthbert, 20                        The Cool List:Steven Brown, 46                        The Cool List:Jo Clifford, 68                        The Cool List:ora Bissett, 43                        The Cool List:Kobi Onyame, 36                        The Cool List:Fallon Carberry, 31                        The Cool List:Graham MacMillanMason,32                        The Cool List:Jenni Fagan, 41                        The Cool List:Rose Leslie, 31                        The Cool List:Rohan Gunatillake 38,                        The Cool List:David Martin, 43Artist and festival                        The Cool List:Sharon Rooney, 29                        The Cool List:Hannah Dines, 25                        The Cool List:Hope Dickson Leach, 42                        The Cool List:Mark and Isla Nelson, 4and 37Comedians and political                        The Cool List:ohanna Basford, 35                        The Cool List:Claire Heuchan, 26                        The Cool List:Si Ferry, 30                        The Cool List:Samantha Kinghorn, 22              COOLNESS is something that is often difficult to define.

He also claimed that improvements made to the school system by Labour would \u0026ldquoeradicate the desire of parents to use the independent sector.  However John Edward, director of the Scottish Council of Independence Schools, said:  \u0026ldquoEvery year, our schools save the Scottish education budget \u0026pound180m, add \u0026pound450m to the Scottish economy and generate \u0026pound250m in tax. In straightened times, they secure high attainment and offer subject choice, ied curricula, wide extra-curricular provision and learning support. They should be left alone to continue that contribution to the nation.  Labour last year unveiled plans to remove the \u0026ldquoVAT exemption on private school fees, the proceeds from which would be used to pay for free school meals in the state sector.  Across the UK, around 6.5 per cent of pupils are estimated to be educated independently, although the figure is lower in Scotland. North of the border, 29,647 children and young people \u0026ndash 4.1% of the total \u0026ndash attended one of the 72 establishments that were members of the Scis in 2016.  Defenders of the Labour plan believe it would provide a spending boost in state schools, while critics said it would create an exodus from the private sector which would end up costing the taxpayer.  McDonnell, an ally of leader Jeremy Corbyn, spoke to this newspaper about the impact of a policy Labour believes could raise between \u0026pound1bn and \u0026pound1.5bn.  With most of the proceeds earmarked for increased education spending, the Scottish Parliament could expect to receive a fixed share under the Barnett Formula.  He said: \u0026ldquoOur view is that private schools should be treated no differently in terms of their services than any others. That\u0026rsquos why we believe charging VAT is fair.  \u0026ldquoThat would give us the opportunity of raising significant funds that could then be invested in education as a whole. We don\u0026rsquot see why private schools should be treated differently in this way.  The MP said Labour is working on \u0026ldquodetailed costings for the policy but said \u0026pound100m would be line with what Holyrood could expect under Barnett.  In the context of investment and improvement in state schools, he added: \u0026ldquoI can see private schools becoming unnecessary.  Private schools are also facing higher costs in Scotland after the SNP Government backed the abolition of the tax relief they enjoyed on business rates, a decision that may cost the sector \u0026pound5m.  Scottish Tory MSP Liz Smith said: \u0026ldquoIt is very disappointing to see a sustained attack on independent schools at a time when they have met the conditions of tougher charity tests and increased their provision of bursary support for those families who would otherwise not be able to attend independent schools."},{"url":null,"title":"lib-dem-leader-puts-pressure-on-sturgeon-to-back-brexit-vote","story":"  Addressing his party\u0026rsquos conference in Dunfermline, he urged the First Minister to \u0026ldquoget off the fence and \u0026ldquostand up for Britain\u0026rsquos place in Europe.  Mrs Sturgeon was expected to provide an update on her constitutional plans in August, but the UK Government\u0026rsquos handling of the Brexit negotiations delayed any statement she might have made.  Some senior Nationalists believe there is no prospect of another plebiscite before the next Holyrood election and Mrs Sturgeon herself has called on supporters to focus on the \u0026ldquowhy of independence, not the \"when\".  Speaking to fellow Liberal Democrats, Mr Rennie called on the SNP leader to join the campaign for a new Brexit vote:  \u0026ldquoThe case for a Brexit deal referendum is growing. More people are backing it across the United Kingdom. They know the country is on the wrong track.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe SNP say they are open-minded on a final say. But they have been open-minded for two years now. There\u0026rsquos only two hundred days left. They aren\u0026rsquot open-minded they are paralysed by indecision.  Mr Rennie made a \u0026ldquoplea to the SNP: \u0026ldquoI know you are divided on Brexit. I know you can\u0026rsquot make up your mind. I know you are split on the fundamentals on independence: on the currency, on the timing and on the entire economic underpinning.  \u0026ldquoBut, while you are working on how to get out of your hellish mess, will you do something positive for the rest of us? Scotland deserves better than this. Scotland demands better.  \u0026ldquoGet off the fence. Stand up for Britain\u0026rsquos place in Europe. Put your voice behind a public vote on the deal.  Meanwhile, former party leader Tavish Scott said the Liberals had to offer voters an alternative to the left-wing politics of Jeremy Corbyn and the hard-Brexit policies espoused by Tory Boris Johnson.  Mr Scott called on the party to fill \"the glaring gap in modern politics\" and warned that if they could not be relevant \"then the world will pass us by\".  He stressed that \"this country needs better than it currently has\", saying that meant there was an \"opportunity\" for liberals, although he conceded:  \"We have not set any heather on fire since 2016, despite being the only avowedly pro-European party who should at least get a hearing from 48% of the electorate.  \"Tony Blair said yesterday that if the British public are offered a choice of Corbyn versus Boris at the next election they will be looking for something else.  \"He is right. And we need to make that alternative us. That is the glaring gap in modern politics.\""},{"url":null,"title":"one-week-which-explains-whats-wrong-with-the-world","story":"  Here we unravel the web of events which have taken us to where we are today.  THE next week is going to be remarkable. The events which unfold will be a snapshot of what has gone wrong with the world and why. But it will also offer a glimmer of hope, and show us what we can do to change things for the better.  Few of us would disagree that our world is in a sorry state, and our predicament is down to a web of tragedy and change: terror, war, the rise of the alt-right, Brexit, the gulf between rich and poor, the corrosion of democracy and human rights, the worst excess of social media, the instability of work, the power of big finance, climate change, and the turbo-charged nature of new technology from artificial intelligence to robotics.  All of these problems are connected in a chain made of terrible decisions by our leaders, aided and abetted by our own apathy and ignorance.  Our world moves so fast that few have time to reflect on why we live as we do, why the events that fill us with fear are happening \u0026ndash or to ponder what the future will make of this time of ours Might historians call this era \u0026ldquoThe Great Disruption? Not since the industrial revolution has the world been in such a state of flux.  Everything is suffering change. It is impossible to think of any industry that isn\u0026rsquot being transformed by technology \u0026ndash taxis, travel agents, newspapers, secretaries, telephone operators, just about every shop on the high street, stockbrokers, the postal service, delivery drivers, book stores, libraries ... the list is endless.  Change is not just altering industry. Warfare, the way we socialise, entertainment, religion, manners \u0026ndash even how we date has changed. Some changes are good, some are bad, but one thing is for sure, this is the era of the \u0026ldquoGreat Disruption.  The irony is it was meant to be so different. At the end of the 20th century, we were told we were at \u0026ldquothe end of history \u0026ndash the Cold War was over, incomes were rising, and bitter divisions between left and right seemed to have been healed.  All it took, however, were the actions of 19 men, mostly from Saudi Arabia, a few years later to start a chain of events that would ripple through the world, influencing in turn the invasion of Iraq, terror in Europe, the rise of the alt-right, the path to Brexit, and the corroding of democracy that we see around us in the west today.  Each of these seismic events have echoes in the coming week which show us the web that connects them: how without one the other would never have occurred. But let us start with the first stage of this chain reaction.  THE TERROR TRAIL  Tuesday will be the 17th anniversary of the al-Qaeda attack on America. Like another great act of terrorism \u0026ndash the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria by a Serbian gunman in June 1914 \u0026ndash the shockwaves from 9/11 rang around the world, and still ring today. Without the 9/11 attacks, there would have been no invasion of Iraq. They created a new military doctrine in America \u0026ndash pre-emptive military action: hit the enemy first before they hit you.  Intelligence was cooked up to justify the attack on Saddam Hussein\u0026rsquos regime. Lies were told about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. These falsehoods were amplified by much of the right-wing media in the UK and USA. Millions marched calling for no war, but they were not listened too.  As many military and intelligence chiefs warned both before and after the invasion, the attack on Iraq unleashed a wave of terror and violence across the middle east and Europe. An organisation as ghastly as Islamic State would simply have been a psychopath\u0026rsquos dream before 9/11 and Iraq made it a possibility.  Indeed, without the invasion of Iraq, there would unlikely have been civil war in Syria, as the toppling of Saddam was the started a domino effect across the Middle Dast in the shape of the Arab Spring. War in Syria led to a mass exodus of civilians fleeing murder and bombing, many heading to Europe as refugees.  So the ripples of 9/11 were these: a growing distrust in the west for mainstream political parties, a loss of faith in the press, the rise of terror in Europe, and an increase in immigration.  Call it grim serendipity, but this week will also see pre-trial proceedings under way against the alleged brains behind 9/11, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed within the walls of Guantanamo Bay.  THE CRASH  This Saturday will mark another anniversary \u0026ndash 10 years since the collapse of the global finance firm Lehman Brothers which triggered the crash of 2008. Like 9/11, we live with the effects of the crash to this day. The Iraq War also exacerbated the pain of the crash, with governments in the UK and USA too overstretched and overspent militarily to deal with the financial turmoil. The crash itself was down to old-fashioned greed and malfeasance. A mix of voodoo financing, snake-oil CEOs, and consequence-free risk-taking with other people\u0026rsquos money led to the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. The crash triggered the Great Recession across the Western world as the contagion spread.  In the UK, the government had to step in with a huge bank rescue package that came to total \u0026pound500 billion in taxpayers\u0026rsquo money, with funds pumped into teetering giants like the Royal Bank of Scotland Group, Lloyds TSB and HBOS. On Wednesday and Thursday respectively this week, the chair of RBS Group Sir Howard Davies and former chancellor Alistair Darling will both give public lectures on the legacy of the financial crisis.  What was the legacy? Austerity for one \u0026ndash which saw a squeeze on public services that hurt the worst-off in society the most \u0026ndash but also a sense of public outrage that bankers got off scot-free, bailed out when many felt they should have gone to jail.  So in the public mind the crash represents one thing: the little guy getting screwed while the corporate elite makes hay at their expense.  THE ALT-RIGHT  The alt-right would have had poorly fertilised soil to grow upon without the Iraq War and the financial crash. Not only did the war influence the worst effects of the crash, limiting over-spent governments from tackling the financial crisis more fairly, but both the war and the crash stoked the flames of racism. In alt-right eyes, immigrants and refugees are either terrorists or they are stealing white jobs.  This week, alt-right messiah Steve Bannon, Trump\u0026rsquos intellectual guru, will be popping up all over the place. He\u0026rsquos meant to be releasing a film called Trump @ War, and after getting dumped from the New Yorker festival after an outcry by liberal movie stars like Jim Carrey, Bannon will still be making an appearance at a festival organised by The Economist.  Put bluntly \u0026ndash because the alt-right sees the world in blunt terms \u0026ndash the chain of events goes something like this:  9/11 triggers war in Iraq, Iraq leads to Syria, and disruption in the middle east causes a rise in immigration into the west.  Simultaneously, the role of the West in the Middle East gives Islamist terrorists the ideological background to launch terror attacks on Western targets \u0026ndash Paris, London, Madrid.  The terror attacks fuel racism and calls for tighter immigration.  Meanwhile, the economic crash plays into the hands of the alt-right, allowing them to attack traditional politics, make claims of elites versus the people, and fuel a growing sense that nationalism and isolationism are the answers to our fears.  It\u0026rsquos a recipe made in hell.  SOCIAL MEDIA  These crises play out against the chatter of social media \u0026ndash a tool that fits snuggly into the hand of the alt-right. In a world in which many get their news not from a paper or TV, but from an echo-chamber on Twitter or Facebook, the lies and hysteria of extremists \u0026ndash from the alt-right to arch-Brexiters, and from hardline Corbynistas to the twin fringes of ultra-nationalism and ultra-unionism in Scotland \u0026ndash become harder and harder to tackle. Academics, think tanks, journalists and economists may be revealing facts which undermine extremist claims, but if few are listening \u0026ndash if most are having their own world view confirmed on social media and shutting out any fact that counters their opinion \u0026ndash then truth crumbles, and we find ourselves living in a post-truth world where anything goes.  The fight for truth goes on, of course. As Bannon takes to the world stage, a man who stands for a very different set of values will also have all eyes upon him. On Tuesday, Bob Woodward, perhaps the world\u0026rsquos greatest living journalist and the man who exposed Watergate with forensic newspaper reporting, officially launches his latest book Trump: Fear in the White House. The already heavily-trailed book portrays a president elected upon the backs of myriad fears we have discussed while barely capable of tying his own shoelaces.  Little wonder then that this week the Royal Society for Public Health, concerned by the impact of social media on modern life, is urging people to give up Twitter and Facebook for September.  BIG TECH  The men  who are the new masters of the universe \u0026ndash stepping into shoes once worn by corporate bankers \u0026ndash are the CEOs of big tech. On Wednesday, Forbes magazine releases its 100 Richest People of Tech list. Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon, is pretty much guaranteed the top spot. He is, after all, the richest man in the world with an estimated wealth of \u0026pound87 billion . In the same week, Nobel Laureate in economics, Professor Joseph Stiglitz, will address the Royal Society about the issues of \u0026ldquoArtificial Intelligence and the Future of Work. Over at MIT \u0026ndash the acclaimed Massachusetts Institute of Technology \u0026ndash scientists will spend this week debating the impact of emerging tech on the global economy.  So this week points to where the real elites lie: they aren\u0026rsquot \u0026ldquoexperts in universities, or economists, or journalists \u0026ndash they are the super-rich who make the rail and steel tycoons of the Victorian era look poor in comparison.  The week also flashes us a warning that tech is changing how we work and live. Will robotics and AI create mass unemployment and stagnate wages? If so, what will that mean for the millions still trying to recover from the effects of the crash? And who might exploit that? The alt-right?  Coincidentally, Apple is set to launch its latest iPhone in San Francisco on Wednesday \u0026ndash giving us more access to social media bubbles and taking more and more of our time away from what matters: our families, our friends and the facts that we need to look the world square in the eye and understand it.  BREXIT AND DEMOCRACY  Inevitably, all these woes of ours synthesise down to the causes of Brexit: distrust of mainstream politics, a socially and financially wounded working class, the rise of the far right, fear of terrorism morphing into hatred of immigrants, and social media bubbles which leave us free of fact but full of opinion, and vulnerable to manipulation, propaganda and lies.  It is fitting, then, that come tomorrow we are just 200 days from Brexit. Few now would argue Brexit wasn\u0026rsquot about immigration \u0026ndash an issue melded with and distorted by 9/11, Iraq, Syria, and the crash. The events of the world since 9/11 have taken democracy to the brink as Brexit shows in the UK and Trump shows in America.  However, one need only look a little further afield to see democracy under attack elsewhere in the week to come. On Friday, an increasingly populist government in Poland has to answer to the European Commission over the independence of the judiciary being undermined. Race hatred in Germany will continue to boil over. Italian democracy hangs by a thread.  Meanwhile, our paralysed Western governments look at a world in torment and find themselves without answers. This week, the 39th session of the UN Human Rights Council will look at a world in tatters with allegations of genocide in Myanmar, and the wars in Yemen and Syria just the main course in a banquet of global horrors. Simultaneously, Russia and China, two great disruptor nations, will engage in huge joint military exercises in Siberia \u0026ndash a show of force to a wounded west that their old enemies are fit and able.  The death of the old order has its own symbolic moment as well, when on Thursday, Kofi Annan, former UN secretary general and a man who represented the best of our post-war humanitarian values, is laid to rest in Accra, Ghana.  It should comes as no surprise then, that just a few days later on Saturday, the UN is launching its International Day of Democracy, aimed at bolstering belief in liberty, freedom, equality, the rule of law and free speech.  That\u0026rsquos how bad it\u0026rsquos become \u0026ndash democracy needs its own special day.  GLIMMER OF HOPE  Just 24 hours after the International Day of Democracy, the UN is launching the International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone layer \u0026ndash like democracy, the UN is concerned that the Earth\u0026rsquos climate is on its last legs and we have to act soon before it is too late. But it may in fact be climate change \u0026ndash the greatest threat to humanity \u0026ndash that points the way to salvation.  On Friday and Saturday, some 35 million people will take part in the Clean Up The World Weekend. It involves nearly 50,000 different projects in 130 countries. The aim is simple: improve your local environment. Also on Saturday, hundreds of thousands, if not one million or more, people around the world will take part in the International Coastal Clean-up, aimed at getting the filth of plastic off our shores. In Florida alone there are 252 individual mass clean-ups 12 in Ghana more than 100 around the Caribbean the main one in Scotland is the beaches around Cramond near Edinburgh.  Millions of people coming together, without the need for political leadership, for the future of the planet and the future of their children \u0026ndash and using social media to coordinate it all \u0026ndash is surely a sign that ordinary folk are not so weak that we can change nothing, and that new technology can be harnessed for good.  People have listened and read and understood the facts about climate change \u0026ndash they armed themselves with the truth and now they are mobilising. They are taking that knowledge and applying it in real life from Cancun and Miami to the west African coast and the Firth of Forth.  Hope lies in ordinary people, in education, in facts, truth and action \u0026ndash these are the only tools we have to break the chain of events which has led us to the sorry state we find ourselves in at the beginning of this one very significant week in September.  THE NEW HERALD ON SUNDAY \u0026ndash BORN AMID HISTORY IN THE MAKING  AS this report shows, this first edition of the Herald on Sunday could not be more timely. All the events that dominate our lives coalesce in the coming week. It is a week which allows us to reflect on how we got here, and try to work out what we can do to get out of the mess we find ourselves in.  So for a new paper, we come to the news stands with fertile ground to explore. Good Sunday journalism is meant to not just report, but to analyse and explain events. Good journalism is meant to seek out the truth and try to find some answers. That is what we are doing in this report. We are asking: how did we get to this one week in September 2018, what has shaped our lives to this stage, and what can we do to move on and prosper.  The analysis and reporting of the new Herald on Sunday will seek out the truth without fear or favour, and try to provide honest answers impartially. Often the truth is uncomfortable and answers unpalatable, but good journalism has always been about taking the hard road, not the easy one.

Foreign Editor David Pratt goes to the heart of the Kurdish Rojava Revolution and meets some of the women making it happen.  As befitting such a memorial to great sacrifice, it\u0026rsquos a solemn place. To wander its avenues flanked by 1,300 headstones one can only but ponder on the lives of those buried there. Sometimes though there are clues in the faces that peer out from the glass mounted framed photographs left by relatives and loved ones.  Most of those depicted are young, in their late teens and early twenties, and rather uncommon for a cemetery dedicated to fallen soldiers, many are women.  It was grey and overcast with brooding storm clouds scudding across the sky like giant Zeppelins, the day I visited the Martyr\u0026rsquos Cemetery in the northeast Syrian town of Kobane.  Almost four years have passed since that bitter siege in 2014 when Islamic State  jihadists overran most of this city near the Turkish border, only to be beaten back by the determined and near legendary resistance of mainly Kurdish fighters.  Today many consider the battle for Kobane to be a key turning point in the war against IS in Syria.  Since then something equally extraordinary too has happened in this remote corner of northern Syria a place the Kurdish name for which is Rojava or quite literally Western Kurdistan.  It\u0026rsquos a story that defies the usual narratives about Syria and the Middle East. One totally at odds too with the reactionary, hierarchical, misogynistic and vehemently anti-democratic diktats espoused by the jihadists of IS.  It was six years ago when the Syrian government regime of President Bashar al- Assad found itself embroiled in a civil war. It was at that moment too that Kurdish political parties in Rojava declared autonomy and began their extraordinary project of self-government and equality for all races, religions, women and men. Out of this was born the Rojava Revolution as it has now become commonly known.  With gender and religious equality enshrined within the revolution\u0026rsquos constitution, women, especially, play a crucial role in shaping the political direction of this remarkable movement.  All too often in the course of the revolution women or their loved ones have also made the ultimate sacrifice for a cause in which so many here passionately believe.  Women\u0026rsquos People Protection Units  were formed that fought alongside their male counterparts in the YPG, both forces being under the command and control of the leading political party of the Rojava Kurds, the Democratic Union Party .  \u0026ldquoWe came to plant flowers, we do it once a week or whenever he comes to our mind, Zuleyxa Bilad tells me while standing in the Martyr\u0026rsquos Cemetery with her daughter Gardenia alongside the grave of her husband who was killed in the bitter battle for Kobane.  It was at the height of the fighting that the YPG fighter was shot by an IS sniper in the city on a day that also saw 27 of his comrades killed, many women among them.  I asked Zuleyxa if her daughter Gardenia now five years old knew what had become of her father?  \u0026ldquoGardenia knows everything because I explained everything to her and sometimes she cries, Zuleyxa replies.  \u0026ldquoLater she will understand that her father along with his brothers and sisters died defending the revolution for all of us, so that life will be better for her and the next generation when they are adults, Zuleyxa added, before both mother and daughter continued adorning the grave with the flowers and plants they had brought from the market in Kobane.  Women have borne the brunt of the fight against IS and shouldered the responsibility of defending and shaping the Rojava Revolution in so many ways. Some like Zuleyxa have lost husbands, sons and daughters. Others themselves have served and perished on the frontlines.  So many of the graves in Kobane\u0026rsquos Martyr\u0026rsquos cemetery have the names of young women inscribed into the marble of their headstones or have pictures of them smiling and dressed in the khaki military fatigues of the all-female YPJ People\u0027s Self-Defence Units.  As well as resisting IS in Kobane, women were also involved as part of the umbrella Syrian Democratic Forces  that comprises both Kurds and Arabs, in the fierce fighting that culminated in October last year in the ousting of IS from its self-proclaimed capital Raqqa, most of which now lies in bomb blasted ruins.  More recently women have fought and died too on the battlefields surrounding the city of Afrin. There Turkish forces and their militia allies who have much in common with the jihadists of IS, have advanced forcing many Kurds and others to flee eastwards to Kobane.  \u0026ldquoOur family\u0027s ancestors have been living in Afrin for over 200 years, says Nuri Urik, a 45-year-old Kurd who, along with his family and thousands of others, was forced from Afrin by the fighting.  Today, he and his wife, children and grandchildren have taken up home in Kobane.  \u0026ldquoThe whole journey was traumatic with the constant bombing, but the moment that we left Afrin was the worst, nobody remained in the village, everyone left, Mr Urik recalled, of the day just a few months ago when he and his family fled.  During the journey, his daughter-in-law Hemide Dede was pregnant. Once in Kobane, she gave birth to his granddaughter Xedice, who when we talked was just weeks old.  Tough as life is in Kobane the womenfolk of Mr Urik\u0026rsquos family now find themselves in a very different environment to the one they would have been subject to had they stayed in Afrin at the mercy of the occupying Turkish forces and their Islamist militia allies.  The beating political heart of the Rojava project is generated by communal assemblies, in which local people take decisions for themselves, be it about jobs, the environment, healthcare, literacy, the rights of the displaced or whatever. In every sphere women are scrupulously given an equal voice to men and women co-chair every meeting and every assembly.  Emina Bekir and her colleagues Almaz Rumi and Heval Heyad run the Kobane Women\u0026rsquos Board, the sharp end of an administration that deals with the day-to-day work of providing facilities to help women, ranging from creches to literacy project for the elderly.  \u0026ldquoThings are far from ideal and basic resources remain out biggest problem, but we have every right to be proud of what we have achieved so far and with adequate overseas support who knows what we are capable of, says Emina Bekir head of the Kobane Women\u0026rsquos Board. She has a point. From local defence groups and Women\u0026rsquos Academies\u0026rsquo to advance equal opportunities in education to \u0026lsquoWomen\u0026rsquos Houses\u0026rsquo where those who have experienced domestic violence can find shelter, support and legal representation there is much to admire.  For their part critics have claimed that the Rojava revolution is \u0026lsquocultish,\u0026rsquo \u0026lsquocommunist\u0026rsquo or \u0026lsquopseudo Marxist\u0026rsquo to mention just some of the negative observations cast its way. But while there are elements of such characteristics, up close the Rojava Revolution remains democratic in a way many in the West would be envious of.  Real people by and large govern here, not the career and opportunist politicians that have come to plague so much of governance in the West.  The real internal hands-on workings of this system became clearer one afternoon while in Kobane when I visited a cultural centre where hundreds of local women and others displaced by the fighting from the city of Afrin had gathered for a conference. Young and not so young, all were members of the local \u0026lsquoParastina Jin\u0026rsquo a local community defence group.  \u0026ldquoRight now here in Rojava there is a revolution within the revolution, insisted Ayse Efendi, who is co-chair of the Movement for a Democratic Society and was presiding over the conference.  Married to former co-chairman of the PYD, Salih Muslim Muhammad, she like many women of the revolution I encountered was keen to stress that what is underway in Rojava is not just a fight for the rights of Kurdish women but also for non-Kurdish minorities, mostly Arabs but also Syriacs, Turkmen and Assyrians.  This is not just wishful thinking but implemented at the most basic level. If for example language difficulties arise during meetings or conferences then interpreters are provided as I myself witnessed.  No distinction on the basis of ethnicity or background is made and it doesn\u0026rsquot stop there. Beyond the region too what the Rojava experience represents says Ayse Efendi is \u0026ldquothe fight for women\u0026rsquos rights internationally.  This global outlook and senses of solidarity was something I was to hear time and again from women\u0026rsquos representatives in Rojava.  To date the Rojava womens\u0026rsquo achievements are nothing short of remarkable in a region traditionally very conservative and home to rural and peasant norms. Here the \u0026lsquoold ways\u0026rsquo included prevailing attitudes that saw the existence of child marriage and keeping women at home.  Many women made the point that historically the problems they faced derived mainly from two sources, the family and the state. Intimidation and arrest were for a long time common in this part of Syria for those women who did not toe the established line.  \u0026ldquoHistorically there were certain people in both these sections of society who believed that if women became educated and emancipated, they would become a source of problems for wider society and the then existing political infrastructure, says Nejbir Teyar a 24 year old spokeswoman for the Kongreya Star .  Kongreya Star is a confederation of Rojava women\u0026rsquos organisations whose guiding principle is that \u0026ldquowithout the liberation of women, a truly free society is impossible. It has been pivotal in the significant advances made in gender relations in the region.  \u0026ldquoWhen you look at Kurdish history, women have always been a powerful influence in the family but we have taken that influence and emphasised its positive rather than negative factors, Ms Teyar explained.  I put it to her that the Middle East was a challenging place to say the least for anyone seeking to enhance women\u0026rsquos rights and asked where might the Rojava women\u0026rsquos revolution be in say five years time?  \u0026ldquoWe are not daunted by such challenges, women have been suffering for thousands of year, but if we organise to get there then nothing can stop us, came her reply adding again too the importance of global solidarity.  \u0026ldquoWe do not see ourselves detached from other women\u0026rsquos struggles internationally, when we see a single women suffer we feel the pain, she told me.  On the morning that I left Kobane to begin my journey home it was an early start. In the dawn light we pulled up at the first of many checkpoints where a young women YPJ member dressed in camouflage fatigues and carrying a Kalashnikov rifle checked our ID. A short time later on the city\u0026rsquos outskirts we passed the Martyr\u0026rsquos Cemetery shrouded in drizzle, but I could just make out the figures of other women YPJ members laying flowers on another grave.

However, details of the plan have angered a trade union for other local government staff who are not being offered an extra \u0026pound25m.  Gary Smith, Scotland secretary of the GMB union, said: \u0026ldquoIf there is going to be a load more money for teachers, it\u0026rsquos going to be an explosive cocktail for public-sector pay talks.  Teachers\u0026rsquo pay is determined by a tripartite body that includes the Scottish Government, representatives from councils \u0026ndash as the employer \u0026ndash and union negotiators.  However, the group has failed to reach an agreement after the teaching unions called for a 10 per cent pay rise.  The Educational Institute of Scotland , which represents most teachers north of the Border, has signalled that strike action could be taken unless their demand is met.  Leaked papers from the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, which represents councils, provide a detailed summary of the revised proposal.  In March, Cosla made an initial offer to all bargaining groups, including teachers, of a three per cent rise for staff earning up to \u0026pound36,500 and two per cent for those on higher salaries. The proposal was rejected.  Derek Mackay, the Cabinet Secretary for Finance, then wrote to Cosla last month and agreed to an additional \u0026pound10m which would extend the three per cent rise to teachers earning between \u0026pound36,501 and \u0026pound80,000.  He also backed another \u0026pound25m for a wider \u0026ldquorestructuring of the main pay scale, aimed at improving recruitment and retention.  The paper noted: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government has proposed a better offer for teachers and is prepared to fund it. Collectively it represents an investment over its two elements of \u0026pound35m.  Cosla, which is responsible for making a formal pay offer, backed the plan this month and teacher representatives are now considering the detail.  A local authority source said the two elements, taken together, could result in a sizeable number of teachers getting a rise in excess of 10 per cent.  The Cosla paper cautioned that the new plan would not \u0026ldquoguarantee a settlement with the unions, but stated: \u0026ldquoWhat it would do, however, is force a decision by the EIS to gamble or settle. Gambling on getting a mandate for industrial action in pursuit of an unachievable claim when three per cent is on the table and a desirable restructuring of the main grade on offer would be a bold move by a trade union not known for foolhardy decisions.  The document also suggested that the Government had \u0026ldquoexpressed an eagerness to \u0026ldquode-couple that rise from the pay scale revamp, on the grounds that the second element is a \u0026ldquopolicy intervention designed to correct a \u0026ldquofailure in the teacher market.  Smith\u0026rsquos GMB members, who include cleaners and care workers, have also been offered three per cent \u0026ndash which the union rejected \u0026ndash but not an additional \u0026pound25m.  \u0026ldquoWe don\u0026rsquot grudge teachers anything, but our members are doing more work than ever. It will add fuel to the fire, he said.  Councillor Gail MacGregor, Cosla resources spokesperson, said the Government\u0026rsquos \u0026pound10m had been \u0026ldquomatched pound for pound by council leaders for the general workforce: \u0026ldquoIt should not be forgotten that Scottish local government is the employer and the one making the offer. We are also funding the vast majority of the offer to teachers within the limited resources we have at our disposal \u0026ndash so it would be wrong to solely focus on the \u0026pound10m from Government.  \u0026ldquoSecondly there is a separate discussion around the \u0026pound25m for restructuring of the pay grade and a joint commitment to look at that \u0026ndash but that is nothing to do with the pay deal it is totally separate.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoTeachers\u0026rsquo pay is a matter for the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers  and negotiations for 2018-19 are now well under way and making progress.  An EIS spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoAt this week\u0026rsquos SNCT Extended Joint Chairs meeting an amended pay offer was proposed. The teachers\u0026rsquo side of the SNCT will now consider the offer in detail. A further negotiating meeting of the Extended Joint Chairs is scheduled for the September 18, where the teachers\u0026rsquo side will respond formally to the offer."},{"url":null,"title":"home-ownership-a-pipe-dream-for-most-public-sector-workers","story":"  Research by the Unison trade union found that saving money for a down payment on a property would take decades for public sector staff \u0026ndash and more than a 100 years in parts of London.

So far this year five ships on the Clyde and Hebridean services have been out of service. On Arran this weekend, the country\u0027s busiest route, one of the two ferries was out of action and the other, the antique MV Isle of Arran, has also had its problems this summer.  The old boat, a beige time capsule, was supposed to be replaced by a new high-tech, environmentally-friendly vessel called the Glen Sannox, but that has been delayed.  The ideal lifespan of a ferry is 25 years but half of them on our routes are older. The average age of ships is 22. In the early 1990s, Scotland\u0027s last burst of ferry building, it was 12.  It\u0027s not as if the Scottish Government is not investing, with over \u0026pound1 billion plumbed into ferry services since the SNP came to power in 2007. Two new ones, delayed by up to a year, are under construction, but this simply isn\u0027t enough to cope with demand \u0026ndash ironically spurred by the Government\u0027s flagship road equivalent tariff, which has kept prices down, and the collapse of the pound after the Brexit vote, which has led to more stay-at-home tourists as well as an influx from abroad taking advantage.  There are no quick and easy solutions. There are no vessels available to buy or rent-in which are available. What is needed is a long-term, planned investment programme for a fleet of standardised ships as well as standardised harbour facilities, so that these boats could be shuffled round the routes. Over to you Holyrood."},{"url":null,"title":"lifeline-to-scotlands-islands-in-jeopardy-as-ageing-fleet-faces-soaring-passenger-numbers","story":"  The 50-year-old heating engineer has been trying to tell how little he thinks of the ferry service to his island. Now he has decided to show it instead.  So he ushers us in the shade behind his white van and brandishes a photo of the empty car deck of an ageing ro-ro. \"They had told us the boat was fully booked,\" he says. \"But it was empty. Computer problems.\"  Mr Higgins is having a picnic lunch on the front at Brodick, Arran\u0027s main port, as another load of tourists in sunglasses, their faces glowing red from sun and sea, trundle hand luggage along its promenade. \"I like to get off the island when the visitors come,\" he smiles, watching them. \"That is not always easy. In the summer you have to book three weeks in advance.\"  It is a brilliant September day, the Firth of Clyde is a flat azure that melts seamlessly in to the sky and Arran is heaving. It has been all season. So are the boats that provide its lifeline links to the mainland. The island is home to just over 5,000 people. Last year 911,434 passengers were clocked on its two ferry routes. That is 20 per cent more than a decade ago. The figures for cars are rising even faster, by 44 per cent from 2007 to total 229,664 in 2017.  This summer traffic \u0026ndash most of it on what is often a two-boat service out of Ardrossan on the North Ayrshire coast \u0026ndash has grown again.  The passengers Mr Higgins watched had passed through a high-tech adjustable gangway and state-of-the-art terminal . But they did so after coming off a boat built in 1984, the MV Isle of Arran. And that is a problem.  The vessel, its interior a beige time capsule of sticky seats and retro puggies, has had problems, more specifically this year, propeller pitch control problems. Cue service disruption, and not for the first time.  The old boat was supposed to have been replaced this summer by a new high-tech environmentally friendly vessel called the Glen Sannox. That ship is delayed. Hence the frustration of Mr Higgins and much the rest of Arran.  Yet this local row \u0026ndash albeit affecting Scotland\u0027s busiest ferry route \u0026ndash is just one symptom of a much bigger problem, a problem that has been a generation in the making.  Simply put, Scotland\u0027s islands are getting record numbers of visitors but the boats and port infrastructure carrying them are old, really old.  There is a mantra in the ferry industry about this crisis. Nobody, insiders insist, is to blame. And nobody, they add, will be able to find a quick fix.  That is because half of the ferries on Clyde and Hebridean routes have seen out their ideal lifespan of 25 years.  The average age of a ship is 22. In the early 1990s, the last time Scotland had a major burst of ferry-building , the average age was 12. The number, unchecked, has been rising ever since. In fact, it has been a generation since Scotland, one of Europe\u0027s most \"islandy\" nations, was launching enough ferries to sustain its fleet.  The result? Boats break down. And when they break down they are hard to fix. And our islands suffer.  So far this year five ships on Clyde and Hebridean services have been out of service. One, the Hebridean Isles, built 1985, which usually services Islay, has been laid up twice, thanks to damage in rough seas off Tiree and a collision with the harbour at Kennacraig on Kintyre.  Newer ships, such as the MV Clansman, which services the outer Hebrides from Oban, are among those out of action.  Bad things happen at sea that is to be expected. What counts is whether the entire system \u0026ndash fleet-wide \u0026ndash can cope when they do.  Take Calmac. The biggest operator of ferries runs most services to islands and peninsulas in Western Scotland. It is state-owned. Its ferries are owned by another state owned entity, CMAL, which also owns or leases the boats that, under a separate Northlink franchise, service routes to the Northern Isles of Orkney and Shetland.  Between January and the end of July this year, some 2,326 out of 79,203 Calmac scheduled sailings were cancelled. Of these 327 were for mechanical reasons. Most of the rest were because of bad weather.  The figure for cancellations for problems with the ferries looks low, not least because Calmac will stress that it laid on more than 900 extra sailings to compensate for some of them.  However, a ferry that does not sail is not quite like a bus that does not turn up on time. There are rarely alternatives. And with ferries packed to capacity, alternative travel is not always easily arrangeable.  When a boat breaks down, a replacement has to come from somewhere else. Somebody always loses. Calmac does not have a spare vessel, crewed and fuelled, bobbing about at sea waiting to save the day. Indeed, even if it did have a spare, Calmac could far from guarantee it could use it. Why? Every port has its own pecularities, whether it is an ageing linkspan or unusual tide. This is not a standardised fleet. Most ships and ports are bespoke.  Usually Calmac gets the blame. It is the firm with the name on the side of its ships, with their trademark blue hulls and white superstructures. In fact, the firm, which had to compete to secure its franchise from its own government owners, has been warning about a growing problem with its service for years.  Back in 2010 the company bluntly told the Scottish Government that a new ferry would have to be launched every year just to stand still.  In its submission to that year\u0027s ferry review, it said such a drumbeat of production could cut the average age of the fleet from 22 in 2012 to 19.5 in 2022.  Warnings have echoed ever since. In March, Calmac\u0027s chief executive, Robbie Drummond, signalled this summer could be tough. He said: \"Any issues with a vessel on one part of the network will have knock-on effects for other routes, as boats need to be diverted or deployed elsewhere to keep the lifeline network running.  \"Islay has already been adversely affected by such changes this week, with one of the two ferries that normally serve the island needing to be withdrawn to fulfil contractual obligations elsewhere.  \"The working life expectancy of a ferry deployed on routes like those on Scotland\u0027s western seaboard is around 25 years, so with nearly half of the ferries working these routes already beyond that milestone - and having been used intensively during those years of service - the risk of mechanical failures and breakdown is significant.  \"It also takes longer to get older boats back into service when things do go wrong, often due to the difficulty in sourcing parts across Europe.\"  By May there were more grumbles. Mr Drummond, summoned to Holyrood, spelled out the problems again. He told MSPs: \"It remains the case that we have no spare vessels to accommodate this eventuality.  \"It was not a minor breakdown a major vessel has been out for more than two months, and is coming back in for another two weeks while we get back on track.  \"There has been a period of major disruption\u0026mdashthe worst the company has experienced for eight years. We have tried as best we can to provide the best possible service through that period.\"  Key stakeholders are not happy. Outer Hebrides Tourism  reckons it lost \u0026pound6m from service cancellations after the breakdown of one boat. Ian Fordham, its chairman, this week said: \"While the Scottish Government must now invest in CalMac to improve fleet resilience, they should also recompense our local businesses and invest in rebuilding confidence in the Outer Hebrides as a tourist destination after the negative economic impact of this summer\u0027s ferry fiasco. This has hit tourism business not just this summer but its future growth too.\"  It is not as if the Scottish Government is not investing. The current SNP administration has put a cool billion pounds in to ferry services since it came to power in 2007. This includes \u0026pound97m for two new ferries being built for CMAL at Ferguson Marine in Port Glasgow. The first of these, the MV Glen Sannox, was supposed to go in to service this summer to replace the Isle of Arran but will not start operating until, at current estimates, next summer. A second, now codenamed 802, will run to the Western Isles to help address the OHT\u0027s concerns. It isn\u0027t convinced. Among its other complaints were that two new ferries were delayed \"with nothing else in a build pipeline.\"  \"How they will manage this against the backdrop of traffic and visitor growth to the Outer Hebrides?\" it said.  The boom in visitors was not expected. Some put that down to the Scottish Government\u0027s flagship \"road equivalent tariff\" or RET scheme under which a ferry journey should not cost more than a drive. But other factors are at play: the collapse of the pound after the Brexit vote means more tourists from both home and abroad.  Across the Calmac network, the last five years have been busy. Between 2012 and 2017 the number of cars carried grow by 37 per cent to 1.43m per year. Passenger numbers rose 17 per cent to 5.2 million per year.  Joe Cullinane is pleased with that. He leads North Ayrshire Council, which includes key Clyde ferries, including Arran\u0027s. \"The fleet is too old to meet the demands of RET,\" he says. \"RET is great for the added tourism. But the infrastructure is not ready to cope with RET, our roads, our ports and our ferries.\"  The RET pressure has been hardest on Mr Cullinane\u0027s patch. Tiny Cumbrae, gets more visitors than all of the Western Isles put together. So many, in fact, that there is now routine traffic congestion in the sedate resort town of Largs from where a new hybrid ferry sails. Why? Cars queuing for the hop across the First of Clyde.  The new ferries on order at Ferguson Marine are also hybrids. This vexes some of Scotland\u0027s \"armchair admirals\", the voices berating the decision to invest in new tech, rather than tried and tested conventional ships. The delays to the two new ships have been at least partly put down to the risk of innovation. Some critics have also suggested a quick order could be placed for a cheep-and-cheerful diesel-guzzling chugger in a low-cost shipyard in the Far East. Policy-makers reckon that would just be another stop-gap solution.  The Scottish Goverment quango Transport Scotland asked Calmac and CMAL to look for off-the-shelf boats to buy or lease to fill the gaps. It even suggested that it would pay for them. So couldn\u0027t Scotland just pick up a \"rustbucket\" from the Greek Islands or Norway? No. There are just no vessels out there that would work.  Transport Scotland said it \"continued to invest\" in new ships and ports. Its experts stress that ferries should not be seen as ships in isolation. They are part of a complex system that includes ports and other transport connections. They have to \"fit\".  CMAL had no comment. It has its two new delayed ships on order and then will look to get another, for Islay. The future of Scottish ferries - of Scotland\u0027s islands - now lies in the hands of a document CMAL published in January. The Vessel Replacement and Deployment Plan or VRDP is a detailed run-down of what boat should go where for years to come. It\u0027s very last words should be music to the ears of Scottish islanders and visitors. It says: \u0026ldquoConsider the opportunity to develop a medium/large class of major vessel capable of working effectively and efficiently on a number of routes across the network.  What this means is a move to more standardised vessels for big routes, namely from Oban to Colonsay, Islay, Coll and Tiree from Mallaig to Lochboisdale in the Western Isles and Armadale on Skye and from Wemyss Bay on the Clyde to Rothesay on Bute. For standardised ships, these ports will have to have standardised or future-proof harbour facilities built. That is big money. But, crucially, it would mean Calmac could reshuffle its fleet far more easily when something goes wrong.  The VRDP did not say when such plans would be considered. Transport Scotland was able to. It\u0027s next year. A spokesman said: \"The focus of the next vessel procurement will be a new ferry for Islay to replace the MV Hebridean Isles. This will maintain our investment programme, currently focused on the construction of two major vessels for the CMAL fleet and a number of major harbour projects.  \"The development of a medium/large class of major vessel will be considered by Transport Scotland, CMAL and CalMac as part of their programme of work. This is intended to get underway next year.\"  Back on Arran there was more trouble this weekend. The island\u0027s other main ferry, the Caledonian Isles, now exactly 25 years old, was cancelled for technical reasons. Islanders are used to this.  Sheila Gilmore, out walking her cockapoo Archie, was philosophical. Arran born and bred, she now runs the local destination marketing bureau, Visit Arran. \"It is frustrating when you can\u0027t get off the island. We have to get used to that. What we want is to make sure we have two ferries on the main Ardrossan route all year round. Across the network? Resilience is the issue. We need a spare boat.\""},{"url":null,"title":"world-trade-centre-subway-station-reopens-for-first-time-since-911","story":"  Cheers erupted as the first train rolled into the new WTC Cortlandt station.

That, says former Scottish first minister Jack McConnell,\u0026nbsp  now Lord McConnell of Glenscorrodale, has contributed to the programme losing its way.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos deliberately moved away from a programme that expands the knowledge of the viewer, to one that has attempted to be an entertainment show in which people shout at each other.  In an age when too many media interviews are carefully controlled to produce a line for news, Question Time could play an important role. Instead, it produces zero public benefit in that context.  While reluctant to discuss his friend\u0026rsquos potential role on the programme, his vision of the next presenter is not a million miles away from Wark.  He says: \u0026ldquoThe role needs someone who has authority, who is well-researched and doesn\u0026rsquot rely on research done by a team behind the scenes. It needs someone who has the potential to be seen as at least an equal to the people around the table in terms of knowledge of current affairs and credibility.

Many people love being a volunteer for the buzz of being at the heart of a community-based cultural event.  Among them is Nanette Craig, who will be 85 on the second day of the festival, and has been helping out for more than a decade. She said: \u0026ldquoI love being part of the festival, it\u0026rsquos great fun and it keeps you young.  Nanette moved to the area 60 years ago when she married a local farmer and they retired to a house in the town in 2002.  She added: \u0026ldquoI love it here, there\u0026rsquos such a strong sense of community. But the town had become so run down with empty shops and houses. It really needed a boost and that\u0026rsquos what the festival has done.

Her roles extend from delivering leaflets to introducing speakers at events that are part of the children\u0026rsquos festival. This time she is looking forward to catching up with the likes of Cathy Cassidy, Ross Mackenzie, Chae Strathie and Vivian French. Helena said: \u0026ldquoI really enjoy being part of the festival, it\u0026rsquos always been part of my life. And it\u0026rsquos great to have the chance to meet so many authors and illustrators.

At the same time, she found a 19th-century Scottish dictionary in an Edinburgh bookshop.  \u0026ldquoI came across the word timmer breeks \u0026ndash timmer is timber and breeks is an old Scots word for trousers and timmer breeks together means coffin, she said.  \u0026ldquoThe more I started to look at these dictionaries I was coming across these really interesting definitions \u0026ndash phrases I had never used.\u0026nbsp  \u0026ldquoA lot of the words had a real poetry to them and that\u0026rsquos what made me collect them. There is a word huam, which means the moan of an owl in the warm days of summer, or splorroch which is the sound made by walking in wet mud.  A Scots Dictionary of Nature, which is published by Saraband, is a reminder of how easily the beauty of language and its connection with nature can be lost.\u0026nbsp  In 2007, the Oxford Junior Dictionary ditched 40 words it said children no longer used.

The ensuing outcry led to a book called The Lost Words by author Robert Macfarlane, a fundraising campaign to get the books into schools and even an exhibition in Edinburgh this summer.\u0026nbsp  Ms Thomson, from Kilsyth, said: \u0026ldquoDifferent words will have resonance with different people depending on who they are, where they are from and how old they are.  \u0026ldquoIt harks back to connections to place and history, how you relate to previous generations. There\u0026rsquos a word for a sparrow \u0026ndash speug \u0026ndash I always remember my grandfather using.  \u0026ldquoMost of us are now in the city more than the country and we don\u0026rsquot care about the weather in the way we would have done.

The campaign is being fronted by ordinary Scots, like Gordon Hutchinson who underwent a life-saving transplant, aged just 13.      \t         “I called and was told I needed to get down to Edinburgh right away.”It was a call Nick had waited two and a half years to receive. He was born with a kidney condition that meant neither of his organs worked properly.                                                                                                         He underwent surgery at 18 months old and then went for regular checkups to monitor how his kidneys were functioning.  At a routine appointment in October 2014, doctors delivered the news that his kidneys were failing and Nick started dialysis shortly after.He said: “I’d lived with the condition all my life so hearing that I’d need treatment was a shock. “The doctor told me I’d be lucky to make it to Christmas without being on dialysis but I held on until February 2015.                                                                                                        “By the time I went on dialysis, my kidney function had dropped to eight per cent. I thought I was okay but looking back I was constantly tired and agitated. Things were a bit of a struggle.”Nick was determined the dialysis would not take over his life and kept working throughout.He said: “I was team leader at that time for an oil company – in charge of the onshore group.“I was determined to keep on working and have as normal a life as possible but it meant doing dialysis every night after work.“I’d leave home at 7am and not get back until 10pm or 10.30pm every day                                                                                                         “Dialysis was hard. I felt like my life had been put on hold but I knew the treatment was the only thing keeping me alive. “Some days were better than others the staff at the hospital got me through some difficult times.”Despite that, Nick decided to propose to Philippa and booked the wedding at the Winter Gardens in the hope she would say yes.“I left flowers by the kettle one night – happily she said yes,” said Nick.“We’d been together for ten years and she saw me through everything.“She had to put up with an awful lot – the mood swings, not going out because I was too tired all the time – but she still said yes.”The couple got married last August and were on honeymoon when Nick got the call that would transform their lives.He said: “I was really lucky – I was only on the transplant list for two and a half years.“But I didn’t get my hopes up too much until I was taken down to theatre and knew it was going to happen.“I was building myself up for disappointment until that point. It was a really surreal experience.”Happily, the transplant went ahead and Nick woke up to a whole new life.“As soon as I woke up from surgery I instantly felt better,” he said. “Nothing could have prepared me for the difference it made.  “I’d just got married and then I got the gift that I’d waited over two years for.  “To have a life free from dialysis was the best feeling and I felt amazing. I didn’t realise how ill I’d been until I had the transplant and started to feel 100 times better. It was fantastic.”Nick, an electrician by trade, has made the most of his donor’s incredible gift – enjoying life to the full and setting up his own business.He said: “It was something I always wanted to do but would never have been able to achieve on dialysis.“I now have my own electrical business and am working all over Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire.“It’s made a massive difference to Philippa and me too – we can go out and enjoy ourselves now. It’s nice to have that freedom it’s a new life basically.”As for his donor’s family, Nick has written a letter thanking them for his gift.He said: “I know nothing about the person who made my transplant possible but I owe them everything. “They saved my life and are truly my hero. I want their family to know I will be eternally grateful for this incredible gift.”Nick is already on the organ donor register and hopes his story will encourage others to sign up.He added: “It’s quite possibly the most important thing anyone can ever do.”To join the NHS Organ Donor Register, visit weneedeverybody.org                "},{"url":null,"title":"scottish tradesmen it s your call to help children","story":"        Protecting children does not just fall to the police, social workers and professionals who work with them.

/                   \t      \t\tProtecting children...in the average primary class, at least two children have suffered abuse or neglect. The NSPCC\u0027s Childline is on call 24 hours a day to help children who need help.\u0027\u0027      \t         Matt Forde, the national head of NSPCC Scotland, said: “We’re not asking people to spy on families. “But when they see something, in their heart of hearts, they know isn’t right, we’re asking them to report it so that those families can get the help they need.                                                                                                        “The online course both informs and educates about the signs of abuse and neglect and what you should do if you have a gut feeling that something is not right.“We’re not trying to turn plumbers or builders into social workers.“But they do spend a lot of time in customers’ homes and it’s not an unlikely scenario that someone in that situation might gain an insight into a child’s life.“People are often unsure whether they should report it. We would ask them to look at it from the child’s point of view – or their own child’s.                                                                                                        “The police and children’s services are not in the business of getting involved, willy-nilly, when they don’t need to.“In the vast majority of cases, children are not removed from their homes but their families do get the help and support they need.“Often, parents have their own pressures and have lost sight of their child’s needs.“They’re overwhelmed with their own difficulties and have a strong instinct against asking for help.“It’s very often a burden that is lifted when they get a chance to talk about something they have been struggling with on their own for far too long.”                                                                                                        On the flip side of that coin are children who are in imminent danger.NSPCC Scotland asks the public to call its helpline – 0808 800 5000 – or the police immediately in the worst case scenarios.Last year in Scotland, the NSPCC’s helpline referred 2012 calls and emails to local agencies such as the police or children’s services.The majority were from people who were concerned a child was being neglected  followed by concerns about physical abuse , emotional abuse  and sexual abuse .Matt said: “There has been increased traffic to our helpline.“People are often unsure whether to report something – they really struggle with it.“By calling the helpline, they can talk through their concerns and decide whether it’s something that needs to be taken forward.“Our advice would be for people to consider if it was their child in that situation – better safe, than sorry.”As the NSPCC relies on donations from the public to deliver its services in Scotland, the It’s Your Call online course does cost £19 for individual tradesmen, with package deals also available for employers.But Matt is hopeful that it will become a success.He said: “It’s very early days for the It’s Your Call training but we are hoping individuals and employers will take it up.“We are not funded by the government – we raise all our own funding – so a fee is involved to cover the cost of delivering the training. “But we hope people will agree it’s a small price to pay to help children who are potentially being abused or neglected.“It’s about helping to give children a voice when they can’t speak out themselves.”NSPCC Scotland prides itself on providing a voice for children but is also keen that young people, of all ages, are able to make their own voices heard too.The charity holds special Speak Out, Stay Safe assemblies at primary schools in every local authority area in Scotland with that aim in mind.Matt added: “We help children understand what abuse is and what to do if they are affected.“We then go back two weeks later to find out what the children made of it and reinforce the message. “Children often come to Childline when they are aged 12 and above, talking about things that have happened to them for years.“So we wanted to deliver a programme for primary schools in the hope that children would start reporting issues earlier.“Teachers have been very positive about the programme as it’s a topic they often struggle with too.” The NSPCC is the leading children’s charity fighting to end child abuse and protect children at risk in the UK and Channel Islands. Voluntary donations make up around 90 per cent of its funding.Childline open 24 hours a dayThe NSPCC’s Childline service has two bases in Scotland, in Aberdeen and Glasgow.In 2017/18, Childline volunteers delivered almost 280,000 counselling sessions to children and young people across the UK on the phone and online. Based on the population of Aberdeenshire, it is estimated that volunteers delivered around 1800 counselling sessions to children living in that area last year alone.Some of them are going through the toughest times of their lives. They face issues such as mental/emotional health, family relationships and bullying. So it’s vital that they have somewhere to turn. Childline – 0800 11 11 and www.childline.org.uk – is there for them 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.On average, a child somewhere in the UK contacts Childline every 25 seconds.NSPCC Scotland’s Speak Out Stay Safe  service, which helps children learn how to recognise abuse, has now been delivered in the majority of our mainstream primary schools.Sadly, in the average primary school class, at least two children have suffered abuse or neglect.Just £4 pays for a child’s call or contact with Childline and £3 pays for the SOSS programme to reach a child. But the NSPCC relies on donations from the public to provide its services across the UK and volunteers to help deliver them.To find out how you can help the charity or to make a donation, visit the website https:www.nspcc.org.uk/what-you-can-do.                "},{"url":null,"title":"payment phone line down for almost a month","story":"        A north-east MSP has appealed to the Rural Economy Secretary after it emerged a phone line to help farmers navigate government payments has been down for almost a month.                Peter Chapman has said that calls are being diverted from the Rural Payment and Inspection Division  office telephone line at Thainstone, Inverurie, to Elgin.                                                    This has led to delays while calls are then transferred back to Inverurie or problems for farmers getting through at all as the lines are too busy.                                                    Mr Chapman was contacted by a constituent in Aberdeenshire who has expressed his frustration at the problem.        It is understood that the fault relates to a fallen phone line near Thainstone.The rural payment offices provide information to farmers about application forms that need to be filled in for grants and payments to meet strict deadlines.Peter Chapman, Scottish Conservative MSP for the north-east region, said: “I was contacted by a farmer constituent of mine who has raised concerns about this problem, which has been going on for nearly a month.“This is causing problems both for local farmers and for the Elgin office, which I gather is being inundated with calls.                                                                                                        “Farmers are being kept waiting for long periods of time to be connected, while staff in Elgin do not know if those in Inverurie are present to deal with the call.“It is important that people can reach their local office as quickly as possible, as very often application forms are subject to strict deadlines.“I have written to the Rural Economy Secretary seeking some information on when this issue will be resolved and also some assurance that the Scottish Government is making sure the Thainstone office can accept local calls.”                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"play facilities to be installed at kingseat","story":"        A long running planning related issue at a residential development on the site of the former Kingseat Hospital, near Newmachar will be resolved next week.                Aberdeenshire Council will carry out work to form a community park and install play equipment, after the initial developer of the site, Avant Homes, failed to install the facilities as required.                                                     The work had been a condition of the planning permission agreed for the site and late last year the council served planning enforcement notices to try to get the work moving.                                                     Other than preliminary works there has been no significant progress from the developer or landowner, so the council will begin work on site from Monday  to deliver the park and play area and seek to recoup the cost.         The lack of community facilities at Kingseat has been an ongoing concern for the local community and Councillors for a number of years.The enforcement notices were served in connection with two breaches of planning control, relating to the storage of spoil/materials and the lack of a play park. The focus is on a fenced-off central area of the site where there was previously a bowling green and open space area within the former hospital complex. This was intended to form part of the open space/facilities for residents within the completed development. Avant Homes had 12 weeks from October 20, 2017 to clear the spoil storage area and create a new open space area, including play equipment.                                                                                                         The notices were not appealed by the developer and the period for compliance expired on February 12.Since then the site has changed ownership to ZTR Investments and Aberdeenshire Council gave the new owners time to comply with the notices, while making alternative arrangements. Aberdeenshire Council’s Head of Planning, Robert Gray, said: “Although some preliminary clearing work was undertaken by the new owners there has been no significant progress in forming the park or installing the play equipment. As such the Council has appointed contractors to complete the works. “The site owners, Kingseat Community Association, Newmachar Community Council and immediate neighbours to the development area have been formally notified of the start date.                                                                                                        “This is the first element of an attempt to facilitate completion of the wider development at Kingseat and deliver some much-needed community facilities for the residents.”The work is expected to take up to 60 days to complete, depending on weather conditions.

A language that official bodies such as the UNESCO insist has been dead since the 1800\u0026rsquos.\u0026ldquoIt wouldn\u0026rsquot be the first time UNESCO has prematurely pronounced a language as dead. Back in 2009 UNESCO declared Manx extinct despite there being over 1500 speakers of Manx.\u0026ldquoUNESCO was forced to change its classification of Manx from \u0026ldquoExtinct to \u0026lsquoEndangered\u0026rsquo after a group of school children wrote to them in Manx asking what language they were writing in if Manx didn\u0026rsquot exist.\u0026ldquoThe more people I talked to the more I came to find that Norn isn\u0026rsquot dead, it has just become lost in our English. When I gave people examples they shrugged them off as \u0026lsquoCaithness Words\u0026rsquo but it is so much more than that it is \u0026lsquoCaithness language\u0026rsquo if only we put our minds and our hearts to it.With her Norn Min series workbooks Grace Hall is spreading the Norn language both within Caithness and outside of the region as well.She added: \u0026ldquoThe Norn Min series has three workbooks published and another two in the pipeline. Copies of the series have sold as far away as America and Sweden.\u0026ldquoIt was just after the publication of Norn Min buk two that I received an email from the University of Bari in Italy as their Minority Languages department was interested in Norn.\u0026ldquoThey asked if they could use the Norn Min series to create an Italian-Norn phrasebook. A week later I was contacted by the World Children\u0026rsquos Book project and they offered me a contract to translate five of their books into Norn.The World Children\u0026rsquos Book project has over 200 translators making their bilingual books available in languages traditional publishes ignore such as English Igbo in Nigeria, German/Tigrinya in Ethiopia and now English/Norn in Scotland.Copies of both the workbooks and storybooks are available at John O\u0026rsquoGroats and Caithness Horizons.\u0026nbspSunday 9 Sep 2018 10:22 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"BT exchange gets the bird","story":"CONCERNS have been raised by an animal charity after a number of birds became strangled in roof netting in Wick.An angry reader has claimed that the birds included seagulls, crows, blackbirds and pigeons, all of which found themselves trapped on top of the BT exchange in Union Street.The netting is said to be on the building for \u0026ldquosafety reasons \u0026ndash but, as the picture the reader provided shows, it doesn\u0026rsquot appear to do much for the welfare of those trapped in it.The reader, who did not wish to be named, has said that both BT and animal protection charity the SSPCA have been contacted to see what can be done \u0026ndash \u0026ldquobut to no avail \u0026ndash and is appealing to them to do something before more bird injuries and deaths occur.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove tried calling them but nothing seems to be done, the reader said.\u0026ldquoOver the year I\u0026rsquove seen around eight birds \u0026ndash seagulls, pigeons, blackbirds and crows \u0026ndash trapped on the roof netting of the BT building on Union Street.

Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to life and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that divides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because if nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Sunday 9 Sep 2018 10:23 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117364.jpg","title":"New service gives job hunters a Fair Start","story":"\u0026nbspScottish Government ViewpointFAIR Start Scotland is the country\u0027s new devolved employment support service.It is focused on supporting unemployed people who have challenges in accessing the labour market for whom work is a realistic prospect.Launched in April, earlier this year, it is an example of one of the first uses of newly devolved powers under the 2016 Scotland Act.The service will run until 2023 and aims to provide tailored, flexible and person-centred support to at least 38,000 people across Scotland who want help to find work, and stay in work.Fair Start Scotland is distinctive in that participation is purely voluntary.This means that people have everything to gain and nothing to lose \u0026ndash choosing to participate will not affect existing benefits or be driven by fear of benefit sanctions.The service is delivered locally, meaning that no participants are left without the support they need.Delivery is over nine geographic areas including the Highlands and reflects local area economies, meeting the needs of employers, disabled people and those at risk of long-term unemployment.Jamie Hepburn, Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, said: \"What\u0027s crucial about Fair Start Scotland is that it treats people with fairness, dignity and respect and that it is focused on the needs of the individual.\"We are dedicated to delivering a high quality employment support service that will lead to real and sustained job outcomes and help people to achieve their full potential.\"As well as meeting the needs of unemployed people, Fair Start Scotland also seeks to help businesses find the skilled and committed employees they need to thrive.\"One of the many now benefitting is Highlander Alan Cairns .He has not worked for over a year and his biggest barriers to work have been low confidence and computer skills but now he has secured 16 hours of work per week.Alan started on the Fair Start Scotland service in the middle of May and has been attending the service for the past 12 weeks.

Like that earlier work, The Katanes Saga is told in an unpretentious, engaging, sometimes blokey style. From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash if it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him returning to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Asleifarson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being knifed in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Sunday 9 Sep 2018 10:23 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of life make life-changing decisions that create a difference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people.

He was a third-year medical student who played rugby with the cycling trio and was also a talented musician. He had also been suffering from depression.The idea of cycling from John O\u0026rsquoGroats to Land\u0026rsquos End came to the trio after they had learned that Marcus had previously done the lengthy cycle, not once but twice.Fenn, a final-year maths student from Sheffield, said that Marcus\u0026rsquos sudden death was a huge shock to us all at the rugby club,and for everyone that knew him.\u0026ldquoHearing the news that he had been suffering from depression was a surprise to all his friends and family, he said.\u0026ldquoIn light of this, Marcus\u0026rsquos family have set up a fund in his name \u0026ndash Marcus in Mind \u0026ndash to raise awareness and prevent this sort of tragedy happening to more young men.Giles, a marine and offshore engineering student from Bridgnorth, Shropshire, added: \u0026ldquoThe three of us felt compelled to do something to help raise awareness of depression and mental health.\u0026ldquoAfter learning at his funeral that Marcus had completed this very cycle ride twice, we knew it would be an appropriate challenge.\u0026ldquoWe are using the social media hashtag #ItsOkNotToBeOk and we\u0026rsquore hoping to remove some of the stigma and get blokes like us opening up about mental health.Given Marcus\u0026rsquos and the trio\u0026rsquos links with rugby, clubs around the UK have been aware of the mental health awareness drive that they\u0026rsquore undertaking,Alex, a marine engineering student from Porthlevan, Cornwall, said: \u0026ldquoWe have been in touch with rugby clubs up and down the country. Our aim is to spread our message far and wide and hope others may cycle with us.\u0026ldquoWhen we discovered depression leading to suicide was the cause of Marcus\u0026rsquos death, we couldn\u0026rsquot believe it.

Brian, who was awarded a British Empire Medal in June this year in recognition of his services to military history in Orkney said: “Many people have dedicated time and energy to gathering photos over a period of 20 years or more and would like to see the collection completed as far as possible for the centenary of the Armistice on 11 November this year.“Having a nearly complete set of images of all the Orcadians lost would be a most poignant way for our community to mark this anniversary and a wonderful resource for future generations.”It’s believed 578 Orcadians died serving in the Great War and the Legion’s collection, available to view on their website, contains photos of just over half — 297 — of those lost.The council’s call comes as part of Orkney’s First World War commemoration programme, which is being coordinated by the council with invaluable contributions and support from local organisations community groups and individuals.As part of a series of events, on November 11, Orkney will participate in a national commemorative event that involves as many photos of local lives lost in the war as can be found and the participation of their families, a further reason for trying to complete the collection.Lucy Gibbon from the council’s Library and Archive service said there may well be much sought-after photos in people’s attics and family memorabilia collections: “Whilst very few people had a camera during the Great War, nearly all towns had photo studios. Most servicemen visited one of these while training in the UK.”“If you know you lost an Orcadian relative in the war, now is a great time to find out more about them. The Orkney Library \u0026amp Archive might have some items to help shed light on their story.”The Legion’s photo archive has been made possible thanks to the generosity and hard work of many — for example around half of the photos have been sourced from The Orcadian, which has published photos sent in by families in a feature called Our Roll of Honour during the Great War.Other notable contributors and donators over the years include Tom Gibson of Rousay, Beatrice Thomson of North Ronaldsay, Mabel Eunson of Deerness and the late Margaret Watters of Stenness, Bill Miller of Stronsay, Phyllis Gee of Flotta, and George Esson who spent two decades visiting families in South Ronaldsay and Burray seeking photos of loved ones lost in the war, and with the help of and David Mackie and Colin Rendall made copies for the Orkney Library and Archive.These and many more contributors are noted on the project’s website — where people can also view images in the collection by Parish and by significant battles.Anyone with photos they believe are not already included in the Legion’s collection is urged to contact Brian Budge on phone 01856 872225 and email brian.budge@btinternet or to drop into the Orkney Library and Archive in Kirkwall.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

With these beach cleans we’re taking that commitment one step further, helping sweep our shorelines for litter and collate vital local data that will be fed back to the Marine Conservation Society.”“The results from previous years’ Great British Beach Cleans are thought to have been instrumental in bringing about environmental legislation such as the plastic bag charge and banning of microplastics in personal care products, so the more local faces that join in, the bigger the potential difference we can all make.”The Great British Beach Clean is organised by the Marine Conservation Society  and takes place annually in September.Scottish Sea Farms are looking for volunteers to take part in their effort.They have asked anyone planning to join in to should register, via https:www.mcsuk.org/beachwatch/events/gbbc, and should wear appropriate clothing with pickers, gloves and bags to be provided.The meeting point of the Echna Loch Bay event, will be at lay-by on the road next to the bay, down the hill from the fossil centre, and the meeting point for the Weyland Bay event will be at the lay-by opposite the sewage treatment works on Carness Road.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Finalists will also receive feedback from some of the region\u0026rsquos top entrepreneurs and business advisers on how to take their idea forward.Run by Create, the UHI\u0026rsquos Centre for Enterprise and Innovation, the competition is now in its 13th year and is open to all students studying at the UHI as well as non-students living in the Highlands and Islands, Moray and Perthshire.Last year the competition attracted more than 115 entries. This year the entries will be narrowed down to 15 finalists who will discuss their ideas with the judges at the finals day on November 22.Last year\u0026rsquos top prize went to former Inverness College UHI student Paul Beaulieu , from Milton, Invergordon, who took home a cash prize of \u0026pound1500 and a combined legal and accountancy package worth \u0026pound2000 for an idea that could revolutionise how pipes are fabricated and fitted together.Dr Carol Langston, head of Create, said: \"Often people have a business idea, but they don\u0026rsquot know what to do with it, or who to turn to for help. That\u0026rsquos where Create comes in. We work with people to encourage them to be ambitious, bold and creative in their thinking, with the aim of encouraging innovation.\"Former winner Anna Renouf of Orrin Equestrian, is encouraging new entrants to take part in the competition.Since winning the most innovative business idea and the best engineering and technology award in 2015, she has gone on to win \u0026pound10,000 from Scottish Edge and received a Smart Scotland feasibility grant, which has allowed her to focus on the development of her innovative saddle design.Anna said: \"The University of the Highlands and Islands Business Competition represented the start of my business journey and it really gave me the confidence to take my idea forward and develop it further.\"Even now, I regularly seek advice and guidance from the Create team about the direction of my business.

When the kirk on the shores of Lochbroom was put up for sale by the Church of Scotland back in 2016, it\u0026rsquos future looked uncertain.A determined local fundraising drive saw it eventually taken into community ownership by locals who see it as a key hub in the beautiful, remote area.Celia said: \"We saw how well Donnie Mackenzie\u0026rsquos fundraiser for Clachan did and the huge boost it gave everyone involved. Sara and I thought we would enjoy getting fitter, seeing more of our country, and help Clachan at the same time. Since our local Trust became owners on June 22 we straightaway saw the difference it has made to our community. It has become a community focus right from the start.\"With the doors open more often we know there\u0026rsquos someone there and stop for a chat. For those of us living on the no-through road on the west shore of Loch Broom, we pass Clachan every time we go anywhere so it is ideal.\"\"When Clachan opened during the Lochbroom Sheepdog Trials, the trust displayed some local produce, from handloom weaving, cards, honey, handmade books and paintings, to show the range of economic activity in Lochbroom. That is the tip of the iceberg. There\u0026rsquos only a small population but there\u0026rsquos a huge number of people producing high-quality goods \u0026ndash having their work displayed in a public building helps everybody.\"Sara and I are confident that Clachan will be an asset to the Lochbroom community for many years to come so we are asking for sponsorship. This can be done at the New Broom hub in Ullapool and by emailing me at celiajcharity@me. Thank you.\"Kenneth Macleod, an interim trustee of Clachan Lochbroom Heritage Trust, said: \"I have seen the benefit that grows from rescuing a building, improving it and making it available for wider purposes. Of course Clachan continues for the usual church occasions \u0026ndash we want everyone to know that! \u0026ndash whilst extending its usefulness for other appropriate purposes.\"Sunday 9 Sep 2018 10:24 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

We\u0026rsquoll ensure an open competition for all bidders whether public or private sector organisations.\u0026ldquoWe expect the current franchise to end in 2025. The tendering process will begin two years before that.

He can now use Microsoft Outlook and completed his new CV on Microsoft Word and been applying online for jobs.Alan said: \"I\u0027ve attended workshops on confidence building, and digital skills.\"My confidence is improving a lot and so is my computer skills, I have been job searching online and sending emails, I couldn\u0027t do this before.\"* To find out more and check eligibility for the service visit www.mygov.scot/fairstartSunday 9 Sep 2018 10:24 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Shortly after I came back to Scotland in 1996, I saw Tommy Sheridan speak at a rally in Glasgow’s George Square. I had been in England for seven years so had largely missed the poll tax marches and his six months incarceration for trying to block a warrant sale. I don’t remember what the rally was in aid of just the impression he created. With his black leather jacket and self-conscious Che Guea pose, he was, frankly, irresistible.             Later, as an MSP for the Scottish Socialist Party, his appeal endured. You wouldn’t have wanted him to lead the country, obviously, but – like Dennis Skinner – it was good to have him there on the periphery campaigning on issues such as the abolition of poindings. A belligerent Jiminy Cricket, he sat on Holyrood’s shoulder, reminding it to always let its conscience be its guide.            How long ago those days seem now. The days before Sheridan’s ego parted company with his convictions before the swinger allegations, before he became abusive towards the women who gave evidence against him, before his perjury conviction and his jail sentence. The days before he helped form Hope Over Fear, a shouty, Bro-centric vehicle for his rehabilitation and, some would say, a blight on the wider Yes movement.Now, to consolidate his position on the paranoid fringes, Sheridan is set to front an online video programme on Sputnik, the Russian propaganda platform. With impeccable timing he made the announcement just as the UK government identified two Russian nationals as suspects in the Novichok poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal. Introducing himself to viewers with customary modesty, he compared himself to that other great socialist firebrand, Oscar Wilde, and pledged to bring them stories ignored by the dreaded MSM. Unlike all those other self-serving politicians, Sheridan said, his integrity was priceless and his principles non-negotiable. Those principles he hadn’t traded in for a chance of preserving his image as a steadfast family man, at least.Sheridan is, of course, following in the footsteps of Alex Salmond who hosts a weekly chat show on TV network Russia Today  – the non-thinking man’s answer to the “problem” of alleged BBC bias. Fed up of Auntie’s unionist leanings? Why not tune into the outlets that pioneered fake news and so opened the door to Brexit and Donald Trump?It takes a degree in cognitive dissonance to present a state-owned propaganda machine for a regime that annexed Crimea, propped up Bashar al-Assad’s regime and persecutes gay people as a promoter of social equality, and a hopeless naivete to believe that an operation that exists to undermine faith in the establishment is genuinely invested in Scotland’s independence . But Sheridan assured his public that Sputnik was a censorship-free zone. There’s no way a man o’ independent mind like Julian Assange-supporting Citizen Tommy would be used as Vladimir Putin’s mouthpiece. This is the same Citizen Tommy who called the Salisbury poisoning “a pile of pish” and was last week RT-ing tweets suggesting images of the suspects were photoshopped by MI5.            The interesting thing about Sheridan’s new role, however, has been the mixed reaction to both it and RT from Yessers. Admittedly, he has supporters, most of whom can be found on his timeline, cheering him on with messages such as “Gaun yersel, Tommy – the past is the past”. Similarly, SNP MP Angus MacNeil vowed to continue appearing on RT, despite the government announcement, saying the best way to counter propaganda was to go on and give a “counter message”. But elsewhere there seems to be an incipient backlash towards both the Russian outlets and the wilder elements of the independence movement in general.In March last year, it was revealed SNP MPs had made 50 appearances on RT where fees are up to £1,000 an hour . To be fair, Nicola Sturgeon has always been opposed. When Salmond began his show, she criticised his decision and insisted the party had “regularly expressed concern over actions by the Russian government, including reports of persecution on the grounds of race and sexuality, attacks on journalists and concerns about the integrity of the democratic process.” Despite pressure from some quarters, the SNP leadership has also always accepted that the most plausible explanation for what happened in Salisbury was either that it was a “direct action of the Russian authorities” or that the Russian government had “lost control of the nerve agent and it fell into the hand of others.”But last week the party’s stance seemed to harden. Agreeing the Russian state was “demonstrably implicated” in the attack, SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford branded RT a “vehicle of the Russian state” and said he didn’t believe anyone should broadcast on it.            But the most explosive response came from SNP Westminster spokesman on defence Stewart McDonald, who visited Ukraine earlier this year and called out Sheridan in a series of Tweets.“Many of those [who are] ‘denied’ platforms elsewhere and find themselves on Sputnik are holodomor deniers, conspiracy theorists and cranks,” he said. “Decent-minded people should body-swerve it. Then again, a perjurer and a fake news agency are made for each other,” he wrote.Sheridan’s response was to compare himself to William Wallace, betrayed by his own side, and to suggest such criticism played into the hands of the unionists. Some of those you would expect to defend him did.But elsewhere there was a discernible change in the temperature a subtle scent of something new in the air. It’s hard to put your finger on it, but it’s there on social media: a growing embarrassment with the kinds of people who use #falseflag hashtags and claim elections with low turn-outs are rigged  the kinds of people who see a plot in every BBC headline and who engage in Twitter pile-ons whipped up – wittingly or unwittingly – by the likes of Wings Over Scotland.There must be a growing recognition that it is this kind of behaviour – not McDonald’s – that plays into the hands of unionists, who use it to suggest sections of the independence movement are unhinged. Given at the IndyRef, 53% of men voted Yes, while 57% of women voted No, it should also be clear male-dominated events and all-male panels probably aren’t the way forward.             In the past, there has been a reluctance on the part of MPs and MSPs to speak out too openly for fear of alienating supporters. But it would be good if McDonald’s intervention marked the start of something bigger: a sort of concerted effort to jettison the aggressive, off-putting patterns of behaviour and present a more positive, unified, inclusive and palatable version of the movement to those whose votes it needs to win."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4797006.1536399992!/image/image.jpg","title":"snp gather in edinburgh to debate scottish independence plans","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"spurs lose tight highland amateur cup final ","story":"Lerwick Spurs have narrowly lost the Highland Amateur Cup final after taking the tie to extra-time with a late equaliser.\nThe isles side had gone a goal down to Pentland United \u0026#8211 the competition\u0026#8217s most successful team \u0026#8211 in the 18th minute.\nPentland looked set to secure their eight Highland Amateur Cup trophy until a stoppage time equaliser from Spurs brought the game to extra-time.\nThe Lerwick side found themselves 2-1 down in the 6th minute of extra-time and were unfortunately unable to bag an equaliser.\nSpurs won five games on their way to the final including a quarter-final success against 2017 champions Avoch.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

of creating the new Local Development Plan for Badenoch and Strathspey.\nA Cairngorms National Park Authority spokesperson said that several new additions had been included for public consultations

manager David Berry explained: \"For the most part, the preferred options outlined in the Main Issues Report will be used as the basis for the Proposed Local Development Plan which we aim to publish for consultation in November.\n\"However, there are a limited number of new site allocations that we consider are appropriate to include in the next Local Development Plan and we would like feedback

allocation for the Landmark Forest Park is being considered as is a small extension to the allocation at the Grantown Caravan Park.\n\"The consultation we are carrying out from this week to September 21 concerns these site allocations only and no unrelated comments can be considered at this stage.\"\nThe small industrial zone extension is proposed to the north of the Dalfaber Industrial Estate and there are proposals to designate more land for economic use at Granish just north of the village.\nLand for industrial use has been regarded as being in short supply within the Aviemore area for many years.\nThe park authority is also looking to re-allocate the existing protected open space at Spaven Drive at the north end of Aviemore for community use.\nThe site has been identified by Aviemore Community Enterprise Company as a possible location for a new community hall with a kick park and playground.\nThe blueprint for the Landmark attraction is to expand the site to the west and south which would accommodate increased parking and future expansion of the business.\nLand to the north-east of Grantown\u0027s caravan park has been pinpointed for possible development.\nThe CNPA is required to publish a LDP for the park which must be reviewed every five years.\nBetween November 2017 and March this year the MIR \u0026ndash which outlined the CNPA\u0027s views on the key issues

Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association  in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary  Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon. This was then used as a pretext by the RUC to ban the NICRA parade from the Square. \nAbout 2,500 took part in the NICRA march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon. The main speaker was Austin Currie MP, later a Fine Gael TD. Also speaking was Gerry Fitt, West Belfast MP. Fitt who, years later, was lifted into the House of Lords by Margaret Thatcher, declared that they would go on until they had “Civil Rights and a 32-County Republic”.\nBut the real leaders of the Civil Rights Movement which began that day were the rank and file, the ordinary people of Tyrone and beyond who marched for justice and freedom. \nThe first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon was held on 24 August 1968, 50 years ago this week.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27461  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\n“The denial of rights, equality and respect is as wrong today as it was fifty years ago. - Mitchel McLaughlin\nHundreds of people took part in a commemoration in Tyrone yesterday to mark the 50th anniversary of the first civil rights march to be held in the north. \nThe march retraced the steps of the original march from Coalisland to Dungannon and was attended by Sinn Féin representatives from across the north. \nIt was led by Mid Ulster Sinn Féin MP Francie Molloy, who took part in the original march 50 years ago as a steward. \nMarchers carried replicas of the posters carried by the original march, reading \u0027One man, one vote,\u0027 \u0027Equal housing now\u0027 as well as banners referring to the Caledon housing protest which was the motivation for the march. \nContemporary posters on the threat posed to Brexit to rights were also carried by marchers. \n\nIn 1968 the original march was stopped before it reached the Square in Dungannon by the RUC because loyalist protestors staged a counter demonstration. \nThis time, however, the march reached its destination where speeches were made by Francie Molloy, local MLA Colm Gildernew and Fermanagh/South Tyrone MP Michelle Gildernew. \nThe main speaker of the march was veteran republican and civil rights activist Mictchel McLaughlin. \nIn his speech, the former Assembly Speaker said tat much has changed in the last five decades and that we are on the verge of a major shift towards Irish unity. \n\"The Orange state is now gone and we now have a peaceful and democratic way forward. \n“This is a very different place than it was in 1968 and I am convinced that we are now on the verge of another seismic shift towards a new, agreed and united Ireland that will provide a prosperous and shared future for all our citizens,\" he said. \n\nBut Mr McLaughlin also warned that our rights are still under threat today from Brexit and the right wing alliance between the Tories and the DUP. \n“My deep concern is that there are still people who want to deny rights and equality to their fellow citizens today. \n\"People in the north still face attacks on their electoral and civil rights, alongside the continued denial of rights to LGBTQ couples, women, Irish language speakers, and bereaved families seeking a coroner’s inquest.\n“Today, we are experiencing an unacceptable blockade on rights, imposed by the DUP and facilitated by the British government.\n“Rights are also under threat by a right-wing Tory Brexit and there are unwelcome echoes of gerrymandering and the hollowing out of democracy by the recent Boundary Commission proposals.\n“The denial of rights, equality and respect is as wrong today as it was fifty years ago,\" he added. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27462  ","story":"Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O\u0026#039Neill.\n Michael McMonagle\n\n“We must specifically acknowledge the damage done by the Catholic Church to the lives of many women and children in the mother and baby homes, the Magdalene Laundries and a succession of abuse scandals and cover ups.- Michelle O\u0026#039Neill\nThe visit to Ireland by Pope Francis this weekend is an opportunity for the Catholic church to address the ongoing legacy of abuse, Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O\u0027Neill has said. \nMichelle O\u0027Neill made the comments ahead of the historic visit to Ireland of Pope Francis this weekend to attend the World Meeting of Families which is being held in Dublin.

The march was blocked by the RUC at Thomas Street from entering Dungannon’s Market Square, subsequently leading to the second Civil Rights march in Derry’s Duke Street on 5th October 1968.\n\"The first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades,\" he said.\nOver 2,500 took part in the first civil rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon.\nThis would evidently change politics here forever - this was very much a campaign organised by people, from all backgrounds and none. \nProminent republicans were also central to the organisation of demonstrations, including the now Mid Ulster MP, Francie Molloy and the late Stan Corrigan.\nReflecting on the first civil rights march, 50 years on, Colm Gildernew said the first civil rights march should act as a rallying cry to those of us who seek to promote rights, equality and respect for all in society today.\n\"We are currently experiencing an unacceptable blockade on a swathe of rights-based issues by the DUP, including Irish language, marriage equality, women’s health, and legacy rights.  \n\"There are huge concerns arising from Brexit and the recent Boundary Commission proposals, seen by many as a new attempt to gerrymander the north.

The Volunteers were brothers Gerard and Martin Harte and Brian Mullin.\nThe SAS killings brought to an end a month which had been one of the most intense and tragic of the war in Ireland. It began on 1 August with the IRA bombing of Inglis Barracks in London, close to Margaret Thatcher’s Finchley constituency. It was the first IRA attack in England since the bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the Tory Party conference four years earlier. A British solider was killed in the Inglis Barracks blast. In the following days, the IRA killed three British soldiers and an RUC detective in the North. \n\nOn 8 August, two young nationalist men were murdered by a loyalist death squad in Belfast. There were two more such sectarian killings of young nationalist men in Belfast, on 17 and 18 August. On 20 August, eight British soldiers were killed at Ballygawley, County Tyrone, when the IRA bombed a bus carrying members of the Light Infantry Regiment returning from England. On 31 August, two civilians were killed in Derry after they triggered an IRA booby-trap bomb intended for British forces. \nPolitically this period was dominated by the issue of extradition and, on 27 August, Robert Russell, one of the IRA prisoners who broke out of the H-Blocks in the mass escape of 1983, was handed across the border to the RUC. This was despite widespread protests, including public dissent from within Fianna Fáil.\nIt was on the Long Bog Road at Drumnakilly, four miles outside Omagh, that the three IRA Volunteers met their deaths.\nAt 4pm on 30 August, they were ambushed by British forces who poured a hail of bullets into their car. The RUC and British Army immediately sealed off the area and the bodies of the three men were left at the scene, within the cordon and inaccessible to grieving relatives, until the following afternoon. \n\nGerard Harte  was the eldest of the three Volunteers and was an experienced IRA activist. With his brother, Martin, he was a prominent member of the Loughmacrory St Theresa’s GAA Club, where he organised youth teams. \nMartin Harte was just 21 but had been in the IRA for four years at the time of his death. A talented football player, he had captained the Loughmacrory team. He was the father of a three-month-old son and, to compound the tragedy, his widow was Briege Mullin, sister of his friend and comrade Brian Mullin. \nVolunteer Brian Mullin  had been singled out for particular harassment by British forces. He was arrested and interrogated in Gough Barrack on numerous occasions and a few weeks before his death he and his brothers were beaten by crown forces outside their family home.\n\n\nHundreds of British soldiers and RUC members saturated the Tyrone countryside as the three Volunteers were laid to rest. Speaking at the graveside of the Harte brothers, Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Volunteers were “good, decent, patriotic freedom fighters driven to fight for justice”. \nVolunteers Brian Mullin, Gerard Harte and Martin Harte were killed on 30 August 1988, 30 years ago this week.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27466  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\n“The policy of this government is failing the homeless, failing those renting and those who strive to own a home.

The excellent work done by Barrister Mark Bassett covers EU and Irish law and is unambiguous - with political will, this can be done,\" she said. \nMartina Anderson said that senior figures in the EU, as well as leading representatives from both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have already indicated support for the proposal. \n\"The European Parliament emphatically endorsed a resolution calling for democratic and social rights to be upheld in the north post-Brexit. The Parliament’s Coordinator on Brexit, Guy Verhofstadt supports continued representation for the north, as does the Fianna Fáil leader and Fine Gael MEP Seán Kelly believes it is worth considering,\" she explained. \nSinn Féin recently made a submission to the Constitutional Commission set up to examine the boundaries of European Parliament constituencies which called for the creation of a new constituency in the north and Martina Anderson explained this legal opinion reinforces that submission. \n The Sinn Féin MEP made a direct appeal to An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to uphold the rights of Irish citizens in the north. \n“An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar stated that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish government. This is the first real test of those words. There are a number of regions and territories across Europe that offer flexible and imaginative solutions to ensure citizens maintain their voting rights, it’s time Ireland did likewise. So now it\u0027s over to An Taoiseach. \n“2018 marks the 50th Anniversary of the Civil Rights Movement in the north. Brexit threatens many hard-won rights and protections that we in Sinn Féin will continue to fight to uphold. If the Irish government is serious about joining us in this fight, then they can allocate these two new seats to the north,\" she said. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27469  ","story":" Caolán McGinley\n\nI am calling on the IFA to respect the rights of Palestinians by cancelling this match and sending out a strong signal that the slaughter of Palestinians in the open-air prison which is Gaza, is completely unacceptable.- Sinead Ennis\nThe Irish Football Association have come under increased pressure to cancel an international friendly with Israeli which is scheduled for Tuesday 11th, September. \nThousands of people have signed a petition set up BDS Ireland is calling on the IFA chief executive to cancel the fixture.\nSinn Féin MLA Sinéad Ennis said the IFA have made the ‘wrong decision’ by hosting the Israeli soccer team and called on them to respect the rights of the Palestinian people. \n“Over recent weeks and months, many sporting, cultural and music figures have heeded calls from the BDS movement, not to perform in Israel. \n“The Israeli government must feel the pressure of the international anger at their mass killings, human rights violations and flagrant violations of international law.

This shows the consistently high performance that our students are achieving over a wide range of subjects.” \n  \nA large percentage of pupils will be returning to embark upon A-Level studies and the College would also like to formally wish those leaving all the very best in the future career paths they choose to follow.\n  \n\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_995389.jpg--.jpg?1535635289000\n","title":"peter marks 40 years with moy park","story":"  \nBROUGHSHANE man, Peter Morgan, has been an employee of Moy Park for almost 40 years and still maintains \u0027every day is a school day\u0027.\n  \nPeter is the Agri Business Technical Manager at the Larne Road site. \n  \nAs Moy Park celebrates 75 years in business this year, Peter reflects on personal milestones and discusses how the agri sector has changed during this time.\n  \nSpeaking to the , eter said: “I finished college in 1981 and joined the O’Kane Poultry team after studying agriculture and gaining a HND in Poultry Husbandry.\n  \nI always enjoyed the outdoor life and thought a career in food production would be beneficial in the long term as society became more attuned to food demand and supply issues.\n  \n\n  \nFirst role\n  \n\n  \nPeter\u0027s first role in O’Kane was as a Broiler Advisory Officer, which involved helping farmers with their bird management and ensuring they were producing good, quality chicken. \n  \nI was later made Manager of the Broiler Growing Operation in 1989 and took on additional responsibilities in 1995 as Manager for Broiler, Breeder and Hatcheries.\n  \nNearly 30 years later after Moy Park acquired O’Kane in 2010, I took on my current position as Agri Business Technical Manager, Peter explained.\n  \nIn this role, Peter is responsible for ensuring they are compliant with all operating procedures, using only approved products across the farming supply base and helping farmers achieve excellence in what they do.\n  \nPeter continued: As you can imagine, there has been significant advances in research and development over the course of my career, which keeps us at the forefront of bird health and welfare, sustainability, product quality, food safety and value for money.\n  \nFor example, reducing campylobacter has been a top priority for not only the poultry industry, but in particular Moy Park. This is the most common form of food poisoning in the UK. \n  \nWe have heavily invested in research throughout the production chain and we have already implemented new ideas such as hot water heating, double barrier changing facilities in each house and other technologies which we firmly believe have had a major impact in reducing the number of our birds which can become infected with Campylobacter. \n  \nFurthermore, we are focusing on excellence in biosecurity and innovative processing technologies.\n  \n\n  \nOngoing challenges\n  \n\n  \nControlling infectious disease in poultry is an ongoing challenge Moy Park face, in particular avian influenza . To address this, they have upgraded their AI contingency planning, rewriting the rulebook in the past year to ensure they have a robust plan in place.\n  \nWe have to think carefully how we would react and prevent spread if AI came in to Northern Ireland and together with agencies and Government departments we exchange views regularly with working groups, in order to remain on top of this key issue, Peter said.\n  \n\n  \nCareer Highlight\n  \n\n  \nOver his 40 years with the company Peter said a key highlight has been promoting ownership and pride with the people he works closely with.\n  \nA back to basics approach is one of my fundamental pillars, and I still firmly believe that bird husbandry and welfare are key to producing a high-quality product.\n  \nThere are endless opportunities for those considering a career in agriculture and food production, and as my wife and son also work in the poultry industry, I can definitely vouch for that!\n  \nAs the world population continues to expand, the demand for goods also increases and food production, and those working in the industry, will have to keep up with this development.\n  \nBy strengthening our production capabilities over the past number of years, we are well placed to meet this demand, with poultry a healthy and versatile source of protein which is also good value for money.\n  \n\n  \nPositive outlook\n  \n\n  \nPeter concluded: As I look back on my time in the industry and at Moy Park, I’ve always started each morning the same way, and I think it has stood me in good stead!\n  \nThe first thing I think of is ‘today will bring a new challenge, a new opportunity and I will most likely learn something new’ as every day is a school day!”\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_995387.jpg--.jpg?1535635242000\n","title":"superb gcse results for dunclug college","story":"  \nDUNCLUG College is celebrating historic levels of achievement at GCSE level. \n  \nAll students, including those with ious learning challenges sat a minimum of 7 GCSE subjects, including the compulsory core of English, Maths and Science and a range of GCSE optional choices in a balance of General and Applied courses.\n  \n Many gifted and competitive students sat 8, 9 or 10 subjects. The overall result for GCSE English for the whole cohort was 80% in the A – C range, with the overall Mathematics result being almost 60%: in each case this represented the best outcomes in the school’s history. \n  \nOverall, almost 80% of students achieved 5 or more subjects in the A – C range with almost 60% achieving this standard inclusive of English and Maths. This significantly exceeds the National and Northern Ireland averages and places our school and is testimony to the success which can be attained at a non-selective school. \n  \n Many factors contribute to such success, not least the support of parents, the commitment of students and the motivational teaching which is inspirational yet grounded, and which proves that high expectations enable students to push boundaries and indeed predictions. \n  \nSubjects which achieved the outstanding success rate of 100% of pupils gaining Grade C or better were as follows: Art, Construction, Media Studies, Double Award Science, Occupational Studies, Further Maths, Prince’s Trust, Agriculture \u0026amp Community Sport. Other high achieving subjects included: Applied Business 70%, English 80%, English Literature 92%, Engineering 70%, French 75%, Geography 79%, ICT 70%, Single Award Science 78%, Technology \u0026amp Design 91%, Drama 91%, Music 82%, BTEC Sport 91%\n  \nThe Principal noted that amongst the numerous excellent combinations of grades were children with special educational needs, and many personal best achievements. It was also very encouraging to note that 96% of all students in the year group achieved at least 5 grades in the A – E range.\n  \nCongratulations to top achievers: Kirsten McLeister - 5 A* and 3A, Craig Francey - 4A*, 4A, 1B and 1C and Charlotte McKay 1A*, 4A, 2B and 1C.\n  \nOther students with a profile of A - C grades in eight or more subjects included: Stuart Adams, Tori Agnew, Chloe Bleakley, Alan Clarke, Daniel Compton, Megan Davison, Laura Du Bois Pidgeon, Amy Ewart, Joy Forsythe, Rachel Greer, Abigail Harris, Timothy Hill, Korben Houston, Lynn Hughes, Deanna Johnston, Jamie Knox, Danielle Mahaffy, Tamzin McClenaghan, Adam McConnell, Grace McCullough, Emma McDowell, Thomas McFall, Megan McKay, Luke Neeson, Robbie O’Neill, Aimee Penney, David Saunderson, Chad Shaw, Joshua Shaw, Robyn Telford, Charlotte Waide, James Warwick, Leah Young. This, in addition to the list of students, too numerous to list, who achieved 7 top grades.\n  \nInterviews are currently underway at the College for Sixth Form places and/or advice for students on the next steps in their learning. Applications are also welcome from students from other schools.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

grateful family of a Ballymoney schoolboy whose life was saved by his older brother\u0027s bone marrow have spoken publicly for the first time.\nA year after seven-year-old Caden Moore received a transplant at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children from his 11-year-old brother Ben their proud mother Sabrina has agreed to share their inspiring story.\nSabrina and her husband Bryan are hoping their unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Register.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Chronicle, teacher Sabrina said: It\u0027s been the toughest year of our lives but what a difference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such life-changing procedures in the same hospital, on the same day, is something we could never have imagined. Caden is improving every day and Ben has never looked back. We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus      return false     else if        your_email.focus      return false     else if        friends_name.focus      return false     else if        friends_email.focus      return false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random return false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n       .ready .click .hide          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.fadeIn          return false                .click .parents.fadeOut          return false                    */       ]]\n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n                           username.focus            return false           else if              password.focus            return false           else                      ]]\n      \n      \"\n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n               return false\" title=\"View The Leader online!\"\n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n banner\" title=\"Advertise with Us\" /\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n          ?

We have come close in the past, making it to the quarter-finals and the semi-finals, so to go one better this season is a great feeling.\n\u0026#8220There is a real buzz and a belief in the team that we can go and win the Irish Cup in our first final.\n\u0026#8220We have gone up against teams from all over the Province this season to get to the final.\n\u0026#8220We didn\u0027t know too much about any of them, they were all an unknown quantity, but we played to our strengths and we have been rewarded.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus      return false     else if        your_email.focus      return false     else if        friends_name.focus      return false     else if        friends_email.focus      return false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random return false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n       .ready .click .hide          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.fadeIn          return false                .click .parents.fadeOut          return false                    */       ]]\n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n                           username.focus            return false           else if              password.focus            return false           else                      ]]\n      \n      \"\n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n               return false\" title=\"View The Leader online!\"\n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n banner\" title=\"Advertise with Us\" /\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n          ?

The Ballymoney man lost his father, Mervyn Robinson, to the\u0026#160 North West 200 in 1980, while in July his cousin, William Dunlop, was killed during free practice at the Skerries 100 near Dublin.\nAll of these setbacks forced a re-think, says Robinson. My main reason for quitting the sport was my wee boy, Max, he told Chronicle Sport.\n\u0026#8220Road racing is getting very dangerous and there have been too many accidents recently, so I\u0027m not prepared to take the chance any more.\n\u0026#8220My main fear is getting caught up in something outside of my control like, like an accident happening in front of me, or a bike seizing or something.\n\u0026#8220William\u0027s death affected me big time, to be honest I felt like packing it in immediately.\n\u0026#8220The\u0026#160 circumstances surrounding William\u0027s death were just awful. The fact he left behind a\u0026#160 young daughter and Janine [his partner] had a second baby on the way made it so horrible for us all to deal with.\n\u0026#8220I thought about it and I decided I wanted to do myself some justice and finish off the season before calling it a day.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus      return false     else if        your_email.focus      return false     else if        friends_name.focus      return false     else if        friends_email.focus      return false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random return false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field -

outside belfast to pay 17 more for gas","story":"\nTowns outside Belfast will be paying 17% more for gas prices following Firmus Energy\u0026#8217s tariff hike next month.\n\n                \nTen Town areas include Craigavon, Antrim, Armagh, Ballymena, Ballymoney, Banbridge, Coleraine, Limavady, Derry/Londonderry and Newry.\n\n\n\nThis is a further blow for consumers\n\nThe Consumer Council\n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nFirmus Energy is to increase gas prices by 12% in the Ten Towns area from 1 October 2018. The Consumer Council has branded the increase ‘unwelcome’ and called for more gas licence holders to enter the market so create more competition.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe council is urging the 38,000 natural gas domestic and business customers to consider ways to save on household energy bills.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nAn annual bill for a typical Firmus Energy customer in the Ten Towns areas using 12,000 kWh on a Pay As You Go meter will increase from £594 to £666, an increase of £72. Whereas the annual bill for a typical Firmus Energy customer in the Greater Belfast area using 12,000 kWh on a Pay As You Go meter will increase from £539 to £604, an increase of £65.\n\nGas prices in Ten Towns will be around 17% more expensive than Belfast, based on SSE Airtricity’s Pay As You Go tariff.\n\n“This is a further blow for consumers following recent electricity tariff increases by the three largest electricity suppliers in Northern Ireland,” said a NI Consumer Council spokesperson.\n\nRichard Williams, Head of Energy Policy at The Consumer Council, said: “This is unwelcome news for Firmus Energy customers, following a 6.8% increase in the Ten Towns area earlier this year. However, we are aware the main driver is the significant rise in global gas costs since the tariff was last set in April. From 1 October, the annual bill for a typical Firmus Energy customer in Ten Towns will increase by £72 a year to £666. It is the sole supplier of gas in the Ten Towns. We would like to see other gas licence holders enter the market so that consumers there can benefit from competition.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8628181.1536329418!/image/image.jpg","title":"candlelight vigil in memory of cameron truesdale","story":"\nA candlelight vigil is to be held in Waringstown tomorrow night  in memory of Cameron Truesdale.\n\n                \nThe teenager  died on Wednesday night after a 20-month battle with cancer.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe vigil will begin at 8pm in Waringstown Park, in the village near Lurgan.

After the Act of Remembrance, Bro Ward laid a wreath at the Herron family memorial plaque which was unveiled on the boundary wall of Dromore Orange Hall in April 2016 and is the only tangible memorial in Dromore to the history of the Troubles.  \n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nTown draper, William Herron , his wife Elizabeth  and daughter Noeline  died in the blaze after an incendiary device was planted in their Market Square drapery store in April 1976. The fire destroyed much of the shop and the family home above it, where the three victims died from suffocation. Bro William Herron was a member of Closkelt LOL 415 in Rathfriland District LOL No 3.\n\n* A series of commemorative events also took place across Northern Ireland last weekend as the Institution marked its inaugural Orange Victims Day. The Loyal Order formally remember the 335 Orangemen and one Orangewoman murdered by terrorists during the Troubles. The day, which will become an annual event, also highlighted the ongoing plight of the injured and bereaved.\n\n\n   \n                 .

This borough has given so much to me over the years and I am thankful to everybody who has helped me throughout my rugby career so far.\n\n “I would like to thank the council for considering me for this honour and for arranging today’s very special event. I have had the privilege to take part in some memorable sporting occasions and today’s will live long in the memory with the best of them.”\n\n Earlier in the day Rory attended a special Festival of Rugby held at City of Armagh Rugby Club made up of teams from clubs across the borough including Banbridge RFC, Dromore RFC, Lurgan RFC, Portadown RFC and City of Armagh RFC, as well as rugby neighbours Dungannon RFC and Monaghan RFC.  Portadown Panthers opened the festival with an exhibition game of tag rugby, of which Rory is the club patron.\n\n Lord Mayor Julie Flaherty said: “Today has been a real celebration of Rory Best’s sporting achievements and the contribution he makes to our borough. He thoroughly deserves the Freedom of the Borough honour and we could ask for no better example for our young people to follow, both on and off the pitch.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n “The fantastic turnout from the world of provincial and international rugby is testament to the regard with which Rory is held in the professional game, as are the tributes from some of the stalwarts of the game.”\n\n Dr Rory Best OBE received the Freedom of the Borough of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon in recognition of his outstanding sporting achievements of a local man who was raised and educated in Poyntzpass and went to Tandragee Junior High and Portadown College. He played rugby for Banbridge and his wife Jodie teaches in The Armstrong Primary School, Armagh.\n\n Rory has won a raft of honours in the rugby world, including captaining Ulster, Ireland and the British and Irish Lions earning more than 100 caps for Ireland and more than 200 for Ulster leading Ireland to a third Grand Slam and Triple Crown in 2018 also leading Ireland to historic wins over the New Zealand All Blacks, South Africa and Australia and being part of the Ulster side which reached a Heineken Cup final in 2012.\n\n As part of the Freedom of the Borough celebrations, some of Rory’s most memorable items from his playing career are on display in a special exhibition in the Archbishop’s Palace in Armagh\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nItems on display include the match ball from the Ireland rugby team’s historic win over the New Zealand All Blacks in Chicago in 2016 Rory’s shirt from the Six Nations Championship Grand Slam winning game against England in 2018 the boots worn by the hooker on his 200th cap for Ulster in 2017 and his captain’s shirt from the Lions game against the Chiefs on the tour of New Zealand in 2017.\n\nThe exhibition is open until Sunday, September 16 from 10am to 5pm and 7pm to 9pm on weekdays and 2pm to 5pm at weekends, it will be closed on Saturday 8th September and Wednesday 12th September.

A further 1,492 names appear to be duplicates, meaning ‘when an individual has multiple regiments, or units on their Record of Service. \n\nThe Coroner’s Office had been attempting to trace former soldiers who may have  been in Ballymurphy during the three days in August 1971 when ten people were shot dead and one died of a heart attack.\nHowever, just days before the inquest was due to begin into the killings 47-year-ago the database containing nearly 5,000 names landed on the Coroner’s desk.\n\nSpeaking to the Andersonstown News Ballymurphy Massacre Families spokesperson John Teggart said: “Six working days before the start of our inquest and they  send this letter, this has been done before with the recent UVF story to attempt to delay our inquest.\n\n“Vital inquest resources are being used up here and that shouldn’t be happening, these stunts are nothing but a waste of time. We would now ask for more resources to be released on the back of this. All they  are attempting to do here is swamp the system days before we are due in court.\n\n“The families are devastated, we were and still are working towards this date, the Coroner  has been very focused in the lead up to this, she is now obliged to look at this list. We hope that it can be done in a speedy fashion.\n\n“We were prepared, we knew it wouldn’t be straight forward, when you’re working with the MoD the resources they have and the dirty deals they’ve been up to all along are well known. They’ve been sitting on their hands this entire time probably thinking they’d pull a stunt like this closer to the time [of the inquest], but to do it six days beforehand is utterly despicable.”\n\nMr Teggart continued: “Sure look at the UVF stunt a while ago, that was done to take the focus off the Paras and the Queen’s [regiment] another dirty tactic and I’d be confident that the MoD had a hand in it. \n\n“The UVF certainly weren’t out to help us that time and now the MoD have decided to swamp the inquest.”\n\nDiscussing what now needs to happen Mr Teggart said: “We need to remain focused and keep on track, we’ve had setbacks before and we’ve dealt with them, we will certainly deal with this one.\n\n“I hope there will be no delay we have a preliminary hearing on Thursday, the Coroner is demanding an explanation, she wants to know why this database has suddenly turned up and rightly so. \n\n“Our inquest is set to last 3-4 months, hopefully this database can be looked at in line with this time-frame so we aren’t setback.\n\n“When we were given a date for our inquest 18 months ago we clapped in the court, that’s unheard of. You now have good, independent people within the courts, the MoD have seen this so the only way they could try and delay this is with the dirty deals that they are doing now. \n\n“Bottom line is, the families are ready to go, the Coroner is ready to go, all the work’s done, the schedule has been set out, justice needs to be served.\u0026#8221\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37277587.ece/7350a/AUTOCROP/w300square/LMB_20180901_05_126.jpg","title":"belfast telegraph readers enjoy european heritage open days photos","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It definitely can be done economically. \n\n\"There is concern about the cost of the project, but you know what they say you can have three economists you’d have four conclusions.  \n\n\"There are opinions either way about whether it can stack up or not.\"\n\nAt the conference Professor Dunlop also released the first artist impression of what the bridge might look like. \n\n\n\n\nWhy £15bn bridge to Scotland could be the answer to Brexit conundrum\n\n\n\n\n\nBoris Johnson backs bridge linking Northern Ireland and Scotland\n\n\n\n\nThe catalyst for the proposed bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland came from a speech made by Boris Johnson in January 2018 while he was the Foreign Secretary, in which he floated the idea of a 22-mile bridge across the English Channel to France - something he said would improve transport links after Brexit. \n\nProfessor Dunlop said the proposal wasn\u0027t feasible as the stretch between the United Kingdom and France is one of the busiest shipping channels in the world, but was asked shortly afterwards by Scottish newspaper The National if a similar project between Scotland and Northern Ireland was a possibility. \n\nHe laid out two proposals for the route - one from Larne and Portpatrick  or a crossing between the Mull of Kintyrne and Torr Head .\n\n\"One haulier I was speaking to was making dozens of trips across from Northern Ireland to Scotland every year and the cost of that was £600 each time. So when you take personalised stories like this you can see how the financial benefit would add up,\" Professor Dunlop said. \n\nThe proposal received a boost in March after a spokesman for the Scottish Government said it would \"initiate discussions to explore improving connectivity\" between the island of Ireland and Scotland, adding it was important \"that all options are fully considered\" \n\nDUP leader Arlene Foster and MP Sammy Wilson have both previously voiced their support for the project.  \n\nThe idea was also supported by former Foreign Secretary, who has called for it to be considered \"seriously\".  \n"},{"url":null,"title":"european heritage open days history opens up to northern ireland public","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

To take the challenge visit discovernorthernireland/loveheritage\n\nTo inspire those interested in exploring their cultural heritage journey this coming weekend, here is a list of just some of the quirky culture and hidden heritage that exists right here on Northern Ireland’s doorstep:\n\n\nDid you know…\n\n\nAntrim: The historic village of Gracehill was a settlement founded by the Moravians in 1765 and Northern Ireland’s First Conservation area. For Moravians, the burial ground was known as \"Gods Acre\" and had a strict layout. Men were buried to the left and women to the right of a central path. All the headstones were of the same shape and design - the Moravians believe that everyone is equal in death - and were laid almost flat on the ground.\n\nBelfast: Next door to the Belfast Harbour Commissioner\u0027s Office you will find Sinclair Seamen’s Church, a unique maritime-inspired church. Built in 1853 as a tribute to the city\u0027s seafaring traditions, its interior features a pulpit shaped like a ship\u0027s prow, the bell from 19th Century-built battleship HMS Hood and lifeboat-shaped collection boxes.\n\nDown: Grey Abbey is the oldest example of Gothic architecture in Ireland founded in 1193 by John De Courcy. In the 17th century the abbey ruins were acquired by the Montgomery family, who still live in the grounds to this day.\n\nFermanagh: Enniskillen is Ireland’s only island town and Castle Coole is regarded as the finest country house in Ireland. The house itself has no back door which is said to be a deliberate omission in order to discourage salesmen from calling.\n\nTo find out more about the list of those properties open in your area for European Heritage Open Days 2018 and to get involved visit \nwww.discovernorthernireland/events/European-Heritage-Open-Days/\n.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"gregory campbell calls for removal of sectarian graffiti near site of greysteel massacre","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

markings read \u0027Prods Out\u0027, \u0027FIRA\u0027, and \u0027GAA\u0027. \n\nEast Londonderry MP Mr Campbell said the graffiti was \"not only sinister but blatantly sectarian\" and said he had requested to have it \"removed by the Department for Infrastructure as quickly as possible\". \n\n\"Its location is only a short distance from the Rising Sun bar in Greysteel where next month the 25th anniversary of the murder of eight people will occur,\" he said. \n\n\"Such graffiti is totally inappropriate at any location or time, but given the sensitivities of the location it should be removed as a matter of urgency.\n\nThe Greysteel massacre was a mass shooting which took place on October 30, 1993 in Greysteel, Co Derry in which eight people were killed and 19 were injured. \n\nIt was carried out by the UDA in retaliation for the bombing of a chip shop on Belfast\u0027s Shankill Road. \n\nMr Campbell went on to urge representative from Sinn Fein and the SDLP to condemn the graffiti. \n\nIt is unclear what FIRA could refer to, but could possibly be a misspelling of  \u0027SF/IRA\u0027 or \u0027PIRA\u0027. \n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts travel

almost 3m more than he paid for it in 2013.\n\nBuilt in 2010, the sun-soaked deluxe pad boasts six bedrooms, a fully-equipped gym, nine bathrooms, a swimming pool and a private jetty that serves a nearby lake.\n\nThe 10,500sq ft home has been tastefully decorated in greys and beige, with a pool table in one of the leisure rooms.\n\nThere\u0027s even a putting green in the grounds where the Holywood-born golfer could take out the clubs and get in a little after-hours practice if the mood took him.\n\nRory and his American wife Erica Stoll - who hails from the same area of Palm Beach where the house was sold - have now moved into a new home once owned by golf legend Ernie Els in nearby Jupiter.\n\nRory and Erica married in April last year at Ashford Castle in Cong, Co Mayo.\n\nThe couple first met when the stunning New Yorker was working manager of championship volunteer operations for the Professional Golf Association of America.\n\nShe famously woke McIlroy up after he had slept in during the Ryder Cup in 2012.\n\nThe new owner of the former McIlroy mansion, which the golfer originally paid £7.2m for, has not been revealed.\n\nIn 2013, McIlroy sold a five-bedroom house with its own golf driving range and putting green at Moneyreagh, Co Down, for £2m. \n\nThe 14-acre estate also boasted five bedrooms and a gymnasium.\n\nIn 2014 the golfer bought a property in Holywood through Simon Brien Residential estate agents.\n\nHe also snapped up a three-storey building there, described as having been sub-divided into five apartments.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"test shows some northern ireland meat had up to four animals in it","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

tests on meat from Northern Ireland, England and Wales 145 were partly or wholly made up of unspecified meat. \n\nSome samples contained DNA from up to four different animals and others contained no meat from animals that were advertised. \n\nLamb was the meat mostly likely to be contaminated, followed by beef and goat, while cow DNA was the most commonly found contaminant in other meat.  \n\nMince meat as the most commonly contaminated product followed by sausages, kebabs and restaurant curries.\n\nSamples came from 487 different locations including restaurants and supermarkets.\n\nA number of the samples came from Northern Ireland.\n\nThe BBC revealed that 73 of the contaminated samples came from retailers across three supermarkets. 50 samples came from restaurants and 22 from food manufacturing or processing plants.\n\nOstrich DNA was found in one of the samples.\n\nThe majority of samples were tested for common food DNA such as cow, pig, sheep, goat, horse, chicken and turkey.\n\nThe FSA said that other animal DNA could have been prevent but not identified during testing as it was not being looked for.\n\nLocal authorities gathered the samples from businesses before sending them for analysis, this data was then sent to the FSA.\n\nThe FSA said that the level of contamination present suggested it was deliberate, with over 1% of a animal\u0027s DNA counting as deliberate. \n\nHowever the FSA said the results were \"not representative of the wider food industry\".\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37289182.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/freederrycorner.jpg","title":"trust apologises after pink free derry wall for organ donor

It would be hilarious but for the money involved and the questions it raises about competence, cronyism and ethical behaviour at the highest levels of government. \n\nWe had allegations that former minister Jonathan Bell had tried to break his spad\u0027s finger and swung a punch at him. We heard that his former spad Timothy Cairns told him \"Listen to me, big b***s\" during a row witnessed by senior civil servants. \n\nThere were lurid suggestions of sexual misconduct made about two of Mr Bell\u0027s ministerial colleagues. \n\nThere was evidence that Mr Bell was unable to adequately discharge his duties the morning after a late night in New York. \n\nThere were claims that Mr Cairns answered to other spads rather than his ministerial boss and that some of them had families who stood to gain from RHI. \n\nAll this, before we even consider Mr Bell alleging that the Executive\u0027s spin doctor David Gordon characterised him as a \"monster\" who needed to be put to sleep and that a senior journalist was advising the DUP about how to attack him. \n\nThe former permanent secretary of his department stated that colleagues at Invest NI had complained of Minister Bell\u0027s \"limited contribution to Northern Ireland\u0027s interests regarding foreign direct investment and trade\" and the risk of him \"making inappropriate or unhelpful comments\".\n\nAfter a trade delegation he was due to lead to the US on St Patrick\u0027s Day was dropped, it was further stated that he delayed providing routine information to OfM/DfM and travel authorisation for Invest NI staff out of pique. \n\nMost of those settling in to watch the live feed were expecting to hear a Northern Irish version of Yes Minister. What they got sounded more like a particularly fractious episode of the Jeremy Kyle Show with the DUP family at war. \n\nDuring the hearing it appeared that Mr Bell\u0027s memory of key events and grasp of detail is far from perfect, that he made secret recordings of conversations with civil servants and party colleagues, and that spads rather than he made key decisions. \n\nRegardless of the veracity of any of the claims, the rest of us are left wondering about the ethics and integrity of those who govern us. \n\nSadly, the civil service does not emerge well either. \n\nThe people running the RHI scheme appeared not to be able to spot basic flaws. The unit was under-resourced, no staff had specialist knowledge of a complex field and personnel changes meant that there was no continuity as the crisis unfolded. \n\nMost people will be shocked and bewildered by all of this. Of course, the media can distort and sensationalise stories. But this one gets worse if you follow the live coverage and read all the documents. \n\nWe have no government. But if and when we do, there is no case for dancing in the streets. \n\nCivil servants and ministers will have much to prove. We need to trust that civil servants have the competence to manage large budgets, ministers the ability to lead them, and that unelected party officials are controlled by ministers, not the other way around. Until that confidence is restored, providing Stormont with yet more power would be unthinkable. \n\nNick Garbutt runs Nick Garbutt PR\n"},{"url":null,"title":"prayer groups bid to use council chamber rejected","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

But the particular use that it is requested for doesn\u0027t to me fit in with that.\"\n\nHe warned that if the prayer group gained access it could open the door to other uses \"that we might actually not deem appropriate\".\n\nCouncillor Paul Reid of the DUP said: \"As one who is a minister of religion I would encourage people to pray. \n\n\"It is a good thing to talk to God in prayer but I do not believe this chamber is the place where people ought to be praying for a number of reasons.\"\n\nHe said there were other parts of the building which could be used as \"a quiet place of reflection\".\n\nUlster Unionist representative Stephen Nicholl said: \"I don\u0027t think there has to be a specific place in which to pray. Anywhere is suitable for prayer. \n\n\"I think perhaps the attention is because of the work that we do here. Asking for assistance through prayer certainly would, on some of the later nights, be useful.\"\n\nHe added: \"If we say this is a political chamber then we determine that everything else is outside. \n\n\"Once we change that definition then we cannot stop anybody or anything going on in this chamber under the current equality legislation.\"\n\nCouncillor Timothy Gaston of the TUV said ratepayers had paid for the facilities and should be able to use them.\n\nHe said: \"We shouldn\u0027t be closing the chamber off to anybody. \n\n\"We should be opening it up for anybody to come in and view them and use it for whatever they can.\"\n\nA total of 24 councillors out of 32 present voted for the group to use another part of the building.\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article35627921.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/global1.jpg","title":"family of danielle mclaughlin to meet taoiseach after letter saying she is not an irish citizen","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Freedom as a political party in the Republic with the aim of taking the country out of the European Union, and added such a scenario could be one way of avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland.  \n\n\n\n [0]if  returnjs = d.createElement js.id = idjs.src = \u0027https:connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1\u0026version=v3.1\u0027fjs.parentNode.insertBefore\n\n\nPosted by

Elections. \n\nIn its programme it pledges to support \"reunited and independent Ireland under the control of the Irish people\". \n\nThe party\u0027s other objectives also focus on protection for the Irish language and support of \"stable families for procreation\". \n\nIn a country where more than two thirds of people have a positive view of the European Union, the group could face an uphill battle for support. \n\nAmid chaotic negotiations between Brussels and London on the future of the UK\u0027s relationship with the EU, support in the Republic for the EU grew by around 5% over the past year, according to recent polling data. \n"},{"url":null,"title":"secretary of states announcement of civil servant decisions is of greater significance","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo

Of much greater significance than the cash crowd-pleaser was the Secretary of State\u0027s announcement of legislation to allow civil servants to take the decisions MLAs ought to be making.\n\nIndirect rule.\n\nIf I was a civil servant I\u0027d be asking for a cut of the £13,000 being taken from one of those poor MLAs. Civil servants will soon be effectively moonlighting as Executive ministers. And we all thought double-jobbing had ended.\n\nBradley\u0027s actions are an obvious attempt to keep Stormont open as a bit more than a tourist attraction.\n\nAllowing civil servants to make decisions avoids the dreaded direct rule label. It keeps alive the possibility of a return to devolved government until there really does have to be an election, in 2022. \n\nAnd even then, we could have a fantasy election to an Assembly that doesn\u0027t exist: 2003 all over again. Rule by civil service decree is profoundly undemocratic. Those elected by no-one will be making important decisions that affect everyone.\n\nGovernance transfers to the unelected and unaccountable. The main means of citizen redress will be via the courts. \u0027First Minister Sterling\u0027 - a job he does not seek and in which he ought not to be placed - will take decisions without democratic mandate.\n\nWhether the quality of civil service rule will improve matters is unclear. A fair chunk of the RHI evidence suggests a body struggling with the complexities of the legislation - even if it ought to have been mainly a cut-and-paste from the Westminster model - and failing to warn hapless ministers as trouble developed.\n\nIn its defence, the civil service appeared short-staffed and overworked - problems now multiplied several-fold by the Secretary of State\u0027s promise of more roles.\n\nThe costs of a full Assembly dissolution would be personal as well as political. When the Assembly was created in 1998-99, it was not the main source of livelihood for many MLAs. Few had expected its formation and many had other jobs.\n\nAfter years of relative stability from 2007-16, it has become the main source of income for most members .\n\nSo sympathy is due to those MLAs who are blameless in the institutional collapse and diligent in their constituency duties. As my Liverpool colleague Sean Haughey has shown in the Journal of Legislative Studies, MLAs spend a big proportion of their work  on constituency activity. \n\nThere\u0027s also much to be said for working from home. But when the university term starts, I wouldn\u0027t get 35p let alone £35K for long if I played truant. And members of a legislative assembly need to be just that.\n\nReducing salaries can concentrate minds but not change them. It may make MLAs thrifty with the weekly shopping but paying people £13,000 less will not alter their views on an Irish Language Act, same-sex marriage, abortion, Brexit, blame for RHI, whatever. \n\nUltimately political will not fiscal rectitude will determine the Assembly\u0027s future. There remains the strong suspicions that the DUP is, for now, comfortable with political arrangements - no worries for the DUP nine, erstwhile 10, given their prospering at Westminster - whilst Northern Ireland\u0027s institutions are not Sinn Fein\u0027s ultimate concern anyway.\n\nLogically, there is no reason why the Assembly cannot be reconstituted to deal with schools, hospitals and other matters, even if its members are still arguing over the dead-end of identity politics and wrestling over social issues. \n\nAn incremental way forward would be for the Assembly to revive but confine legislation initially to agreed ring-fenced issues - baby steps back to the full model. But don\u0027t expect anything prior to the RHI verdict anyway. \n\nPublic support for the Assembly - but not the current fake one - remains high, despite the cynicism over MLA pay. Credible immediate alternatives remain in short supply. \n\nDirect rule? Non-runner for nationalists. \n\nTransfer of powers to local councils? 11 mini-Stormonts. \n\nJoint authority or unity? Unionist uproar. \n\nAt its brief best, the Assembly was passing nearly as much legislation as its counterparts in Scotland and Wales. Yesterday\u0027s nod towards a \u0027pay-per-legislation\u0027 model will not, alone, restore its fortunes, but at least a potential Guinness World Record - for Secretary of State indecision - has been avoided - for now. \n\nJon Tonge is Professor of Politics at the University of Liverpool\n"},{"url":null,"title":"heres what its like to be really really attractive","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

We used to be a very calm nation. And today I feel a bit insecure about the future, especially for my children\nVoter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n“Terrible! I just wanna cry when I think about it,” said Veronica Lundqvist, referring to the Sweden Democrats after she left a voting booth in central Stockholm.\n\n“They say awful things. I mean of course we have a lot of refugees here, but we need to take care of them.\n\n“They come from a terrible place, terrible wars. We can’t just throw them out.”\n\nBut others say the Sweden Democrats are trying to fix a historical problem.\n\n“It’s an integration issue,” Karl Ljung said at the same voting station.\n\n“It’s not just about what happened two years ago when we had a lot of refugees. It’s more that we have had an integration issue for maybe 20 years. So we really have to solve it now.”\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nJan Bjorklund, leader of the Liberal Party, arrives at a polling station in Stockholm \n\n\n\n\nMohamed Nuur, a 26-year-old Social Democratic candidate of Somali descent, said he sees Mr Akesson taking Sweden back to the past.\n\n“For me, the Sweden that he  wants to see… that is not our future,” Mr Nuur said.\n\n“That is to go back in history. For me, when he is saying that immigrants are not welcome to Sweden… he is trying to spread hate between the people.\n\n“Actually, it’s the immigrants who built up this country.”\n\nSecurity was another key election issue. Citizens expressed concerns about reports of an increase in crimes such as rape and gang violence.\n\nSabina Macri, voting in central Stockholm, said the current political situation has left her questioning her future in Sweden.\n\n“We used to be very safe. We used to be a very calm nation,” she said.\n\n“And today I feel a bit insecure about the future, especially for my children. We have two girls.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"bonkers conkers people derry urged keep eyes signs autumn summer heat wave","story":"\nA nature charity has asked the people of Derry to help it collect data on the changing seasons.\n\nSchools across the city have reopened their doors, but a traditional childhood favourite – the conker – is missing from the trees.\n\nThe Woodland Trust claims the sizzling summer heatwave and prolonged drought has caused a delay in ripe conkers appearing on our trees.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, while there have been some sightings of aspiring conkers – the familiar spiny green husks hiding in the branches – no records of ripe conkers have been received.  They’re easy to spot as the horse chestnut will drop the conkers to the ground naturally when they are ripe.\n\nBy recording natural seasonal sings – that’s the first signs of spring and autumn – members of the public are helping to show how climate change is affecting UK plants and wildlife.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nThe charity is appealing for more people across Northern Ireland to take part in its online project, as records here are relatively scarce.\nMartha Boalch, citizen science officer for the Woodland Trust, says: “We’d really love local people to take part in Nature’s Calendar, so that we can get an accurate picture of how the seasons unfold right across the UK.  And keeping your eyes peeled for conkers is a great place to start.  I’m sure the kids will agree!\n\n“This year’s unusual weather, with a prolonged lack of water, could have delayed the horse chestnut trees producing their fruit and could stop them from growing to their full potential.\n\n“Although we’ve only had a small number of conkers recorded so far, all is not lost for our favourite sign of autumn!  Over the next month we would expect more fruit to ripen, but only time will tell whether it will be a plentiful, or disappointing, crop.”\n\nTo find out more about Nature’s Calendar and to become a recorder, visit naturescalendar.woodlandtrust.org.uk\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"dong kids youth events centre derrys culture night celebrations","story":"\nPicture: Local young people pictured at the Nerve Centre where you can witness a one of a kind live recording session where three local young bands will record two original tracks each, crafting a record in the flesh from 6pm - 9pm on Culture Night.\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"huge day fundraising events kicks off aid altnagelvins neo natal unit","story":"\nA bumper day of fundraising events is currently underway in aid of Altnagelvin Hospital\u0027s Neo Natal Intensive Care Unit.\n\nThe Tattoo Lounge in Rathmor Business Park is holding a charity tattoo event and family fun day.\n\nThe Tattoo spaces are now fully booked, however there may be a small number of cancelations.\n\nThere will be a big display of custom motorcycles on show hosted by the Exiles RC and guests from the Dead Society MCC this morning at the Tattoo Lounge.\n\nThe family fun day is also underway with live music from local musicians.

after leaflets were delivered to householders living in the university area of the city advising residents there will be wardens active in the area tasked with dealing specifically with issues involving students’ ‘anti-community activity’.\n\nThe leaflet was issued by the Sinn Féin councillor for the area, Mickey Cooper.\n\nIn the wake of the leaflet drop, Derry Now spoke to residents living in the area about the issue of students and anti-social behaviour.\n\nHowever, many of the residents claimed that incidents related to noise or anti-social behaviour from students living in the area had significantly decreased, which they attributed to ‘dwindling numbers’ of student admissions at Magee University.\n\nDerry Now contacted Ulster University, who confirmed that there had been a ‘decline in overall admissions’ at the Magee campus.\n\nA university spokesperson said that in the past two years, the number of admissions had dropped by 172.\n\n“As part of our commitment to our multi-campus operation we balance student numbers across all campuses,” the spokesperson said\n\n“Full time undergraduate student places at Ulster University, for students from Northern Ireland and

work through our confirmation and clearing period to provide educational opportunities to new students on a wide range of programmes on the Magee campus.\n\n“Our plans for our Magee campus and the city are ambitious.\n\n“The recent opening of the £11million teaching block is a major boost for our staff and current students and also paves the way for enhanced future capacity on the Magee campus in line with our broader expansion plans.”\n\nDisciplinary action\n\nIn relation to the issue of anti-social behaviour in and around the university area, the spokesperson said such incidents would not be tolerated.\n\nAn Ulster University spokesperson said: “Ulster University is proud of our role in the community and the positive contribution our talented students make to society, but we do not tolerate anti-social behaviour and have robust disciplinary processes in place to deal with any incidences, as and when they are reported to us.\n\n“We will be working with students from the start of the academic term to underline the impact of anti-social behaviour, both on the local community and on future career prospects.\n\n“We work closely with the PSNI on a range of initiatives who also join us each year in giving presentations to our students on the consequences of anti-social behaviour.\n\n“We will fully investigate all reports made to us by the authorities and begin disciplinary action where we have the necessary evidence to do so.”\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"new multi disciplinary gp service create 200","story":"\nDerry has been announced as one of two areas in the north to benefit from multi-disciplinary teams at its GP practices which will create two hundred new jobs in the city.\n\nIt has been described as a ‘new era’ in GP care placing the city will be at the forefront of the ‘major transformative initiative’, according to the Department of Health.\n\nHealth and Social Care Trusts are working with GP Federations to start the recruitment processes for 200 new posts in Derry, with the new services expected to become available in the coming months.\n\nMulti-Disciplinary Teams  involve the establishment of practice-based physiotherapists, mental health specialists and social workers at GP practices - working alongside doctors and nurses to better meet the needs of the local population.\n\nThe Department of Health said the model includes significant investment in additional nursing specialist roles such as health visiting and district nursing.\n\nIt aims to provide care closer to people’s homes and improve access times and will also see practice teams supported to identify opportunities for early intervention.\n\nPatients will be supported in managing long-term conditions and dealing with lifestyle issues which can impact on their health.\n\nThe Derry GP Federation area covers in the region of 200,000 patients and includes Derry, Claudy, Limavady and Strabane.\n\nThe Department of Health announced the MDT initiative in May as part of a £15m transformation fund allocation to primary care.\n\nThe Department’s Permanent Secretary Richard Pengelly today said: “This is a very important step forward in the transformation journey.\n\n“I look forward to MDTs being extended to other GP federations in the years ahead.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build

system focussed on physical, mental and social wellbeing rather than just managing ill-health - with a greater focus placed on prevention and early intervention.”\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCommunities\n\n\nSinn Féin Health Spokesperson Patricia Logue has welcomed the first stage of the £15m programme.\n\n“This is a very important part of the transformation agenda identified within the Bengoa report and which was begun by the then Health Minister Michelle O’Neill,” she said.\n\n“This is the direction of travel which healthcare must go in and the introduction of this scheme is tangible evidence of the transformation agenda now beginning to be rolled out within the health and social care service.”\n\nMeanwhile, Foyle DUP MLA Gary Middleton has welcomed the allocation of £15million secured from the confidence and supply agreement to introduce multi-disciplinary teams to GP surgeries.\n\n“Today the Department for Health has announced a £15million rollout of money secured by the DUP for Health Transformation,” he said.\n\n“GP surgeries in Londonderry and County Down will be the first to benefit from the introduction of multi-disciplinary teams.”\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"tips issued help derry kids avoid dreaded back school germs","story":"\nAs the new school year gets under way, the Public Health Agency  is raising awareness amongst Derry parents about the importance of good hygiene – both in school and at home.\n\n“Schools can be a common breeding ground for germs and bugs so it is important to take steps to reduce the risk of picking up or spreading germs to others,” said Dr Philip Veal, Consultant in Health Protection at the PHA.\n\nParents and schools can help reduce the spread of germs by encouraging kids to practise good personal hygiene by washing hands thoroughly with soap and warm water after using the toilet and before eating.\n\nYou should also make sure your child carries tissues at all times and teach children to cover their nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing and to use a tissue which is disposed of quickly and carefully in a bin\n\nTeach children it is good to share, but not to share drinks, food or lip balm.\n\nMake sure your child receives the free flu vaccine if they are eligible\n\nThe PHA also suggests using an alcohol-based hand gel or wipe when hand washing is not possible, such as at school events or during field trips.\n\nThe spread of infection can also be reduced by thoroughly cleaning lunchboxes each day and supervising children as they regularly clean out their schoolbags. Use a wet cloth or wipe to remove dripped liquids and food crumbs from schoolbags.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nIt is also important to keep children at home from school if they are sick.\n\n“Bugs and germs are often found in school and these can be easily passed from child to child,” said Dr Veal.\n\n“Effective hand washing is one of the most important tools in preventing many illnesses. Clean hands are vital in controlling the spread of infections and other illnesses such as food poisoning and seasonal flu. By following some simple steps we can help to avoid illness.\n\n“A great way for kids to learn about how these infections can spread is using e-Bug, a series of fun online games for primary and secondary school children.\n\nThe resources, which are free and matched to the school curriculum, can allow teachers to work with pupils and play games like the Bogey Bus, Microbe Mania, Kitchen Mayhem and Super Sneezes, learning about the spread of microbes while having fun.\"\n\nFor further information on the seasonal flu vaccine see \nwww.pha.site/fluvaccination\n\n\nFor more info on e-Bug, visit \nwww.e-bug.eu\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"a man from llandrindod wells had his life saved twice in one month by the wales air ambulance in welshpool","story":"\nLeft to right: Pilot, James Benson, pictured alongside Critical Care Practitione\u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gtr Kate Humphries, Gr\u0026ltspan class=truncate-full-screen\u0026gtant Withington and Critical Care Doctor Scott Farmery. \u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8492487/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" height=\"\"\n                                                                                                                        \nA man from Llandrindod Wells had his life saved twice in one month by the Wales Air Ambulance\n\nGrant and his family visiting the Welshpool airbase.

Only five players attended a pre-season meeting and Down took the field for their National League opener with barely 15 players.\n\nHowever, Rooney\u0026rsquos infectious enthusiasm has transformed Down and three months later the girls find themselves preparing for an All-Ireland showdown.\n\nSport is such a conundrum. All who have been involved in sport at any level can testify to the many frustrating and heartbreaking defeats sporadically interrupted by moments of sheer elation.\n\nIt\u0026rsquos these infrequent moments that keep players and coaches going year in year out in search of just one more. A half, a game even a season can be changed on a block, tackle, score or win and the momentum gathered can be infectious.\u0026nbsp\n\nA group, seemingly going nowhere except deeper into the abyss are suddenly galvanised, working for one another as if their lives depended on it. Success is like a lightning bolt. It can strike when you least expect it and you must keep the energy and drive going. You have to strike when the iron is hot.\n\nYet, as we all know, fairy tale endings only become fairy tale endings when the underdog performs to their very best and leaves the field of play with no regrets.\n\nOn their day the Down girls are a match for anyone as they have proved a number of times this year and they have also shown that when their backs are against the wall they can and have turned games around.\u0026nbsp\n\nDown have talented players all over the park. They will be led by Clonduff sisters Sara Louise and Fionnuala Carr, who were both on the side that won the All-Ireland Junior crown at Croke Park in 2014.\n\nThrow in in Bredagh\u0026rsquos Catherine Rocks, Liatroim\u0026rsquos Aimee McAleenan and Dearbhla Magee and you have the nucleus of an attack-minded side.\u0026nbsp\n\nHowever, Portaferry\u0026rsquos twin terrors Niamh Mallon \u0026mdash skipper of the 2014 side \u0026mdash and Saoirse Sands are the jewels in the Down crown and they have the potential to cut any defence to shreds and no better place to do that than Croke Park on Sunday.\n\nThere were plenty of raised eyebrows when Down got the better of Tipperary thanks to a 58th minute goal from Sara Louise Carr to reach the Liberty Insurance All-Ireland Intermediate final for the first time in 20 years.\n\nIt may have been a surprise, but there were indications that the Mourne girls were making real progress as the summer evolved.\n\nAdmittedly, the league was a disaster, as they lost all five outings, but then they got the better of Derry in the Ulster final. They followed that up with a draw against the much-fancied Oak Leafers in the opening round of the All-Ireland Championship.\n\nThat laid the platform for the rest of the campaign and they defeated Laois to bag the runners-up spot in Group 1 behind Cork, who had overcome all before them.\n\nTipperary topped Group 2 and were six points clear at half-time in the semi-final, but with the experiment of deploying Fionnuala Carr at full forward dispensed with, there was an immediate improvement as the Clonduff colossus began to exert greater influence from centre back. Nicole Kelly put the shackles on the dangerous Nicola Treacy too.\n\nMeanwhile, Niamh Mallon was busily keeping the umpire busy as she racked up nine points, seven from placed balls. That brought Down in touch and Sara Louise Carr, who got married earlier this year, pounced for the definitive goal to go with her earlier two points from play.\n\nCork will be desperate to get over the line having lost the last two deciders, including last year\u0026rsquos to Meath after a replay.\u0026nbsp\n\nMuch like their senior counterparts, they have cruised through to the final, finishing the group phase with a positive scoring differential of 65 points, compared to Down\u0026rsquos -2. Indeed, the Rebels were 12-point victors when the teams met in P\u0026aacuteirc Esler in July.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe Leesiders possess a lot of firepower with Finola Neville, Caroline Sugrue and Katelyn Hickey well able to hit the target. Minor star Cliona Healy came off the bench to have a big impact in the semi-final win over Galway, scoring three points in as many minutes soon after her second-half introduction to edge the Leesiders clear and finishing with four.\n\nHealy wasn\u0026rsquot involved when the Leesiders garnered the Division 2 League title, but she and a handful of other colleagues from the All-Ireland-winning Minor Championship side have made the step up and with that sort of ability to be called upon, they will be hard to beat.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Arts Centre launches new programme  ","story":"\t\t\t\nDOWN Arts Centre has announced its latest arts programme.\n\nThe new-look autumn guide, covering September to December, is brimming with a huge range of exhibitions, music, theatre, comedy, talks, classes and workshops.\n\nA ied season of live performances gets off to a comedic start with Owen O\u0026rsquoNeill\u0026rsquos new one man play, \u0026lsquoTen Songs To Die For\u0026rsquo.\u0026nbsp Also billed for the autumn are local comedians Shane Todd with his hilarious brand new stand-up show \u0026lsquoHero\u0026rsquo and Kevin McAleer \u0026mdash a comedy apparition not to be missed.\n\nMusical highlights include celtic and country classics including the Leading Ladies, charismatic singer songwriter Grainne Duffy and the ever popular Illegals with Niamh Kavanagh.\n\nNew to Down Arts Centre is local musician Tony Wright who will provide a unique night of story and song with a killer sound track.\u0026nbsp\n\nAlso not to be missed is The \u0026lsquoLegend of Luke Kelly\u0026rsquo, a spectacular tribute to the greatest folk artist of the 20th century, a definite must-see for all fans.

community service dedicated to eighth century replica monument  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA REPLICA of St Patrick\u0026rsquos Cross at Down Cathedral has been formally unveiled following a cross-community dedication service.\n\nThe replica eighth century cross \u0026mdash which stands an imposing 12-feet high and weighs five tonnes \u0026mdash is located just yards from where the patron saint is buried on the historic Hill of Down, with the Mournes in the distance providing a stunning back.\n\nBishops from the Church of Ireland and Catholic communities took part in last Friday afternoon\u0026rsquos service and they were joined by local clergy and monks from the Holy Cross Monastery in Rostrevor.\n\nFriday\u0026rsquos ceremony had been pencilled in for earlier in the summer but had to be postponed following the discovery of medieval human remains while contractors were preparing the ground for the installation of the cross, carved from Mourne granite excavated from Thomas\u0026rsquo Mountain high up in the mountain range.\n\nThe intricately designed structure was manufactured by the Kilkeel firm of McConnell Brothers and representatives from the firm were joined by Church of Ireland Bishop Harold Miller, Down and Connor Bishop Noel Treanor, the Dean of Down, the Very Rev Henry Hull, and members of the Cathedral Chapter.\n\nDean Hull, who led the short service of dedication, said the ceremony marked a very special day and was delighted a number of people heavily involved in the project were present, including Dr Mike King from the Down County Museum.\n\nDean Hull explained that Dr King played a key role initiating the replica cross project, financed by Newry, Mourne and Down Council.\n\n\u0026ldquoMike worked hard along with others to bring about the cross which replicates one that was in place around 800AD. Inside Down Cathedral, there are some old stones and through research, Mike discovered they were in fact part of the original St Patrick\u0026rsquos Cross, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoIn some old drawings of the cathedral you can see broken portions of the cross which marked nearby St Patrick\u0026rsquos grave. Obviously this old Celtic cross had fallen down and was broken with some pieces placed inside the church.\n\nDean Hull said Dr King, with the help of Philip Armstrong, redesigned the replica cross based on drawings and sketches and eventually, through the help of McConnell Brothers, the imposing replica cross was produced.\n\nThose in attendance at the dedication ceremony were told that the source of the granite used to make the replica cross was most probably the same as that from which the original was made, Dean Hull said the cross is at the heart of the Christian faith and that because Jesus died on the cross, people are reconciled to God and find forgiveness.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoWe are reconciled to God but through the cross we can be reconciled to each other, with the cross reminding us of our common faith as Christians. It is lovely today that Christians from different traditions are able to stand around this cross today because the cross is a symbol of Christian unity and it reminds us that we have one faith, he continued.\n\nDean Hull said when people look at the cross and reflect back to Patrick and to the days of an undivided church, they are reminded that despite all has happened, \u0026ldquowe are still one in Christ with the cross a symbol of what people have in common\u0026nbsp \u0026mdash Christian unity.\n\nConcluding before the start of a short religious dedication service, Dean Hull thanked the Lecale and Down Historical Society which helped with the restoration project and the former Down Council and current Newry, Mourne and Down Council for their support.\n\nDean Hull\u0026rsquos words were reflected by Bishop Miller, who said a prayer as part of the dedication service along with Bishop Treanor.\n\nThe clerics then gathered at the base of the sculpture where they placed their palms over the imprint of a hand in the cross\u0026rsquos base and were joined by Bishop Grant Le Marque, former Anglican Bishop of the Horn of Africa, who was visiting the Down and Dromore Diocese.\n\n\u0026ldquoHere we have Christian hands together, said Bishop Miller, encouraging other people from all over the world to visit the cathedral to make the same gesture.\n\nHe added: \u0026ldquoThe cross is never just something at a distance it is the very heart of our faith in Christ, our relationship with Christ and our salvation in Christ.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Delight after new Translink bus service is extended to Clough  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA NEW bus service is operating in Clough.\n\nThe Downpatrick to Ballykinlar service is being extended to Clough from this month.

A super effort. The only other male junior, Oliver Robinson,\u0026nbsp did a double. The U-13 boys 100m in 15.15 and a strong run in the 1500m saw him finish in 5\u0026rsquo40.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\n\nA promising start to his career as a Year 8 athlete. The sole senior of the night was Davy Foster in 1,500m running a fast 4\u0026rsquo50. Maybe Davy will stick to these faster shorter distances to try and keep up with his daughters.\n\nGirls galore\n\nTwo of the aforementioned Foster girls competed in the U-11 girls\u0026rsquo 1200m. In a competitive race Jodi hit the finish line in 4\u0026rsquo17 then not far behind was the always-smiling Kari in an impressive time of 4\u0026rsquo43. They both also tried the long jump.\u0026nbsp\n\nIn the U-13 girls\u0026rsquo 100m EDAC had three runners. Heat one saw Kara Trainor finish well in second place in 15.01. In heat three we saw Lauren Madine win in\u0026nbsp a new PB time of 14.16 and Anna Gardiner come home in 15.67 with Lauren taking the overall win and gold medal for the distance.\u0026nbsp\n\nKara\u0026rsquos time placed her sixth overall. It was pleasing to see them follow the lead of the younger girls by trying a field event as well, in this case the discus. Commendable enthusiasm!\n\nFab five females\n\nThe U-13 girls\u0026rsquo 1500m saw a large field of 14 athletes, five of which were EDAC runners and which also included the top class City of Lisburn athlete Katie McCleery, who is ranked in the top 10 in the UK for her age category over this distance.\u0026nbsp\n\nMcCleery made her intentions clear from the start as she immediately hit the front. Lauren decided to track her run and see how she went and was closely followed by Anna Gardiner, Lucy Foster, Kara Trainor and Emily Burns.\u0026nbsp\n\nAll five EDAC athletes looked superb over the three and three-quarter laps. On the last bend McCleery tried to hold on, but Lauren moved up another gear waiting and cruised past to take first place with 100m to run and crossed the line in a superb time of 4\u0026rsquo57 which is a PB by 18 seconds and puts Lauren 8th in the UK for her age for 2018. That was an outstanding performance.\n\nAnna Gardiner was the next EDAC athlete to finish in 5\u0026rsquo05 which is also a significant PB.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\n\nThe PBs were coming thick and fast as Lucy Foster came home in 5\u0026rsquo17 which was 12 seconds better than her previous best. The ever-improving duo of Kara Trainor and Emily Burns battled it out to the end and almost needed a photo finish to separate them \u0026mdash their times were\u0026nbsp 5.41.34 and 5.41.90. This race was really exciting to watch with brilliant efforts from all the girls. By filling first, third, fourth, seventh and eighth places, in the field of 14, there is surely cause for celebration at the depth of talent within the EDAC ranks.\n\nIcing on the cake\n\nLast girl to race was U-15 rising star Kirsti Foster in the 1500m. The girls were mixed with a strong U-15 boys\u0026rsquo field and Kirsti did not take the race lightly, despite carrying a slight niggle from hockey.\u0026nbsp\n\nShe dominated the girls\u0026rsquo field and beat some of the boys too in her race to finish a strong 5\u0026rsquo12 to provide a fitting finale to the night and to the track season.\n\nLaganside 10k\n\nPaula Radcliffe was obviously the star of the show, but EDAC had a few sparkling performances themselves.\u0026nbsp\n\nPaul Lloyd led the troops home and despite narrowly missing out on the elusive sub 40, he felt that he had given his all in the fast-paced race. His time of 40.08 is tantalisingly close and his consistency has to be commended.\u0026nbsp\n\nPhillip Vint, another man who rarely misses a weekend race, came next in 41.10 with Liam Keenan not far behind in 41.36. Gavin Hynds in 41.45 had plenty to celebrate as this was a PB and proves that marathon training doesn\u0026rsquot always slow you down and must be great morale booster for him.\u0026nbsp\n\nDeirdre v Paula?\n\nDeirdre Weatherall finished in 42.08 and was slightly disappointed with that. However, she was cheered up by the fact that Paula Radcliffe had decided to run in the pack and was seen in chat with ious folk en route.\u0026nbsp\n\nThis gave Deirdre the chance to have a sprint finish to the line with the women\u0026rsquos marathon world record holder.\n\nPaula also has European and World Championship medals too numerous to mention as well the accolade of four times Olympian. Many would defer to such greatness, but Deirdre is well known for her fresh-faced enthusiasm and took no time to decide that having a result sheet with her name one place ahead of Paula\u0026rsquos was an opportunity unlikely to be repeated.\n\nAfter reading on Wikipedia that Deirdre is described as the foremost tragic heroine in Irish legend and probably its best-known figure in modern times, she could probably argue that Paula should have been in awe of her rather than the other way round.\n\nThis is the spirit that is key to Deirdre\u0026rsquos rise in the ranks and long may it continue.\n\nLiam Smyth \u0026mdash veteran in terms of longevity in these events clocked up a respectable 44.42. Behind him another historic event was unfolding.\n\nGavin McConvey came in to the finish line in 53.51 declaring that the last time he saw a sub 54 minute 10K was in 2004. Not bad going Gavin, keep it up.\u0026nbsp\n\nRoisin Gaffney, another reliable EDAC runner, finished in 54.09 and for once found, despite her love of the sun, that the heat was oppressive and was glad to be done.\n\nDonal at the double\n\nDonal Smith headed to Kildare on Saturday to take part in an a 5k run in aid of the Injured Jockeys\u0026rsquo Fund - but having discovered that there was a 10K race nearby he decided in true horse lovers\u0026rsquo form to hedge his bets and do both. He did say afterwards that it was a lot for one day and he may need a few rest days, but knowing Donal, that won\u0026rsquot last for long.\n\nNo one from the club made their way to Derry on Sunday morning for the Waterside Half Marathon which this year was also the NI and Ulster Half Marathon Championships.\n\nWhat\u0026rsquos ahead?\n\nThis will probably come too late for regular readers of the weekly papers, but Tuesday is the night for the annual trek to Castlewellan for the lung busting, for some, Mill Hill Mile Challenge.\u0026nbsp\n\nThis is a race that is, or should be, on everybody\u0026rsquos bucket list so if you\u0026rsquore going don t\u0026rsquo forget you must register online beforehand.

They were freed on bail later that evening.\n\nAiring last November, the Alex Gibney-directed documentary was a hard-hitting examination of claims of state collusion in the murders, which broke new ground by publicly naming alleged suspects.\n\nThe six men killed in Loughinisland were Adrian Rogan, Barney Green, Dan McCreanor, Eamon Byrne, Malcolm Jenkinson and Patsy O\u0026rsquoHare.\n\nClare Rogan, wife of Adrian Rogan, said the families would not be deterred in their search for truth and justice.\n\n\u0026ldquoWe are shocked and appalled at the arrest of two journalists related to the No Stone Unturned documentary, which exposed the extent of state collusion between the state and loyalist paramilitaries in Loughinisland, she said.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe British government have systematically denied and continue to cover up its role in the murder of six people in the Heights Bar.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoThese arrests show the lengths of desperation that the British government and state forces are prepared to go to, in order to stifle the truth about what happened in Loughinisland.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe Police Ombudsman\u0026rsquos report into Loughinisland murders was one of the most damning expositions of state collusion in mass murder ever published.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoOur families, and many other families across the island, some of whom have been denied the basic right to an inquest, have campaigned for many years against state collusion and for truth and justice for our loved ones.\n\nSouth Down Sinn F\u0026eacutein MP Chris Hazzard has thanked those who came out to stand with the Loughinisland families on Friday night.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe arrests of two leading investigative journalists who helped lift the lid on collusion following the 1994 Loughinisland murders through \u0026lsquoNo Stone Unturned\u0026rsquo has re-opened many wounds for the families of those murdered, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoThat truth would never have been possible without journalists like Barry and Trevor who acted always with integrity.

He started rowing back to shore, but one of the oars slipped overboard and into the water.\n\nAfter a few unsuccessful attempts to circle the oar, Mr Milligan decided to jump overboard to retrieve it. After getting the oar, Mr Milligan tried to swim back to the boat, but it was drifting away in the strong tide.\n\nA strong swimmer, Mr Milligan struck out for the shore and was about half a mile out when he was picked up by police in a rowing boat.\n\n\u0026ldquoI shouted to the children to keep calm and they did.

He is still the top bid. It is understood that two additional parties are interested in acquiring the 75,000 sq ft red brick building which once provided work for 400 people when it was owned by Hursts, part of the Ulster Weaving Group.\n\nNearly 150 years old, the five-storey mill was used for the wet spinning of flax and most of its flooring is tiled.\u0026nbsp This activity closed ten years ago.

The display was organised by Down District Council as part of their Percy French festival and more than \u0026pound500 worth of fireworks were used.\n\nBilly Caughey was the master of ceremonies for the evening and introduced several bands who played selections prior to the display.\n\nCROSSGAR \u0026mdash Mr James Mejury, founder of the family motor business in Crossgar, died at his home this week. He was 80. A native of Ballyronan, Derry, he moved with his family from Belfast to Shrigley after the outbreak of the last war and began his business in Killyleagh Street, Crossgar.\n\nHis conscientiousness at work meant that 12-hour days were common place. The solution of customers\u0026rsquo problems were his delight.\n\nDRUMAROAD \u0026mdash Gene Fitzpatrick, voted Ulster\u0026rsquos top cabaret artist, is to compere a grand iety concert organised by St Patrick\u0026rsquos Scouts and Cubs in Drumaroad Hall next Tuesday night. A top class line-up includes Fergie, Houl Yer Whist, Dominic Hughes and a local supporting cast.\n\nDuring the past few months the boys and their leaders have been very busy. The cubs spent a very enjoyable five days at Clare, while 30 miles away the scouts were on a ten-day camp at Birr, Co Offaly.\n\nThe scouts won the Diocesan Shield and represented Dromore diocese a few weeks ago at the Melviin Trophy in Dublin where they gained considerable success.\n\nKILLINCHY \u0026mdash A harvest fair in Killinchy Presbyterian Church Hall on Saturday afternoon raised \u0026pound1,300 for church funds. There was a high standard of entries for the ious classes for bread, cakes, fruit and vegetables and sales were also good.\n\nThe crowds seemed to enjoy a iety of sideshows on the football pitch where darts shooting and beanbag games contributed to the fun.\u0026nbsp\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Local minister gets in tune for marathon on the organ  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA PLUMP cushion will be the Rev Mark Spratt\u0026rsquos best friend as he undertakes a 12-hour music marathon.\n\nThe minister of Kilmore Presbyterian Church, near Crossgar, is once again preparing to play an organ and piano non-stop to raise funds for the church.\n\nHe will be playing hundreds of psalms, hymns, spiritual songs, church music, classical pieces along with wedding favourites from 9am-9pm on Saturday, September 15.\u0026nbsp\n\nIt will the second time since 2014 that Mr Spratt will take to the keyboards to raise money for the Drumaghlis Road church where he is Director of Music.\n\nA renowned organist, Mr Spratt told the Recorder: \u0026ldquoI did a 12-hour marathon before in 2014 and that time we raised just over \u0026pound2,000 for the Women\u0026rsquos Association and other church activities.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis time it\u0026rsquos to raise money for repairs to the church\u0026rsquos roof and other property matters and I\u0026rsquoll be happy with whatever the community is able to give.\n\nMr Spratt has successfully completed two other music marathons for Bangor Presbyterian Church where he was part of the ministry team before he moved to Kilmore.

She said people expect the politicians to be at work and backed the clamour for them to engage in meaningful talks on the way forward and get back into government.\n\nThe Dundrum woman said the event, alongside those held in other towns, was designed to send a clear message that people have had enough and want the MLAs back in Stormont working for those who voted for them.\n\nJoan hopes the We Deserve Better campaign is something that will focus a lot of minds, explaining people are aware that some MLAs who want to get back to Stormont as part of a functioning Executive, but this has not been possible as result of the political leadership vacuum due to the DUP and Sinn Fein being unable to agree a way forward.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt feels as if we have been putting up with the impasse but there is momentum for change. Hopefully this movement will be able to grow and put some pressure on the politicians to get back, she continued.\n\n\u0026ldquoA lot of people have said that maybe we should do this again and last week I encouraged those in attendance to take photographs and send them to their MLAs to show the support there is for them to get back to work.\n\nJoan said the simple message from last week\u0026rsquos meeting to the politicians was: \u0026ldquoWe elected you, get back to work.\n\nShe added: \u0026ldquoThe politicians are in effect our employees, we elected them to do a job for us and at the minute they are not delivering.

His greeting at a youth Mass in Galway where he declared \u0026lsquoyoung people of Ireland, I love you\u0026rsquo became a stand out moment, replayed on television on countless occasions since. My own childhood involved attending Mass at the Graan and serving as an altar boy in St Michael\u0026rsquos Church in Enniskillen with many of my primary school classmates. We were lucky too that for much of my childhood our pastoral leadership was led by Father Brian D\u0026rsquoArcy who preached a message of tolerance, diversity in the church, compassion for the complexities of life and the experiences that shape them. Even when a stream of disturbing disclosures arose that challenged the Church and its response to clerical abuse and coverup, Father Brian\u0026rsquos consistently strong and unequivocal demand for accountability, truth, justice and recovery for victims offered a pathway for the institutional church to remain connected with its members.\n  My own life journey took me to Dublin in 1999 and what I discovered very quickly was that the message of compassion, openness and truth that I had faithfully followed and listened to every Sunday did not reflect the views and actions of the hierarchy either in Ireland or in the Vatican. Like many people of faith I found this not just challenging but chilling.\u0026nbsp\n  As I embarked on a legal career in human rights law I spent many days hearing story after story of adults recalling their experiences of abuse and brutal actions at the hands of clergy and lay people at the Residential Institutions Redress Board.\u0026nbsp\n  Those stories will never leave me. Sine then, the full impact of church and state abuse has come through my office door clerical sexual abuse, church authority cover ups, Magdalene laundries, the cruel operation of mother and baby homes, where many single mothers lost their babies to a regime of illegal adoptions and told they had committed a mortal sin. We have been witness to church intolerance towards lone parents, women, advocates of shared education, access to certain healthcare services, separated couples and the LGBT community.\n  And so when I was given a ticket to the Pope\u0026rsquos Mass last weekend I thought long and hard about attending. I could see that for many people of faith this was an opportunity to gather as a church community and celebrate their faith, their God and their Christianity.\u0026nbsp\n  On the other hand I could see that for many victims of the Church the Pope\u0026rsquos visit resurrected those deep seated and enduring feelings of hurt, trauma and damage that has never been properly addressed with actions.\u0026nbsp\n  So many victims have said to me that the abuse itself is not nearly as bad as the culture of cover up, the systemic efforts to sideline and disbelieve victims, to hide evidence and wrongdoers from a process that would lead to truth, justice and love for the victim and their families.\u0026nbsp\n  So I ended up last Sunday foregoing the papal Mass and standing for truth with nearly 10,000 other citizens in Dublin City Centre. It was a personal choice. I am glad now I made that choice. I am sad that the Vatican and the leadership of the Church still don\u0026rsquot get it. Still don\u0026rsquot acknowledge that abuse wasn\u0026rsquot simply perpetrated on children by individual wrongdoers but that their many violations were facilitated, covered up and enabled by Bishops, Archbishops and Cardinals all the way to the Vatican.\n  Ireland has changed utterly since 1979. It is reflected in all the societal changes that have taken place in the last thirty nine years. It is reflected in the fact that the people of Dublin were much more interested and welcoming of the Queen than the Pope.\u0026nbsp\n  It turns out that Pope John Paul was wrong when he said back in 1979 that he loved the young people of Ireland.

It gives information about changes in drinking pattern and fluid intakes and monitors calf health.\n  The launch of the Winter Fair was held at Draynes Farm, near Lisburn, where Michael Drayne led a tour of agricultural journalists and industry representatives around his farm and milk bottling plant. The milk botting plant began when his father began with a horse and cart. Now the business has a fleet of vans distributing milk and dairy produces to customers in four counties. However their products are supplied to customers across Ireland through the Henderson Food Service and other companies.\n  The borehole gives Draynes Farm a constant supply of water which is also useful to soften the mains water for washing.\n  A 50KVA solar panel plant has been installed on the roofs of some of the buildings.\n  Draynes Farm processes 5m litres of milk per year and operates Monday to Friday with their own supply of 1.2 million litres of farm milk held over the weekend until the beginning of a new week. A total of 35 staff are employed in all departments.\n  The Draynes Farm dairy herd uses three Lely Astronaut A4 milking robots. The cows visit the robots on average 3.1 times per day averaging 33 litres per day with some exceeding 50litres.
