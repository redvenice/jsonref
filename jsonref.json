This was previously covered by an Interrail ticket.The move was met with criticism yesterday, with fears raised that tourism in cities outside of London will be affected. Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said the RDG had been ‘deeply irresponsible’ over the situation.Britain has been part of Interrail since its launch in 1972 and began a trial selling Eurail passes in January.                  Britain has been part of Interrail since its launch in 1972 and began a trial selling Eurail passes in January. Pictured are tweets criticising the move Unlike Interrail, which allows travel across as many as 31 countries for European citizens, Eurail is for tourists from the rest of the world.But following the trial, the RDG favoured its own ‘Britrail’ pass for those travelling to the UK from outside Europe, which includes two-for-one deals on attractions across the country.The Eurail Group subsequently ended Britain’s association with its Interrail and Eurail schemes as it intends to merge the passes.Eurostar trains will not be affected by the move, which comes into force from January next year.This means that tourists on an Interrail pass will be able to travel to London from Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam and vice versa.Rail expert Mark Smith, founder of Seat61.com, said the decision is ‘a backwards step’ as it would put visitors off from going to destinations such as Edinburgh, York and Bath.         A map showing some of the interrail routes around Europe, which are regularly used by backpackers ‘They’ll be encouraged to see London and go back and enjoy their free travel elsewhere,’ he said.‘So it’s bad news for the regions.’ Labour’s Mr McDonald added: ‘We are in the middle of a climate crisis and have just 11 years to drastically reduce emissions to avoid catastrophe. We should be making it easier for people to travel between countries by rail, not encouraging flying by making rail travel more expensive and difficult.’For almost 50 years the Interrail scheme has been used as a ‘rite of passage’ by teenagers and young people, allowing them to travel freely across the continent on a single ticket.RDG director of nations and regions Robert Nisbet said: ‘The rail industry boosts British tourism and working together, rail companies are offering the best option for tourists with BritRail, which is recommended by Visit Britain, offers two for one deals on 200 attractions across the country and includes the convenience of mobile tickets.‘Although the Eurail Group has ended our decades-long membership of Interrail since we stopped trialling Eurail passes, British people will feel no difference - they can still buy an Interrail pass, get the Eurostar and travel by train across Europe.’ "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3263a854457013787a03bb7073836a1db42c3e2e/0_406_7687_4611/master/7687.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88b03a79d744c8020d6ea680aadfbf90","title":"gossamer gateway avalon tintagel castle bridge magic history arthurian merlin","story":"This miraculously slight structure, like a pair of high-ing boards meeting in the middle, reconnects Cornwall with the legendary Arthurian ruins – and Merlin’s caveA slender carpet of slate hangs above a rocky ravine on the north coast of Cornwall, where azure waters lap at the entrance to Merlin’s Cave. It looks like the wizard has been up to his old tricks, conjuring a gossamer-thin bridge that effortlessly s the chasm, reconnecting the mainland to the ancient ruins of Tintagel Castle for the first time in centuries.The modern-day Merlins take the form of Laurent Ney, a Belgian architect and engineer, and William Matthews, lead designer under Renzo Piano of the Shard skyscraper in London. The pair teamed up to summon this £5m footbridge into being for English Heritage. “We had no magic spells to help us,” says Ney, whose firm has built around 100 bridges across the world, but none in such a challenging location. “It was the first time in my life that I had to design a bridge in a site that was totally inaccessible – and which was expected to disappear into the landscape.”The rugged promontory provided the perfect place for the Cornish kings to build their fortified stronghold in the fifth and sixth centuries, when the headland was connected by a narrow isthmus that has since crumbled into the sea. The end-of-the-earth feeling also helped to fuel all the legends that have swirled around the site since the middle ages, when it was named as the place of King Arthur’s conception, prompting Richard Earl of Cornwall to build his castle there in the 13th century. This made it a tricky place to bring 50 tonnes of steel and 40,000 slate tiles – all of which had to be delivered by helicopter in five-tonne prefabricated chunks and assembled by a crane on a cable stretching right across the gulch.The result is a miraculously slight structure, with polished steel balustrades and diagonal braces that, from a distance, make it shimmer like a spider’s web in the dew. As you get closer, it reveals itself to be two separate structures, each cantilevered out from the cliffs – like a pair of opposing ing boards, not quite meeting in the middle. The gap, say the architects, represents “the transition between present and the past, the known and the unknown, reality and legend” – to be experienced as visitors cross from the mainland to the mysterious ruins.In truth, it was a practical necessity, in order to avoid excessive forces meeting at the centre of the double-arched structure, but it makes for a poetic sight. Daredevils hoping for a risky leap across the ravine will be disappointed, though: the gap is only 4cm wide and the two decks are actually connected by steel cables at either side, somewhat destroying the illusion.There has been a need for a bridge here for a long time. Ever since the 12th-century chronicler Geoffrey of Monmouth spun his seductive Arthurian tales, Tintagel has been inundated with visitors seeking a taste of the magic. Accessibility has never been its strong point. The original land bridge to the island was so slight, wrote Geoffrey, that “three men shall be able to defend against the whole power of the kingdom”. When the poet John Leland visited in 1540, he observed that the only way on to the island was “by longe elme trees layde for a bryge”, while a 1604 map labels “a draw bridge decaid” and shows a man in a red tunic struggling to scale the “verie steepe and craggie” cliffs.He was lucky there was no one with a buggy and screaming toddlers trying to come down in the other direction. As one of English Heritage’s top five attractions, Tintagel Castle sees almost 250,000 visitors a year, with up to 3,000 people a day at the height of summer. Before the new bridge, the only way to the ruins was via steep staircases cut into the cliffs, connected by a small wooden bridge at the bottom.“It was always a nightmare getting people on and off the island,” says Georgia Butters, English Heritage’s head of historic properties in Cornwall. At peak times, there were waits of up to 45 minutes at either side, with school groups and pensioners regularly stranded on the protected promontory with no loos in sight. She says around a third of visitors to the small village of Tintagel didn’t even bother visiting the castle, put off by the long queues and 148 steps.Now, with timed tickets in hand, tourists will be able to flow across the bridge’s elegant 70 metre deck of local slate tiles, which have been packed together on their sides without mortar, creating the effect of walking across a box of After Eight mints. There is a slight rattle as you traverse this mineral mat, and a subtle bounce created by fellow walkers, both of which add a frisson to crossing the 2.5-metre-wide deck 60 metres above the sea. There are nice details – thin slices of quartz embedded in the slate as well as raw oak handrails – giving it a hand-crafted quality in tune with the historic setting, and making it unlike most modern technocratic footbridges.The polished steel balustrade can look a bit too bling as it glints in the sun, and the arrival of this shiny new structure hasn’t been to everyone’s liking. To some, it smacks of the “Disneyfication” of the site in the hands of English Heritage, which has been accused of turning the location into a “cash cow theme park” by campaign group Kernow Matters To Us (Kernow is Cornish for Cornwall). Hackles were raised in 2016 when an 8ft high bronze statue of a cloaked figure with a sword was unveiled on the island, shortly after a relief of Merlin’s face was sculpted into the cliffs below – an unthinkable act in the eyes of some critics, akin to carving the face of a druid into Stonehenge.“The bridge is just the latest English Heritage vanity project,” says Cornish archaeologist and historian Craig Weatherhill. “It continues the cheap and nasty theme park approach, ruining the ambience of the site.” Weatherhill and his fellow campaigners think the focus on Arthurian legend is a distraction from the real history of Tintagel, the seat of the kings of Dumnonia, a powerful empire that stretched across Cornwall and Devon from the 5th to the 7th centuries. The number of amphora fragments found at the site, indicating vast quantities of wine and olive oil brought from across the Mediterranean, far exceeds the number found at sites across the rest of Britain combined, while excavations suggest Tintagel was larger than London in the same period. “What really rankles Cornish people,” adds Weatherhill, “is the fact they’re marketing the site as ‘English’ Heritage, when the English have had nothing to do with it.”Butters defends the accusations of commercialisation, which have been more vocally levelled at English Heritage since it became an independent charity in 2014 and forced to cover its own costs (the bridge was part-funded by a £2.5m donation from Tetra Pak billionaires Hans and Julia Rausing). A family ticket to Tintagel now costs £33.80, while the gift shop sells a Sword in the Stone letter-opener for £40 and a model of the Knights of the Round Table for £120.“We need to make money to look after our heritage,” says Butters. “And it’s very important that we’re not snobbish and elitist about it. We must spark the interest of the next generation in these sites, because if people don’t care about them, they won’t be preserved.”You could argue that there has been a slightly tacky side to Tintagel ever since Tennyson fuelled the Arthurian hype with his Idylls of the King, and the railway arrived at nearby Camelford, spawning such heady visions as the Victorian pile of the Camelot Castle Hotel and the 1930s fantasy of King Arthur’s Great Halls. Amid the surrounding jamboree of legends, the sleek new bridge is a carefully judged arrival."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc73cfedc33de8b14cb08ad3730ce701c4f656d7/0_701_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d583f7f61e38c17f6562fdd6fe4d9606","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of them Welcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.“It’s Mark Twain these days,” says voicefrombelgrade, “I’m rereading his short story collection”:Every time I read The Experience Of The McWilliamses With Membranous Croup, Extracts from Adam’s Diary, Eve’s Diary, The Stolen White Elephant... I just love them. Also, I pilfered Tom Sawyer from my late father’s library (all right, I’ll take it back, my mom won’t even know that I took it...) – it’s a masterful Serbian translation from the 1949 (the author is Stanislav Vinaver). It’s relatively rare to find a translation that’s as good as the original, but this one really is, and I just have to revisit it every so often.BaddHamster is “finishing up” The House Of Sleep by Jonathan Coe:Warm, funny, breezily paced (as always with him) and a few interesting thoughts on the nature of sleep. Basically, if you like Coe, you’ll probably enjoy it. I do and I am.And CharlieBing “just finished” Judith Schalansky’s Pocket Atlas of Remote Islands:As a cartographer by training and a sometime graphic artist by trade, I just loved almost every bit of this beautifully designed book ... a minor quibble with the occasional use of yellow text on white pages, but the typography is exquisite, the whole conceit just wonderful.Michael, a retired headmaster grieving for his wife, the victim of a terrorist attack, asks himself the question of who is really responsible for what happened, not the bombers themselves, not the bomb makers, but the ‘bomb-triggerers’ – the politician enriching himself from his time in office. There’s much more to this story than vengeance though the narration soon reveals darker aspects of Michael’s character as he recalls his career. Good’s skill is in the narrator considering himself as a realist struggling with difficult pupils, but coming over to the reader as anything but that, and a cruel authoritarian.As an ex-teacher of 31 years, this is an admirably accurate portrayal of some headteacher’s traits I have seen all too frequently.Reading Isabel Allende’s Daughter Of Fortune has been “an exquisite pleasure” for PatLux:Such a rich historical novel in which I, like one of the main protagonists Tao Chi’en, learned lots. I loved the lyrical evocative prose which stimulated all my senses. One of those books that makes you feel you are on a delightful journey with the characters and evokes laughter and sadness. And it stays with you in the intervals between when you put it down and pick it up again. I will definitely be reading more Allende.MachenBach recommends Augustus Carp, Esq., By Himself: Being the Autobiography of a Really Good Man:A satirical mock-autobiography, published anonymously by Sir Henry Howarth Bashford in 1924. Anthony Burgess singled it out as one of the 20th century’s funniest books, but I would say that it’s consistently amusing, rather than LOL funny. Still, that’s rare enough to be noteworthy. Carp is possessed of a Pooterishly inflated sense of his own (and his father’s) importance, and almost total blindness to his own limitations and motivations. He’s a hilariously sanctimonious self-professed Christian (or “Xtian”), who frequently goes out into the streets to lecture smokers, drinkers and music hall artistes on the evils of their ways, but who seems hypocritically blind to his own acts of bullying, blackmail, and greed. Like a monstrous cross between Pooter and Ignatius J Reilly, his voice is impressively realised, and the irony well sustained. I’m not sure how much real satirical bite it had at the time – it seems rather more 1890s than 1920s in many ways, and the joke does wear a little thin long before he gets his comeuppance, but it’s very well-written (in a pretentiously archaic register) and generally good fun.Finally, Dennis89 suggests we give “serious thought” to reading An Armenian Sketchbook by Vasily Grossman:A 200-page account detailing the writer’s reflections, thoughts and wanderings during his visit to Armenia at the twilight of his life. Justification for the journey is provided by the task of editing a Russian translation of a local Armenian novel though the trip allows Grossman to explore and delve far more deeply into this marginalised and often overlooked country.Faith, patriotism, oppression, comradeship and other such topics are beautifully mused upon in this life-affirming gem of a book.Sounds fantastic. (That’s also an excellent excuse to link to Linda Grant’s fine article on reading Grossman: “It took me three weeks to read it and three weeks to recover from the experience.”)If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

BA refused to reveal the number of flights affected but according to Flightstats, which tracks arrivals and departures, by 5.30pm the airline had cancelled 140 flights and a further 370 had been delayed.BA said its latest systems failures affected only the London airports, but the disruption had knock-on effects elsewhere, including at Edinburgh, Glasgow and Belfast and in many European destinations when incoming flights failed to arrive.Customers experienced difficulties checking in online, and queues formed in airport departure areas as the airline moved to manual systems to keep flights operating.Some social media users reported that, on flights that did take off, the food and drink service was affected. Air travel experts said BA may be liable to pay compensation to affected passengers, on top of refunding them the ticket price. Under EU law, some passengers whose flights are cancelled or delayed by two hours or more can be given compensation.The airline said it was offering customers the chance to move bookings to another travel day between 8 and 13 August.When an airline starts cancelling or delaying flights for more than three hours, passengers are entitled to compensation of €250-€600 under EU rules.The cause of the problem has to be under the airline’s control and not an “extraordinary circumstance”. Lack of planesstaff, flight overbooking, a strike by the airline’s staff or an IT failure are all considered to be within the airline’s control – so compensation is payable.Passengers on cancelled short-haul flights – up to 1,500km – are entitled to €250 or £230. For flights of 1,500km-3,500km duration, passengers are entitled to €400 (£370) or €600 (£555) for the longest flights (more than 3,500km).Compensation is also payable in the event that the plane is delayed. The payments are the same but only kick in when the plane has been delayed three hours for short flights or four hours for the longer trips. The delay is calculated against the time the plane was due to arrive.Passengers are also entitled to “assistance” under the EU rules. Short-haul passengers should receive food and water after two hours. Mid-distance passengers get help after three hours, while long-haul passengers receive it after they have been held in the terminal for four hours. If the delay is overnight, passengers should be provided with hotel accommodation but this often does not happen. This assistance should be provided irrespective of whether the delay is the airline’s fault.The airlines have fought these compensation rules since they were introduced and passengers have had to go to court to get their money. The airlines frequently blame delays on events outside their control. Freak weather events, or a last- minute strike by air traffic controllers are deemed to be outside their control. A lack of planes or staff is not.The rules only apply to EU-based airlines or all flights that start in the EU on non-EU based carriers. What will happen post-Brexit is not yet clear.\u0026nbspMiles BrignallAbout half of the BA flights scheduled to depart from Heathrow’s Terminal 5 between 9.30am and midday were cancelled or delayed, according to the airport’s website.It was not until 4pm that BA said it had resolved its computer problems. In a statement, the airline said: “We apologise to all our customers caught up in the disruption, and appreciate how frustrating their experience has been. Our teams have been working tirelessly to get the vast majority of customers on their way, with most of our flights departing.”It added: “Our flights are returning to normal. However, there may be some knock-on operational disruption.” The airline was still advising passengers to check for flight information on its website before travelling to the airport.The computer failure is the latest in a series of operational problems to hit the airline in the busy holiday season.Earlier this week, BA flights were among a total of 177 flights cancelled and then reinstated because of threatened industrial action by Heathrow staff.The strikes, originally due to be begin at midnight on Monday, were suspended to allow for further talks between union and airport officials.If BA pilots go ahead with strikes, the likely disruption could coincide with five days of walkouts announced late on Wednesday by Ryanair pilots who are members of the Balpa union.Balpa said that “decades of Ryanair refusing to deal with unions” had led to members voting for a 48-hour strike beginning on 22 August and a 72-hour strike from 2 September.“No pilot wants to spoil the public’s travel plans but at the moment it seems we have no choice,” said Balpa’s general secretary, Brian Strutton.A third strike action, by Heathrow ground staff, could still go ahead on 22 and 23 August unless talks result in a compromise.BA had other problems this week after 200 people had to be evacuated from a British Airways flight after smoke poured into the cabin minutes before it was due to land in Valencia. The crew used oxygen masks as they helped passengers on to the evacuation chutes.BA has previously been hit by severe computer system failures that have left passengers stranded around the world.In 2017, over a May bank holiday weekend, 75,000 passengers were stranded when the airline was forced to cancel more than 700 flights over three days."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27f3b1f6cabced82f340841cf6f543dc823ea9e6/0_306_4585_2751/master/4585.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ba572e05c1491b41eef9f4c2a411101","title":"polite society why are british cities banning swearing pspo","story":"Councils say bans help tackle anti-social behaviour. But critics argue restrictions are a heavy-handed curb on freedom of expressionWhen Salford ditched its ban on swearing last week, Mark Thomas’s reaction was apt. “Hoo fucking ray” the comedian tweeted, shortly followed by a “Whoo- fucking -hooo”.Introduced by the city council in 2016, the public spaces protection order (PSPO) outlawed “foul and abusive” language in Salford Quays, the former site of the Manchester Docks that has now been transformed by upscale developments. Offenders faced an on-the-spot fine, which could increase to £1,000.The order immediately alarmed critics and free speech campaigners. What, after all, constituted foul language? Would a “bloody hell” get you into trouble? Could you be fined for a “damn”?Thomas was due to perform at the Lowry theatre when the order came down in 2016, and has been known to “drag audiences through the streets” on post-gig demos. “In the interests of remaining within the law, I sent Salford City Council a list of words I’m considering using, and asking which are permissible and which are not,” he wrote at the time. “The list runs to 425 words, in alphabetical order, starting with ‘arse’, ending with ‘winnit’ and including the term ‘cat twinky’. I have no idea what that last one means but thought we should check nonetheless.”Though Salford’s citizens are now free once again to turn the air blue, many cities, towns and villages across England now fine cursing. A freedom of information request by the Manifesto Club, a campaigning group that “challenges the hyper-regulation of public spaces”, revealed that between August 2017 and January 2019, 15 councils banned swearing or foul language.Previous FOIs by the Manifesto Club, for the period November 2014 and June 2017, list other local authorities that have introduced orders banning swearing – some of which have now expired.The PSPOs were introduced by the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 to tackle anti-social behaviour in public places. The civil rights organisation Liberty argues they are being used as a heavy-handed curb on freedom of expression.“PSPOs are dangerously broad powers that local councils are systematically misusing,” said Lara ten Caten, a lawyer at Liberty. “Whether to criminalise rough sleepers or to restrict free speech, these blunt powers are being used with little accountability, often against vulnerable people.“We have even heard from people with mental health issues who are particularly distressed at the prospect that they might inadvertently breach a swearing ban in their area, and feel that large parts of their local communities are closed to them because these bans are so vague that they make it impossible to know whether you might be punished just for speaking.”Some councils argue that crackdowns on iniduals who swear and thereby cause a nuisance are supported by the public, particularly if those iniduals are persistently making life a misery for residents. The orders often state foul language is prohibited when it causes “harassment, alarm or distress”.“This group are regularly visited by the council and offered help in relation to substance dependency and other issues and the council also uses other tools including warning letters and the use of community protection legislation to support safety and wellbeing in the wider community.”Still, “causing annoyance” arguably sets the bar pretty low, and in theory gives enforcement officers broad powers to police language. Or as Thomas put it, “the fate of gutter-gobbed miscreants will be in the hands of a council official”.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7275ef431dd4f060d6f489ebc74b2b2e0cb1ae90/0_507_2120_1271/master/2120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d2a6f56bfe292fca1d0929c7a93ad59","title":"michael buerks fat shaming is weak not the obese people he targets","story":"The BBC presenter wheels out all the offensive cliches in his column on obesity and the NHS “Freedom to make bad choices is what personal autonomy, indeed democracy, is all about,” writes Michael Buerk in his latest column for the Radio Times. And, wow, has the former star of I’m a Celebrity made a bad choice this week. In a piece entitled “Leave couch potatoes alone!”, Buerk takes aim at people he deems to be “weak” – the obese.Picking apart the common argument that obesity is the biggest danger to the NHS in terms of cost appears to be the raison d’être of the piece, along with a plea to leave overweight people to make their own mistakes. It’s as cruel and vitriol-soaked as debates about obesity generally are – the joy Buerk takes in littering the column with pejoratives is obvious, if the results are not particularly creative. There’s the perennial “porky”, and references to “guzzling” and being “out-waddled”. There’s originality though in his choice to reframe the societal cost of obesity in a “positive” way – with a reminder that “the obese will die a decade earlier than the rest of us”.Because, remember, dear readers – the obese will die. It’s OK. Memento mori. Everybody dies – but especially fat people. And isn’t that a wonderful and warming thought? Doesn’t that make you feel better about the future? Does it reassure you that NHS funds are safe?Insulting the overweight is a bold choice for Buerk, because he’s going for “two-thirds of us” according to the stat in his piece. It’s also bold to insult those who enjoy watching television – “listen up, couch potato!” – in a magazine read by those who enjoy watching television. I respect him for this move as I respect any man who decides to torch the goodwill or respect he may have earned throughout his career for some attention in its later days.What I don’t respect is the conviction with which he promotes untruths: “You’ll lose weight if you eat less” “It’s your fault” ”It’s your choice” – not always, unfortunately. “The truth is, healthy food is cheaper than sugar-packed, fat-soaked convenience rubbish” – maybe, maybe not. I can’t be sure that being overweight will kill me 10 years earlier than healthier living would. But Buerk’s point that that would be OK, that it’s a worthy sacrifice for obese people to die earlier because they’ll be saving the NHS money over the long term – not to mention helping to protect the planet into the bargain – isn’t just shockingly callous, it ignores the existence of proven treatments such as stomach-shrinking surgery that can help people lose weight, improve their lives and save NHS funds. Why should treatment be denied to those struggling with obesity, whether through overeating or circumstance? Does an obese patient really deserve less empathy than any other?Buerk also argues that VAT on takeaways and fizzy drinks covers a chunk of the extra costs to the NHS of obesity, and that’s why people shouldn’t worry about it so much.I can’t be certain that VAT on Pringles will cover any future hospital bills I may have. What I can be fairly certain of is that this piece adds to a continuing unnecessary cruelty towards, and dehumanisation of, the two-thirds of us who are overweight. As the reporting of the article has sparked more thoughtful discussion of the subject, it’s also included objectifying headless pictures of overweight people, and links to voyeuristic videos of people struggling. “They’re weak, not ill,” is how Buerk’s article on overweight people ends. But the reality is that it’s Buerk’s unprompted cruelty that’s weak."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25cfe14265978017ab4f66f314a97a4e2bfaf07f/0_0_941_577/master/941.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8adffcfbaf2403e139b275f43d7b79c3 1400w","title":"farmer produces ethical king prawns in a lincolnshire field","story":"Most warm water prawns sold in UK are imported from Asia and are tainted with allegations of slavery and environmental destructionAt a farm in Lincolnshire two aquaculturists are busy feeding thousands of larvae in a dozen large tanks designed to emulate a seawater environment.This is the UK’s first warm water king prawn producer. In less than three and a half months, each wriggling little creature will grow to weigh 30g, ready to be harvested and sold to retailers and restaurants. FloGro Fresh is the first company in Britain to bring Pacific whiteleg prawns fresh to the market – most prawns consumed in the UK are imported frozen from India, Vietnam, Thailand, Ecuador or Honduras.In an industry rife with human trafficking and modern slavery, and notorious for its destruction of marine ecosystems, FloGro is one farmer’s attempt to produce farmed prawns that are sustainable and ethical.“The beauty of our operation is that it’s entirely fresh, everything that comes from overseas has been frozen,” said Ralph Maxwell, FloGro’s managing director.The team at FloGro “get the order in the morning, go and harvest it immediately from the tank and they’re shipped to the customer overnight and will be in the restaurant the following day. So in less than 24 hours you have that order.”“They know exactly where it comes from,” he added. “There is provenance and there is traceability to everything we do, so if the customer or chef wants to come and see it they can come up and see the prawn. We don’t know where the prawns come from in southeast Asia, but I’m told they come from very dubious places.”The Marine Conservation Society has given a thumbs up to FloGro’s methods of production and sustainability. Its closed-loop aquaculture system uses renewable energy – a combination of rooftop solar panels and wind power from Lincolnshire.750 cubic metres of water, heated via a biomass boiler fed with wood pellets to ensure it remains at 28C (82F) at all times, is filtered and recycled robustly. Prawn poo is spread on land as fertiliser.A major issue with intensive prawn farming in places like Asia is the use of polluting chemicals and antibiotics. According to the Environmental Justice Foundation, “the production of prawns can be responsible for serious environmental degradation, such as the destruction of mangroves, wetlands and coral reefs, destruction of marine and coastal bioersity and mass drowning of sea turtles and other protected species. It has also been linked to human rights abuses, such as child, forced and bonded labour, intimidation, violence and even murder.”Neil Campbell, head chef at Yotam Ottolenghi’s Fitzrovia restaurant Rovi, said the restaurant’s relationship with the farm was key in choosing their product.FloGro receives a shipment of 150,000 larvae from the US every four to five weeks. Boxes containing baby shrimps in highly oxygenated pure seawater arrive at Heathrow. The larvae go through an acclimatisation period before being placed in blue tanks filled with salted water, known as nursery tanks. They stay there for 28 days, growing from 0.003g to 0.03g. Another 28 days are spent in six intermediary tanks where they grow to 2–3g each. They spend the rest of their lives in 12 concrete “grow-out” tanks.In contrast with conventionally farmed prawns in Asia and Latin America, which are often fed with fishmeal obtained through illegal fishing, FloGro prawns are fed with fishmeal from France that is sourced from off-cuts from human consumption.“We’re not killing fish to put in our prawns, it’s only the waste product from human consumption,” said production manager Richard Clarke. Born in Lincolnshire, Clarke studied aquaculture and fisheries management and is now one of two full-time staff on the farm. Two part-timers help at the weekend.The prawns are harvested twice a week. They stop feeding 24 hours before so the back vein is empty when they are harvested, making life easier for chefs. The prawns die instantly when put into iced water. They are then vacuum-packed and kept chilled until they are ready to be delivered. They cost £20 per kilo.Maxwell said the response to the British prawns has been overwhelming. “Our problem is that we can’t supply enough,” he said. The company is now focusing on setting up its own hatchery to increase production.FloGro, set up in 2015, is also looking at ways to sell an important byproduct of the prawn shells: chitosan, which can be used in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. Every two to three weeks, prawns shed their shells.“A lot of restaurants have stopped selling imported prawns because they don’t know where they come from,” said Maxwell. “The consumer drives the marketplace and is becoming far more sophisticated. They want to know where the prawn has come from, so that’s a big plus for us. That is why there is a potential to grow our industry in the UK.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0de8d4cf9e6d50e81f661ab0959b20ec4c691a2/0_0_1062_637/master/1062.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a1723b78c85dde5f10996d077378628","title":"sequins and stardom the fashion legacy of the supremes","story":"From homemade dresses to glittering gowns, Motown’s most successful act became well known for their iconic stage attire.

The Belgian travelled to Milan on Wednesday and will have a medical at the Serie A club’s headquarters on Thursday.The player’s representative, Federico Pastorello, spent most of on Wednesday in talks with United representatives in London to finally sort out the long‑running saga and the two sides came to an agreement in the early evening. United had already knocked back one bid from Inter and had been hoping to received a fee of around £80m for the Belgium international but were in the end persuaded to accept the latest offer.Lukaku was desperate to join Inter and his relationship with the United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjær, had deteriorated in the past week. He was fined by United for missing training without permission this week.Inter had previously offered £64.7m including add-ons paid over two years and were initially hoping that the Belgian would join on loan for the first year. However, United’s resistance led to Inter, under pressure from their new manager, Antonio Conte, to raise their bid on Wednesday.Inter’s final offer consisted of an initial £64.7m plus a further £5.3m in add‑ons. United have managed to include a sell-on clause in the deal but do have to pay part of the fee to Everton.The player has agreed a five-year deal with Inter worth around £300,000 a week. Conte is a long-time admirer of Lukaku and wanted to sign the Belgian when at Chelsea and will be delighted to have got his man.Lukaku scored 27 goals in his first season at the club but managed only 15 in 2018-19. He joined United from Everton for £75m plus £15m in add-ons in July 2017.The fee paid for Lukaku is a transfer record for Inter, the previous record for the Italian club being in 1999 when Christian Vieri joined from Lazio for €46m (£42.5m).United will be pleased that the saga is over and Solskjær is confident he can be competitive with the options available up front. He has Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial, Alexis Sánchez and Mason Greenwood from whom to choose.United were interested in signing Christian Eriksen and Paulo Dybala but have ended their interest in both players. The club decided that Dybala’s wage demands were excessive and Eriksen would prefer a move to Spain if he were to leave Tottenham this summer.Dybala is earning more than £300,000 a week at Juventus before tax and was looking for an increase in that at United. A further complication was his image rights, which are expensive, as well as agents’ fees of up to £12m.It has been a mixed transfer summer for United. They finished sixth in the Premier League last season, a demoralising 32 points behind the champions, Manchester City, but have been able to add the central defender Harry Maguire from Leicester for £80m, Aaron Wan-Bissaka from Crystal Palace for an initial £45m as well as Daniel James from Swansea for £15m in this window.They also look like keeping hold of the midfielder Paul Pogba, who has been the subject of consistent interest from Real Madrid through the summer.Asked then if Pogba will feature on the opening day of the season, when United face Chelsea at Old Trafford, Solskjær replied: “He should be OK. I hope so, anyway.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef802fd7f1e89d48bbea2d94fcdd9625f3151500/0_167_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ffec0d642a571cc05c7354e35e6ec8b","title":"neil lennon reinvest kieran tierney celtic","story":"Neil Lennon hopes he will be given Kieran Tierney’s record £25m transfer fee to reinvest in his Celtic squad.

A medical is also to be completed but, provided there are no last-minute hitches, the left-back’s switch should be completed before Thursday’s 5pm English transfer deadline.Tierney’s departure now leaves Lennon with a major hole to fill.

Lennon hopes he will be able to use some of the cash generated by Tierney’s sale to beef up his team. He told BBC Radio Scotland: “I hope so. There are a few areas I’d like to improve in.”“It shows the work that people have done at the club, whether it be Brendan Rodgers, Ronny Deila or the people at the academy to produce such a fine player. He’s an outstanding young talent and a great kid.”Celtic’s captain, Scott Brown, echoed the thoughts of his manager as he added: “Kieran’s a fantastic player. There’s always going to be interest in him. He will be a big miss.”While Tierney’s exit will deflate a fanbase that has taken the self-confessed Hoops diehard to their hearts, Lennon will hope to raise their spirits by leading Celtic back to the Champions League group stages.And his team are well-placed to reach the play-offs after the draw in Transylvania.Mario Rondón drew first blood for the hosts when he slotted home just before the half-hour but Lennon’s team now return to Glasgow packing a vital away goal after James Forrest quickly cancelled out the opener.“It’s a great result,” Lennon added. “The away goal is priceless for us. The guys will be a match fitter for it. You could see at the end some of them were starting to struggle with the heat. It’s been a tough game but a great night’s work and we’re looking forward to the second leg.“I was delighted with our attacking play and we looked really dangerous early on. Maybe our final ball just let us down a little bit but I always felt we’d have the capability of scoring. They scored a great goal on the counter but our reaction was superb.” It bodes well for the second leg on Tuesday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c263c54dac4d1d55e858a089211c08d1ad6c5e6/0_90_3754_2253/master/3754.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb3e0003a699edadfa322adbe15c0fb5","title":"tottenham agree 55m fee with real betis for giovani lo celso","story":"• Argentina midfielder must agree personal terms• Tottenham also hoping to sign Ryan SessegnonTottenham have reached an agreement with Real Betis to sign Giovani Lo Celso for a club record-equalling €60m (£55.3m) while Mauricio Pochettino is also hoping a deal for Fulham’s Ryan Sessegnon can be completed before Thursday’s transfer deadline.On a busy penultimate day of the transfer window Spurs finally struck a deal for the Argentina midfielder Lo Celso after failing with attempts to sign Philippe Coutinho on loan from Barcelona, although a move for the Juventus striker Paulo Dybala also appeared unlikely to materialise broke down after the Juventus forward requested a salary of £350,000 a week.While Lo Celso has yet to agree personal terms, he is expected to move to north London after being withdrawn from the Betis squad for the friendly against Las Palmas on Wednesday evening and is expected in London on Thursday for a medical.The fee for the former Paris Saint-Germain player would match the amount Tottenham paid for Tanguy Ndombele at the start of July, with Pochettino having urged his chairman, Daniel Levy, to back him in the transfer market having reached the Champions League final last season.His request appears to have been granted, with the manager also keen on signing the England Under-21 international Sessegnon before the deadline passes.Negotiations with Fulham have dragged on all summer, with the Championship side having held out for a fee of nearly £30m despite Sessegnon having only one year of his contract remaining. England Under-20 World Cup winner Josh Onamha is likley to go to Craven Cottage as part of the deal having spent last season on loan at Sheffield Wednesday.Last season’s first-choice left-back, Danny Rose, has been reintegrated into the squad after missing Tottenham’s tour of Asia last month “to explore prospective opportunities with other clubs” but it is believed Pochettino would prefer to allow Sessegnon the chance to take over as the England defender’s long-term successor.Ambitious attempts to sign a second Argentina international in the form of Dybala have been frustrated by the same issues which confronted Manchester United in their attempt to sign the 25-year-old last week.As well as wage demands that would make him by far the club’s highest earner, complications relating to Dybala’s image rights – which are owned by his former agent Pierpaolo Triulzi – have caused those close to the deal to state it would take “something miraculous” to complete the deal before the deadline. Triulzi is currently suing Dybala for breaching their contract in 2017, with his new agent, Jorge Antun, reportedly having asked United for a £13.7m fee for his client to move to Old Trafford. Paris Saint-Germain could now be his best chance of securing a move away from Juventus, with new manager Maurizio Sarri having made it clear he is not part of his plans for the new season.Spurs had also showed an interest in signing Philippe Coutinho on loan from Barcelona but could not agree a deal with Barcelona. The Brazil international Coutinho worked with Pochettino during a loan spell with Eyol in 2012.The future of Christian Eriksen, meanwhile, appears no closer to being resolved after talks between the Denmark midfielder and Manchester United broke down. With less than 11 months of his contract remaining he is thought to favour a move to Real Madrid and could still depart after Thursday’s Premier League deadline as most European leagues’ markets remain open until the end of the month.

Media Group confirmed preliminary figures showing that its main  News \u0026amp Media subsidiary recorded an operational profit of £800,000 for the first time in many years. Media Group is owned by the not-for-profit Scott Trust, which has an endowment of £1bn built up over many years through past investments in companies such as AutoTrader. The return on this investment allows  Media Group to subsidise its news operations by up to £30m a year and remain sustainable while guaranteeing its independence.Although income from the ’s print operations remains a very significant part of the business, largely due to the cover price paid by readers, the majority of the company’s income now comes from its digital operations. Media Group’s chief executive, David Pemsel, said: “Achieving a third successive year of revenue growth and meeting our break-even target for GNM is a tribute to everyone within our organisation. GNM has been transformed in the last three years into a more reader-funded, more digital and more international business.”In order to hit its financial targets and reduce costs, the accounts show  Media Group paid out £4.3m in redundancy payments to staff in the last financial year. This was aided by a voluntary redundancy scheme under which the total headcount fell from 1,475 to 1,437 across editorial, sales, and support isions.Last year  Media Group took a financial hit relating to the closure of its own printing sites as part of the decision to switch to a tabloid format and outsource production of the physical paper, enabling it to reduce costs in the long term."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d95dff9c31c47ad9eaf925ef2756a475b1f16e72/365_444_4752_2851/master/4752.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c93d2c26ad5d4e90e5a76ad00ebb89d3","title":"royal mint paused creation of 1p and 2p coins last year","story":"No 1p coins were struck for first time since 1972, after sharp recent fall in use of cashThe Royal Mint produced no 1p or 2p coins last year.For the first time since 1972, no 1p coins were struck for circulation in 2018-19 – and for the first time since 1984, no 2p coins were produced.The Royal Mint produces coins, which can last decades, in response to requests from the Treasury to meet the needs of the economy.The Treasury also said no £2 coins were produced last year, as there were already enough in circulation: about 494m.A day after the review was announced, Downing Street said it had no plans to axe 1p and 2p coins after a brief but determined media campaign and concerns raised by charities.In May the government emphasised that there would be no changes to the mix of coins and notes all the denominations, from the penny to the £50 note, would stay in circulation.Cash use has fallen sharply in recent years as the use of contactless payment has surged.

In his collection of home results Root has a 4-1, a 3-1, a 2-1, a 1-1 and now a 0-1. The only visiting team not to get a Test off him are Ireland, who came close. The good news for the England fan, forever fretful, is that each of these home defeats has been followed by a victory.England just need to do what they did last year, after losing the first Test of the summer to Pakistan: make three changes, bowl well, bat solidly, win comfortably. Now, as then, the second Test is one they cannot afford to lose. The difference is the extra pressure that comes with the Ashes – but England’s World Cup stars have already played four must-win matches this summer, under immense pressure, and won the lot.Three months in, Jofra Archer is already having a very interesting international career. He started the World Cup as a novice and ended it as England’s spearhead with 20 wickets. He then became perhaps the first England cricketer ever to be rested from a Test before he had played one. At Edgbaston Root and Trevor Bayliss erred on the side of caution by leaving Archer out when he was considered fit by Jason Gillespie, his coach at Sussex and fellow member of the fast bowlers’ union. Asked to prove his fitness by playing for Sussex 2nds, Archer promptly turned into Superman, taking six wickets and making a hundred in the same day.He is now a near-certainty for Lord’s, where he needs to treat the Australians not as he did when he last faced them there (one for 56), but as he did when they met again at Edgbaston in the World Cup semi-final (two for 32). Ideally he will do to them what Steve Harmison famously did at Lord’s in 2005 and leave a few dents in their helmets, not to mention their self-esteem.Ed Smith, England’s chief selector, sees it as his job to give the captain and coach options for the final XI. At Edgbaston he may have given them too many: a squad of 14, containing seven seamers. Root and Bayliss were like children in an ice-cream parlour, spurning all the sharp flavours – Archer’s polished pace, Olly Stone’s raw power, Sam Curran’s left-arm swing – in favour of vanilla, mid-80s right-armers. The seam attack of Jimmy Anderson, Stuart Broad, Chris Woakes and Ben Stokes had lost their previous two home Tests as a unit (against India at Trent Bridge last year and West Indies at Headingley 2017) and duly added a third, though they could not be blamed for Anderson’s injury.Smith may well decide to get tough, drop Moeen Ali and Joe Denly, and hand Root and Bayliss a squad of only 12. The first XI almost pick themselves: Burns, Roy, Root, Stokes (bowling less because batting at four), Buttler, Bairstow, Curran, Woakes, Archer, Broad, Leach. With Stone pulling up lame, the spare seamer can be Toby Roland-Jones, who knows the Lord’s slope, made a sparkling start to his Test career in 2017 and is now taking five-fors again after a serious injury.One minute Jos Buttler was England’s man for all seasons the next he was demoted to allow Stokes to resume the Test vice-captaincy. This was baffling, as Buttler had done nothing wrong and Stokes, for all his strengths, had unmistakably let the team down with the Bristol incident. If the argument was that Stokes had shown leadership in the World Cup final, well, Buttler had too. Root compounded the error at Edgbaston by shifting Buttler to short-leg, so that England’s best cricket brain, after Eoin Morgan, was no longer part of the conversation in the slips. It surely makes more sense to stick Rory Burns at boot hill and get Buttler back into the engine room.For his part Buttler has to make some runs. He managed 5 and 1 in the first Test, joining Bairstow and Moeen in the melancholy club of gifted strokemakers who have yet to reach double figures in a Test this summer. Between them, they’ve batted ten times and made 33 all out. Buttler, since his recall in May 2018, remains second only to Root for Test runs and top of the class for Test fifties (nine, to Root’s six), and he recovered from an equally poor start last year. But if he and Bairstow flop again, one of them will surely give way to Ben Foakes, who brings more glue.After the Lord’s Test against Ireland Root complained about the pitch being “substandard”. It was certainly a green top and Root was right to feel that the game “wasn’t even close to a fair contest” between bat and ball. Saying so in public seemed hard on the MCC’s new groundsman, Karl McDermott, and also uncharacteristic of Root – who may now be kicking himself, as a piece of green unpleasant land is exactly what he could do with to see off Steve Smith.On a flat pitch Smith is Bradman revisited but, on something more spicy, he is as wobbly as the next man. At Edgbaston and Trent Bridge in 2015 he made 7, 8, 6 and 5, falling to Steven Finn (twice) and Broad (also twice), thanks to three nicks and a slice. There is a Barmy Army chant in there somewhere."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fe90788f6977035233d82a30512c27057e5bd2c/75_0_5005_3003/master/5005.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f958832a53f0a4dc9df0680a41cb05ec","title":"share your bame experiences of the edinburgh fringe festival","story":"We want to hear from BAME people who are attending - or have attended - the festival.

But the war in Manhattan Beach, a city in southern California, sums up a wider problem for neighborhoods transformed by the tech platform: what happens if your neighbors hate it?Neighborly disputes over Airbnb and other home-share properties are frequent, said Dan Weber, the founder of Airbnb Hell, a website that collects horror stories from hosts, renters and neighbors of Airbnb homes. “It is fairly common, unfortunately, for neighbors of Airbnb rentals to suffer just for living next to a space,” he said. “People staying in an Airbnb rental are usually on vacation, and what happens is that the neighbors end up inadvertently living next to a party house.”Dozens of accounts on the site complain about noise levels, parking hazards and drug use near their homes. “I have listened to countless nights trying to sleep, through drunken, drugged behaviour, people roaring and screaming, night and early morning,” one user wrote. “The latest rave resulted in a near riot in front of the house when drunken partygoers screamed and fought in the front yard when the police came for the third time that day,” another said.Weber said he had looked into class-action lawsuits against Airbnb, to be brought by both hosts and guests, but the company’s air-tight terms of service agreement generally prevents any kind of legal action. Neighbor complaints may be a loophole, however, as they “never consented to this”, he said. Cities such as New York and San Francisco have created hotlines to allow neighbors to report illegal short-term rentals in their buildings. Weber said Airbnb should be doing more to address the issue.“If Airbnb did a better job of policing their own platform, this would be less of a problem,” he said. “It seems they choose profit over the safety, health and wellbeing of both their users and the neighbors.”Airbnb said it launched its “Neighbor Tool” in 2016 to help community members to “be good neighbors in the places they call home”. “Hosting is a big responsibility and those who fail to meet our standards and expectations will be subject to suspension or removal,” an Airbnb spokeswoman told the . The online form allows people who live near rental properties to file complaints about problems including “noise, party, or disturbances”, common spaces such as parking and trash collection, and “ general concerns”.And beyond just becoming a neighborly nuisance, Airbnb has faced a global backlash for the effects that converting permanent housing into holiday homes can have on entire communities. One paper from UCLA found Airbnb was “having a significant effect on Los Angeles’ housing market and is contributing to the housing crisis” in the city. The short-term rental economy has been blamed for upending housing markets in cities such as Barcelona and Paris, displacing locals and exacerbating urban inequality.Apostolos Filippas, an economist who authored the paper The Tragedy of Your Upstairs Neighbors: When Is the Home-Sharing Externality Internalized?, said the immediate effects were complicated and difficult to measure. Short-term rentals might have positive effects such as bringing money to local economies and neighborhoods often overlooked by tourists, but they in turn might raise rental costs for local residents.He and his co-author discussed both monetary and non-monetary impacts: will Airbnb cause your rents to go up? And perhaps more importantly, what does it do for your quality of life?In Manhattan Beach, the community where the emoji house is located, neighbors say owner Kathryn Kidd retaliated with a bright paint job after the community reported her for renting out her home on Airbnb illegally.The house is now bright pink and emblazoned with two large emojis, one with a zipper mouth (neighbors say it’s a “shut up” emoji) and another with eyes pointing in different directions and its tongue sticking out, both with exaggerated eyelashes. Locals say the piece amounts to “bullying” and an “F-U to the rest of the street”. Kidd claims it’s all in good fun.She hired a local artist, Z the Art, to paint the mural after she was fined $4,000 for violating city laws on short-term rentals. The unit has now been relisted on Airbnb for rentals of a minimum of 30 days at a time, in keeping with local laws.Kidd did not respond to a request for comment but previously told Easy Reader News the emojis were not intended to mock neighbors. “I’m trying not to offend anybody,” Kidd said. “I did it for the purpose of being happy, being positive, and I think it’s cute and quirky and kind of funny, and certainly was a time for the emoji.”Z the Art said Kidd mentioned none of these issues to him when he was hired for the job. She did have “three or four specific emojis in mind” and they decided on two after he made some designs. He never expected his work to be at the center of a neighborhood war.“The whole area is right up the street from the beach – I would kill to ever be able to afford property like that,” he said. “This just seems like way too much attention for a paint job there’s a lot going on in the world.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16dad25eb007cb21e8736ff0e2a4b875eeb3b3bf/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d4683ecbb8fbacb4326141df4bd5558","title":"how much does google know about you podcast","story":"Alex Hern on how Google’s use of personal data has potentially helped create a new age of mass surveillance.

While she prepares breakfast, and her husband Daniel plays with their daughters Brooke and Harper, her son Chase is engrossed in sending an email to his beloved stepgrandfather, “Pops”, his face a study in intense concentration.Nine-year-old Chase, who has the neurological condition cerebral palsy, cannot walk, talk, feed himself or pick up a pen. Yet, thanks to technology that’s widely available, he can communicate, learn and explore the online world from his family’s home in Northfleet, Kent.On his computer, “Chase uses the on-screen keyboard (OSK) tool, because he doesn’t have the fine motor skills to type on a keyboard,” says Nikki. Running on Windows 10, “it displays a visual keyboard with all the standard keys. Using a joystick that he can control with just his thumb, once he switches on the OSK, he can do everything from browse the internet to search for videos on YouTube and write emails. We introduced him to it when he was six and it really has been life-changing for him.“Because he can’t speak or type messages on a phone, being able to write emails to his friends and close family is so important to him – it helps him feel connected.“The keyboard also has a text prediction function, which suggests words for him as he types. It makes it quicker for him, and, because he has learning difficulties too, it helps him with his spelling.“When I see him on his computer, and how its technology empowers him, it fills me with confidence that as he grows up he’ll be able to lead a fulfilling, independent life. That is all I’ve ever wanted for him.”Nikki’s hopes for her son are mirrored by Microsoft’s mission to empower every person through building inclusivity into technology, such as the Windows 10 operating system, which supports the OSK and its Office 365 suite.After a normal, healthy pregnancy, Nikki says she was devastated when Chase was born with brain damage, having been deprived of oxygen during her labour.“The hardest part was the uncertainty. No one knew how severe his level of disability would be, and for the first few years of his life it felt like I was living in limbo watching and waiting to see what milestones he would reach, or not,” says Nikki.“He was diagnosed with cerebral palsy when he was nine months old, but it wasn’t until he was around three that the full extent of his disability was clear. He’s never spoken, he can’t stand unaided, and he suffers from almost constant involuntary movements of his limbs. His reading ability is closer to that of a five-year-old. He’s also incredibly loving, with a wonderful sense of humour and a very determined personality.”While Chase uses an electric wheelchair and requires round-the-clock care, Nikki says technology gives him the independence he craves.“He’s well aware his siblings and other children don’t need the same help he does. But when he’s on his computer, he feels like any other nine-year-old, because he’s in control and he doesn’t need any assistance,” says Nikki. “That means so much to him and it’s vital for his self-confidence.“I see how he puffs up with pride when he shows his little sisters, who are five and three, something he’s discovered online – his current obsession is looking at locations around the world on Google Maps. It gives him the chance to be the big brother and take the lead.”A keen gamer too, Chase uses his Microsoft adaptive controller to access his Xbox console.“We all game together as a family. It can be stressful going out because of the challenges Chase can face with poor disability access and toilet facilities.

Her living room is filled with bright and joyful prints created by herself and others. “I like so many artists and they have influenced my work. I particularly like Modigliani, Kandinsky and Picasso,” she says.Ezekiel lives with motor neurone disease (MND), and is unable to move from the neck down. Her own art – which can take months to make – is created using eye-gaze technology. An infrared bar picks up her eye movements, and this operates an on-screen mouse and keyboard. “Eye-gaze has allowed me to create again,” she says.She uses this technology not just to make her art, but in many parts of her life – from operating the TV controls to paging her carer, to using social media and writing emails. It has also enabled her to campaign on disability issues and volunteer for the MND Association, and Lifelites (which provides specialist technology for children in hospices), as well as other charities. She has won many awards, including Third Sector volunteer of the year 2016.Ezekiel’s feelings are mirrored by Microsoft, whose mission is to empower every person. This is achieved through integrating accessibility tech, such as the operating system to support eye-gaze technology, seamlessly alongside its Windows 10 and Office 365 suite.Ezekiel, who lives in Hendon, north-west London, was diagnosed with MND in 2000. At the time she was 34, and seven months pregnant with her second child. She was referred to a neurologist during an antenatal appointment the doctor immediately realised that her arm weakness and slurred speech were not due to pregnancy. Ezekiel was diagnosed with MND two months later and within a year was unable to use her hands. “I think I’ve become stronger since my diagnosis, because I’ve been through some very difficult times,” she explains.Although Ezekiel had always loved painting and drawing, and had been on a foundation course after she left school, earning a living had taken precedence over art. She worked as a personal assistant in publishing, with her ambition to become a fine artist overtaken by marriage and children then, later, by MND.In 2010, she began to use eye-gaze technology. Although she had tried different sorts of assistive technology in the years following her diagnosis, this had often proved frustrating and uncomfortable. But using her eyes to operate the computer was a huge improvement, and in 2012 she began using this tech to create art with a software program called Revelation Natural Art.As for her art practice: “I feel like it’s still developing. I’m still learning about the art software I use.” Her colourful paintings can take months to complete, but, she says: “I’ve always been very determined, my mum calls it stubborn!”Ezekiel is also glad to support other artists using this technology. “I know a few eye-gaze artists, but art is a very inidual practice and we all do our own thing. I’m often asked about the software I use and for advice, which I’m always happy to give.”The technology is also becoming more accessible to other users. Microsoft is now on hand to offer guidance and support to potential eye-gaze artists, or anyone who wants to use assistive technology with their products. The company has worked on bringing eye-gaze technology to more users and, as a result, Windows 10 includes built-in tracking support and an experience called Eye Control. This enables people with disabilities to use a compatible eye tracker, like the Tobii 4C version Ezekiel uses, which unlocks the Windows operating system. Users will then be able to operate an on-screen mouse and keyboard using just their eyes. This tech also enables text-to-speech, so when someone has typed a phrase or sentence using their eye tracker, this text can then be “spoken” by the computer.Ezekiel is very keen to improve access to technology for other people who are no longer able to speak or express themselves. And for herself, she stresses that there is always more to find out and more ways to develop as an artist. “Eye-gaze painting is very different to using hands and it’s still a learning curve for me.”Sarah Ezekiel’s art is available via her website sarahezekielWhether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

Computer software is essential to her dual career, writes  Sue George“Teaching yoga, hosting yoga brunch events and doing a full-time finance contract is pretty tiring,” says Jemma Ralston, “but it is so exciting because I am in control. All these things I am choosing to do. Yoga is my passion.”Ralston teaches ashtanga vinyasa yoga in classes across London and – alongside her new yoga business – she also works as an accountant.Ralston has a condition called Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) that leads to problems with blood clotting, causing easy bruising and prolonged bleeding. It also involves nystagmus – uncontrolled eye movements, leading to reduced vision and depth perception.After university in Glasgow, Ralston went to work in Jersey on a graduate training scheme. “I was thrown in at the deep end,” she says. “Being a trainee auditor and visually impaired wasn’t easy. A lot of my work was going through papers with a red pen.” She had to pass some tough accountancy exams. “Things take me longer to read than they might for a person with 20-20 vision. Yes, things were sometimes tough. But not that bad,” she laughs.While she was working in Jersey, Ralston started yoga classes and immediately felt the impact on her stress levels and long-term anxiety. “I felt at home. As someone who grew up with a few physical ailments, I thought: ‘I can do this! I feel relaxed!’ I understand what the instructor is telling me and I can listen to my body.”Three years later, she was working in London as a senior-level accountant at a large corporation. After a painful relationship breakup, she travelled on her own to Thailand, where she practised yoga every day for a month. “From then on, I knew I was going to be a yoga teacher. I didn’t know when. I had a successful job in the City and had worked very hard. But I knew I would when the time was right.”That time came three years ago. Her father was diagnosed with terminal cancer, and she had an incident with her blood condition where she went into cardiac arrest. “That was when I made the decision. A couple of days later, I booked my teacher training,” she says.She qualified in October 2017 and left her full-time City job three months later. Ralston began teaching classes all over London, soon deciding the best plan was to be a contractor in the finance sector while she established her yoga business.Her corporate background is a good complement to her yoga business. “Yoga teachers don’t do it for the money – we do it because we love teaching. But I would like to find a way where I can teach and live a comfortable life. I think my knowledge of finance and business models will help me on that journey.”As soon as she starts a contract in a new office, Ralston sets up Ease of Access Center in Windows 10. “I tend to ‘lose’ the mouse cursor, and the larger the monitor, the more space there is to lose it in. I make the mouse cursor bigger so I can follow it,” she says. Ease of Access options also allow her to use the Narrator function, meaning that she can hear audio descriptions of elements on the screen, something she may need if her sight deteriorates.The Ease of Access Center enables Ralston to increase the size of, and contrast within, documents. Working with spreadsheets for her own business, or with financial modelling for clients, she uses Excel and changes the text to be white on a black background. She also finds the search function helpful, rather than having to look through documents for particular figures.Right now, she has yoga brunch events to organise, and technology can help with that. “When I am on the computer for a long time, I use the Magnifier tool because my eyes get tired, especially for things like proofreading,” she says. “It’s about independence. These things are here to help everyone.“I can accept my body as not perfect – but no one’s is,” she continues. “We all have our limitations and have things we can excel at. It’s about appreciating what you can do.”Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

Sue George finds out howLike many teenagers, Ella Warren-Roberts, 14, is very creative. She makes slate jewellery, she does woodcutting, and paints in watercolours. “She always has more than one project on the go,” says her proud mother, Glenda Roberts. “And she always completes them.”“So I don’t get too stressed out on one thing, I can relax by doing another,” says Ella. This lively, cheerful teenager also really likes science but, until recently, she wasn’t able to shine at it. She struggled reading science questions and her work took too long. But now, she is third in her year at chemistry.Ella is a day pupil, and Glenda is a teacher, at St David’s college, an independent boarding and day school in north Wales for children aged nine to 19. The school prides itself on teaching mixed classes, where pupils with additional learning needs, and those with none, work together to reach their full potential. Many of the pupils, like Ella, have dyslexia, and teachers, such as Glenda, have been trained at Bangor University to work with dyslexic learners. Some teachers bring their dogs to work, which pupils – including Ella – find very calming. “I have anxiety, and animals really help me. They aren’t judgemental,” she says.Using a computer for her schoolwork has also played a part in reducing Ella’s anxiety – which came about because it took her longer than others to complete certain tasks. “It made me feel more stupid than anyone else,” she says firmly. But now she realises that she isn’t stupid and her past problems with reading and writing have eased greatly.The apps and programs available with Office 365 allow this to happen smoothly. For instance, the school has a OneNote account used by both pupils and teachers. OneNote is a collaborative digital notebook that can be typed into, drawn or written on, and visual or audio clips can be added to it. Teachers use it to compile worksheets pupils then work on them online.Glenda points to the Microsoft Edge immersive reader, part of Microsoft’s learning tools, and the assistance this tool can give learners across a range of programs, including OneNote and Word. For instance, it can highlight words or sentences, or split inidual words into their component syllables – something that can also help anyone learning in an additional language.Ella uses it to change the background colour on her screen: she finds it easier to read on a sepia tone, where there is no glare. Previously, she relied on teachers printing worksheets on coloured paper. Then there is the choice of fonts. She can immediately choose a font she finds legible. “I used to be behind everyone else, but now I’m on target,” she says.For Glenda, Microsoft programs have also been a big help. Last year, she was away from work for nine months after being diagnosed with endometrial cancer. “I was in dire straits,” she says. “They gave me three months to live.” She is currently on the anti-cancer drug Avastin and is still going to the Christie hospital in Manchester for treatment.OneNote helped her feel less isolated when she was off work, and even in hospital the apps on her phone helped her keep track of how her pupils were getting on. “I might be part-time, but I am invested,” she says confidently.Using the Microsoft Teams platform, she was able to see what they were learning and could make comments to help their teachers.Both Glenda and Ella are physically active, doing the Race for Life 5k together. They live in an area where outdoor activities are popular people come to the family’s Airbnb to enjoy the nearby mountaineering. Her school also gives Ella the opportunity to enjoy another of her hobbies: wakeboarding. This sport is similar to waterskiing, but with one board instead of two skis. Ella describes it as “like snowboarding, if the snow had melted”.Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops, whatever your need.

The Jamaica Gleaner reported her as saying the artefacts were taken during early archeological digs when the island was still a British colony. She said the pieces were made by the Taíno, the indigenous people of the Caribbean encountered by the 15th-century western explorers.“They are not even on display,” Grange said. “They are priceless, they are significant to the story of Jamaica and they belong to the people of Jamaica.”She said ministers were working with the National Commission on Reparations, a group established in 2009, to have them returned.Taíno objects are in a number of European and north American collections. The British Museum artefacts arrived in the early 20th century from a collection built up by William Ockleford Oldman. A spokesperson for the museum said it had not received any official communication from Jamaica’s culture ministry.“Two Taíno objects, a stool and a standing figure have been on public display in the Enlightenment gallery since 2009,” the spokesperson said. “Taíno objects in the collection have been lent extensively to India, Japan, Spain, France, Singapore and the Horniman Museum in London. The Taíno ritual seat was part of the A History of the World Tour which has been seen by more than a million people at multiple venues from 2014-18.“The British Museum has a number of ongoing collaborative research projects with colleagues and island governments in the Caribbean.”The issue of repatriating objects is one of the most pressing debates in the museum world and was given extra impetus by a report commissioned by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, published in late 2018.The report by Felwine Sarr and Bénédicte Savoy recommended full restitution of objects and artworks taken without consent from their countries of origin.As well as Jamaica’s request, Greece wants the British Museum to return the Parthenon Marbles and Ethiopia wants objects taken during the Battle of Maqdala. Talks are ongoing for some of the spectacular Benin Bronzes to be loaned to a new cultural hub in Benin City, Nigeria.The debate arouses strong passions. The historian David Olusoga has talked of “a special version of Supermarket Sweep where every country is given a huge shopping trolley and two minutes in the British Museum.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ffbb91a5fe3aa9758a1656705d96f19e26beb149/0_117_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48046775361997b4059bbbe098e2497b","title":"puerto rico governor ousted pedro pierluisi","story":"Puerto Rico’s supreme court overturned the swearing-in of Pedro Pierluisi, who was appointed by disgraced Ricardo RossellóPuerto Rico’s supreme court on Wednesday overturned the swearing-in of Pedro Pierluisi as the island’s governor less than a week ago, clearing the way for the justice secretary, Wanda Vázquez, to take up the post after weeks of turmoil.Vázquez took the oath of office in the early evening at the supreme court before leaving without making any public comment. She became just the second woman to hold the office.“I will continue to focus on helping our people regain their way in an orderly and peaceful fashion,” she said in a statement in which she promised to assume the position with “humility and commitment”.The high court’s unanimous decision, which could not be appealed, settled the dispute over who will lead the US territory after its political establishment was knocked off balance by big street protests spawned by anger over corruption, mismanagement of funds and a leaked obscenity-laced chat that forced the previous governor and several top aides to resign.But it was also expected to unleash a new wave of demonstrations because many Puerto Ricans have said they don’t want Vázquez as governor.Pierluisi said that he had stepped forward to help islanders “in the best good faith and desire to contribute to the future of our homeland”, but that he would respect the court’s ruling.Pierluisi was appointed secretary of state by the then governor, Ricardo Rosselló, while legislators were in recess, and only the house approved his nomination. Pierluisi was then sworn in as governor on Friday after Rosselló formally resigned in response to angry street protests.Puerto Rico’s senate sued to challenge Pierluisi’s legitimacy as governor, arguing that its approval was also necessary, and the supreme court held in favor of the senate.On Monday the senate decided not to hold a vote, although the body’s president, Thomas Rivera Schatz, said Pierluisi had only five of 15 required votes. The same day the supreme court announced it would hear the case.The senate had also asked the court to declare unconstitutional a portion of a 2005 law saying a secretary of state need not be approved by both house and senate if they have to step in as governor. Puerto Rico’s constitution says a secretary of state has to be approved by both chambers.The court agreed that the clause was unconstitutional.Six of its nine judges were appointed by governors from Pierluisi’s party, the pro-statehood New Progressive party, and three by the main opposition Popular Democratic party. The senator leading the challenge to Pierluisi is in his party.Vázquez became justice secretary in January 2017 and has limited experience leading government agencies. She previously worked as a district attorney for two decades at Puerto Rico’s justice department, handling domestic and sexual abuse cases, and in 2010 was appointed director of the Office for Women’s Rights.Some critics say that as justice secretary she was not aggressive enough in pursuing corruption investigations involving members of her New Progressive party, and that she did not prioritize gender violence cases.Last November, the Office of Government Ethics said it had received a complaint about possible ethical violations involving Vázquez, who was accused of intervening in a case involving a suspect charged with stealing government property at a home where Vázquez’s daughter lived.Vázquez appeared in court to face charges including two violations of a government ethics law. In December a judge found there was no evidence to arrest her.Rosselló’s resignation followed nearly two weeks of protests amid anger over corruption, mismanagement of funds and a leaked obscenity-laced chat in which he and 11 other men including government officials mocked women, gay people and victims of Hurricane Maria, among others."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/837d72a61ee8cde932e9e9c64c6d7f06c4719387/0_247_7360_4418/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=911e37500efa5a59e618234e38e0eeac","title":"rome spanish steps fascist style measures against tourists","story":"Police patrol 18th-century marble steps, blowing whistles at visitors sitting downThe authorities in Rome have been accused of applying “fascist-style” measures after police began shooing resting tourists away from the staircase of the famous Spanish Steps.Police began patrolling the 18th-century marble steps on Tuesday, blowing whistles at those sitting down. The monument, a Unesco world heritage site, has long been the ideal resting spot for tired visitors and holds a special allure at sunset.But people could be fined €250 simply for sitting down on one of the 136 steps that lead up to the Trinità dei Monti church, and up to €400 for dirtying or damaging the steps in their wake.The measure is among a number of rules reinforced by the authorities in early June, including a ban on “messy eating” by monuments, wandering around bare-chested, jumping into fountains, and dragging wheeled suitcases and pushchairs down historic staircases.“Protecting a monument is fine, and obviously you shouldn’t eat on the steps, but the ban on sitting down is really excessive,” Vittorio Sgarbi, a controversial art critic and former deputy minister of culture, told AdnKronos news agency. “It seems to me to be a fascist-style provision that the municipality will be forced to review.”“We agree that people shouldn’t ‘camp out’ and eat on the steps of monuments, as rubbish gets left behind,” said Tommaso Tanzilli, a director at the Rome unit of Federalberghi, the Italian hotels association. “But criminalising people for sitting down, especially if they are elderly, is a little exaggerated.”Claudio Pica, president of Fiepet-Confesercenti, in Rome, said the rule was absurd and would drive tourists away.The monument, designed by the architect Francesco de Sanctis between 1723 and 1726, underwent a €1.5m restoration in 2016, funded by the luxury jeweller Bulgari.Similar measures are in place in Venice, with stewards patrolling the steps of the porticos that surround St Mark’s Square and other monuments throughout the summer. The exercise of moving people away is often futile, as unwitting visitors soon replace them. But authorities there do take tough action against those who flout the “decorum” rules: in July, two German tourists were fined €950 and asked to leave the city after being caught preparing themselves coffee on a camping stove on the steps of the Rialto Bridge.And the rich and famous are not excluded from Italy’s rules. The newlywed German model Heidi Klum and her husband are reportedly facing a €6,000 fine for swimming in Capri’s Blue Grotto. The couple, who married on the island on Saturday, allegedly ed into the turquoise waters of the cavern from a yacht shortly before sunset on Monday. People can visit the grotto by boat, but swimming is strictly forbidden.As Rome and other Italian cities continue their crackdown on “uncouth” behaviour, you might get in trouble if you do any of the following:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/381b64207174b1d4f25b274e98009a1e8d9c149d/0_156_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84e82e409f08f2e9455b5d18d6f392b8","title":"syria turkey and us reach deal to manage tensions over kurds","story":"Joint operation centre agreement follows Ankara threats to launch offensive against YPGTurkey and the US have agreed to establish a joint operation centre to manage tensions between US-backed Kurdish militia and Turkish forces in northern Syria.The announcement from the Turkish government came after three days of tense negotiations with US officials hoping to forestall a Turkish attack on the Kurdish YPG group, which controls large swathes of northern Syria.Turkey sees the YPG as a terrorist offshoot of the Kurdish PKK, which has fought a bloody insurgency inside its territory for the past 35 years.The defence ministry said in a statement that Ankara had agreed with US officials to “implement without delay” the first measures aimed at eliminating Turkey’s concerns.“In that framework, to quickly create in Turkey a joint operation centre to coordinate and manage the implementation of the safe zone with the US.”Ankara has stepped up threats in recent days to launch an offensive against the YPG.That put the United States in a difficult position as a Nato ally of Turkey but also a supporter of the YPG as its main frontline partner against the Islamic State.Both sides agree that a buffer zone is needed to keep the YPG away from Turkey’s borders, but they have erged on how large it should be, or who should control it.The defence ministry said Turkey’s ultimate aim was to create a “peace corridor” that can “ensure that our Syrian brothers will be able to return to their country”.Unprecedented protests demand civil liberties and the release of political prisoners after four decades of repressive rule by the Assad family. The regime represses demonstrations in Damascus and the southern city of Deraa but protests continue.Defecting army colonel Riad al-Asaad sets up the Turkey-based rebel Free Syrian Army. Islamist groups join the revolt.Regime forces take control of the rebel stronghold in Homs after a month of bombardment. Other bloody operations are carried out, notably in the central city of Hama, after massive anti-regime protests.FSA fighters launch a battle for Damascus but the government holds firm.More than 1,400 people die in a chemical weapon attack on rebel-held districts near Damascus.The US and Assad ally Russia agree a plan to eliminate Syria\u0027s chemical weapons, averting punitive US strikes against the regime.Hostilities between jihadists and rebel groups turn into an open war in the north. The group that will become known as Islamic State takes Raqqa – the first provincial capital to fall out of regime control – from rebel forces.A US-led coalition launches airstrikes against Isis in Syria. The strikes benefit Kurdish groups, which since 2013 have run autonomous administrations in Kurdish-majority areas.Russia launches airstrikes in support of Assad\u0027s troops, who are on the back foot. Russian firepower helps turn the tables for the regime, which begins to retake rebel-held territory.Russia and Iran, as backers of the Syrian regime, and Turkey, a supporter of the rebels, organise talks in Kazakhstan, between representatives of both sides. The process leads to the creation of four de-escalation zones.A sarin gas attack on the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhun kills more than 80 people, prompting Washington to attack a regime airbase.Further complicating an already drawn-out conflict, Turkey launches an operation against the Kurdish People\u0027s Protection Units which, with US support, played a key role in beating back Isis.Regime launches a ferocious assault on the remaining rebel-held enclave near Damascus, eastern Ghouta. In under four weeks, the Russian-backed onslaught kills more than 1,200 civilians.Turkey has the highest number of Syrian refugees in the world at more than 3.6 million and has faced increasing pressure domestically to speed up repatriations to peaceful parts of the country.The talks come at a delicate moment between Turkey and the US, who have grown increasingly estranged over a number of issues, including American support for the Kurds and Turkey’s decision to buy a Russian S-400 missile defence system."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3979981.1565217290!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cervicalcheck sends letter with incorrect test results to 400 women","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tProf Brian MacCraith: his report urged the HSE to move quickly to ensure CervicalCheck becomes a well-structured, strongly-led organisation. Photograph: Nick BradshawApproximately 400 women whose cervical smear test results were delayed for months in the latest cancer screening controversy, have this week received a letter with incorrect information about those results.This latest mistake has emerged in the wake of the publication of the MacCraith report on the 4,088 women affected by an IT failure and human error.The report by DCU president Prof Brian MacCraith found that in the case of 873 women who had a repeat HPV test, no results were sent to them or to their GP for over six months and, in the remaining cases, GPs were informed but not the women concerned.The HSE on Wednesday confirmed that almost half of the 873 women received a letter in the last week from CervicalCheck that “contained an inaccuracy”.The newest error in the ongoing cancer saga emerged after a woman contacted The  following publication of the MacCraith report.Preferring to identify herself only as Ms Scullion, she said she was one of the 873 women who had not received any results of a repeat test for HPV, the virus that can cause cancer.She received a letter on August 6th, but dated August 1st which told her: “Please be assured that as expected your HPV re-test result is unchanged from your original smear test of the above date (July 2018) and remains HPV negative.”Ms Scullion said she is HPV positive, known from a previous testing and investigation.‘Mail merge’She said the letter appeared to be a “mail merge”, an automated letter to multiple recipients, and “looks like an administrative error”.She contacted CervicalCheck who “apologised profusely” and confirmed it as an administrative error. Ms Scullion said she will attend for her next test at the end of the year.But she expressed concern that “a letter that is meant to put your mind at rest, makes you worry even more” and said this new error might be illustrative of what Prof MacCraith found, that “too few people within CervicalCheck are managing too many projects”.Ms Scullion said that “I just couldn’t believe it. It’s just embarrassing that there is yet another mistake and you start wondering what else will happen.”The MacCraith report urged the HSE to move quickly to ensure CervicalCheck becomes a well-structured, strongly-led organisation with good management practice and an active culture of risk management.In a statement, the HSE said in the letters sent out, “we also confirmed that the result of these women’s HPV re-test was unchanged ‘and remains HPV negative’. However, for some women, this should have read ‘and remains HPV positive’. This was an error on our part and we are very sorry for any confusion it may have caused.”Further testingThe HSE stressed that at the time of the original HPV-positive result, the women’s GPs would have recommended further testing.“We are nonetheless again very sorry for any confusion or distress this error may have caused. We will be writing to women involved, as a matter of priority, to correct this error. We have already communicated directly with a small number of women who have contacted CervicalCheck on this issue.”The revelation came as Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Health Simon Harris met cervical cancer campaigners about a formal State apology to the women and families affected by the ongoing controversy.Mr Varadkar is expected to make a formal apology in the Dáil when it resumes in the autumn. Lorraine Walsh, whose test results were misdiagnosed, and Stephen Teap, whose wife Irene Teap died of cervical cancer, represent the 221-plus patient group and discussed all aspects of the State’s role in the CervicalCheck controversy with Mr Varadkar and Mr Harris.The HSE has said any woman with concerns could contact clientservices@cervicalcheck.ie or phone 01-8659392."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Documents shows public displeasure at jailing of Sutton GP Dr Bassam Naser for tax evasionPatients waiting six months told they are HPV negative when actually HPV positiveMajority of messages received by department seek harsher punishment of criminalsNBCI investigating claims inspector worked as security consultant for Coolmore StudRight-wing conservative youth group says Foley-Walsh was at the conference in a \u0026lsquopersonal capacity\u0026rsquoOireachtas committee report raises concerns about multibillion-euro roll-outFormer garda says he sees correspondence from commissioner as a vindicationAcademics say use of electronic devices is difficult to police in crowded exam hallsHuman rights panel in Belfast hears calls for appointment of covert policing commissionerHSE data shows \u0026euro200m wasted yearly over lack of step-down care, says Sinn F\u0026eacutein TDForensic mental health occupational therapist among the contestants this yearFamily of John Boreland, shot dead in north Belfast in 2016, say \u0026lsquobroken lives will never be healed\u0026rsquoPeople who work with horses close to the Border say their industry has been \u0026lsquoabandoned\u0026rsquoExpenses claimed since 2015 yet Senator\u0026rsquos site \u0026lsquonews section\u0026rsquo last updated two years agoMichael D\u0026rsquoArcy says countries such as Ireland may require pan-EU financial supportMore than 540 patients admitted to hospitals across State are without bedLawyers for Cork man say late member of Beatles also faced issues over cannabis convictionFunds business Val Issuer has served notice to quit to tenants in number of older properties"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3979889.1565203588!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"would a united ireland see everyone together standing tall","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUnlike other sporting bodies, the IRFU stayed together after partition, but the anthem issue always rankled with players from an Ulster Unionist background, leading to Phil Coulter writing Ireland’s Call. Photograph: Bryan KeaneInpho. Ireland’s Call will never be anybody’s favourite song, but it’s a noble example of the compromises a united Ireland would involve, and it does have at least one outstanding virtue. It works.The Irish rugby team, which will go into this year’s World Cup as one of the favourites, is itself a model for what all-island co-operation can achieve.Unlike other sporting bodies, it stayed together after partition, but the anthem issue always rankled with players from an Ulster Unionist background, especially after 1987, when an IRA bomb meant for Judge Maurice Gibson also injured three northern rugby players heading south to play for their country.After a farce at that year’s inaugural World Cup in Australia, when a bad tape recording of James Last playing The Rose of Tralee deputised for Amhrán na bhFiann, there was no anthem at all for Ireland’s only away game during the 1991 tournament. The IRFU then commissioned Phil Coulter to come up with something fans from both political traditions could sing.His simple ballad has since suffered much scorn, some terrible singing, and many letters to The . But it has gained a grudging acceptance. Now supporters from the “four proud provinces” belt it out with something like gusto, alongside the Soldier\u0027s Song when the team plays in Dublin, exclusively when they play away.Coulter was a good choice for the job, being from a city whose very name ides its citizens and became one Northern Ireland’s many shibboleths, used by both sides as an identity marker. Here was the “narcissism of small differences” par excellence. But thanks to various local compromises, an uneasy peace prevails, while the “Derry-stroke-Londonderry” example, has spawned a humorous meme for similar resolutions of minor conflicts.Where else might an agreed Ireland find common ground?SymbolWell, there’s also the harp, which is both the Republic’s official State symbol and part of the British royal standard. In a country where even musical instruments can be politicised - fiddles tend to be Catholic and flutes Protestant, at least in mid-summer - the harp too might once have been forced to take sides.But after the demise of the Gaelic Ireland, when Queen Elizabeth’s troops were ordered to “hang the harpers and burn their instruments”, harping was deliberately revived during the United Irishmen era, and by patriotic Belfast Presbyterians to boot. It has since become ubiquitous as a shorthand for Ireland, adoring everything from Ryanair planes to the pint of Guinness.The harp’s unifying credentials remain impeccable and would surely feature as part of any new Irish flag. It wouldn’t even have to be the republican green. The existing Presidential standard has a gold harp on a background of blue, Ireland’s “other” official colour.The shamrock would also remain a very important symbol in any new state, not least for the excuse it gives Irish politicians (North and South) to converge on the White House every March 17th.The St Patrick’s Day parade may be contentious in Belfast, but unionist politicians have been happy to enjoy the red carpet treatment rolled out to all of Ireland - uniquely among the small nations of the world - in Washington every March.CapitalSpeaking of Washington, itself a compromise capital\u0026nbspconceded by the yankee north to southern states, would Ireland also require a new political capital? It’s impossible to imagine Dublin ever being supplanted now as the island’s dominant city and the revival of Royal Tara is unlikely - it was hard enough to move the OPW to Trim - even if that were an acceptable compromise to Ulster.But perhaps Áras an Uachtaráin would need to be relocated to Armagh, which managed to remain the ecclesiastical capital of Ireland throughout a century of partition and despite being at the centre of some of the Troubles’ worst events.This is not to assume that the Áras would still have a president, of course. That question too would be on the table and unionists might well prefer to leave the residence in the Phoenix Park while reinstalling a Viceroy, or something similar.In any case, symbols may be the easy part of an agreed Ireland. Elsewhere there would be a world of wrangling over questions of real power. Establishing a common foreign policy for the combined jurisdictions might be nearly as challenging as it is for all the countries of the EU.Then there are the legal systems. Would they be unified, and if so how? And health? The existing Republic might happily adopt a British-style NHS overnight, but could a new 32-county state afford it?On the plus side, that would be a lot of stitches holding the two sides of a reunited Ireland together while old isions healed. But would careless drivers henceforth be breaking the speed limit in miles or kilometres? Would the fines be in euro of sterling?These and a thousand other questions would have to be teased out before the agreed flag could be run up a pole for the first time, wherever that might happen."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3979893.1565204483!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"private ownership of national broadband network unfair","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Government is going ahead with the broadband project despite the advice of some who caution the €3 billion programme does not represent good value.A draft Oireachtas committee report into the national broadband plan has said it is “unfair” the network will be owned by a private investor despite a multibillion-euro investment by the State.The cross-party Oireachtas Committee on Communications is in the process of compiling a report into the controversial broadband plan, and met on Wednesday to formulate a number of recommendations on how to proceed with the project.A draft version of the report, seen by The , also raises concerns around the governance of the broadband plan and the length of time the rollout of the network will take.It emerged earlier this year that the Government was going ahead with the project despite the advice of some senior officials who cautioned that the €3 billion programme did not represent good value for money.State subsidy“The joint committee is concerned that, given the amount of the State subsidy for the project is much greater than the initial outlay from the investor, it appears unfair that the resulting network will be owned by the investor rather than the State. This could create the impression that the State is largely paying for the construction of an asset which will be owned by private interests,” the report states.Concerns were also raised about why only one member of the board of the National Broadband Ireland company would be appointed by the Minister, while eight would be appointed by the investors.The report says the Department of Communications has stated “that the sole responsibility of the board is to deliver the NBI contract” and that it will report to the department regularly.Consortium’s interestsDespite this, “the joint committee is unclear as to how that responsibility will safeguard against the board being more concerned with the interests of the consortium, who appoints the bulk of the members, above the State’s interest”.The length of time it will take to roll out the new network is also raised in the document.In the preface, the committee chair and Fine Gael TD Hildegarde Naughten said the committee felt it had “no option” but to investigate these issues before the final contract was awarded and said that it was “vital” the Government “get this process right and at the same time not delay the process unduly”. The report is due to be finalised at the end of the month.Documents released earlier this year showed that Department of Public Expenditure officials also suggested the State was investing most of the money and assuming most of the risk, while a private company would garner many of the benefits."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3978650.1565109359!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"droughts force thousands to abandon way of life in somaliland","story":"Locals in Carracad, Somaliland, have been hit by drought and cyclones, threatening their agricultural way of life. Video: Concern \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tKhadan Mohammed Hamed (19): She knows about climate change and soil erosion from her biology class and realises that combination has eroded a way of life.  Photograph: Gavin DouglasConcern WorldwideThey are the vanguard of a cohort likely to soon number many millions of people in climate-vulnerable locations across the planet.They are crammed into supposedly temporary camps to cater for the tens of thousands of villagers forced off the land because of sustained droughts.Conditions in settlements on the outskirts of Hargeisa, the capital of Somaliland, and near the city of Borama are primitive – so many people living in close proximity without running water or toilets and with little electricity.Home is in the form of a flimsy makeshift tent, a corrugated iron shack or a tiny house of one room, two at best. Solid waste and vast amounts of plastic are intermittently heaped on the side of narrow streets. There is next-to-no public lighting. What there is comes courtesy of small solar panels, giving a hint of what could be in terms of comfort and safety if the cheap renewable energy source was more fully deployed.Water supplyWater is trucked in, the same way 70 per cent of Hargeisa is supplied, though there are plans to build a water supply system with international support. For now, water has to be boiled, invariably by way of a wood fire, before consumption.Listening to their stories of forced migration, many are clearly traumatised at having to abandon a rural way of life, which up to a few years ago was feasible in spite of intermittent drought. Many pine to return to the land but they know it is not feasible.They are officially described as “internally displaced people” (IDPs), forced to flee their home but who remain within the country’s borders. In reality, most are climate refugees.In Somaliland, a self-declared state in east Africa twice the size of Ireland, they are estimated to total 600,000 people, though that number can rise sharply in response to drought, flooding or a cyclone, events occurring more frequently due to climate disruption.Through interpreters, the common thread emerges: loss of livestock due to more frequent droughts and not enough water to sustain their pastoral existence. In contrast, increased floods are often a contributory factor, as they wash away crops, turn fields into gulleys and undermine attempts to ersify. It ends with the inevitable move to the city and for some a camp, where they have lived for almost 10 years.With dignity, women outline their personal circumstances in an unvarnished way. In more ways than one they are household heads and look after money efficiently. Sometimes it’s a consequence of husbands and sons still working in rural areas.Listening to their stories and observing their surroundings is enough to graphically illustrate arduous circumstances. It is a harrowing experience because their distress is palpable and yet solutions seem obvious and inexpensive to an outsider.The three camps near Hargeisa – Dgalli (9,000 people in 1,500 households), Mooga A (3,000 people, 500 households) and Mooga B (1,300 people, 225 households) – are barely a few kilometres apart.Sahra Badal, who has been five years and seven months in Dgalli, still describes herself as a pastoralist. A orcee with five children, she had 35 goats and a donkey to sustain the family. Now it’s just three goats that wander around stony land with little vegetation where the camp is located – most goats in the vicinity have a tag around their neck with the mobile phone number of their owner.Selling fruit“Life is very difficult but cash helps,” she says, referring gratefully to monthly support of $60, which enables her to send her children to school and helped her set up a small business selling fruit and vegetables.Her neighbour Nura Ismail Saed, who is two years in the camp, would prefer to move back to the rural area from which she came with her five children but she suggests this is unlikely. Asked if that made her sad, she replies: “A lot, a lot.”In Mooga B, which has the least facilities – no shops, no school, no available land nearby, the women repeatedly highlight the absence of toilets one describes how a pregnant woman had to be brought to a mobile health clinic in a wheelbarrow.Indications of emerging resilience are the only heartening aspect in the face of such poverty. Milgo Ahmed Hashi sells milk from her home, which she buys in from Hargeisa. With no refrigeration, she uses plastic bags in an attempt to keep it cool and plans to have it all sold by 5pm daily so it doesn’t sour. The profits enable her to feed and clothe her 10 children. She hopes there will soon be enough to send her children to school.Khadan Mohammed Hamed (19) completed her secondary education, and though she failed her exams as she was affected by her mother’s death at the time, she hopes to resit them. “I hope to continue, to become a doctor,” she adds. She knows about climate change and soil erosion from her biology class. She realises that combination has eroded a way of life for “people, who were successful farmers, and not farmers any more”.That resilience is obvious the next day when visiting a more established settlement, Ayah 4. A large sign indicates 350 concrete housing units were constructed by UN-Habitat with support “from the people of Japan”. There is an air of permanency though some still live in traditional tents. Many are reconnecting with land nearby (provided by the government) and have more significant livestock numbers. Local commerce is evident with tiny shops, a local market and a small cafe selling tea.Self-help groupsIt is clear that self-help groups, including some aimed at teenagers, set up with support from Concern Worldwide and other aid organisations, are helping to form a backbone for the community.Emerging entrepreneurship is real. Some have savings, which suggests better prospects and quality of life may be realisable. But it means also hard questions have to be faced up to among large sections of what were once nomadic people, according to the director of the Somali Cash Consortium, Alessandro Bini. Is urbanisation, including a shift to small business and services industry, the best option for most of these people? Does it mean pastoralism must change to agriculture which is inevitably more intensive, entailing, for example, pesticides?Implemented correctly, he believes more sustainable communities are possible – backed by “a long-term, predictable safety net” covering the basic needs of a good proportion of the population on a constant basis.Drought year after year makes rural communities weak and vulnerable, according to Abdi-Rashid Haji, Concern Worldwide’s Somalia country director, who recalls how a woman illustrated her plight to him by placing a stick in a piece of muddy, unstable ground, adding: “This was my farm.”“That is when you lose confidence and you end up in an IDP camp,” he says.In building resilience development organisations are acutely conscious that repeated drought prompts negative coping strategies, such as child marriage and labour, school dropouts and family separation.Displacement also gives rise to concerns about safety and security, and underlines the need for child protection. Sexual and gender-based violence in camps is an additional risk. In that scenario, female-headed households, children, older people, those with disabilities and marginalised communities are especially vulnerable to abuse, as well as disease and malnutrition.Reports indicate some urban IDPs in Hargeisa and Burao cities are experiencing “extreme food security outcomes” and the official classification “catastrophe” is figuring more frequently. A visit to a Save the Children health clinic on the outskirts of Borama confirms how close communities, even those in IDP camps, are to famine.Lack of sanitationOut of 1,633 children under five assessed between September and December last year, 319 were “moderately malnourished” and 150 “severely malnourished”.Similar levels have been recorded this year, before the worst effects of the latest drought are predicted to kick in. Poor hygiene arising from a lack of sanitation gives rise to widespread diarrhoea, especially among the young, which further exacerbates their vulnerability.The increasing lure of the city is summed up by Roda Osman living in the rural village of Jir Jir. She has 13 children, three of whom are staying with relatives in the city of Borama and attend secondary school there. She hopes they will get a scholarship to go to university or get a job. “Without education, life is without light,” she adds.Droughts and Cyclone Sagar reduced their livestock to 10 goats and two camels. Crops in recent years have only yielded fodder. She is surviving because of cash payments via mobile from Concern. Fearing further livestock losses, she is quietly banking on her children already in the city, and a hope that with a job they will be able to build a house “and take us to the city”.* Kevin O’Sullivan

spree","story":"Two women in Muslim dress were caught in an apparent attempt to use their outfits to steal dozens of items from a supermarket.The women were stopped by security guards at an Asda branch in Dagenham, East London, after being suspected of trying to leave with an estimated £200 worth of tins of baby formula hidden in their clothing.Video footage taken by a local shopper appeared to show one of the woman taking items from what appeared to be a bag or pouch hidden under the long, black robe she was wearing after being confronted by security staff at the store last Saturday evening.Both women were wearing hijabs and black abayas, the headscarf and loose robe-like garment worn by some Muslim women.At one stage one of the woman pulls up the dress, revealing her tummy and underwear, in what appears to be an attempt to show she is not hiding any more items.Some of the items the women are alleged to have attempted to stealThe Asda employees can be seen covering their eyes and turning away as the woman walks towards the exit whilst holding up her black dress, leaving behind her a pile of around 20 discarded items. Her actions prompted several onlookers to question whether they were Muslim at all, with some saying no observant woman would either shoplift or expose herself in a similar manner. One Muslim mother of two shopping in the store on Wednesday told The :  “It’s not the first time it’s happened, where they dress up in abayas. It’s wrong and I\u0027ve seen it done before all around the world. It\u0027s wrong.Another shopper, who herself wears a hijab and abaya, wrote on Twitter: “If she’s Muslim or not she’s giving us Muslim women a bad light and if she is Muslim then may Allah guide her.”Another Twitter user, named only as Abdul, wrote: These people aren’t Muslim they’re those people who live in and around east London and have exploited the fact that it’s predominantly Muslims around here and to be honest Muslims are very generous people in giving towards charity and these frauds know this. Be aware everyone.”Security staff surround the two women at the Dagenham AsdaA senior Muslim community leader, who asked not to be named, told The : “It’s highly unlikely religious Muslim women would do this, but different Muslims do different things. If these women were Muslim and were attempting to shoplift they certainly should not be doing so. Both these acts, shoplifting and lifting up their dresses, go against what Muslims should be doing in the first place.”Asda staff did not immediately report the incident to the police, waiting until yesterday to do so, and the whereabouts of the two women are currently unknown.A spokesperson for Asda said: “We do not tolerate any form of shoplifting and work hard to deter shoplifters from our stores. “All cases of attempted theft are taken seriously and we always work closely with the local police force in the communities we serve. “We are in contact with Dagenham Police about this incident and would like to thank colleagues at our Dagenham store for their quick intervention and response in this case.”The politan Police said its officers were investigating the incident but had made no arrests at this stage.A Scotland Yard spokesman said: “We are aware of footage circulating on social media of two females having been stopped by staff members at a commercial premises at Merrilands Crescent, Dagenham on suspicion of theft. “The incident occurred on Sunday, 4 August between 19:30hrs and 19:45hrs. The two suspects are suspected of having attempted to steal infant formula. The incident was reported to police at 13:22hrs on Wednesday, 7 August. At this early stage there have been no arrests.” Police officer critically injured in London machete attack during vehicle stopReducing air pollution could cut 44,000 cases of asthma in childrenA third of millennials want martial law and 66 per cent prefer strong leader over parliament, poll findsPublic put at risk by release of young offenders without a suitable place to live, say prison inspectorsJohn McDonnell threatens to march on palace and tell Queen: \u0026#39We\u0026#39re taking over\u0026#39 if Boris Johnson loses no confidence voteRyanair pilots vote to strike as British Airways computer meltdown leaves passengers strandedComment: When the moment comes, Boris Johnson should enlist the Queen\u0026#39s help in foiling the Remainers\u0026#39 undemocratic plot\tBafta \u0026#39will not tolerate\u0026#39 token cinema releases from Netflix or othersBodies found in Canada hunt for teenage fugitives suspected of three murdersAlbanian crime gangs using Facebook to counter immigration raids and smuggle illegal immigrants into BritainRemoval of British Isil fighters citizenship backed in first high court judgementSurge in women taking up sport of shooting lifts firearms ownership to record highNo 1p or 2p coins were struck last year for the first time in decadesBanker drowns himself in private swimming pool after becoming convinced he was going to prisonDominic Raab invited for \u0026#39warm\u0026#39 meeting with Donald Trump after impromptu introduction by Jared Kushner Comment: What would it take to give Britain a truly world-class pension system? Kashmir residents say they are starving as first accounts of  India\u0026#39s lock-down of region emergeBBC presenter Jane Hill: healthy living helped me recover from breast cancer surgeryFans concerned over Disney plan to remake Home Alone after purchase of 21st Century FoxWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/06/12/apple-card.jpg","title":"apple card credit iphone ios 13 release date when uk","story":"IM Subscribe NowIM Subscribe NowCreated with Sketch.IM  Subscribe NowIM  Subscribe NowSubscribe NowSubscribe NowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Try Independent Minds free for 1 monthSee the optionsClick to followThe Independent TechApple has started rolling out its new payment\u0026nbspcard to a small set of users.The card is a virtual payment system which sits in the iPhone and allows people to pay with their device.

Instead, the card\u0027s number is stored on a secure chip inside the iPhone, which generates virtual numbers for online or over-the-phone purchases requiring a number.Apple has focused on privacy, saying that purchase information is stored on the user\u0027s iPhone and that it cannot see the information. Goldman will not be allowed to use data for marketing purposes, even for selling other Goldman products.But at Apple\u0027s size - $265.6 billion in sales for fiscal 2018 - the revenue matters less than the effect on keeping Apple customers tied to its brand, analysts said, said Ben Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies.If it works, it\u0027s one more thing that causes you to stay deeply loyal and entrenched in the Apple ecosystem, even if something better comes along, he said.Additional reporting by ReutersBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Whether your passion is in science or the arts, it’s a way to express yourself.”So, the company’s latest initiative, in conjunction with the Mayor of London, may not be surprising. Apple’s daily collection of free events in its stores, called Today at Apple, is going on the road to community organisations with a series called Made in LDN.The Mayor’s involvement makes clear the need for bigger investment in youth services and activities for young Londoners to get involved in across the capital, which will provide the key skills they need to reach their full potential.\u0026nbsp“I am determined to do everything I can to provide positive opportunities for young people this summer and that’s why I am pleased to be working with Apple on a series of programmes to help young people develop the skills they need to get the jobs of tomorrow, while also ensuring they have something constructive and safe to do during the summer holidays, London Mayor Sadiq Khan said.Massive Government cuts have decimated youth services in our city over the last nine years, but through my Young Londoners Fund I’m committed to providing young people with the activities and skills they need to make the most of their potential.”Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Chief engineer of LIFT aircraft Balazs Kerulo demonstrates the company\u0027s Hexa personal drone craft in Lago Vista, Texas on June 3 2019225 Project Scarlett to succeed Xbox OneMicrosoft announced Project Scarlett, the successor to the Xbox One, at E3 2019.

This is a production preview of the Jaguar I-PACE, which will be revealed next year and on the road in 2018One of the first events was at Shapeways.io, a technology hub for young people to learn digital skills such as coding, Adobe Photoshop and more. But, as Obed Yeboah from the organisation explains, the idea is to harness these technological elements (Apple brings its hardware and software to the events for participants to use) and match them to other skills. Yeboah ides these into soft skills such as expressing yourself confidently and hard skills like being able to code a website.“A lot of organisations talk to young people about how to communicate, which doesn’t work for this generation. You have to embed it into something that they would actually do, which, in most cases is around tech, because they use it every single day, Yeboah said.We attach the soft skill, the interpersonal skills development, to a hard skill because it’s very difficult to actually measure soft skills. I mean, the young person can tell you, yeah, I’m confident, but for us to know that they’re confident, we\u0026nbspput them in a scenario where you’re talking about a project with a client, or you’re teaching young people the skills that you’ve learned.”But do some skills lend themselves better than others? After all, coding can be quite a solitary pursuit that may not seem suitable for team building.“With coding, well, if you get a project then you’re not working by yourself. Because you need a group of designers, you need a group of coders and, if the client needs a video, you’re working with videographers as well. It gives you that teamwork element.”Yeboah is frank about how they are able to address issues young people are facing.“A lot of kids come in because they want communication skills. Communication is one of the biggest reasons why a lot of young people don’t speak to anyone about how they are feeling and don’t end up making decisions based on how they feel, Yeboah said.\u0026nbspThey end up doing things that you wouldn’t want a young person to be associating themselves with. If they’re involved in gang culture, or something like that, you realise that is purely based on the fact that they feel misunderstood... The challenge is, how do we build a team of young people to harness what they already love, what they already engage with, such as tech, even if they might be doing something that goes against the rules in other parts of their lives. Once you put them in the same room together, then they’re tackling real issues through learning a skill. So now, when you leave Shapeways.io, you don’t only know how to express your feelings but you also have a hard skill that you can use if, say, you want to go into further education.”Molly Aldridge, 18, went to Shapeways.io after a work experience placement. She had no experience of coding but after taking the HTML and CSS courses at Shapeways.io, is now proficient enough that she teaches coding to primary school children. “I felt that it was easy to learn how to teach coding because it allowed me to further my skills by talking aloud to other people. We talked to each other about how to teach. So, we were able to tell each other if we had something wrong. Which then gave us more confidence for when we would actually teach children.”She was at the first Apple Made in LDN session. “It was a workshop where we learned how make an app, designing what it looked like and adding functionality, she said.\u0026nbspIt was completely new to me. I’ll need some more classes to really get to grips with it. I do more web-based design. So, it opened up another area of coding that I haven’t really looked at or considered before. I had believed that app development was something really complicated, and you needed different software to make it possible. But the workshop showed me that all it really took was this one app that I could use to not only handle the design aspects of it but also use to test out the functionality and how the app would actually work on a device such as an iPhone.”Rohan Coleman, 19, used Procreate, a magnificent creative drawing and painting app, at his Made in LDN session. He said:\u0026nbsp“I’ve never had an outlet to express the ideas I get in my head like that. I feel like I’ve gained the opportunity to explore designing myself – instead of having to rely on someone else to realise my ideas.”Yeboah is emphatic about the benefits.“With Apple Made In LDN, we bring in 40 young people to learn coding and design using Apple’s technology.\u0026nbsp Apple is going into different London boroughs to engage young people with this technology and give them another way into society, which I think is amazing. If we go into a community centre, to run a workshop, it can be difficult to pull in a lot of young people. Our brand isn’t on the same level as Apple.\u0026nbsp And for the young people in south London, or east London, them doing anything with Apple is almost a dream. Nobody in the streets or, you know, nobody in gang culture dreams as far as working with Apple or being trained by Apple. It’s almost like it made them feel, ‘Wow, I’m actually being trained by Apple, I’m in that same environment as them. There’s an opportunity for me to change my life.’ ”Finally, the sessions themselves aren’t the last part of the jigsaw, as Yeboah explains: “A lot of young people are out on the streets or doing bad things purely because there isn’t a choice, there isn’t an alternative: education is not working for them. And for them to survive in the workplace, they don’t know how to. Now, if I’m in an Apple Store, or if I’m working with Apple, then it should give them that kind of realisation that anything is possible.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It soon bounced back and by mid-July it was back trading at around $13,000.\u0026nbspBut even heavier losses were to come, as bitcoin once again fell towards $9,000 at\u0026nbspthe end of July. A week of positive price movement may well be proceeded by another nosee, however some market analysts believe that this time there may be more gains to come.One reason for this is bitcoin gaining a reputation as a safe haven asset, allowing\u0026nbspinvestors can theoretically pile money into the cryptocurrency when traditional markets are looking shaky. With rising trade tensions between the US and China, as well as growing uncertainty surrounding Brexit, bitcoin could see an influx in investments over the coming weeks and months.Created with Sketch.Bitcoin\u0027s volatile history in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Satoshi Nakamoto creates the first bitcoin block in 2009On 3 January, 2009, the genesis block of bitcoin appeared.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearOne cryptocurrency expert predicts that the bitcoin price “could hit $15,000 within weeks”, to take it to its highest level since January 2018, and within just $5,000 of its all-time high.“Bitcoin is becoming a flight-to-safety asset during times of market uncertainty,” Nigel Green, chief executive of financial consultancy firm deVere Group, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.“Bitcoin is currently realising its reputation as a form of digital gold. Up to now, gold has been known as the ultimate safe-haven asset, but bitcoin – which shares its key characteristics of being a store of value and scarcity – could potentially dethrone gold in the future as the world becomes increasingly digitised.CoinMarketCap)This analysis appears to be reaffirmed by recent data analysis by Bloomberg, which found that bitcoin’s price correlation to gold has almost doubled over the last three months.Jeremy Allaire, CEO of one of the largest cryptocurrency payment firms Circle, also pointed to geopolitical events when justifying bitcoin’s latest price rise. In a recent interview with\u0026nbspCNBC, Mr Allaire pointed to two of bitcoin’s key characteristics – a finite supply, and decentralised infrastructure- that make it such an attractive investment.“You can very clearly see some macro correlation there,” he said. “Rising nationalism, rising amounts of currency conflict, trade wars, these all obviously are supportive of a non-sovereign, highly secure digital store of value.”Can Norwegian waterfalls stop bitcoin from destroying the planet?Other analysts suggest that bitcoin\u0027s volatility can also be attractive to investors who want to ersify their portfolio by adding a risky asset that could provide huge gains.This is the view of Marcus Swanepoel, CEO at cryptocurrency firm Luno, who said this tactic had been successfully adopted by a number of private and institutional traders in recent months.It is now clear that investors put money into cryptocurrency when the main markets are falling, Mr Swanepoel told\u0026nbspThe Independent.\u0026nbspThe strategy of using gold or the yen as a safe-haven asset and at the same time buying digital assets to potentially produce a high return, is gaining momentum.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I have my doubts,” he told BBC Radio 4.\u0026nbspHe added that in such a scenario supplies shouldn’t be directed just to supermarkets as a priority but to schools and hospitals as well.\u0026nbsp“We could be in a sort of wartime situation of a limited amount of food rationing… I don’t think we’ll get to that but I’m very concerned about the groups who aren’t in the supermarket chain, how they will deal with things. We have to prioritise – who can prioritise except the government itself?”If the waiver is granted allowing food producers to manage supply disruptions as a group, it will not do anything to stem rises in food prices. According to the FDF, prices will “inevitably” increase because trading under WTO rules will be more expensive and firms will also pass on to consumers the costs of preparing\u0026nbspfor a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe comments add to earlier warnings that a chaotic departure from the EU would lead to food shortages and higher prices.\u0026nbspMark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, said last week food imports would be disrupted if Britain’s ports are not ready in time to handle a sudden surge in customs checks. He added that a no-deal Brexit would slash the value of the pound, immediately raising food prices.\u0026nbspAnd on Monday Tim Lang, professor of food policy at City University, warned that the UK’s food supply faces levels of disruption “unprecedented” in peacetime. The public has so far been kept “largely in the dark” about the government’s view on the gravity of the situation that could unfold, he wrote in The Lancet.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Competition law prohibits such cooperation.\u0026nbsp“We asked for these reassurances at the end of last year and, despite support from Defra, we’re still waiting,” Mr Rycroft said.Speaking to BBC Radio 4 on Wednesday, he said shortages would affect “random” products, depending on “which trucks get through”, and that supplies would be disrupted for weeks or months after the Brexit date.\u0026nbspLord Haskins, former chair\u0026nbspof Northern Foods, agreed\u0026nbspfood shortages are likely if Britain crashes out of the EU, and warned of potential panic-buying which would exacerbate them.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 51Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Beer enthusiasts taste beer and ale during The Great British Beer Festival at Kensington Olympia in west London.

I have my doubts,” he told BBC Radio 4.\u0026nbspHe added that in such a scenario supplies shouldn’t be directed just to supermarkets as a priority but to schools and hospitals as well.\u0026nbsp“We could be in a sort of wartime situation of a limited amount of food rationing… I don’t think we’ll get to that but I’m very concerned about the groups who aren’t in the supermarket chain, how they will deal with things. We have to prioritise – who can prioritise except the government itself?”If the waiver is granted allowing food producers to manage supply disruptions as a group, it will not do anything to stem rises in food prices. According to the FDF, prices will “inevitably” increase because trading under WTO rules will be more expensive and firms will also pass on to consumers the costs of preparing\u0026nbspfor a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe comments add to earlier warnings that a chaotic departure from the EU would lead to food shortages and higher prices.\u0026nbspMark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, said last week food imports would be disrupted if Britain’s ports are not ready in time to handle a sudden surge in customs checks. He added that a no-deal Brexit would slash the value of the pound, immediately raising food prices.\u0026nbspAnd on Monday Tim Lang, professor of food policy at City University, warned that the UK’s food supply faces levels of disruption “unprecedented” in peacetime. The public has so far been kept “largely in the dark” about the government’s view on the gravity of the situation that could unfold, he wrote in The Lancet.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

to decide where to prioritise shipments - they will have to provide cast-iron written reassurances that competition law will not be strictly applied to those discussions,” FDF\u0027s chief operating officer Tim Rycroft told the BBC.\u0026nbspIn the markets, Asian stocks were down on Wednesday while European bourses gained in morning trading.\u0026nbspDominic Raab, the foreign secretary, has\u0026nbsppraised Donald Trump and his deputy Mike Pence for their warmth and enthusiasm for the UK-US relationship.\u0026nbspRaab says he was delighted to meet the pair on his three-day trip to the US in hope of paving the way for a post-Brexit trade deal.The UK looks forward to working with our American friends to reach a free trade deal that is good for both countries, and co-operating on the common security challenges we face.\u0026nbspE.On is the latest “Big Six” energy supplier to blame the government’s price cap for plummeting profits.The cap, which will be reduced this winter, is supposed to stop firms ripping off loyal customers.The German utility’s earnings from UK retail customers crashed 78 per cent in the latest quarter.Customer numbers fell by around 200,000 to 6.4 million in the three months to March.Bad news for E.On today but good news for about 15 million households who will see their energy bills fall this winter.\u0026nbspAnnual energy bills will go down by £75 on average for 11 million households on standard tariffs and by £25 for customers who pay for their gas and electricity upfront.\u0026nbspOfgem, the energy regulator for England, Wales and Scotland, is lowering the price caps for the October to March period due to lower wholesale energy prices.Full story here from Olesya Dmitracova:Energy bills to fall for 15 million households this winter as Ofgem lowers price capsExecutives at Hargreaves Lansdown will give up their bonuses after the Woodford fund fiasco, Reuters\u0026nbspis reporting.\u0026nbspAccording to the nes agency\u0027s source, Hargreaves\u0027 chief executive Chris Hill, Chief financial officer Philip Johnson, chief investment officer Lee Gardhouse and research director Mark Dampier, will take no bonus for 2019.\u0026nbspHargreaves plugged Woodford\u0027s fund through its best buy list and received fees for referring customers.\u0026nbspHundreds of thousands of Hargreaves Lansdown customers who ploughed their savings into Woodford\u0027s flagship fund have had their money frozen since June and it will likely stay there until at least December as the once highly regarded stock picker tries to sort out the mess he is in.\u0026nbspWoodford invested in riskier unlisted stocks which he couldn\u0027t get rid of fast enough when a long run of poor performance prompted people to demands their cash back.House prices have fallen for the second successive month, Halifax says.The average UK house price was down 2 per cent in July to\u0026nbsp£236,120 following a 0.4 per cent monthly decline in June.However, the lender said prices were still up 4.1 per cent in the year to July.Brexit uncertainty will weigh on the UK housing market over the next few months according to analysts at the EY ITEM Club.\u0026nbspConsumers may well be particularly cautious about committing to buying a house, especially as house prices are relatively expensive relative to incomes, says Howard Archer.\u0026nbspHouse prices are still far higher compared to earnings than the average over the last 35 years.\u0026nbspAccording to the Halifax, the house price to earnings ratio was still as high as 5.59 in July after spiking to 5.72 in February (the highest level since November 2017) from 5.39 in January this is well above the long-term (1983-2019) average of 4.29.\u0026nbspAnd it is questionable whether recent growth in jobs numbers and earnings can be sustained months as companies tailor their behaviour to a lacklustre domestic economy, prolonged Brexit uncertainties and a challenging global environment.\u0026nbspTherefore Archer forecats\u0026nbspthat house prices will rise by no more than 1.5 per cent in 2019.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspTesla is in a spot of bother in the US.\u0026nbspBloomberg\u0026nbspreports that Elon Musk\u0027s firm has been scrutinised over safety claims on its Model 3 the car intended to take electric vehicles truly into the mainstream.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspUS\u0026nbspNational Highway Traffic Administration reportedly sent a cease and desist letter last year, taking issue with Tesla\u0027s\u0026nbspclaim that the Model 3 had achieved the lowest probability of injury of any vehicle the agency ever tested.So, what exactly is Britain\u0027s food industry saying it needs the government to do to prevent food shortages after Brexit?\u0026nbspIt\u0027s trade body wants firms\u0026nbspto be allowed\u0026nbspco-ordinate and direct supplies with each other if Britain crashes out of the EU on 31 October.\u0026nbspThey cant do that under current rules which prevent them colluding. Those\u0026nbspmeasures are designed to ensure adequate competition and result in the best outcome for consumers.The Food and Drink Federation (FDF) said: “We asked for these reassurances at the end of last year, but we\u0027re still waiting.”\u0026nbspThe industry says that an October Brexit would be disastrous for food supplies because warehouses are already full in the run-up to Christmas.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOne retailer told the BBC that 31 October\u0026nbsp“is about the worst day you can pick”, as warehouse capacity is at 105 per cent\u0026nbspin November, versus 75 per cent - 80 per cent\u0026nbspin March.The government isn\u0027t being entirely up-front about the potentially dire consequences of no-deal Brexit for fresh food and drink supplies, according to a leading academic on the topic.\u0026nbspTim Lang, professor of food policy at City University, warned earlier this week that the UK’s food supply faces levels of disruption “unprecedented” in peacetime.\u0026nbspWhat does that mean?\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\tThe government estimates that half of lorries entering the country will be unable to cross the border smoothly\tThe flow of trucks could drop by a third within a day of a no-deal Brexit\tFood prices predicted to rise by more than 10 per cent as costs rise and supplies fall.Professor Lang warns\u0026nbspthat Britons, particularly those on lower incomes, already under-consume fresh fruit and vegetables, and food banks are not fully prepared for shortages, which could have a negative impact on diets and public health.\u0026nbspFull story here:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBrexit food shortages: Government being secretive over public health risks of no dealThousands of holidaymakers have had their flights cancelled due to more technology failures at British Airways.\u0026nbspSimon Calder has counted\u0026nbsp86 cancellations to and from Heathrow so far today, including one round-trip to New York and dozens of flights to Mediterranean resorts.

Unfortunately, even the food industry, which has tested a range of options to mitigate the effect of massive disruption at Dover, doesn\u0027t really know.\u0026nbspFood and Drink Federation boss Tim Rycroft tells the BBC:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThere will be selective shortages and they will to some extent be random because it depends on which trucks get through and which don\u0027t. We think there will be some serious disruption and it will go on for weeks or months after our exit.The government is unlikely to grant the food industry\u0027s wish for\u0026nbsprelaxed rules to alleviate food supply problems, says Mark Jones, partner at law firm Gordons. Big supermarkets\u0026nbspprobably won\u0027t\u0026nbspbe on board either.Jones says: “The ‘big four’ control almost 70 per cent\u0026nbspof the market and if any of them have a supply chain advantage post-Brexit, it offers them an opportunity to gain market share, says Jones.\u0026nbspI cannot see them wanting to help their competitors. They will want to help their own customers.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“As to suppliers, if they can sell the stock they have, they will, and they may well be able to make a better profit if supply is tight. \u0026nbspIf they cannot sell or use their raw materials, there is nothing stopping them picking up the phone to their competitors and selling raw materials now. \u0026nbspRelaxing rules on anti-competitive behaviour is, in my view, unlikely to help shortages and I cannot see the Government going for it.”\u0026nbspThe pound is a quarter of a per cent lower against the dollar so far today at $1.2137, not far off the 31-month low of $1.2080 it hit last week.\u0026nbspAgainst the euro, sterling is down 0.1 of a cent, leaving it slightly above the 23-month low reached yesterday.\u0026nbspWith little to look out for on the economic calendar, Connor Cambell, financial analyst at Spreadex, predicts markets will remain incredibly susceptible to the minutiae of the trade war and comments from Donald Trump.Twitter has revealed it may have used some people\u0027s personal data to target them with advertising without their permission because of issues within the platform\u0027s settings, the\u0026nbspPress Association\u0026nbspreports.The social media giant said it had recently discovered issues in its website where settings choices may not have worked as intended, resulting in some gathered data being used to personalise advertising.Twitter said it fixed the issues on 5 August.In a blog post discussing the problems, Twitter detailed how, in one case, data may have been shared with advertisers despite not receiving user permission to do so.Donald Trump\u0027s trade war with China has pushed oil prices to a new seven-month low as the outlook for the global economy looks increasingly bleak.\u0026nbspBrent crude is down 0.6\u0026nbspper cent to $58.31.\u0026nbspThe US president attacked Beijing this week for allegedly manipulating its currency to make Chinese exports more competitive.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe UK government is yet to respond to a request by the food industry to waive parts of competition law so that companies can cooperate after a no-deal\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspto mitigate\u0026nbspfood shortages.\u0026nbspFull story from business and economics editor Olesya Dmitracova here:\u0026nbspBrexit: UK food industry asks for rule waiver to tackle food shortages after no-dealOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This can be damaging, not only to the share price, but also to investor confidence.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

to decide where to prioritise shipments - they will have to provide cast-iron written reassurances that competition law will not be strictly applied to those discussions,” FDF\u0027s chief operating officer Tim Rycroft told the BBC.\u0026nbspIn the markets, Asian stocks were down on Wednesday while European bourses gained in morning trading.\u0026nbspDominic Raab, the foreign secretary, has\u0026nbsppraised Donald Trump and his deputy Mike Pence for their warmth and enthusiasm for the UK-US relationship.\u0026nbspRaab says he was delighted to meet the pair on his three-day trip to the US in hope of paving the way for a post-Brexit trade deal.The UK looks forward to working with our American friends to reach a free trade deal that is good for both countries, and co-operating on the common security challenges we face.\u0026nbspE.On is the latest “Big Six” energy supplier to blame the government’s price cap for plummeting profits.The cap, which will be reduced this winter, is supposed to stop firms ripping off loyal customers.The German utility’s earnings from UK retail customers crashed 78 per cent in the latest quarter.Customer numbers fell by around 200,000 to 6.4 million in the three months to March.Bad news for E.On today but good news for about 15 million households who will see their energy bills fall this winter.\u0026nbspAnnual energy bills will go down by £75 on average for 11 million households on standard tariffs and by £25 for customers who pay for their gas and electricity upfront.\u0026nbspOfgem, the energy regulator for England, Wales and Scotland, is lowering the price caps for the October to March period due to lower wholesale energy prices.Full story here from Olesya Dmitracova:Energy bills to fall for 15 million households this winter as Ofgem lowers price capsExecutives at Hargreaves Lansdown will give up their bonuses after the Woodford fund fiasco, Reuters\u0026nbspis reporting.\u0026nbspAccording to the nes agency\u0027s source, Hargreaves\u0027 chief executive Chris Hill, Chief financial officer Philip Johnson, chief investment officer Lee Gardhouse and research director Mark Dampier, will take no bonus for 2019.\u0026nbspHargreaves plugged Woodford\u0027s fund through its best buy list and received fees for referring customers.\u0026nbspHundreds of thousands of Hargreaves Lansdown customers who ploughed their savings into Woodford\u0027s flagship fund have had their money frozen since June and it will likely stay there until at least December as the once highly regarded stock picker tries to sort out the mess he is in.\u0026nbspWoodford invested in riskier unlisted stocks which he couldn\u0027t get rid of fast enough when a long run of poor performance prompted people to demands their cash back.House prices have fallen for the second successive month, Halifax says.The average UK house price was down 2 per cent in July to\u0026nbsp£236,120 following a 0.4 per cent monthly decline in June.However, the lender said prices were still up 4.1 per cent in the year to July.Brexit uncertainty will weigh on the UK housing market over the next few months according to analysts at the EY ITEM Club.\u0026nbspConsumers may well be particularly cautious about committing to buying a house, especially as house prices are relatively expensive relative to incomes, says Howard Archer.\u0026nbspHouse prices are still far higher compared to earnings than the average over the last 35 years.\u0026nbspAccording to the Halifax, the house price to earnings ratio was still as high as 5.59 in July after spiking to 5.72 in February (the highest level since November 2017) from 5.39 in January this is well above the long-term (1983-2019) average of 4.29.\u0026nbspAnd it is questionable whether recent growth in jobs numbers and earnings can be sustained months as companies tailor their behaviour to a lacklustre domestic economy, prolonged Brexit uncertainties and a challenging global environment.\u0026nbspTherefore Archer forecats\u0026nbspthat house prices will rise by no more than 1.5 per cent in 2019.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspTesla is in a spot of bother in the US.\u0026nbspBloomberg\u0026nbspreports that Elon Musk\u0027s firm has been scrutinised over safety claims on its Model 3 the car intended to take electric vehicles truly into the mainstream.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspUS\u0026nbspNational Highway Traffic Administration reportedly sent a cease and desist letter last year, taking issue with Tesla\u0027s\u0026nbspclaim that the Model 3 had achieved the lowest probability of injury of any vehicle the agency ever tested.So, what exactly is Britain\u0027s food industry saying it needs the government to do to prevent food shortages after Brexit?\u0026nbspIt\u0027s trade body wants firms\u0026nbspto be allowed\u0026nbspco-ordinate and direct supplies with each other if Britain crashes out of the EU on 31 October.\u0026nbspThey cant do that under current rules which prevent them colluding. Those\u0026nbspmeasures are designed to ensure adequate competition and result in the best outcome for consumers.The Food and Drink Federation (FDF) said: “We asked for these reassurances at the end of last year, but we\u0027re still waiting.”\u0026nbspThe industry says that an October Brexit would be disastrous for food supplies because warehouses are already full in the run-up to Christmas.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOne retailer told the BBC that 31 October\u0026nbsp“is about the worst day you can pick”, as warehouse capacity is at 105 per cent\u0026nbspin November, versus 75 per cent - 80 per cent\u0026nbspin March.The government isn\u0027t being entirely up-front about the potentially dire consequences of no-deal Brexit for fresh food and drink supplies, according to a leading academic on the topic.\u0026nbspTim Lang, professor of food policy at City University, warned earlier this week that the UK’s food supply faces levels of disruption “unprecedented” in peacetime.\u0026nbspWhat does that mean?\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\tThe government estimates that half of lorries entering the country will be unable to cross the border smoothly\tThe flow of trucks could drop by a third within a day of a no-deal Brexit\tFood prices predicted to rise by more than 10 per cent as costs rise and supplies fall.Professor Lang warns\u0026nbspthat Britons, particularly those on lower incomes, already under-consume fresh fruit and vegetables, and food banks are not fully prepared for shortages, which could have a negative impact on diets and public health.\u0026nbspFull story here:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBrexit food shortages: Government being secretive over public health risks of no dealThousands of holidaymakers have had their flights cancelled due to more technology failures at British Airways.\u0026nbspSimon Calder has counted\u0026nbsp86 cancellations to and from Heathrow so far today, including one round-trip to New York and dozens of flights to Mediterranean resorts.

Unfortunately, even the food industry, which has tested a range of options to mitigate the effect of massive disruption at Dover, doesn\u0027t really know.\u0026nbspFood and Drink Federation boss Tim Rycroft tells the BBC:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThere will be selective shortages and they will to some extent be random because it depends on which trucks get through and which don\u0027t. We think there will be some serious disruption and it will go on for weeks or months after our exit.The government is unlikely to grant the food industry\u0027s wish for\u0026nbsprelaxed rules to alleviate food supply problems, says Mark Jones, partner at law firm Gordons. Big supermarkets\u0026nbspprobably won\u0027t\u0026nbspbe on board either.Jones says: “The ‘big four’ control almost 70 per cent\u0026nbspof the market and if any of them have a supply chain advantage post-Brexit, it offers them an opportunity to gain market share, says Jones.\u0026nbspI cannot see them wanting to help their competitors.

The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)Although the film may feel relatively slight compared to the other titans of animation on this list, there is something so wonderfully zen about this Pooh, filtering the wise words of AA Milne through the slow, thoughtful tones of Sterling Holloway. Bambi isn’t exactly the most action-packed Disney film around, and it’s hard to imagine many people are getting a kick out of the singalong version to “April Showers”. But is there any bigger shock to the system for a child at the movies than the sudden, ruthless slaughtering of Bambi’s mother?Of the Disney Renaissance offerings, Pocahontas stumbles in its messy handling of history, since turning any interaction between white colonisers and indigenous people into a fluffy romance arguably whitewashes the brutal reality of what happened. But there are plenty of positives to be found, since Pocahontas was such a huge influence in Disney’s later portrayals of strong, independently minded women. The film may be relatively light on story (it’s basically Lady and the Tramp, but there’s an added kidnap element), but who cares, when the film features the hottest party of the entire Disney franchise? It’s true what they say: “Everybody wants to be a cat.” In a way, Robin Hood is the ultimate Disney film of the 1970s. It’s a folksy, low-key entry into the canon that’s all about keeping the peace and spreading good vibes. Just ignore the fact that it recycled several pieces of animation from the likes of Snow White and The Jungle Book.It may not have spawned the same level of craze as Frozen did, but Zootopia doesn’t deserve to become another forgotten Disney film. Although it’s as funny as you’d hope from a film about animals with jobs, it also offers parents an easy entry point to talk to their kids about racism and xenophobia. And that’s something that shouldn’t be taken for granted. Dumbo demonstrates the two gifts of early Disney films. There’s the capacity for moments that are pure and heartwrenching, as seen in “Baby Mine” (a scene that’s almost impossible to watch without welling up). Then there’s the ability to descend into the totally bizarre, as characterised by the downright scary “Pink Elephants on Parade” sequence. Tangled finds fun, humour, and adventure in its reimagining of the Rapunzel tale, but what’s crucial to its success is how it anchors the entire film around a single, showstopping sequence: “I See the Light”, where Rapunzel watches hundreds of paper lanterns float up into the skies. It’s, quite simply, a beautiful piece of filmmaking. 930 22. Princess and the Frog (2009)Disney’s brief return to traditional animation reminded us what had been lost in the switch to 3D animation. There’s a wonderful sense of artistry to how The Princess and the Frog renders New Orleans during the Jazz Age, especially in the Art Deco stylised number “Almost There”. And a Disney princess working hard to make her dreams come true? That’s something to celebrate. Although Cinderella is a central member of the Disney princesses, her film hasn’t aged quite as well as the rest of the early Disney films. There’s an odd amount of time spent on Lucifer the cat, and relatively little time spent at Cinderella’s magical soiree. 1130 20. One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961)Cruella de Vil may have committed attempted puppy murder, but there’s still something irresistibly delightful about her “Patsy from Ab Fab” combination of luxury goods and frightening taste. Only Cruella could answer a simple “How are you?” with the line: Miserable darling, as usual, perfectly wretched.”1230 19. Lady and the Tramp (1955)One of several films on this list containing problematic material, Lady and the Tramp certainly isn’t a faultless film. However, given that the central courtship is between two dogs, the film boasts a surprisingly elegant love story. Not only is there the famous “Bella Notte” scene and its accidental spaghetti kiss, but the crooning Pekingese, voiced by Peggy Lee, is simply sublime.Disney took the straightfoward path to making a hit musical for today: they hired Lin-Manuel Miranda. The Hamilton composer and lyricist is a maestro when it comes to cranking out the hits. Opetaia Foa\u0027i helped create the soundtrack’s South Pacific touches, while Dwayne Johnson even wheeled out some light rapping for his performance as the demigod Maui. Moana tells a culturally specific story with spirit, heart, and humour – more of this in the future please, Disney. The Emperor’s New Groove never quite got the appreciation it deserved when it was first released, largely because, like Lilo \u0026amp Stitch, it’s been tossed aside as another forgettable post-Disney Renaissance entry. Not so fast: though it may not have the epic scale of Mulan or Beauty and the Beast, The Emperor’s New Groove is a funny, endlessly quotable (“Pull the lever, Kronk!”) Disney film that – most importantly – finally let Eartha Kitt voice a Disney villain. It may be every modern parent’s least favourite Disney film, but Frozen is actually pretty great if you’ve not been forced to watch it five times a day, seven days a week. On top of a moving central story about self-acceptance and sisterly love, Idina Menzel’s rendition of “Let it Go” is a showstopper tune that demands to belted at least once at every karaoke night. A flight of fancy that celebrates the power of imagination, JM Barrie’s Peter Pan was always an obvious fit for Disney. The film presents an uplifting and limitless world to younger audiences, while letting the adults pretend miserable things like taxes and orce don’t exist for a precious hour and a bit. Plus, Tinker Bell seems like a vicious gossip and the ideal person to go for a drink with, even if she doesn’t quite speak our language. 1730 14. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)It’s the film that started it all. Although Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has since been overshadowed by its successors to some degree, it still has its fair share of magical moments. There’s the small army of birds and rodents that come to Snow White’s aid during “Whistle While You Work”, and the Evil Queen, gone full Joan Crawford, delivering her oft misquoted line: “Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all.”A round of applause for John Musker, who had the idea of telling the Greek myth of Hercules through a chorus of gospel singers. They are, without a doubt, the true heroes of this film, thanks to the insanely catchy “Zero to Hero”. That said, Megara’s definitely a close runner-up for the title, since her “I’m a damsel. I’m in distress. I can handle this” routine made her the go-to Disney princess for the cool kids. Let them deny it all they want, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find a Nineties kid who hasn’t secretly put “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” on their workout playlist. The whole film, in fact, is a power anthem, while Mulan’s one-woman feminist revolution makes her one of those rare multitasking princesses who can do a lot more than just win over a handsome prince. As the very last film to be produced by Walt Disney himself, The Jungle Book marked the end of an era for the studio. The film captures the kind of easy charm that made Disney’s work such a huge part of so many childhoods in the first place. As Baloo eases into “The Bear Necessities”, it feels very much like someone’s come to gently pat you on the shoulder and tell you everything’s going to be alright. Aladdin may have plenty of tricks up its sleeve, but it deserves its place in the upper echelons of Disney films purely on the strength of Robin Williams’s performance as Genie. The comedy actor recorded over 18 hours of additional improvised material for the film, and the finished product is one of the greatest existing tributes to his manic energy as a performer, alongside his vast gallery of impressions. 2230 9. Alice in Wonderland (1951)Another magnificent adaptation of complex source material, Disney’s take on Alice in Wonderland doesn’t get lost in Lewis Caroll’s maze of wordplay, but cooks up its own delightful nonsense. Alice gets read to filth by a patch of garden flowers, Ed Wynn’s Mad Hatter oozes moneyed eccentricity, and there is a general psychedelic vibe to the whole affair. Alice in Wonderland was initially a flop, but there’s no denying its status as a cult classic now. 2330 8. The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996)The Hunchback of Notre Dame is easily the most adult Disney film ever made. There’s religious hypocrisy, lust, genocide, prejudice, violent misogyny, infanticide, and corruption – take your pick! Although Disney certainly used a little creative license in adapting the 19th-century Victor Hugo novel (there are no singing gargoyles in the original, sadly), it’s surprising how fluently its central themes have been translated without threatening the film’s PG rating. 2430 7. Lilo and Stitch (2002)Although it was technically released in the dip that followed the Disney Renaissance, Lilo \u0026amp Stitch is a highly underrated entry that deserves to sit among the classics. Few Disney films speak to real experiences like it does. Look past the alien intruders and Stitch’s more unusual characteristics, and you’ll find a reminder that family is defined only as those who love and support us, no matter where we find them. It’s a simple but pure message, elevated by a cast of characters who act and speak like those we recognise in our own lives. This is the Disney film that comes closest to a David Lynch fever dream. Putting “When You Wish Upon a Star” – the song that best captures Walt Disney’s dream – aside for a moment, let’s remember just how much of a surrealist nightmare the Pleasure Island sequence really is. “Be virtuous or you’ll be turned into a literal donkey,” was quite the threat for an America only recently freed from the grip of Prohibition. It’s a weird and wonderful entry from Disney’s early years. We’re free to question Ariel’s decision to trade her voice so she can chase after a cute guy she met only once, but she will always remain the most loveable dinglehopper-collecting weirdo around. Ariel’s unquenchable curiosity is what makes this aquatic tale so charming, second only to the fact its villain was inspired by the legendary Divine. Plus, “Under the Sea” is such a party tune. Sleeping Beauty is Disney’s most beautiful film, thanks to the fact artists John Hench and Eyvind Earle drew heavily from Medieval tapestries, Renaissance art, and even Japanese prints. It gives the feeling of actually flipping through a storybook, as Aurora wanders a forest that looks as if it’s made entirely of stained glass. And, truly, has there ever been a Disney villain as deviously elegant as Maleficient? One of Disney’s boldest and most avant garde films, Fantasia is simply masterful in its concept. A musical education for many young viewers, the film pairs classical pieces with short animated stories, each wildly different and inventive in its own right. Although Mickey’s appearance in The Sorcerer’s Apprentice has had a life of its own outside of the original film, anyone who grew up with Fantasia is probably more likely to remember the nightmares Chernabog gave them – the Night on Bald Mountain sequence is unlike anything else in the Disney canon. 2930 2. Beauty and the Beast (1991)If you need a sign of exactly how impressive a piece of filmmaking Beauty and the Beast is, reflect on the fact that a love story between a woman and a buffalo-bear-man is the first animated film ever to have been nominated for an Academy Award. And this is nearly two decades before The Shape of Water brought interspecies romance to the ceremony. This is truly “a tale as old as time”, with a lush Alan Menken score (with lyrics by Howard Ashman) and a smart, relatable heroine in Belle. Produced at the height of Disney’s Renaissance in the 1990s, The Lion King is an epic testament to what animation can achieve as a medium. Can it match the power of its source material, William Shakespeare’s Hamlet? Well, when Rafiki lifts an infant Simba up to the skies, as an entire kingdom of savannah creatures bows in servitude, all soundtracked to “Circle of Life”, you can’t help but feel momentarily convinced. A film of stunning vistas, heart-wrenching tragedy, and memorable musical moments, there’s no doubt that The Lion King deserves its place as one of the greatest animated films of all time. 130 30. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)Although the film may feel relatively slight compared to the other titans of animation on this list, there is something so wonderfully zen about this Pooh, filtering the wise words of AA Milne through the slow, thoughtful tones of Sterling Holloway.

This is a production preview of the Jaguar I-PACE, which will be revealed next year and on the road in 2018These 5G capabilities appear to be confirmed in the official invite to the Unpacked event, in which Samsung describes the Note 10 and Note 10+ as new devices designed to take the Galaxy ecosystem\u0027s connectivity to the next level.Several leaks have revealed an Infinity-O design for its screen, as well as a powerful Snapdragon 855 processor. Other specs include a 3,500mAh battery, 8GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage space for the Note 10, and a 4,300mAh\u0026nbspbattery, 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage space for the Note 10+.A major update to the S-Pen stylus is also expected.One of the few things that remains a mystery is the price of the Note 10 and Note 10+, though a leak from Russia suggests the Note 10 will cost around £900. This would make it £100 more expensive than the Galaxy Note 9, which cost £799 at launch.Other rumours hint that the Note 10 and Note 10+ release date will be on 21 August, though pre-orders will likely open shortly after the official unveiling on Wednesday.Inside Samsung’s pivotal struggle to deliver Galaxy FoldSamsung is not the only major smartphone maker to be plagued by leaks, with major launches from Apple, Google and Huawei often softened by months of rumours and leaks in the build up to the official unveiling.In an apparent attempt to take back control from the leakers, Google recently revealed some of the most central details of its new Pixel 4 phone, months ahead of its anticipated release date.Today we\u0027re giving you an early look at the technology behind two new features coming to Pixel 4 that make your phone more helpful and represent a next step in our vision for ambient computing, the technology giant stated.The unorthodox move may also serve to undermine its rivals, with Samsung also anticipated to unveil some form of motion control with its new Galaxy Note devices.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.135 35) Arctic Monkeys – Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not (2006)A new wave of British guitar bands was already being pioneered by the likes of The Libertines, Bloc Party and Franz Ferdinand when the Sheffield-formed Arctic Monkeys arrived on the scene. But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.She also spoke about how she has responded to accusations of cultural in the past.“I would hit back and say, ‘What about this that I had to go through?’ because I wanted to talk so much about my experiences of things I didn’t have, and I think it felt like I wasn’t acknowledging that there is white privilege and there is institutionalised racism,” she said.\u0026nbsp“It seemed to a lot of people like I was living in this bubble or unaware of all these things that people have to experience.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The summer before last, this plot would have been filled with the sound of 70 laying hens clucking as they roamed about, scratching at the weeds around the raspberries.As part of this hen-and-berry experiment, some canes had been fenced off. The chickens, like tiny bio-tractors, went about delivering nutrient-rich manure to the land around the other plants. The hens benefited from freedom and green space. And the raspberry canes they visited? They grew quicker and fruited earlier than the ones beyond the fence boundary. Even now, after nearly two years without chickens, they are still much better plants.Alas, this story doesn’t end quite so well for the hens. Their merry outdoor tramping proved too tempting for kites, buzzards and kestrels, and several were plucked right out of raspberry paradise and eaten up.Nevertheless, this experiment was worthwhile – it is an example of the mixed style of farming that could help our crops, farm animals and soils thrive.There is a word for this method and it’s buzzing across Britain’s fields: agroforestry. If you listen to The Archers, you’re probably thinking that you’ve heard about it on there. If you don’t, you’re probably thinking about how unbearable The Archers is.For the anti-Ambridge brigade, agroforestry is when farmers plant trees (or shrubs and bushes like raspberries) in their fields – and it can help solve many of the problems facing our farmers.Created with Sketch.Agroforestry at Eastbrook Farm Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Eastbrook Farm in Wiltshire has dozens of organic pigs. The farm is interested in moving them to rootle around under trees instead of fields, but they have to be among older, resilient trees whose roots are well established. The farm\u0027s Ben Raskin points to the pigs in Spanish and Portugese dehesa systems that are mixed in with cork and oak trees, feeding on the acorns. Cows enjoy the shade and shelter of trees – and munching on their leaves. The energy they save has been shown to increase the efficiency of dairy farming. The Soil Association says agroforestry increases milk production by 17 per cent, and reduces lamb mortality by 50 per cent. A neat row of almond trees at Eastbrook, in their fourth year of growth. As long as there is not a late frost, the blossom and nuts will do well. A climate-conscious diet may see Britons turn away from factory-farmed meat and towards plant protein – could homegrown almonds become a British staple? A moth sits on thistles that grow between the young trees. Agroforestry is great for wildlife – from the littlest critters to the birds and bees. Blackcurrants growing on the farm are used at the adjoining pub. Trees and shrubs can ersify farmers’ income streams. It may be more awkward to have to sell a variety of produce to different places, rather than only growing one crop for a supermarket, but if that one crop fails they could be more financially vulnerable. A ginkgo tree with a tag for monitoring and measuring growth and health. Gingkos have been found in fossils that are 270 million years old – meaning they evolved with the dinosaurs – and it is believed to be the oldest tree species. Gingko leaves and nuts are used herbal teas and medicines. It’s also interesting in that it has no tree species relatives. However, Ben says it isn’t particularly enjoying life on the farm… What looks like a jumble of weeds and grasses in fact tells a wonderful tale. These are young raspberry canes, which 70 chickens were allowed to peck around for several months. The birds tramped around on woodchip, stopping weeds germinating, and adding nutrients via manure. The canes developed noticeably more happily than the nearby ones that the chickens were penned off from – they grew quicker and fruited earlier than those without, and even now two years later are still the much better plants. However, some of the chickens were eaten by kites, buzzards and kestrels, so the system hasn’t quite proven itself just yet. A perry company is buying pears from Eastbrook. Apples and pear trees are trusted by farmers, whereas almonds and peaches are more exotic, with more unknowns. In a grassy 45-acre field, a large area has been fenced off. You can’t quite see the young willows that have been planted, for timber, but far in the distance, a few have excitedly shot up after a pile of woodchip was stored on them. Ben was not expecting this – but says the retained soil moisture and weedkilling properties must be responsible. Ben, who is encouraging farmers to branch out with their tree species, checks out the tag on a golden glow apricot tree. He says: “As a horticulturalist, I am of course excited to be pushing the boundaries a little and planting things like almonds and apricots in a location and system that probably hasn’t been tried before. However what really drives me is to explore the potential of the whole system. Will the timber trees do better with a coppiced alder next to them? Will our soil health improve? Can we demonstrate improved productivity of the whole farm as many agroforestry systems do?” Eastbrook Farm in Wiltshire has dozens of organic pigs.

Can we demonstrate improved productivity of the whole farm as many agroforestry systems do?” Soil erosion is one of the most concerning. This happens when soil is washed and blown away by rain and wind. Some 3 million tons of topsoil are lost in the UK each year, according to the Campaign to Protect Rural England. And British soils may have only 100 harvests left, warn scientists from the University of Sheffield.\u0026nbspBut trees protect soil: their roots provide stabilising infrastructure, creating channels where water is held, while their bodies act\u0026nbspas wind-blockers. These factors will come in even more useful with the increasingly violent floods and storms caused by climate change. In a few decades’ time, we may be relying on agroforestry techniques just to ensure we can still feed ourselves.\u0026nbspThe roots of trees also dig deeper than crops, allowing them to bring up more nutrients\u0026nbsp – mainly nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium – from below. The nutrients spread to the leaves, which then fall on the soil and feed crops, if they are being grown alongside. This is nature’s fertiliser and could help farmers cut their pesticide costs as well as revitalise tired, one-crop fields.\u0026nbspEastbrook Farm in Wiltshire lets its organic pigs\u0026nbsprootle around under trees instead of fields\u0026nbsp(Emily Clark)Trees also provide habitats for wildlife down in the earth’s crust and above it – giving home to the birds, critters and insects that are in alarming decline in Britain, whose existence we depend upon for our ecosystem.And crucially, trees suck up carbon, which is why planting them is key to the government’s climate strategy. More and more, trees are hitting headlines as solutions to our climate crisis. The government advisers at the Committee on Climate Change say 30,000 hectares of woodland should be planted every year until 2050 to meet the UK’s goal of net zero carbon at that point. That’s 1.5 billion trees in total.Farmers have come to see trees as a problem rather than something of value. If you’ve got a big oak tree in the middle of your field, you don’t think, ‘It’s great to have a habitat for all the stuff around oak trees’, you think, ‘I’ve got to bloody drive round that in my plough’The committee, made up of science and business experts, adds that the 30,000 hectare figure may have to be revised up to 50,000 if other climate promises aren’t met.\u0026nbspLast year, England was 7 million trees short of the target for just 5,000 hectares, so there will have to be huge changes to keep us on track – putting agroforestry in the spotlight. It’s likely that the benefits of tree planting will align with the environment-focused farming subsidies that replace the EU payments after Brexit.There are still more benefits from farm trees – animals allowed to graze among them are given shade and shelter. This means they need less feed to keep warm or cool, and gives them a wider diet. The fruit, nuts, fuel logs or timber from trees and bushes then create another income stream for farmers.\u0026nbspWith all this, you would think farmers would be keen on agroforestry. But modern farming, which has crept up on us since the industrial revolution and inspired today’s chemical-soaked monocrops, has seen farmers become reluctant to keep hedges, bushes and trees.\u0026nbspMany tore these wilder spaces up so they could profit from crops instead – every inch of field matters when margins are tight. In our mad farming subsidy matrix, which encourages farming with yield-boosting pesticides, who could blame them? (Tearing out long farm hedgerows did become illegal in 1997.)Our version of capitalism has also created incentive to farm lots of one thing – high street chains and supermarkets want to make life easy for themselves by having fewer suppliers who can deliver bulk orders. But eventually, the huge monocrop fields that are fuelled on chemicals will become infertile, and what then?The good news is that, if done carefully, planting trees can boost productivity by up to a third, according to the Soil Association (SA). It can be done in an environmentally sustainable way that also makes financial sense.When cows munch on tree leaves, their\u0026nbspdiet is improved and tree growth is stimulated –\u0026nbspmulberry leaves are high in protein and willow bark has painkilling properties. Or when chickens trample down the weeds around young trees, they are stifling the competition. As with the hens and raspberries, animal manure then fertilises the soil – helping trees or crops grow.\u0026nbspFarmers were being paid to rip out hedges so that fields got bigger. As a result we’ve now got lots of really big fields, with nothing but one crop in it, which is actually quite a vulnerable, fragile position to be inBut before taking the risk of buying trees and rethinking their farm systems, farmers need sound advice to know what’s best for their animals or crops. There are a million agroforestry variations, and a million factors – soil type, tree species, choice of animal, grazing time, fencing, market demands, wind direction, labour costs, stubborn landowners… pass the paracetamol.\u0026nbspThis is a long game, and the financial stakes are high – it can take 10 to 15 years to establish a raspberry cane, and growing oak for timber can take 100 years.But there is advice out there. Ben Raskin, head of horticulture at the SA, is in his third year of testing out more than 20 tree species at Eastbrook Farm in Wiltshire – belonging to SA chief executive Helen Browning. He oversaw the raspberry and chicken combination, just one example of his many devious schemes.\u0026nbspHe’s particularly excited about growing almonds and apricots (now feasible thanks to global warming) in a location that hasn’t been tried before… in other words, California dreamin’. Raskin has now put together a handbook for farmers explaining how to move into agroforestry, produced by the SA and the Farm Woodland Forum.\u0026nbspHe says at least one farmer a week comes over to ask about his agroforestry experiments – four came the week before I visited, with 1,000 acres between them, and officials from Defra were booked in the following week.\u0026nbspRaskin\u0026nbspis encouraging farmers to branch out with the tree species they\u0026nbspchoose to plant\u0026nbsp(Emily Clark)Before showing me his neat rows of young trees including peach, pear, cherry and damson, he explains why this type of farming is blossoming in Britain – after 150 years of decline.\u0026nbsp“Long, long ago, farmers would have made quite a lot of use of trees, and hedgerows would have been quite productive,” he says. “They would have had fruit and nuts and they would have coppiced them for fuel.”As industrialisation took hold, and farmers began to specialise, the story changed. “We were getting bigger tractors and becoming more efficient at farming,” Raskin says, “so farmers were being paid to rip out hedges so that fields got bigger. As a result we’ve now got lots of really big fields, with nothing but one crop in it, which is actually quite a vulnerable, fragile position to be in.How small farms are leading the way towards sustainable agricultureFarming chief calls for ‘net zero’ agriculture emissions in UK by 2040‘Super crops’ could revolutionise agriculture in Africa, expert claims“Farmers have come to see trees as a problem rather than something of value, something that’s worth spending time on. If you’ve got a big oak tree in the middle of your field, you don’t think, ‘It’s great to have a habitat for all the stuff around oak trees’, you think, ‘I’ve got to bloody drive round that in my plough’. However, trees do bring a whole massive range of benefits to a farm.”\u0026nbspA lot of countries are way ahead of us on this, he says, including France, China, America\u0026nbspand tropical countries that never lost the art. In Spain and Portugal’s dehesa systems, pigs are mixed in with cork and oak trees, feeding on the acorns.\u0026nbspRaskin points to a few agroforestry operations in the UK – the Pontbren lamb project in Wales involving 10 farmers is one that has been a particular success. They realised during the Nineties that they were spending too much on feed and housing costs for their lambs. To keep the lambs outside for longer, they knew the animals would need more shelter – so they began planting thousands of trees.\u0026nbspTheir plans worked. But the farmers also realised that the woodland absorbed 60 times more water than pasture fields just 10 metres away. The trees they had planted in the wettest parts of Wales were a brilliant defence against flooding in other parts of the country.\u0026nbspThere were also fewer chemicals running into waterways from compacted soils on intensive farms. And better shelter is\u0026nbspknown to\u0026nbspreduce flock health issues, such as lameness or even death of the youngest lambs.But Raskin says there are still very few examples of agroforestry in the UK – and we’ve got to up our game.\u0026nbspWith the barrage of difficulties faced by our farmers, especially as Brexit uproots the subsidy system, they’re going to need all the help they can get. Trees might be the perfect way to branch out.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He and his organisation loaded the Beresheet lander up with a library that could serve as a summary of life on Earth: 30 million pages of information, samples of human DNA, and the tardigrades.Tardigrades were first discovered in the 18th century, and have fascinated scientists ever since. They are tiny, measuring just half a milimetre long, and are found all around Earth.Much of the reason for the fascination is just how able they are to withstand extreme environments and survive. They have shown the ability to be exposed to very high and low temperatures, intense pressure, as well as being deprived of air, food and water, as well as already demonstrating that they can live after being put in outer space.They do that party by going into a very strange hibernation, where they can switch off a variety of biological processes and then restart them again when they wake back up. They could be doing that on the Moon, scientists warn, ready to be revived when conditions are right.As such, scientists don\u0027t think that the tardigrades will be thriving on the Moon. But they could be waiting there ready to be picked up and revived, they say, and could stay in that state for years.On other planets that could potentially be home to life, Nasa and other space agencies are very careful about contaminating the surface with life from the Earth. But the Moon is considered dead and so restrictions are much less – with Apollo astronauts leaving bacteria there in the fecal matter they dropped on the surface.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Morgan hit 17 sixes and set a new record in one-day international cricket, which saw his side win by 150 runsWhile Mr McDonnell, one of Jeremy Corbyn’s closest allies, insisted the party would campaign against having a referendum, he added on Wednesday: “I’ve reinforced the view that a referendum isn’t the solution to the problems in this country.\u0026nbsp“But I don’t want to use parliamentary devices to block it. I’m\u0026nbspnot in favour of blocking, I’ve said it time and time again in interviews.”Mr Leonard confirmed\u0026nbsphe had met with Mr McDonnell after his remarks\u0026nbspand “made clear to him” that a second independence referendum “is unwanted by the people of Scotland and it is unnecessary”.“The 2014 referendum was a once-in-a-generation vote,” he said.The Tories can’t discredit the allure of a Labour-SNP pact this timeIn an interview at the Edinburgh Festival\u0026nbspwith LBC journalist Iain Dale on Tuesday, Mr McDonnell provoked anger as he said that any decision on holding a vote would be down to the Scottish parliament.“It will be for the Scottish parliament and the Scottish people to decide that,” he said. “We would not block something like that. We would let the Scottish people decide.”“They will take a view about whether they will want another referendum. Nicola Sturgeon said by late next year or the beginning of 2021.”Reacting to the comments, the Scottish Labour MP Ian Murray\u0026nbsptold the BBC: “Why John McDonnell has cross the border to go to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe to change a massive constitutional policy on the hoof is completely beyond me.”Venting his frustration, he continued: “We’ve had no explanation from John McDonnell, apart from him doubling down again today, of why he would even consider an off the cuff remark on this policy. Even if he wants to change policy, we are supposed to be a democratic party.\u0026nbsp“Where is the Scottish Labour Party members’ input into this massive constitutional change in policy?\u0026nbsp“He has a lot to explain, but firstly I think he should apologise to Richard Leonard, because Richard Leonard is right. The policy is no to a second independence referendum.”Labour’s manifesto at the 2017 general election claimed independence in Scotland would “lead to turbocharged austerity for Scottish families”.“Labour opposes a second Scottish independence referendum. It is unwanted and unnecessary, and we will campaign tirelessly to ensure Scotland remains part of the UK.”Nicola Sturgeon, a new Scottish referendum will be worse than BrexitBrexit paves way for Scottish independence, Sturgeon saysRees Mogg says Scotland not due independence referendum for 20 yearsSturgeon says second independence referendum will hinge on BrexitIntervening in the row, Labour MP Stella Creasy added: “Nationalism is antithesis of socialism – to prioritise passports over principles isn’t progressive.“Egalitarian devolution isn’t about separation but how by working together as nations within the UK each stronger and more successful. Labour abandons such commitment at our peril.”And seizing on the comments, the Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said Mr McDonnell’s remarks were met with “complete dismay” by Labour voters in Scotland.\u0026nbspEchoing attack lines used by the Tories at the 2015 general election against the then-leader Ed Miliband, Ms Davidson said the shadow chancellor’s comments signalled Labour’s intention to propose a pact with the SNP to “parachute Jeremy Corbyn into No 10”.\u0026nbsp“The fact is this – Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell would happily sell Scotland down the river if they thought it could give them a sniff of power,” she added.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Morgan hit 17 sixes and set a new record in one-day international cricket, which saw his side win by 150 runsBut why is\u0026nbspScottish independence in the headlines again?The short answer is because of Boris Johnson’s arrival in Downing Street, shifting the government’s Brexit stance towards a no-deal departure.Mr Johnson has tried to put the preservation of\u0026nbspthe UK at the heart of his premiership, by visiting the devolved governments early and by describing himself as “minister for the union”.However, his visit to Edinburgh, where he was booed and jeered by protesters, seems to have done more harm than good.A shock\u0026nbsppoll, conducted in the wake of his trip, put backing for\u0026nbspScottish independence\u0026nbspat 46 per cent, with 43 per cent of voters against.Support for independence rose to 52 per cent, with 48 per cent against, when those who said they did not know how they would vote or said they would not vote were removed.The poll by Lord Ashcroft –\u0026nbspthe first to show a lead for Scottish independence since 2017 – had a major impact.Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, said it delivered a “phenomenal” boost for the independence movement, as Scotland was “dragged towards a no-deal Brexit”.While it is only one poll, the Ashcroft findings illustrate the growing threat to the union from a no-deal Brexit.By law, Scotland must seek the UK government’s approval to hold another referendum, as matters relating to the union of the United Kingdom are referred to Westminster.Majority of Scots back independence in shock poll after Johnson visitAfter the 2014 vote, Sturgeon\u0026nbspkept her troops at the top of the hill for some time.She eventually requested consent from Theresa May in March 2017, the day before the then-prime minister fired the starting gun on the Brexit process.May blocked the move, saying it was “not the time” for more constitutional upheaval. Sturgeon tried again in April 2019 but the request was again denied.In May, the Scottish government published a bill laying out the framework for a second independence referendum once it has been granted powers by Westminster.Using a similar framework to previous referendums, the bill would allow a new vote quickly as Holyrood would not need to pass another law. The question and the date would need parliamentary approval under the plan.If the referendum question were the same as in the 2014 poll,\u0026nbspthere would be no need for further testing by the Electoral Commission.There is a small majority for independence in the Scottish parliament, as the\u0026nbspScottish Greens would join the SNP to form a 68-strong bloc in the 129-seat parliament.All of the remaining Holyrood\u0026nbspparties are opposed to Scotland leaving the UK.The problem for Sturgeon is all her preparations hinge on getting the nod from Westminster – and that remains an unlikely prospect.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Who as a Trotskyite councillor was sacked for trying to set an illegal budget, but now wants voters to trust him to run the Treasury.Masquerading as a statesman-in-waiting, McDonnell thinks he can pronounce on the Chancellor’s morality.The public are wise to him.HOME Secretary Priti Patel is right to demand answers on the Carl Beech case.It was already staggering that the failed Met chief Bernard Hogan-Howe swanned off to the Lords.

He also adds that: “I prefer a quiet le away from the day job.” And the band played Believe It If You Like.To recap: Paul is a master baker who caught a lucky break after being booked to appear on what became TV juggernaut The Great British Bake Off.Back then he was happily married to we Alex and, outside of an occasional media interview to plug the show, his home le never made the headlines.A bit of work and no play made Paul a dull boy when it came to clickbait. Then he had a fling with fellow TV chef Marcela Valladolid and all hell broke loose.Sex sells. It always has. So does scandal, and cheating on your we with a younger woman fits firmly into both categories.When the fling ended, the admirably forgiving Alex took Paul back, but the marriage faltered again and he took up with a -year-old barmaid with a fondness for miniskirts and crop tops.What’s not to love for the hundreds of “paparazzo”who make a living from how many times their photo gets viewed online It’s not rocket science, is it  Earlier this year I spotted Judi Dench out supermarket shopping.Yes, that Judi Dench. Dame of the British Empire. Oscar winner. Recipient of more awards than Mr Hollywood’s had hot buns.And favoured guest of chatshow host Graham Norton. But there she was, browsing the aisles and totally unbothered by anyone.Why  Well, firstly, she wasn’t wilfully drawing attention to herself by radiating self-importance. And secondly, while she’s paid to be dramatic on screen, her le outside of it is anything but.Meaning that, in everyday le, her showbiz currency — the aforementioned “clickbait” — is, depending on how you view such things, blissfully low.But , say, she decided to dump her conservationist partner David Mills for a young barman from her local pub, a photo of her low-key shopping trip would be front-page news. Simple really.Aside from the marvellous Ms Dench, there are oodles of A- listers who live non-famous lives, popping to the supermarket or going for a low-key dinner — for example, not The Ivy et al — with loved ones.Occasionally, they might be spotted and photographed, but they just keep their head down and ignore it, accepting that it’s a small price to pay for the myriad other benefits fame brings.NDAsare now commonly used by celebrities to ensure the silence of, say, a nanny who will be privy to what happens behind closed doors — and that’s perhaps understandable.But asking a lover to sign on the dotted line when you’ve already been together two years is saying, in so many words: “I don’t trust you, but I want to carry on sleeping with you.”Who can blame Summer for telling him to stick it where the sun don’t shine Famous US basketball coach and mentor, John Wooden , once said: “Talent is God given Be humble. Fame is man-given Be grateful. Conceit is self-given Be careful.”Wise words that Mr Hollywoodwould do well to heed.WHATEVER you think of Boris Johnson’s politics, it can’t be denied that he’s working his King Ashurbanipal socks offas our new PM.Hospitals, factories, flood-hit towns – you name it, he’s popping up there to put a smile on everyone’s face and reassure them that everything is under control.He’s the frontman while the rest of the bandare putting in the hours at the studio, hopefully producing the hits. Time will tell.But suffice to say, he’s already shaping up to be the UK’s cheerleader – a feat the more reserved and aloof Theresa May never quite managed.WHEN asked about children, Prince Harry replied that he and we Meghan might have “two, maximum”.Fair enough, I thought. After all, she’s  now and,she’s lucky, Mother Nature might let her conceive one more before her womb shuts shop.But no, it seems the royal couple’s decision is to do with population growth, despite experts saying that, globally, the birthrate is shrinking and the real issue is how long we’re all living.So unless he’s planning to pack Granny off to Dignitas, there’s not much he can do about it. But I digress.Regarding royal babies and, in particular, Harry and Meghan’s sensitivity around their firstborn’s privacy, perhaps they should copy his cousin Zara.She and husband Mike Tindall have two daughters, Mia, five, and Lena, one. There’s no showboating or churlishness, they just give their daughters as normal a le as possible via picnics, getting muddy, painting faces and rough and tumble – as seen in thisdelightful photo of mischievous Mia hitching a ride on Dad’s back.They occasionally get photographed, but clearly accept that it’s just one of those things and don’t let it bother them. A parenting template to be admired, whoever you are.THE author Alex Elle once said: “I am very cautious of people whose actions don’t match their words.”In which case, let’s hope she wasn’t invited to the recent Google Camp party in Sicily which,you’re one of the self-regarding A-listers in attendance, was a high-minded gathering to discuss the issue of climate change.Or to the rest of us – a boondoggle for entitled fools. How  to describe an event attended by  of some of the world’s richest people who arrived on eco-unfriendly private jets and luxury yachts Oh, the unacknowledged irony. Meanwhile, Leona Lewis and ious other celebrities, who advocate gun control, happily took a shilling or three to attend the Austria-based party of Gaston Glock – one of the world’s most famous gun makers.But back to Google Camp where – and I can’t quite believe I’m writing this – residents and hotel guests near the archaeological site of Selinunte were told by police to avoid looking out of their windows to protect the privacy of the invited A-listers dining al fresco.The same slebs, one assumes, who regularly virtue signal their moral credentials by advocating a world without borders, where everyone should be treated the same . . . yada yada. If hypocrisy was a movie, they’d all be winning Oscars.SCHOOLBOY Jay Hughes, , was talking to a friend outside a chicken shop in South London when a van pulled up and three men armed with machetes jumped out.His friend ran off and escaped but Jay stood in the shop doorway, where -year-old Nyron Jean-Baptiste stabbed him before boasting, “I got one”, and leaving the scene.Jean-Baptiste has now been jailed for “le” – whatever that means these days – while poor Jay’s distraught mother Cindy has been condemned to a letime of painful loss.Another devastated mother, Linda Burke-Monerville, spoke last month about sending her remaining children back to Nigeria for safety after losing three of her sons to violent crime in the UK.New Home Secretary Priti Patel said this week that she is resolutely focused on restoring law and order to our streets via extra police officers with greater powers.Talk is cheap – particularly when uttered by the majority of politicians.

He tells us what he discovered . . .It’s a Friday night and we are trying to hand in a machete and a samurai sword at a police station — but we are turned away.I’ve joined campaigner Faron Paul, who runs a one-man kne amnesty, offering shopping vouchers to peoplethey hand in their weapons to him.Faron, , came up with his unique way to try to reduce kne crime on the streets of North London, where he lives, after he was stabbed himself.People contact him on social media and arrange to drop off the blades. He collects up to  knives a day before handing them over to police.Faron, who dubs himself a “Daddy by day and a vigilante by night”, was given the two blades that day. Yet when we arrive at South Harrow police station, there’s a problem.There are no police officers there. And while the station did have a kne amnesty bin, it was rather unhelpfully taped shut. Evenit hadn’t been, the blades we had were far too big to fit.A duty public access officer we spoke to wasn’t in a position to take the weapons and told Faron to take them to Wembley police station.For me, this was a ludicrous suggestion.This was a Friday night and anything could have happened.It wasn’t until I stepped in and pointed out it would be safer for him to take the knives than for us to drive around with them that he was convinced.And it was the third police station we’d tried that evening. The first, Ilford, had a two-hour wait. The second, Pinner, was shut.Faron was a promising athlete — but as a teen his dream of becoming an Olympic medallist was snatched away from him after he was viciously stabbed in two separate attacks.He told me he contemplated revenge and only changed his mind because of the impact it would have had on his family.He should be commended for what he does. And while I wouldn’t recommend others to follow suit, I know he’s not the only person who feels compelled to take matters into their own hands in the face of the kne crime epidemic that is gripping the UK.Because for three years now our politicians have been so obsessed with Brexit and debating our future they have failed to spot that our future is happening now.Kne crime has surged to the highest levels since records began in .In England and Wales,  people lost their lives by a kne or sharp instrument in the year leading up to March , according to official figures.There has been a  per cent increase in the number of victims aged  to . That’s a massive hike in young people getting stabbed on our streets. And every day last year around three people aged ten to  were admitted to AE with kne wounds.Despite what people might think, it’s not just a problem in London. Kne crime is growing fastest outside the capital.We need to start getting the message across that it’s not just affecting inner-city kids in London, as tonight’s programme shows with a look at the problems in the North.These chilling statistics are what led me to investigate the UK’s kne crime epidemic for the penultimate episode of my latest ITV documentary series — because whatever is being done is not working. And we have to look at the reasons why our young people pick up a kne.During filming I spoke to one young man who viewed the side holster for his machete in the same way as a new pair of trainers — a fashion accessory.Gang members I spoke to all have one thing in common, revealing they were all excluded from mainstream school before having a chance to finish full-time education. They were all sent to pupil referral units.It’s been suggested that, because schools are under so much pressure from Ofsted to be high-achieving, they push out the troublesome children who could bring down the rest of the class.One of the young gang members said to me: “You tell meit makes sense to put a bunch of bad kids from one area that already have problems into an environment with other bad kids from another area. That doesn’t make sense.”Of course it doesn’t. It’s obvious when you think about it, isn’t it And while some of these pupil referral units succeed, many are seen as training academies for crime gangs.When our new Prime Minister Boris Johnson pledged to hire up to , police officers by this time next year, it was given a warm welcome.The recruitment drive begins next month, with the ambitious aim of having , officers in place within three years.It’s a good thing, don’t get me wrong. But how long will it take to train these officers And how long, once in place, will it take them to build trust in the community The young men I met told me the same thing time and time again: “Show me a better way.” Faron is a great example of how social media can be used for good. But I’ve seen first-hand how it plays a negative part in the rise of kne crime in this country and how easily name-calling online can result in the death of a young person.Not only has it taken away a le and has an impact on the victim’s family, it also has a massive impact on the perpetrator and their family.It’s cancelling out lives, essentially over name-calling on social media.During filming, most of the people I met felt like they were facing or fighting kne crime alone — from the young person carrying a kne for protection to someone in the local community having to take matters into their own hands because they feel there is no other option.Yesterday, counter terror chief Neil Basu said improved social mobility in the UK could do more to stop extremism than “policing and state security” combined.He added that policies which go towards better social mobility and more education are much more likely to drive down violence.And what he says about terrorism could just as well apply to kne crime.There is certainly no quick fix to this problem. We need to stop young people picking up knives, and this will involve giving them options rather than just excluding them. We need to look at the part played by social media in the escalation of violence.We need to look at the connection between poverty levels and kne crime and to send the message that carrying a kne is not cool or fashionable.And, of course, we need more police officers who have the trust of the communities they police.And, more importantly, government needs to convince the people living on the front line of kne crime that there is genuine help out there. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But things aren’t quite working out that way.While the UK economy is far from booming, it is holding up much better than those in the Eurozone. Figures released yesterday show Germany’s manufacturing sector contracted by . per cent in July and is now a shocking . per cent smaller than it was a year ago.Given the importance of manufacturing to the German economy, it is likely the whole economy is now heading for recession — a fate the country only narrowly avoided at the end of last year.In Italy, too, economic growth has ground to a halt again — after the country only just hauled itself out of last year’s recession. In France, growth in the past three months fell to . per cent.By contrast, our economy looks relatively perky, with growth of . per cent in the three months to May. Figures released on Monday showed a rebound in confidence in the dominant services sector.Of the large Eurozone countries, only Spain is currently outgrowing us — but Spain is still recovering after a very deep recession from which it emerged in . In common with Italy, the Spanish economy is still smaller than it was before the - banking crisis.Not that you will hear any of this from Remainers. Every time a car factory is earmarked for closure or a steelworks runs into problems, we hear no end of people saying, “We told you so”.All bad news in the UK economy is automatically attributed to Brexit — on the BBC, especially. What we don’t hear is that manufacturing industries, especially cars and steel, are suffering the same problems across Europe.Germany’s car industry is still reeling from the scandal of Volkswagen cheating in emissions tests by installing software to detect when a car was in test mode.On top of that comes the proposed switch from petrol and diesel to electric cars. Many motorists — myself included — have put off buying new vehicles because we don’t know what to get.We have been told new petrol and diesel cars will be banned from  and worry they might be taxed out of existence well before then. Yet electric cars are still prohibitively expensive and can’t travel nearly far enough between charges.As for the steel industry, all across Europe it is struggling to compete with cheap competition from China — especially since the trade war with the US forced Chinese exporters to search for new markets away from America.Of course,we end up with a No-Deal Brexit and tarfs are imposed on imports and exports between Britain and the EU, it will cause some disruption to trade. But it is wrong to assume Britain will come off worse. In truth, EU exporters have more to lose. Britain runs a huge trade deficit with the EU.In  we exported £billion worth of goods and services to other EU countries and imported £billion from them — a trade gap of £billion. Moreover, EU exports to Britain are concentrated in products that attract relatively high tarfs.Cars, for example, attract an EU import tarf of ten per cent. If Britain chooses to impose that levy in reverse after Brexit, it will cause further mayhem in the German car industry.We also have a high deficit in food — which under EU rules attracts average tarfs of  per cent. For dairy products, the average EU import tarf is  per cent. If our Government decides to impose this on imports from the EU, it will mean the end of quite a few French cheese producers.Of course, the EU can avoid damaging these export industries by agreeing to a trade deal with the UK — one that doesn’t include the hated Irish backstop.Nearly half of Irish food exports go to the UK. Irish exports to other EU countries would be deeply affected as so many rely on UK roads. If there are delays at ports, traffic between Ireland and the Continent will suffer twice over — once crossing the Irish Sea then crossing the English Channel.EU leaders want to punish Britain for voting to leave their sacred project. They fear thatBritain is seen to do well, other countries will want to leave. But playing hardball with Britain will do deep harm to their own export industries.Does German chancellor Angela Merkel want to suffer the wrath of her country’s car makers  Does French president Emmanuel Macron wish to anger winemakers already struggling with an economic downturn at home A hard Brexit could cost Denmark as much as one per cent in lost gross domestic product. Their former economy minister Simon Emil Ammitzboll calls Brexit “the most visible threat to the Danish economy”.Holland and Belgium calculate similar falls will hit their economies, with the Dutch losing ten billion euros by . In Spain, wages for unskilled youths are lower than they were in the late s. Youth unemployment is a huge problem. Even qualied youths face a lower annual salary than their counterparts a decade ago.It won’t take much. Just remove the backstop — really just an underhand way of trying to keep Britain in the straitjacket of EU regulations and trade barriers — and some kind of withdrawal agreement would almost certainly make it through the Commons.If not, then yes, British industry will suffer in some ways from No Deal.

With Theresa May, it never was. Brussels knew she didn’t even want to leave, never mind with No Deal.And whenever No Deal was threatened there would always be some helpful soul in her Cabinet to say . . . “That will never happen.”  People such as the treacherous Philip Hammond.Not any more. Second, he’s shaking up the civil service a bit.  It was civil servants who did most of the negotiating — and they are all wildly pro Remain.But with Boris’s adviser Dominic Cummings wielding the stick they might just be a little more amenable than before.Third — he’s realised that the bloody Northern Ireland backstop was never anywhere near so serious an impediment as the Remainersclaimed.And fourth, and maybe most importantly, he’s leading the country with a sense of optimism and chutzpah.Of course it’s Boris, so he may well do something totally bonkers and wreck the process. But so far he’s got everything right.He hasn’t got long to sort out a deal, the days are counting down. But my guess is that he WILL get one.The EU likes to talk a hard game but it usually budges in the end. It is desperate to avoid No Deal.Andit doesn’t budge — fine. A bumpy road for a few weeks and we’ll be OK, better off than ever. And free. The big threat to Brexit is not the EU — it’s our Parliament, once again.The Labour Party has ditched all semblance of principle and is now for a second referendum.Worse, Boris has a majority of only one. That’s not his fault — blame Theresa May for calling an election two years ago.It looks to me thatMagic Grandpa Jeremy Corbyn calls a vote of no confidence, he will probably win.Labour is already cosying up to the Scottish Nationalists and saying they wouldn’t mind a second referendum on independence.There is now nothing Labour wouldn’t do to gain power. Destroy the union and scupper Brexit — Magic Grandpa doesn’t care.Butthis whole thing ends with Labour des- troying Brexit, the party will never be trusted again.Oh sure, it will still get the votes from the metropolitan, middle-class lefties. But its working-class base will desert it, for good.So the message for Magic Grandpa is very clear. Win your vote of confidence, lose your voters. He’s not the brightest of men, but I do hope he grasps this.And Boris  Keep straight ahead. Play as hardball as possible with Brussels, knowing they want a deal. Strike as many deals with the likes of the USA and Canada as possible.And remind Brussels thatwe walk away without a deal, they don’t get a single penny from us. That should help to concentrate their minds for a while.This has been revealed in a new report by researchers with too much time on their hands. What these men want, I think, is the best of both worlds.I used to have a girlfriend who spent all day long sitting on the roof of the shed. Then she’d dart out into the road after a thrush. She was great.Had a little bell around her neck. And did her business in a small tray by the back door.A WOMAN in East London said nasty things to someone taking part in a gay Pride march. She was wearing a niqab, so the lefties didn’t get too cross.Still, it is at last beginning to dawn on the woke liberals that the more fervently Muslim a person may be, the less likely it is that he or she will take kindly to people who have a knack for interior design and enjoy watching Mamma Mia!.This has put them in a bit of a quandary. Much as have those largely Muslim protests outside schools in the Midlands which insist on teaching kids how wonderful gay relationships might be.The same sort of quandary that affects feminists, who are not entirely convinced that a ft chap with a todger and a beard who wishes to be called “Loretta” in the name of gender freedom actually is a woman.This is the thing with identity politics, protected characteristics and so on. Tug gently on one of its threads and the whole thing begins to unravel like a pink mohair jumper knitted by an imbecile. HERE’S some consol­ation for you cricket fans, in despair at our Ashes defeat. Steve Smith, the man who did most of the damage, is at least HALF English.He’s got an English mum and has dual nationality.He used to play cricket for a team in Sevenoaks, in Kent.So what we should do is ide his run total down the middle – we get half, the Aussies get half. That means we won the first Test. Fair dinkum Sometimes I think that one day I’ll be the only person left in the country paying tax.And I’ll get rung up by the Inland Revenue. “Sorry, Liddle, we need to fire off a few missiles to scare the Iranians. We’ll take it out of your next payment.”Thing is,people aren’t paying tax, or aren’t married to someone paying tax, should they have the vote THE way to pose for your Instagram shots this summer is to stand with your elbows in the air.Here is someone doing exactly that.And so everywhere you go this August, you will find young women doing a passable imitation of a cormorant.Those scented pine-tree things could obscure your view of oncoming traffic, apparently.Have to say, I wouldn’t mindthey were banned altogether. Especially that really sickly one that’s supposed to smell of coconut.Here’s a tip, mini-cab drivers. If you want your car to smell nice for passengers, maybe take a shower once in a while HANGING an air freshener from your car rear-view mirror could land you a fine.APPARENTLY,you stare hard at a seagull in a menacing fashion it will be too scared to nick your packet of chips.This is the new advice from the experts. I’ve known it all along. Stare hard at the bird asit’s just spilt your pint, or tried to chat up your girlfriend.And also add in a bit of abuse and threats for good measure. “You f***ing want some, you yellow-beaked t***er “I’ll cut you open like a tin of peaches, Sunshine.” Always works, until the Old Bill turn up. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

px\" JANE MOORE You CAN avoid all publicity, Paul Hollywood — just ask Oscar-winning Judi Dench As a former Labour activist who spent a decade working alongside Corbyn in his Islington North constituency, I agree with everything Johnson says.Having observed him at close quarters during the years when he was a backbench rebel, I now find the idea of Corbyn as Prime Minister both laughable and terrying.Profoundly unfit for the highest office, he is a toxic ideological extremist without a clue about how to govern Britain.Having poisoned his own party, he would wreck our country toohe came near to power.But what makes me despair is the timidity of sensible Labour folk, who regard Corbyn with contempt yet are still willing to march under his banner.They proclaim that they think he is a disaster, but they allow him to remain in place.This pathetic ineffectuality was captured by Yvette Cooper, widely regarded as possible alternative leader, who bleated to the BBC at the weekend that there is a real concern we don’t look like enough of a broad church at the moment.What a gross understatement.In fact, the Labour Party is in the grip of hardline, quasi-Marxist, anti-Semitic personality cult.But apart from wringing their hands, the likes of Ms Cooper do nothing about it.If Labour is to have a future, the moderates have to get off their knees and start to challenge Corbyn properly.They should be inspired by the words of the great former leader Hugh Gaitskell, a passionate centrist, who famously told the  conference — where the left had prevailed — that he would fight, fight and fight again to bring back sanity and honesty and dignity to the party I love.The moderates need that kind of resolution today, but they show precious little sign of it.They are not only cowardly, but also hypocritical.They send their angry tweets and whine to the broadcasters, but, by campaigning for Labour, they are still working for Corbyn to be Prime Minister.If, as appears likely, a General Election is called soon, the so-called moderates will all be out canvassing in their constituencies for theof a Corbyn-led Government.That reality makes all their denunciations of him completely meaningless.Effectively, the moderates are Corbyn enablers and agents of his extremism.Rather than serve as doormats, they should take a lesson from the Tories, who have long been ruthless about dumping their leaders.Neville Chamberlain, Anthony Eden, Ted Heath, Iain Duncan-Smith, and even Margaret Thatcher were all clinically dispatched once they were deemed to be ineffective or unpopular.The same ruthlessness with personnel could be seen in the way Boris Johnson reconstructed his Cabinet last month as he sacked  ministers in his night of the blond knives, including even the Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt.In contrast, Labour has always been pathetically soft about butchery.In the whole of the party’s -year history, only one leader has ever been forced out against his will and that, ironically, was Tony Blair, by far Labour’s greatest election winner.All the rest chose when to go, even the poor ones like Neil Kinnock, Michael Foot and the s pacist George Lansbury.Today, there are plenty of steps that the moderates could take to crank up the pressure on Corbyn.They could push for another vote of no confidence in him. They could resign the Labour whip in the Commons. They could boycott his appearances at Prime Ministers Questions and other statements.But, as Labour slides towards catastrophe, they have done none of this.What explains their inaction  Part of the answer is fear of the Corbyn machine, especially his supporters’ powerful pressure group Momentum, which is notorious for its intolerance.In fact, though there has been a recent decline in Labour membership, Corbyn backers still make the majority of activists.Any Labour MP who speaks out against Corbyn therefore risks deselection. For the sake of their Parliamentary careers, most of them keep quiet.But there are also deeper factors at work.One is mainstream Labour’s horror at any supposed betrayal of the socialist cause.This is partly because Labour is such a tribal movement, as shown in the ferocious anger generated in  by Ramsay MacDonald’s decision to break with the party by forming a National Government with the despised Tories.Since then treachery is regarded as the greatest sin, far worse than incompetence or unpopularity.This trait particularly insulates Corbyn, who, for all his spectacular failings, is still regarded by the majority of the membership as an authentic socialist.There is also a deep streak of sentimentality in Labour, which stems from the party’s origins in the trade union movement.In this mindset of supposed compassion, sacking people is what the bosses do, not the workers.When the nondescript Clement Attlee was surprisingly elected Labour leader in , supporters of his rival Herbert Morrison tried to comfort him by saying Attlee’s spell at the top would be short-lived.Morrison was having none of it.The party, he said, was sentimental and having once made a man leader, would stick to him.He was right. Attlee was still in post  years later.Sentimentality explains why so many anti-leadership plots are botched.I saw this for myself working as a Labour researcher at Westminster in the late s and early s, when there were hidden manoeuvres against Kinnock.But they all came to nothing because the plotters lacked the determination to finish the job.The same was true during Gordon Brown’s woeful premiership, when conspirators abandoned the battle when the moment came to strike.More interested in dogma than office, the Labour party lacks the unsparing instinct for power that infuses the Tories, which helps to explain why the Conservatives have been in Government for twice as long. Since  , the Tories have been in office for  years and Labour for just .The absence of hard ambition means that socialists are willing to put up with a dud like Corbyn, while they mouth their slogans and wave the red flag.The wilderness is their ideological comfort zone – and Corbyn will ensure they remain there."},{"url":null,"title":"michael gove eu brexit talks","story":"The leading Cabinet minister said it was “wrong and sad” that the EU did not want to discuss a new deal with the UK.His comments came after European leaders finally realised that Boris is serious about leaving without an agreement – but still do not want to offer a new solution to the Irish border problem.Speaking after a meeting of the daily Brexit “war cabinet”, Mr Gove said: “I’m deeply saddened the EU now seem to be refusing to negotiate with the UK.“The Prime Minister’s been clear, he wants to negotiate a good deal with the European Union and he will apply all the energy of the government and ensure that in a spirit of friendliness we can negotiate a new deal.”Mr Gove – who as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster is in charge of No Deal preparations across Government – added: “At the moment it’s the EU that seems to be saying they’re not interested’, they’re simply saying, ‘no, we don’t want to talk’.“Well I think that’s wrong and sad, it’s not in Europe’s interest.”On a visit to Belfast, Ireland’s premier repeated the EU’s line that the Withdrawal Agreement could not be reopened.Leo Varadkar said that a No Deal exit was not guaranteed, however.“There are many ways by which a No Deal can be avoided. Either by the ratication of the Withdrawal Agreement, a further extension or revocation of Article .“So, there are a number of ways that a No Deal can be avoided on the st of October.

And as No Deal nears, and the government and the EU donapost resume meaningful negotiations, it now looks like Britain could crash out with on October . It means Britain would immediately leave the EU, including the single market and customs union, without a transition agreement or settlement for how the next stage of negotiations would go. Experts have warned that the dangers to food supplies, the economy and peace in Northern Ireland could be dramatic. So a lot of MPs have pledged to stop it happening. But can they  This is everything you need to know about Parliament stopping No Deal.    Can No Deal Brexit be stopped  While in theory it is possible, the reality is probably notthe Government is determined to see it delivered.The timetable is such that the only way Parliament could really stop a No Deal Brexit is to beat the government in a vote of No Confidence and then quickly cobble together another government.But this isnapost likely to happen. Boris Johnson doesnapost need to do anything - because leaving on October  is enshrined in law, he just has to let it happen.For Parliament to stop it,  they need to show a level of coordination and unity of purpose not seen in politics since...well, ever. Politicians from opposition parties would need to agree on an agenda, and vote to deliver it, in a way which would likely punish most of the major participants at the ballot box. Why canapost Parliament just vote to reject leaving without a deal  Well theoretically it can, but it just wonapost do anything unless they use a very particular mechanism. MPs could try to take control of the timetable in the House of Commons and try and pass a law which would force the Government to block no deal. They have done this before - repealing standing order  which gives the Government business priority in the house - but requires a lot of effort and wrestling for the agenda for the House of Commons.  Procedurally this makes the Speaker John Bercow potentially a key figure - a decision on allowing MPs to vote on seizing the agenda would be his to make. But Boris Johnson hasnapost ruled out proroguing Parliament - basically suspending it - so that it couldnapost do something like this evenMPs have muddied the water by voting to make Parliament sit some days in October. One option under consideration is for them to vote to delete or amend the date in the Withdrawal Act - but they would need to granted the time to do this.Couldnapost Parliament vote down Boris Johnsonaposs government Yes - but the timetable for stopping a No Deal Brexit on October  is incredibly tight without some dramatic activity. The No Confidence vote could be put down on September  by Jeremy Corbyn - but he hasnapost committed to it yet. If he did, Labour would need Tory backbenchers, like ex-Chancellor Philip Hammond, who have sworn to block No Deal to vote with them.This in itself would be a political feat, as convincing Conservative MPs to back a Labour motion of No Confidence would involve convincing them they werenapost just handing Mr Corbyn the keys to No.    But, evenJeremy Corbyn won his vote it doesnapost automatically lead to a general election.If nobody wins a confidence vote within two weeks, an election is automatically called, with Mr Johnson staying as caretaker PM and deciding on the date. Boris Johnson has  days to prove he holds the confidence of Parliament by winning another vote. In this time another MP could come forward and demonstrate that they had the confidence of MPs, and be invited to form a government of national unity. They then could delay leaving the EU again so that Britain could hold an election or referendum. But that level of cooperation would require MPs to work together in a way that hasnapost happened since WWII. It would also involve Jeremy Corbyn backing another person to be PM ahead of him, evenonly temporarily, as the Lib Dems - not to mention the Tory defectors - have said they wonapost put him in No. The party has already said it wonapost do this. Even more bizarrely there have been reports that Downing Street sources have suggested that the government could refuse to give up power anyway until after October  - crashing the UK into another constitutional crisis. How could The Queen be dragged into it  WellMr Johnson refused to quit then one Tory has said it could drag the Queen into the middle of the constitutional battle. Former attorney-general Dominic Grieve, a leading rebel, said the monarch could then be left with little choice but to sack himhe lost the confidence of Parliament but for whatever reason refused to go.  “The Queen is not a decorative extra... at the end of the day there are residual powers and responsibilities which lie with her. She might have to dispense with his services herself,” he said. Other constitutional experts have said The Queen would do everything possible to avoid becoming involved in any political battle the country finds itself in. So will we have an election before October   Unlikely but not impossible. This is the outcome Boris Johnsonaposs government is most determined to avoid. They want to make sure that any vote, which almost everybody said is going to happen, isn only held after we leave the EU.

Professor Jim Smith, of the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of Portsmouth, has worked with scientists and researchers to help the communities affected by the economic impact of the disaster. The team, the brainchild of Chernobyl Spirit Company who started the vodka project, said: Our idea then was [to use that rye grain] to make a spirit.   Askedthe spirit is safe to drink, Prof Smith explained to BBC : This is no more radioactive than any other vodka.Any chemist will tell you, when you distill something, impurities stay in the waste product. So we took rye that was slightly contaminated and water from the Chernobyl aquer and we distilled it. A radio-analytical laboratory test at Southampton University showed the content was aposbelow their limit of detectionapos, Prof Smith added.    He hopes the sale of the vodka could enable them to distribute most of the money to local communities and use the rest to reinvest in the business. The problem for most people who live there is they donapost have the proper diet, good health services, jobs or investment, he said. Dr Gennady Laptev, a scientist based at the Ukrainian Hydrometeorological Institute in Kiev, said the rye grain and the spirit prove how the contaminated land could be used productively.

Emily Padfield and Les Baker are two of many UK visitors having souvenir pictures taken of them with their prizes, parts of which they can bring home. And a UK former gamekeeper is cashing in on the lust for blood by offering trips to slaughter threatened big game, under the “conservation” label. Derek Stocker’s ProStalk specialises in trophy hunts to South Africa, Namibia and Zimbabwe. They include killing baboons, monkeys, elephants, giraffes, and zebras on “adventures of a letime”.  And wealthy customers have bragged about their cruel exploits during the trips, which start at £, for five days. Hunters can add more animals to kill from a list of  species, including £, extra to shoot a giraffe, £, for a hippo or just £ for monkeys. Experts believe ProStalk is the last remaining major UK company ­organising big game hunts in Africa. Ms Padfield told how the trip was “truly the stuff dreams are made of”. But the Campaign to Ban Trophy ­Hunting’s Eduardo Goncalve branded the safaris “a festival of cruelty”.  He said of shooting monkeys: “Many of these animals live in close proximity to humans and are used to people. “It makes it even easier to shoot them. This is as cowardly as it is disgusting.” Eduardo added: “ProStalk boasts about the ‘thrill’ of killing animals. It may be a ‘holiday of a letime’ for a hunter, but it’s hell for the animal killed to satisfy their sick bloodlust. “Trophy hunting isn’t an ‘adventure’, it’s an abomination, and it needs to be abolished. The Government should implement an immediate moratorium on all hunting trophy hunting imports. “This is the last remaining major UK company organising big game hunts in Africa. It’s a stain on our country’s ­reputation as a nation of animal lovers. “It also has almost every iconic African animal on its hunting ‘menu’ including elephants, giraffes and zebras. All are listed as vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.  “Britain has some of the laxest laws on trophy hunting. We allow hunters to kill and bring home the heads and body parts of practically any animal, including some of the most endangered wildle. “Trophy hunting is a horror show, where cheap ­bounties are placed on the heads of animals for fun. Britain needs to show it plans to lead the way in ­abolishing this abomination by acting now before it’s too late.” The Mirror is calling for a ban on trophy hunting. ProStalk insists it plays a “pivotal role” in ­conservation. It says: “Hunting is such a controversial issue and ­unfortunately the ­uninformed public and animal rights activists are unaware of how much it contributes to conservation.” It also argues the growth of hunting since the s has placed a value on wildle and created a direct incentive to own, purchase, protect and conserve it. The firm says the ­establishment of private game ranches has helped some species recover in South Africa.

Rachael and Kirsty Hoyles now want to help others through dficult times by sharing their story. They conceived following a successful sperm donation from a private clinic in Cardf, Wales Online reports . But tragedy was to follow when complications with both babies meant neither survived. We are heartbroken and would give anything to have our boys back, said Rachael, .    But we know thataposs not going to happen, so we decided to do the next best thing - help anyone  who has to go through this and try to make it more bearable. Rachael, who has been married to Kirsty since June , fell pregnant at the first attempt following a sperm insemination at a clinic in . We were allowed to choose a donor with similar characteristics to ours, she added. We decided to pick someone with similar eye and hair colour to Kirsty. After going through the procedure privately, they were then referred back to the Welsh NHS nine weeks into the pregnancy. However, at the -week scan at Ysbyty Ystrad Mynach it was discovered that one of the twins was very small. A rescan four weeks later revealed that the baby had a very rare birth defect called encephalocele.    It meant the babyaposs skull had not formed properly and had caused part of the brain to protrude out. Around one in , babies are struck down with it, but it remains a mystery as to what causes it. They [the hospital staff] just kept saying aposIaposm sorry, Iaposm sorryapos over and over again, said Rachael, from Cwmcarn, near Newport. We were told that the survival rate was not good. Just days later, their care was transferred to Bristol Childrenaposs Hospital where the diagnosis of encephalocele was officially confirmed. But while they were there, further scans picked up anomalies with the other twin. They said they couldnapost find the stomach, Rachael added. We were now at a crossroads as to whether to continue the pregnancy, but we decided to let it run its course to see what happened. We had many, many scans in Bristol and we were also being seen in Newport too. It was a really horrible time. Neither of us could work while this was happening. At every appointment we would just sit there crying in the waiting room. The second twin was found to have a congenital diaphragmatic hernia, known for short as CDH, which meant the babyaposs stomach had gone up into his chest, had crushed one of his lungs and pushed the heart to one side.  However, doctors said his le could be saved with an operationhe could hold on for a few weeks after birth. We were told he would survive in the womb as I was giving him all his nutrients through my placenta, but he would have to fight for himself for a while once he was born before they could put the stomach back where it should be. Rachael admitted that the complicated pregnancy really tested their marriage. We were very supportive of each other. We just wanted what was best as a family. We had a lot of friends reach out to us who had disabled babies about how hard, but rewarding it all was. At the -week mark, just before Christmas , Rachael and Kirsty were given the news they dreaded. The twin with encephalocele, who they went on to name Bayden, no longer had a heartbeat.  But to give the other twin the best chance of survival Rachael would need to try and get to full-term with both babies still inside her. We had my mum, Kirstyaposs mum and my stepdad all with us in the car [after the news] and we just sat and cried and cried, said Rachael. Nobody knew what to say to each other. It was horric. One of the risks of continuing to carry both babies in the womb was the chance of Rachaelaposs body could reject Bayden and go into early labour. But against the odds, she managed to get to  weeks and have a c-section at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardf on April , . Their son, Jude Hoyles was born alive and breathing. As soon as he was out they took him straight away to be intubated, so I wasnapost able to have skin-to-skin contact, Rachael said. I had to wait hours for the feeling to come back into my legs before I could be wheeled up to see him for the first time.

The youngsteraposs dad, Johny, , said the family, from West Dunbartonshire, Scotland, are trying to stay as positive as they can for their soldier little girl. He said: Emily started getting headaches around the end of May into June and they kept getting worse and worse. “It was going on for around three weeks and we took her to the doctors who said it was just migraines caused by stress at school and told us to give her Calpol. “But we knew it was much more serious. You know your own child and we weren’t happy with that. “We ended up taking her into the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital and she must have seen about nine or  doctors who checked her over.    “She eventually had a scan and that’s when the doctors took us into a room. “That was really distressing because we knew that meant there was something really wrong. “They diagnosed her with medulloblastoma cancer and told us they had found a tumour, which was about the size of the plastic tub you would get inside a Kinder egg. “It was pushing against her brain and they said they had to get it out straight away.” Emily was rushed into surgery and the tumour was removed. Her family are now facing an agonising wait as she undergoes months of radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatment in a bid to destroy any cancer cells which may still be in her body, reports the Daily Record . Johny continued: “She’s had tests on her spinal cord which haven’t shown any signs of cancer which is really good news. “It was a really aggressive tumour so they don’t know for sure whether there’s anything left which is why she’s having this intense treatment.    “The doctors said me and her mum were really ahead of the game in bringing her in. “They said they had never seen anyone get a diagnosis so quickly. More often, it’s left too long and spreads.” He went on to praise his “wee soldier” for showing so much strength and determination, adding: “She’s just finished her third week of radiotherapy and her hair is starting to fall out but you wouldn’t know anything was wrong when speaking to her. “She’s been a wee soldier going in for her treatment. She is only seven but she is so strong and brave – we are very proud of her.” Emily’s family have now launched a dream bid to fly the youngster and her brother Darren, , to Disney World in Florida once her ordeal is over. Her uncle Garry Keggan, who is Johny’s brother, has set up a Just Giving page, which has already raised more than £ towards the goal. Garry said: “Emily is going through absolute hell and I thought it would be a good idea to raise some money so they can go on a nice family holiday once this is over.

A ten-pound note. I felt rich. It all seems so sad and pathetic. Bur that’s what happened to me.” “Not long after that, I met Charlene Downes.” The two schoolgirls came from very dferent backgrounds. Charlene was from a poor working-class family who had moved to the ‘Las Vegas’ of the north in search of a better le. Tyne tells how the two girls quickly became friends and would meet up and trawl around the takeaway and arcades looking for adventure but ended up selling themselves for fast food and pocket money. She said: “Charlene was fun, she was my friend. She was a year or so older than me, but not very streetwise.  I started to pass on to her all the tricks that my mum had shown me. She had a very dferent background to mine, but we had so much in common. “We had a regular route through the town that we would take, calling in at certain take away shops and arcades. She liked to dance for the drunks outside pubs. The Carousel Bar on the North Pier was a favourite place to steal drinks from the tables.” “When I heard that she had gone missing, I wasn’t too concerned at first.    She was wild and anything was possible. I honestly thought she would turn up sooner or later but the days turned into weeks then months and, here we are: sixteen years on and there’s still no sign of her. “I have had police swoop on me thinking I was Charlene a few times. We are the same height and build and look similar, I suppose. It’s hard to take in that she has gone.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger.

He turned Duncan MacKinnon inside-out before flicking an inch-perfect ball to Fraser Watt on the left of the D and he slammed the ball high into the middle of the goal from  yards to make it -.Lochaber had their first shot on goal on six minutes when Ben Delaney found space on the left but his strike went wide of the left-hand post.Inveraray were showing good movement up front and they increased their advantage on nine minutes. The goal came from a corner and Garry MacPherson caught the Lochaber defence napping as he played the ball low from a wide area towards the front post where full centre Lewis MacNicol waltzed into the box and his first-time shot beat the helpless Callum MacDonald to make it -.Lochaber keeper MacDonald pulled off a great save on  minutes as he blocked Garry MacPherson’s fine drive from the left with his chest before clearing the ball to safety.Lochaber’s Ben Delaney and Stuart Callison tested Inveraray keeper Scott MacLachlan but it was the Winterton side who would add a third goal on  minutes. Again the goal came from Lewis MacNicol winning possession, this time deep in Lochaber territory, and he found the ever-alert Garry MacPherson whose defence-splitting pass picked out Fraser Watt running in unmarked through the heart of the Lochaber defence and he slotted the ball low past the keeper from close range.Lochaber were now up against it but, on  minutes, Conor Sweeney took a corner from the right, sending the ball into the danger-area. Stuart Callison found space to slam the ball goalwards and although Scott MacLachlan saved with his feet, he was unable to get the ball away and Ben Delaney was quick to react as he poked the ball over the line to make it - at the interval and give Lochaber hope.Lochaber started the second period with intent and Scott MacLachlan pulled off a great save to thwart Stuart Callison on  minutes.However, Lochaber’s never-say-die attitude got them right back into the match with just  minutes remaining. Lachlan Campbell played the ball across from the right and it came perfectly to the on-running Findlay MacDonald and his  yard shot from the left flew past the keeper to make it -, setting up a tense finishLochaber had a great chance to snatch a point on  minutes when referee John Angus Gillies awarded them a spot-hit, penalising keeper MacLachlan for a “kick” inside the D. Ben Delaney’s well-struck effort went straight down the middle and MacLachlan redeemed himself, saving superbly with his stick before clearing the ball for a corner.Inveraray saw out the rest of the game to claim two valuable points in what was a cleanly fought contest with no cards shown.The win sets Inveraray up for another crucial relegation battle this time at Kilmallie this coming Saturday.Caberfeidh  Kyles Athletic Kyles Athletic came from behind to beat Caberfeidh - in their pm throw up at Castle Leod.Caberfeidh have been on a bit of a scoring spree of late and they took the lead in the opening minute through Craig Morrison.It didn’t take Kyles long to level with Ross MacRae netting on  minutes and Colin MacDonald’s effort on  minutes meant they went into the break - ahead.Ross MacRae got his second on  minutes with Colin MacDonald doing like-wise with just  minutes remaining.Mowi South Division Inveraray  Kyles Athletic The Inveraray seconds and the Kyles Athletic seconds met in a match originally rearranged Thursday  July which was then put back  hours.Kane Kirkhope was playing in a more advanced role for Inveraray and he scored a well-taken goal in eight minutes after some impressive forward play.John MacKenzie was working hard in the middle of the park and he set up Inveraray’s second goal on  minutes.

Day one saw us head out from Carloway aboard the SYSAC II under the watchful eye of skippper Robbie Bell who knows these waters like the back of his hand.The day kicked off with a bait hunt in the East Loch but the mackerel were pretty scarce, it took an hour or so to fill the baskets before steaming out to the two-mile mark in search of spurdogs. By then there was a fair wee wind picking up and it was a tad rough to say the least, with the heavy swell claiming a few breakfasts along the way.All that was soon forgotten as the battle commenced with the mighty spurs. The action started on the first drop with some thumpers coming aboard, single and double shots causing mayhem thrashing about the deck and we lost count of the number of rigs sliced through on the way up. But that’s what we came for, not everyone’s choice but great sport all the same.In between the madness we picked away at the haddock, whiting, grey and red gurnard, ling and pollack, until we had our quota and decided to seek the smoother waters of East Loch Roag for some flattie bashing on the soft ground. It was good to get into the calm and fish the light gear, picking away for dabs and plaice. There was plenty around, nothing huge but a steady flow coming aboard taking us to the end of the day with a good mixed bag of species.Day two set off in brilliant sunshine and not a breath of wind, it was almost tropical conditions. We quickly got our supply of fresh bait in West Loch Roag and set off for the rough ground in search of a few more species, but there was little or no drt so we took a turn into Clf Bay and settled in for a day on the rays. It was brilliant fun, everyone got their fair share with loads of thornback rays and a few spotted rays coming aboard, plenty of dabs, plaice, dogfish and a bonus lb oz turbot to add to the tally. It was a great opportunity to brush up on some of fishing techniques that don’t get practised much at home.We decided to hit the hard ground on the way back to the harbour. It was quite slow, maybe a wee bit early yet, but it produced more haddock, a lovely lb cuckoo wrasse and pollack bringing our two day adventure to an end. All in all another excellent club trip.This year we picked up  species,  counting fish and a few personal bests. Add to that, great company, loads of banter, a good skipper who makes a mean cup o’ tea and you have the ideal ingredients for another memorable few days away on Lewis. We’ll be back next year for sure.Results: Nikki Thompson  points, Robert MacBrayne , Nick Friel , Jim Smith , Gary Sinclair , Steven MacBrayne ."},{"url":null,"title":"mach1 scottish tarmack rally championship report","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWith  starters and  Cobble shop STRC registered the championship tables were always going to change on this mid-season two day event.Sunshine was forecast for the Machrihanish Airbase Community Companycourse and that’s what was delivered. Some crews were hoping for rain but this year it wasn’t to be. Last year’s winner Bruce Edwards in the Darrian T GTR was favourite and since Bruce had not driven the car competitively since Mach   we all thought he would be a bit rusty.Bruce led from the start and set some impressive times throughout the two days but on the last stage he threw it all away and rolled the car as he clipped a large lorry tyre a mile from the finish line, unable to right the car and with the stage blocked the clerk of the course decided on the grounds of safety to cancel the final stage. This allowed Alistair Inglis in the lotus Exige and a previous Mach  winner to clinch the top spot.Class  had  STRC registered this year and new to class  was Tom Blackwood in the gorgeous yellow and Black Fiesta R+. Tom#s first event driving in anger and showed that with some tweaks here and there with suspension settings it’s a great car to drive. How well the car drives notwithstanding, there was a slight moment coming out of one of the tight sections onto the main runway when Tom ran wide and clipped a boundary fence damaging the front bumper of the car but kept the fence intact. Tom finished third Overall and second in class .John Rintoul in another Fiesta R on the back of the recent win at Crail was on it all weekend but just couldn’t clinch the win this year, John finished second overall and took the class win.Alan Wallace in the distinctive green and white Mitsubishi Evo finished a very well deserved th overall and third in class. Harry Chalmers was a Mach  virgin and loved every mile of the venue. Harry commented at the end of the event they we had no problems at all on day one and the car ran faultlessly all day to give him a real confidence boost to push on harder and let him get used to some new parts on the car. Harry kept it neat all day and came away with rd overall after day one.Day two was very fast. Fastest he’s probably been in the car to date with these faster stages suiting faster cars Harry just had to push on brake late and keep it tidy and with that being said the team dropped to th overall due to some of the quicker cars retiring out.Harry said: #I couldn’t be happier for how this event turned out for the team and are all delighted with the result and how far they have come.#Harry also managed the full two days on the same Hankook Tyres Finishing th overall.Alan Stark in the stunning Red Mitsubishi Evo had decided he was playing the long game and would drive accordingly. The plan went well and they played about with tyres trying to make them last for the two days. On the second last stage on the Saturday the manold gasket started to blow and he lost a fair bit of power mid stage. The service crew managed to bolt it up again but the long stages were killing it and it usually faded about  rds in each time.On Sunday he decided to push on a bit and of course it bit him. The interior mirror fell off and he became aware there was a car coming up behind after a merge but wasn’t sure how close. He decided to do the next lollipop and then see where he was on the straight but in his enthusiasm got to him and he understeered into the bales bouncing off them, hitting his bonnet. He also noticed the brake pads were rattling more than usual and it turned out they had lost a pin. The team had to improvise with spare tyre borrowed from Allan Wallace which didn’t quite fit but they wired it in and it lasted.Class  had  STRC registered crews this year and top spot and current championship leader in class went to Colin Gemmell in the Mark  Escort. Colin had a trouble-free run on both days and managed to finish the event th overall just  seconds behind Tom Blackwood and second in class.Alistair Inglis winner of the  Mach  stages kept just ahead all weekend. Nothing could touch his car which stuck to the road like glue.Inglis said: #Overall victory and a class win  Can’t get any better.#Robert Marshall in the Mark  Escort was looking forward to some decent results but an issue on day one with the car losing all its water put an end to any real chances and on day two an engine mount broke putting an end to what Robert described as a perfect weekend.Ross Auld was a welcomethe Mark  Escort and also managed a couple of days assistance in setting up the venue. Ross had managed to set some decent times on Saturday but late in the day the alternator belt snapped and took with it the dry sump belt causing the engine to cease. Ross loaded up the car and headed home and by the Sunday evening he had the engine out the car ahead of its rebuild.Class  saw four STRC registered crews compete in Kintyre this year and top of the list was Greg Inglis in the Lotus Exige. Greg exited the last stage on the Saturday and noticed the rear brake calliper hanging off. A call was made to Montrose where a spare part was removed from a car and the handover was done half way between Montrose and Machrihanish. Greg finished a respectful fth overall and took the class win.Second in class and th overall was Michael Harbour in the Mark  Escort, on the back of electrical problems that saw the team fail to finish the last round at Crail the team have now got the car singing on the stages. Michael didn’t report any issues during the weekend and brought the car home in one piece.Michael Robertson isn’t having the best of luck this season as the Honda Civic Type R driver reported issues with the CV joint that led to driveshaft and df failure but as usual the team loved the event and will be back for sure.Class , with eight registered STRC in class  the battles were all tensely close. Taking top honours in the class was Kyle Adam a full two minutes ahead of nearest class  car of Des Campbell. Kyle also managed a top  overall clinching th spot and despite some overheating at one point the car ran faultlessly doing his championship hopes no harm.Lochgilphead local, Jamie Miller in the C R Max loves the track and had the luxury of booking indoor servicing.

A change of driveshaft, ball joint, wheels and tyres seemed to cure the problem. With an early start on the Sunday morning the car was back on form. Loss of intercom on way to stage  and a half spin on stage  cost them a bit of time and after a few tweaks at service they were away again. The last stage of the day was cancelled resulting in a th overall and th in class.Alan Watt was again out in the green Saxo and finished th in class and st overall. A great result for the team with no damage or mechanical issues to report.Class  had four teams registered in the STRC this year at Mach  but only one managed to finish.

It is bounded to the west by Montgomerie Terrace.ldquoThe proposed new development will be accessed via a new access created off Montgomerie Terrace, with the two new houses towards the front of the site, which replace the existing ldquodoran pre-fab and former canoe shed, accessed off the B.ldquoThese proposed homes reflect high standards of design to ensure successful integration with the character of the local area, without damaging the design characteristics of the conservation area.ldquoThe materials, scale and height of the surrounding area have all been assessed to ensure the proposed development is in keeping with the existing housing.The plans attracted five objections relating to the height of the buildings in relation to nearby properties, and raised issues surrounding privacy and sunlight.However, at a meeting of Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning and building standards committee on Monday August , planning officers urged councillors to approve the plans.In a written submission to the committee, planning officer Julie Hayward writes: ldquoThe main issue with the development is the potential impact of the dwellinghouses proposed on plots five and seven on the light, privacy and outlook of Orchard House to the east due to the position of the proposed houses and dfering ground levels.ldquoThe agent has submitted a drawing to show the relationship between the three houses and section drawings showing ground levels.ldquoIn terms of the impact of the proposed house on plot seven, the proposed house would have two bedroom windows in the east elevation at ground floor level and would be on slightly lower ground. Applying the guidelines in the approved supplementary planning guidance, there would be no signicant loss of light or privacy to Orchard House from this property.ldquoIn terms of the impact of the house on plot five on Orchard house, the garage would be positioned on the eastern side of the proposed house and the decking is shown on the western side beyond the rear wing.ldquoThere would be a window and door to the garage and a window to a WC in the rear elevation, which are not considered to be habitable rooms. There would be a large glazed area in the rear wing serving the living room.ldquoThe house is on signicantly higher ground than Orchard House.ldquoAgain, when applying the approved guidance there would be no direct overlooking and no loss of privacy to the habitable rooms of Orchard House.Kelso councillor Simon Mountford said he did not object to the proposals, but wanted to see a design change: ldquoWhat we have here those very boring roof shapes, although I appreciate modern roofs do not have chimneys or anything to break them up a little bit.ldquoIrsquom wonderingwe could ask the developer to break up the roof lines with some new designs.Tweeddale West councillor Eric Small told the committee: ldquoIrsquom quite happy with the way itrsquos sited in this location, so Irsquom going to go with the officers on this one.

I#ve been on many a demonstration in my time and this was one of the best.Rolling off the ferry on the Friday evening we were welcomed by a guard-of-honour standing along the pier waving saltires.The townsfolk turned out in droves to welcome us, waving saltires from windows and even stringing saltire bunting across the street at fourth-storey level. I had the romantic impression that the good folk of Campbeltown had been following the ious pro-independence rallies as they worked their way around the geography of Scotland and had just been waiting for their own town#s turn!The sun stayed out for us right until pm. Then the rain suddenly came down and we took down our Pensioners for Independence stall.  That evening Yes Kintyre put on a special party for us all with local musicians in the Argyll Arms Hotel.On Sunday some of us stayed on and explored your beautul peninsula. As the ferry pulled away that evening members of Yes Kintyre stood along the harbour wall holding up saltires to bid us farewell.Thank you all again for a memorable experience.Yours,Mary McCabe,Glasgow.Sir,It was my great privilege to attend yet another Open at Royal Portrush and to witness  year-old Oban golfer Robert MacIntyre finish tied sixth in his very first Major Championship.It was a wonderful performance, and confirmation, of the talent and the temperament we, the journalists, felt sure that he had.  He is now a Euro millionaire, but he remains an open, helpful and cheerful lad with both feet firmly planted on the ground, thanks to a great family and a strong desire to remain in his home town.I was at Glencruitten for the first time in June and soon discovered why Robert wants to go back there on a regular basis after weeks on tour.  It#s a terric club, no airs and graces.  They are very proud of Robert, and rightly so, but I very much doubtthey would allow him to lose his down-to-earth approach to international recognition.Yours,Jock MacVicar, Southend-born Scottishgolf correspondent and long-time Dunaverty member. Sir,Through the columns of your newspaper, may I express my grateful thanks to all the businesses, organisations, and iniduals, who donated to our fundraising, allowing the dancers to compete in the United States Highland Dancing Championships held recently in Las Vegas.We had a very successful trip, placing in both the Highland and choreography events.

There was a lot of spirit and a feeling that a number of towns in Scotland which have been forgotten, like Campbeltown, will not be left behind after independence.#He put the turnout at more than , and added: #The fact that the march extended theof Longrow gives a fair indication of the numbers who were there.He also told the Courier this week that he remained the #legal indentity# of the All Under One Banner group, despite a bitter public row among the hierarchy which looks like splitting the group in two.It was the biggest rally held in the town in recent years with marchers coming from as far afield as Aberdeen and Alloa and as well as Oban, Glasgow and Islay, with many travelling on the weekend ferry from Ardrossan.#It really exceeded expectations and made a big splash in the town, Ron Wilson of Yes Kintyre told The National.#There was a real buzz as people came early and most of the hotels were booked up. The pubs and cafes were busy so it was good for local businesses. Campbeltown is a Yes town and it was brilliant to have all these people come here. Local people were coming off the pavements and joining the procession so it created a good, positive vibe.Pro-Unionists opponents held their own counter demonstation. However, the march went off without any incident and there were no arrests, with only one warning which was drug related.A spit of rain earlier in the day failed to develop into poor weather as the marchers would round the town to hear speakers and listen to musicians at the rally at Kinloch Green.Mr Wilson said he was particuarly pleased at the turnout as there had been some confusion over whether the march would go ahead due to internal sions within the hierachcy of All Under One Banner, which has organised independence marches across the country.Following Mr Singh#s sacking, founder Neil Mackay resigned from his position on its national executive pending an internal investigation.Pro-UK Unionist group A Force For Good met the march on the shore front and say they filmed and counted the marchers, as they have at previous events, and afterwards claimed the turnout was just .Director, Alistair McConnachie, said: #All Under One Banner is basically the marching wing of the SNP. AUOB, and SNP MPs and MSPs, lie about the numbers which attend their marches, sometimes up to  or  times.#Unfortunately, they are not challenged by the Scottish media.

are fortunate in Scotland to have a way out of such dficulties in the form of a Debt Arrangement Scheme , which is one of Scotland’s best-kept secrets.  It’s available from charitable organisations such as StepChange and from commercial debt advisers such as TC Debt Solutions, too.  It is a Scottish Government scheme that is legally binding and prevents creditors from taking further action against people who owe money.Set up back in  by the Scottish Government, the scheme allows people to freeze interest and charges on their debts and pay their debts off interest-free over a longer period of time.  This brings payments down to levels that people can afford and gives people the chance to get their lives back on track.  Interest and charges are simply written off.Apart from reducing debt, one of the best things about the DAS scheme is that it protects people from their creditors but is not a form of insolvency: people get to pay back their debt in an affordable way.  Lenders like the scheme because they know they will eventually get their money back – and borrowers like it because they don’t have to pay interest charges and they get longer to pay their debts off.  It’s a case of everyone wins.There’s plenty of information about the Debt Arrangement Scheme online at  www.aib.gov.uk debt-arrangement-scheme.  Thousands of people have used the scheme, but so many

summer tournament, winning the competition in , the one-off match was played in a good spirit, but it was the Pupils who found their ruthless streak to snatch a win in the closing minutes.Rhu, fielding a team with plenty of height and energy, featuring several former youth players from Dumbarton FC # and former teammates of Pupils’ playmaker Donald McCallum # threatened early on.At the other end, though, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils had first-half chances, with Scott Souden and youngster Calum McKillop both having one-on-one opportunities, but their efforts were stopped by the Rhu keeper.The second half exploded into le on the hour mark as former Sons youth Callum Scott made his mark for Rhu, turning inside his marker to curl a classy left-footed finish beyond stand-in goalkeeper Ellis Robertson.Undeterred, the Pupils searched for an equaliser, and were given the opportunity minutes later when a Rhu handball in the box was penalised by referee Thomas d’Alessandro.John McCallum, playing as sweeper in a back three with Fraser Wylie and Ross Souden, stepped up to send the keeper the wrong way and make it -.However, after a lapse in concentration, the Pupils conceded a second goal, a cleverly guided header from a near-post corner evading Robertson in goal.Then, with the -degree heat and high humidity making the game hard work for both teams, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils rallied to equalise.A sweeping move involving midfield trio Keith Mitchell, Stuart Crossan and Donald McCallum found Scott Souden, who made no mistake when bearing down on goal, lashing a right-foot shot past the Rhu keeper, to the delight of his teammates and the clutch of Campbeltonians making the long journey to spectate.Then, in the dying seconds, after seeing shots blocked at their own end, thanks to some vital interventions from Robertson, the Pupils stole a winner when midfield substitute Finn Scott was teed up by Scott Souden to slot the ball home low beyond the Rhu keeper, ensuring the visitors completed pre-season unbeaten.Pupils manager Campbell Robertson said: ‘The conditions were tough, but the boys played really well, and our shape was good too. We would like to thank Rhu Amateurs for their excellent post-match hospitality.’Meanwhile, the Pupils’ centenary season officially starts tomorrowwhen they host Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star at

Now, the environmental body hopes that this will be reduced by Scotland’s forthcoming depositscheme.Under the scheme, shoppers will pay a p deposit when buying drinks purchased in single-use plastic or glass bottles and aluminium or steel cans. People will get their money back when theytheir empty container for recycling. The aim of that p will be to give people an extra incentive to recycle their empty bottles and cans, and make people think twice about dropping them.#Our new figures reveal how Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme could visibly slash the number of littered plastic bottles in the Orkney Islands,# said Zero Waste Scotland#s chief operating officer, Jill Farrell.#We all hate seeing empty bottles and cans littering our streets, green spaces and beaches. The great thing about Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme is it will give people a p incentive to do the right thing with their empty bottles — take them back for recycling, rather than risk them ending up on our streets or in our rivers.#Litter isn’t just an eyesore — it also pollutes our environment and seas. And for every bottle littered, more plastic has to be created, generating more planet-damaging emissions. When you take back your empty bottles to be recycled, you’ll not just be getting your p back — you’ll be doing your bit in the fight against the climate emergency.#Further figures from Zero Waste Scotland also show that Orkney goes through an estimated . million plastic bottles every year. An estimated , plastic bottles are littered in the county each year. With a p incentive not to throw away your empties, Zero Waste Scotland anticipates a  per cent reduction in litter for the materials included in the scheme. This would mean , fewer plastic bottles dropped in Orkney Islands each year.With plastic bottles only one of the materials included in the scheme, the overall impact on litter is expected to be even higher. Steel and aluminium cans, glass bottles will also be part of the scheme. The Scottish Government is expected to introduce legislation to enable the scheme later this year.

Internal features such as stone benches have also been found along either side.The hall is oriented towards the sea and finds include steatite , pottery, a bone spindle whorl and a fragment of a Norse bone comb.The find provides tantalising evidence of the earliest phases of inhabitation on this farm and settlement mound which may well have been inhabitated for over , years.It provides another piece to the ,-year jigsaw along this archaelogy rich stretch of coast as Westness in Rousay — described as the #Egypt of the North#.A team of archaeologists from the University of the Highlands and Islands Archaeology Institute, Rousay residents and students have been digging at the site for a number of years, investigating the later stages of the farm complex and its waste heaps with a particular focus on past diet, farming and fishing practices.Although only partly uncovered at this stage, the Skaill hall has parallels with other Norse halls excavated in Orkney, such as Snusgar, and where in Scotland.The excavation is part of the Landscapes of Change — Archaeologies of the Rousay Clearances and Westness Estate project which is exploring the Skaill farmstead.The present farm at Skaill dates to the th and th centuries and was part of the Rousay clearances during the mid-th century.The name Skaill suggests the site was home to a Norse hall or drinking hall, and was a high status site.Westness is mentioned in Orkneyinga saga as the home of Sigurd, a powerful chieftain, so it was always likely that a Norse settlement was located somewhere at Skaill.Earlier structures have been found below the present farm during previous seasons, and this season explored more of the Norse phases of the site.Three dimensional models of the farmstead can be found here.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The goodwill for such agreements was there, she added.It is easy to see the appeal of such agreements for those voters who believe that Brexit – especially the no-deal iety now envisaged by the Prime Minister – represents a catastrophic act of self-harm. If Swinson and the leaders of other avowedly anti-Brexit parties could reach agreements in key constituencies across the UK to stand only the candidate with the greatest chance of winning then, surely, the chances of the Johnson project being stopped in its tracks would be greatly enhanced.There are just one or two small hurdles in the way…The first of these is the fact that, although speculation runs feverishly, Johnson has not yet called a general election.It’s certainly true that many Conservative Party MPs would like the new PM to capitalise on a boost in the polls to try to increase their numbers at Westminster, but others believe this might be a risky strategy. If Nigel Farage’s Brexit Partysplits the right-wing Eurosceptic vote, then a snap election could bring the Johnson premiership to a sudden end.But let us imagine that Johnson goes down the general election route before the current Brexit deadline of  October and that Swinson sets about trying to build an anti-Brexit coalition. She might have been able to persuade Plaid and the Greens to step aside in a single by-election, but would these parties really be so keen to lay down their electoral chances across the country  Would they risk, by seeing their overall votes in a general election diminish severely, becoming less politically relevant And what about the SNP, every bit as opposed to Brexit as the Lib Dems  There are fewer seats in Scotland where anti-Brexit parties risk splitting the vote than there are in England, but one of them – East Dunbartonshire – is Swinson’s own.Swinson served as MP for that constituency between - and was then defeated by the SNP’s John Nicolson. She took the seat back in , largely, I suspect because of Nicolson’s unpopularity. But with a more impressive candidate, the SNP would surely have a fighting chance of snatching it back. The removal of the leader of the Liberal Democrats from the House of Commons would represent quite a scalp for the nationalists. Can you imagine Nicola Sturgeon passing up the opportunity to see off Swinson  I can’t. And nor would I blame the SNP leader for committing signicant resources to bringing down Swinson. Politics is a contact sport and Swinson is a major target. The suggestion from her that the SNP should give her a clear run at the seat would, rightly, be met with derision.Jo Swinson is not the only party leader now talking about pacts. Brexit Party leader Farage has raised the prospect of deals with the Conservatives, particularly in the north of England, to ensure the election of Eurosceptic MPs.Given the result of the  referendum, any such agreements would surely guarantee the evisceration of any anti-Brexit candidates in those areas.Yes, electoral pacts might be made to work for pro-EU parties but they could just as easily be the secret of Brexiteer success.Those now clamouring for agreements to be struck between the Lib Dems and other parties which take the same position on EU membership should, I think, be careful that they are not wishing for the creation of two-horse races in key constituencies across the country. That scenario would risk strengthening rather than weakening the Brexiteers’ squad at Westminster.Johnson is supported by a team in government that is fully committed to Brexit by  October at any cost. The PM will gladly sacrice the best interests of the UK economy to protect himself.This being so, and with Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour still embarrassingly weak on the matter of Brexit, the idea that the Johnson project might be stopped is an appealing one to those of us who would dearly like to see Brexit cancelled at this late stage.But I fear that any plan to run a single anti-Brexit candidate in a constituency would be met with a plan to run a single pro-Brexit candidate. Jiggery-pokery would be fought with jiggery-pokery.It is abundantly clear that Brexiteers won the  referendum with a campaign strewn with lies. Their promises of an effortless, painless departure from the EU have long since been exposed.But rather than turning against campaign leaders, pro-Brexit voters appear to be hardening their positions and cheering on a damaging no-deal departure.It may now be obvious that Brexit is going to be dficult to deliver. But stopping it will be harder still.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon labour the stumbling block to alliance as john mcdonnell calls snp tories","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The First Minister said she did not believe there would be a formal coalition with Labour, but wanted the SNP to be part of a \"progressive alternative\"the parliamentary arithmetic meant it could halt Boris Johnsons government.But shadow chancellor John McDonnell, who has sparked an internal Labour row over a second independence referendum, today described the SNP as \"Tories\" and said there would be \"no pact or coalition\".Speaking at the official opening of a new renewable energy scheme in Stirling, Ms Sturgeon said: \"I think its even more important now that we try to build that kind of progressive alliance that gets the Tories out because they are intent on taking the country down a catastrophic Brexit path.\"I dont envisage any formal coalition with Labour, but I want the SNP to be part of efforts to get things on to a better track than they are on now.\"The stumbling block to that is Labour. Labour are still on the fence on Brexit and Jeremy Corbyn is abdicating his position of leadership by not giving that clear direction. So we need to get Labour off the fence and then we can look to stopping Boris Johnson in his tracks, hopefully.\": John McDonnell doubles down on opposition to blocking a second independence referendumBut Mr McDonnell, speaking at an event at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, said: \"I have ruled out any pact, any coalition whatsoever. We want a general election - and I say to Boris Johnson - bring it on. I think wersquoll go in as a majority Labour government, butwe donrsquot, and Irsquove made this explicitly clear, we will go in as a minority government and we will lay out our programme and seek to implement it.\"If other political parties or inidual MPs support our proposals thatrsquos up to them, thatrsquos fine.

I donrsquot want to be derogatory, but my own view is I think theyrsquore Tories.\" During the  election campaign the Conservative Party ran an effective campaign showing the then Labour leader Ed Milliband in the pocket of the then SNP leader Alex Salmond, to suggest that the parties that might form an alliance in the event of a hung parliament.The then Prime Minister David Cameron said the billboard campaign warned voters \"you could end up with an alliance between the people who want to bankrupt Britain and the people who want to break up Britain\".: Tory poster shows Ed Miliband in Salmondrsquos pocketEarlier Ms Sturgeon did welcome Mr McDonnells remarks about a Labour government not blocking a request for a second independence referendum, which are contrary to the partys current position.She said: \"John McDonnells comments, as far as Im concerned, are a statement of basic democracy. He said that it should be for the Scottish Parliament to decide the timing of an independence referendum and it should be for the Scottish people to decideScotland becomes independent or not.\"Im surprised that anybody thinks that is a controversial statement - it is basic democracy. Westminster governments are perfectly entitled to argue against independence and seek to persuade Scotland not to make that choice but theyre not entitled to block the right of the Scottish people to choose.\"She added: \"If you look at the poll this week, in Scotland, Labour dont have that many voters left at all but of those they do have left, according to that poll  per cent or so support independence so the position John McDonnell stated seems to me to be a politically sensible one from Labours perspective.\"The fact that Scottish Labour seems so opposed to it can only suggest that they are determined to continue their downward spiral that theyve been on for the last few years.

He was speaking at an NFU meeting in the Lerwick Hotel.Asked about a Tory threat to the minimum wage protection that was in place for agricultural workers, he said he didn’t hold with a minimum wage workers should be free to accept as low a wage as was offered.Their “freedom” was to be exploited.Back then LibDems opposed Labour’s plan to extend the minimum wage on principle.

Other events of similar size # even in less challenging locations than Lewis # have come and gone. But the HebCelt remains, steadfast and loyal in the face of changing fashions and changing economic demands.Without the Celtic element, it#s doubtful it would have been able to survive, but as it is it offers something unique in the Scottish music events calendar # both in the kind of acts on show and the setting, with a floodlit Lews Castle over-looking the main site, giving it an ambience all of its own.With up to  acts on show, performing from early afternoon to late at night, it once again provided a veritable feast of Celtic and traditional music. Now some may quibble that the music of KT Tunstall, the headline act, is not Celtic in nature # more pop-rock maybe # but the LA-based singer-songwriter is most certainly Scottish. And she got married in Skye, so that#s enough.Maybe the biggest testament to this year#s festival is that the internationally-renown performer, with a string of hits and albums to her name, did not steal the show as you might expect.Instead the talk of the tent was on the performances from the likes of Elephant Sessions the country and western outfit of The Shires # always likely to prove a hit at an island event # and west coast favourites Manran and Tide Lines.And, of course, there#s the strange phenomenon that is Peat n Diesel, three unassuming local characters whose tongue-in-cheek lyrics # like #Calum Dan and his Transit van# # have captured a mass following, particularly among the youth. They were first scheduled to play in the small acoustics before the hordes of disappointed followers, who were simply unable to get near, persuaded the festival organisers to give them a last-minute billing on the main stage. It was again a hoot, and maybe it#s true after all that #that#s the way we do it in the Western Isles#.But perhaps the real beauty of the HebCelt is that it is about far more than what happens at the main site. From Wednesday to Saturday the town was alive every night into the small hours of the morning. No doubt bar and hotel staff were exhausted in the aftermath, but rather delighted in the sharp spike in takings.The truth is that, while tourist numbers coming to the island are on the rise, the local economy is not performing great.

The results are projects which genuinely improve the lives of today#s residents # as well as visitors # and leave a legacy for future generations. What is even more remarkable is the fact these projects are achieved with very little access to loans. The good work of the community trusts is achieved through dogged determination to raise funds within the community combined with seriously clever navigation of the minefield of grant applications. By steadily securing the funds from a myriad public pots and local activities the trusts ensure each project is not only affordable now, but sustainable for generations to come.In Staffin # home to the iconic Old Man of Storr # the local community trust has raised over £, to upgrade existing footpaths and create new ones. There will be new parking, #welcome# structures and interpretation boards at all sites. The whole project will result in what the trust is calling #Skye Ecomuseum# which will encourage visitors to spend more time and therefore more money in Staffin.In the north west of Skye, the Glendale Trust covers a huge area that attracts , visitors a year # many travelling the long and winding single track road to the top five hotspot of Neist Point.The trust, under the leadership of Tim Hunter-Davies and three new directors, is working hard to develop sustainable facilities for the community and tourists. They have taken ownership of Meanish Pier and the foreshore, creating opportunities for local residents and regional businesses alike. It will be run commercially and provide income to enable the Trust to invest in further sustainable community projects.Glendale # which was the subject of Scotland#s first community buyout back in  # is rich in history and the trust is also looking to develop projects that preserve and share the story of the area, as Tim Hunter-Davies explains: #As well as being instrumental in land reform in the last century, Glendale has a rich heritage stretching back through the centuries. A steamer used to sail daily from Loch Dunvegan and was used as a point to transport many people away from Scotland during the Highland clearances. We want to preserve and share our history with the community and visitors.#In south Skye is the Sleat Community Trust. It has been working hard to provide and improve leline services for the community that also benefit visitors arriving and leaving Skye on the Armadale Mallaig ferry.The SCT currently provides shop, post office and fuel services in two buildings no longer fit for purpose. Over £, has been raised from public and private sources to build a new shop with a community #social# space and offices for the employees of the Trust. They hope to open the new shop in early summer .In addition, the purchase by the Trust of the -hectare Tormore Forest in  continues to create additional sources of income, including selling housing plots as well as an attraction for the community and visitors alike. As trust business development manager Mike Shucksmith explains, the success is based on a combination of commercial and voluntary activity.He said: #To maintain the forest, we have to generate income so we sell split logs to the community, create woodchip for biomass boilers and are developing a micro-hydro scheme. At the same time, we have a vibrant volunteer culture in Sleat who have created a network of paths, social areas and a polytunnel where local school children can help grow saplings to regenerate the forest. The trust also operates #Skyenet # a community broadband network # a community transport scheme, Tormore Explore Forest School and the Visit Sleat tourism group, which promotes the area as a destination of choice for visitors.#From the Sleat Peninsula to the gateway to Skye in the south where a new access route to the island is being created by the members of the Broadford and Strath Community Company. They are developing a cycle path all the way from Kyle of Lochalsh to Broadford. One of the project pioneers is keen local cyclist, Andy Neison.#I used to commute from Teangue on Sleat to Kyle by bike,# he said. #I was really unnerved by the road from Breakish to Kyle with a high volume of fast-moving traffic. When friends told me about the old road from Broadford to Kyle I started exploring sections of it. It#s a good starting point and will become a pioneer project for the highlands.#After receiving a grant of £, from Sustrans, a sustainable transport charity, to fund engineering and traffic surveys, the Trust is now working to secure funding for a project officer to take the Skye Cycleway to the next phase. The community is heavily invested in the project with volunteers coming out in all weathers to clear sections of the old road, but this is a long-term project with hundreds of thousands of pounds ultimately needed to complete the full route from Kyle to Broadford.Over the Skye bridge, the Kyle and Lochalsh Community Trust is creating a vast community and visitor experience on a piece of land known as the Plock.Securing funding from the Scottish Land Fund enabled the Trust to take ownership of the Plock and the old Skye Bridge toll office and develop a masterplan for these two community assets. On the Plock itself, there will be a hub building with cafe, carpark and toilets, a network of accessible paths, a #pitch and putt# course, a Viking living village, accommodation pods, a watersports centre, wildle hide and a for thrill-seekers a huge zipline across the bay.Jo Wawrzyczek of the trust expects the Plock to attract , visitors a year. #This is an ambitious project that will cost almost £million,# she said. #However, it is very important for local people and businesses as it will help to create a great community space as well as keep visitors in our community for longer.#The trust also owns and manages the public toilets and pontoons in Kyle which will be a source of income for the project. With the aim of making the project self-sustaining, the Trust plans to lease the café and watersports centre on the Plock as well as generating income through the accommodation pods. Inspired by the success of other community-driven harbour developments such as Tobermory on Mull, Portree and Braes Community Trust want to maximise opportunities for local people and visitors through taking ownership of the harbour and improving facilities.The trust is currently in talks about relocating the oil tanks at the pier head which would be a breakthrough for the project and open up commercial opportunities. They are also considering a new road from the south to improve access and ert traffic away from the town centre. But according to development officer Fiona Thompson a new breakwater and pontoons will be the real game-changer for Portree.She said: #There have been aspirations for improvements to facilities at the harbour for over  years with little major investment.The harbour group are now closer than ever to realizing the community#s vision for a new, vibrant, welcoming port. A breakwater will allow us to provide overnight berths and efficient, comfortable transfer for cruise ship passengers, while a visitor centre will provide a warm highland welcome to visitors from across the globe. This project will be transformational for Portree and surrounding areas.#The community trusts of Skye and Lochalsh all have several features in common. They have vision, ambition, energy and drive and they are full of volunteers who are committed to bringing long-term projects to fruition for the benefit of their community # and their visitors # for decades to come."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Skye-Bridge-2018-winners.jpg","title":"skye bridge 10k race to kick start kyleakin gala","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe first bridge k was held  years ago, and since  hundreds have taken on the challenge in an event which has helped raise thousands of pounds for good causes based in Kyleakin and surrounding areas.back again.Online entry — which is discounted — will be open until Friday th August, or runners can register on the morning of the race for £.

It’s really invaluable having Deirdre and Micheál onboard and it was incredible to see so much of an eclectic mix of people at the launch. Art and creativity is very much part of the foundation of Féile.”Aisling Award winner Deirdre Mackel has spent six years at the helm of the visual arts exhibition having previously become involved as an exhibitor. “I have seen the exhibition grow over the years, it’s brilliant to be a part of, to see the amount of people coming in and just taking their time to see the art works,” she said. “It just really warms my heart to see all the art up in St Mary’s.”Deirdre spoke of the amount of preparation that goes into the artistic showcase each year. “There is a lot of background work, the call that goes out for artists to display in the first instance. When you see people coming in and installing their art works it’s just magical. You really get a sense of what it means on launch night which we had last Wednesday, seeing what it means to people, to the artist it lts my spirits. Debuting artists would say ‘I’m so nervous’ and they come back year after year, the exhibition really encourages new artist development and another thing that comes out of it is a real sense of volunteering.”Deirdre continued: “Local artist Micheál Gallagher has also come on board and the team have been very much hands on deck. We have some really stand-out pieces from the West Belfast Arts Society, Richard Kelly and a focal point is always the Relatives for Justice Remembrance Quilt. We have a series of Civil Rights posters which were exhibited in the Tate Modern and now they have been brought to Féile.“We are seeing a lot of the artists coming here with their families and staying for the duration of the festival. The visual arts exhibit gains more and more momentum year on year.” The Féile Visual Arts Exhibition will be on display until Thursday, August . All are welcome to attend."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"bombay street play brings back memories for roma","story":"BRASSNECK Theatre Company’s latest productiontells the story of the burning of Bombay Street.Something in the Air will take to the stage at the Roddy’s for a limited run during the annual Féile an Phobail. Written by playwright Laurence McKeown and centred on events surrounding the pogroms, which led to the outbreak of the Troubles  years ago this August, the play details how sectarian violence erupted across the city, how families were forced to flee their homes and ended up taking refuge across the border. Brassneck Artistic Director Tony Devlin told the Andersonstown News how the play will coincide with the th anniversary of the events, which were the catalyst for the Troubles. “This play is a daring piece of writing that will force audiences to not only reflect on the  years since the Troubles began but through it we want to create a conversation for debate and discussion about how we collectively move forward for the benefit of future generations.“The play explores one woman’s journey from Bombay Street after that night when her family were forced from their home and forced to go to a place called Gormanston down south where these families stayed for a few months while Bombay Street was rebuilt or they were rehoused,” he said. “ years later, this woman, who was  at the time, is expecting a researcher from Dublin to come and talk to her about the events of that night. This character Rosie Murray is played by acclaimed actor Roma Tomelty who I have known for years and am delighted to be working with in this project.”Tony spoke of how the play was to be first performed at The MAC theatre back in May but had to be halted due to the tragic death of fellow lead actress Mary Jordan’s mother in a car accident in Dublin. “We cancelled the show and now are in a position to bring it back. Working on this, directing this has been an education for me having been born in the late ’s, I had never heard of Gormanston. I didn’t know we had refugees in our own country during this time in our history. “Myself and Laurence also wanted to focus on the North South ide which is an underlying theme in this play. We wanted to address how the North and South has been pulled apart since partition.”Roma Tomelty who portrays the character of Rosie Murray said she knew “exactly who she, Rosie, was” from the first few lines of the script. “I have known Tony a long time, he asked me to play the part and we have a long history. When I got the script, the first line is that ‘I went to St Vincent’s School’ – which I did so from then on in I thought I know exactly who you are. The play is marking this event. “I was on the road the night the burning of Bombay Street happened. We were trying to get home to Andersonstown, my aunt was burnt out of Dover Street. “There is a line in the play about ‘ordinary people living in extraordinary times’. I remember driving through the chaos that night, you just got on with it,” she said. Actor Mary Jordan’s character is now a researcher after “turning her back” on her former banking career during the Celtic Tiger. “My character becomes very interested in Rosie’s story and to learn that there were refugees from Belfast. She comes to visit Rosie to hear more and I can’t say anymore than that,” she added cryptically. “Audiences will find out more as the play progresses.”Something in the Air will run at the Roddy McCorley Social Club from Wednesday August  until Sunday August .Tickets are priced at £ and are available from the bar."},{"url":null,"title":"belfast city airport flights to london delayed due to british airways systems issue","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

She said: \"I have a wedding to get to, so this just isnt a case of postponing a weekend away. I think Ill just have to get the next flight out of Gatwick but honestly its a lot of extra cash to cover before I get to claim insurance.\" Meanwhile, images on social media showed long queues of holidaymakers at airports and error messages on the BA app. The airline said the systems issue had resulted in delays and cancellations from London airports. It is offering short-haul passengers departing from Heathrow, Gatwick and London City the chance to re-book to another day between Thursday and next Tuesday. A spokesman said: \"We are working as quickly as possible to resolve a systems issue which has resulted in some short-haul cancellations and delays from London airports. \"A number of flights continue to operate but we are advising customers to check ba for the latest flight information before coming to the airport.\" BA is using back-up and manual systems to try to cope with the problems. A major computer failure hit the airline over spring bank holiday weekend in May , standing tens of thousands of passengers and costing owner AIG around £ million. The airline cancelled  flights due to a power failure, sparking a raft of compensation claims for flight costs, train and hotel expenses, replacement clothes and toiletries. The GMB union blamed the meltdown on cost-cutting and the outsourcing of hundreds of IT jobs, which was denied by BA. More recently, it has faced troubles including threatened strikes by its pilots. The airline is also set to be fined £ million over a cyber attack on its security systems last year in which the personal data of up to , customers was stolen. On the trains, services will ert to London Bridge where possible, with travellers advised to Thameslink or other Southern services where available, National Rail Enquiries said. Tickets can be used for alternative transport on London buses, some Thameslink services, and the London Underground.

He was away on church business.He said: \"I only got back to Fort William around what would have been half-time. And I didnt bother going to the match.\"But it was fantastic to hear that the barren streak was over. Supporters have been euphoric. And its been amazing to see the response all over the world to the win.\"The club has gained thousands of fans on the internet and Fort Williams merchandise sells across the globe.News of the overdue win has delighted people far and wide.\"The congratulations have been coming in from everywhere,\" added Mr Baxter, who never lost faith - even when Fort William were routinely shipping  and  goals every other Saturday.And while he has stopped short of calling the win over Nairn County a miracle, he says it is a fitting reward for the clubs determination to keep going in the face of adversity.Internal wrangling has also caused dficulties at Fort William, but a new board have vowed to push the club forward.Despite the horric results of the last few years, new-found fans have been known to travel thousands of miles to watch Fort William, whose ground at Claggan Park is one of the most picturesque in the UK - sitting at the foot of Ben Nevis.Mr Baxter, who used to attend the occasional Bangor FC game at Clandeboye Park in his youth, said he has always been proud to be associated with Fort William, whose away games in the Highland League to clubs like Wick Academy and Cove Rangers can involve five-hour drives.According to Mr Baxter, the small population in the Fort William area and the competition from the Scottish game shinty made it hard in the past for the club to attract new players, who are paid a maximum of £ a week.But this season a deal has been done with Scottish Championship side Inverness Caledonian Thistle to lend Fort William young players. Six of them featured in the line-up against Nairn County.Another three players are also on loan with the team, who denied the Caley Thistle arrangement amounted to a take-over.The hapless Highlanders have become an internet sensation with thousands of followers keeping up with their every move ... and defeat.And the Nairn result was greeted with a flood of overjoyed messages on social media, with one fan David Childs posting: \"What a time to be alive.\"The Scottish National Partys Westminster leader Ian Blackford even got in on the act, tweeting: \"Heartfelt congratulations to Fort William FC on an emphatic victory after an -day wait.\"The Fort William manager Russell McMorran has said he wont allow the Nairn success to go to his players heads. And his down-to-earth caution has been endorsed by Rev Baxter, a former Bangor Grammar School pupil who left Northern Ireland in  to study in Scotland and Oxford before becoming a tax inspector.

It is perched above the Co Donegal village of Burt and attracts thousands of visitors every year.The fort is a powerful manestation of what remains of ancient Ireland and on a clear day, from its pinnacle, it is possible to get a glimpse of three counties-Donegal, Derry and Tyrone. The commanding and spectacular waterways of Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle lie to its west and east respectively.But, in the th Century the fort, once home to kings of old Gaelic order, was rapidly disintegrating towards extinction. It was however saved by the vision of one man who spearheaded its restoration just over  years ago.Dr Walter Bernard was born on May ,  at Newmarket, Co Cork. His father was a captain in the th Rles, a regiment of the British Army and was amongst the reinforcements that arrived in Brussels on the eve of the Battle of Waterloo in June of  but was apparently too late to take part in the famed history changing conflict.Walter became a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland in , a Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland in  and Fellow of that college in .Between - Dr Bernard served as a surgeon throughout the Crimean War attending the wounded British soldiers at Inkerman and witnessed the ravages caused by small pox and cholera. He later recalled that for every man that was shot, fty more were killed by those diseases, particularly in the notoriously harsh winters of  and .On the journey home from the Ukranian battlefields, he saved a man from drowning and was awarded with a certicate from the Royal Humane Society. Then, with his experiences of military conflict at an end, Dr Bernard landed back in Ireland and settled in Buncrana before building up a very large medical practice in Derry. He ran this surgery for over sixty years and was a prominent member of the city’s branch of the British Medical Association as well as holding many public offices throughout his career.One such appointment was to examine the quality of water in the city for Londonderry Corporation at public facilities such as the Creggan reservoirs built in stages between -, and which supplied much of the city’s domestic and industrial water needs.His experience of the waterborne disease cholera in the Crimea made him an ideal candidate for this job.Dr Bernard also addressed the Medical Society of King and Queens College of Physicians on the issuer of diphtheria in April . He cautioned the assembled medics that there was a reason why the disease was largely absent from statistics sheets.He said: “There are few diseases about which so many mistakes in diagnosis are made.”He feared the misdiagnosis rate was so high that it was almost impossible to ensure that ‘true diphtheria’ was as common in a town as reported.Dr Bernard added: “Diphtheria occurs in Londonderry, I have no doubt whatever…in my practice it has been my lot to treat many cases of this disease.”At some point in , Dr Bernard paid a visit to Grianan of Aileach and many years later in , he said of the experience: “Seventeen years ago, when this traditional and historical place was first visited by me, I found it in a very ruinous condition, and from that time I commenced to take an interest in its associations.“Year after year I witnessed further advance of its ruin, and I clearly saw thatsomething were not soon done to arrest the progress of its destruction, it would be in a few years a thing of the past.”Grianan of Aileach is a hilltop fort that sits on top of Greenan Mountain in Inishowen just over  feet above ground level.The ringfort was thought to have been built in the sixth or seventh century, although there is some evidence to suggest that the site had been in use before that.Greek astronomer and cartographer Ptolemy penned a remarkably accurate map of Ireland in  A.D. from which maps were later created in the th and th centuries. He called the land ‘Iouernia’, thought to mean ‘abundant land’ from which the Irish names Eriu and Eire are derived. Amongst two sites identied as ‘regia’ or royal places in Ireland by the Greek map maker, one of them is believed by some historians to be the Grianan of Aileach.Whether Ptolemy pinpointed it or not, the Kingdom of Aileach was indeed one of Ireland’s royal sites of the Gaelic order. The fort was thought to have been constructed originally by the northern section of the Ui Neill clan, but between  A.D. and the thirteen centuries, over  kings from ious clans, some also High Kings of Ireland, held the throne of Aileach. The last man to be known as the King of Aileach was Aed Buide Ua Neill who died in .Despite ious interpretations, it is generally agreed that Aileach means ‘stony place’ and the word Grianan means ‘sunny place’ so that Grianan of Aileach broadly translates as ‘The Stone Palace of the Sunny View’.Whatever the actual meaning of its name, it is evident that it was an extremely important place. Aileach’s political and strategic importance was such that the annals of Irish history record that it was attacked at least three times. In , Finsnechta Fledach, King of Ireland, destroyed the fort.Again, in , when Muirchertach MacNeill was king, Viking raiders sacked the site when they settled at Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle. It’s also thought that King Brian Boru came to Aileach in , but it was destroyed once more in , when another King of Munster, Muirchertach Ua Briaincame to Inishowen and plundered the region and razed the fort. The fort was laid to waste by O’Brien in revenge for O’Neill’s destruction of his royal seat at Kincora and he reportedly told his soldiers to each take a stone from the Donegal hillside so the place would be reduced to rubble.The fort itself could have served two main s both as a defensive and a ceremonial one and moreover as a settlement that was surrounded by ringforts of lesser importance. Whatever its actual , it is known that buildings of this nature were very rare in North West Ulster and its presence signies that its inhabitants were regarded as being very important.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe linking of St Patrick to the site is seen as attempt by Christian converts to place it firmly in that tradition whilst acknowledging its pagan history and the naming of a holy well right outside the ringfort in honour of Ireland’s patron saint seems to confirm that.There is also a mythological and folklore version of the founding of Grianan of Aileach which says the ringfort was built by Dagda , a god and the king of the Tuatha De Danann-the supposed ‘Tribe of the Gods’-a supernatural race in Irish mythology. The Tuatha De Danann are said to have invaded Ireland before the Celts and built strategic stone forts on the tops of hills.Dagda was said to have fought the Second Battle of Moytirra against the Fomorians and the fort at Aileach was built over the grave of his son Aedh who had been murdered.In , a Derry based group called the Irish Irelanders, enthusiastic Gaelic revivalists travelled to the site on Sunday afternoons and carried out some repairs. But, the splendour and historical intrigue of Grianan of Aileach had largely been ignored for many years until in , Dr Walter Bernard decided to begin its restoration in earnest.In the s, painter, musician, antiquarian and archaeologist George Petrie examined Grianan of Aileach when he was head of the Royal Irish Academy’s antiquities committee which was linked to the Irish Ordnance Survey.Petrie’s findings suggested that the hill many have been enclosed by many other ramparts and a line of stones leading up to the entrance which were all gone by then.But, despite his efforts, the expert’s findings remained confined to the records of the Royal Irish Academy, there were no efforts by the organisation to attempt any restoration of the ancient site.It was Dr Bernard who took practical action beyond the analysis of the site. He paid for the entire project that took place between - and recruited his crew of labourers from the farms surrounding Burt. They ferried the materials needed for the restoration on the back up small carts up supplied by the local landowners up the incredibly steep hill.What the doctor found at the site was a disorganised mess of which he said it was: “An immense circular heap of stones, with its grey fallen masonry scattered over the interior-no vestige of a wall, entrance passage, or central building.”Remembering that Walter Bernard was a medical doctor with no detailed description of what an ancient ringfort truly looked like and that there weren’t enough stones on site to complete the job, makes this story even more remarkable.Dr Bernard discovered many animal bones on the site including sheep, cows and goats and items like sling stones and warrior’s clubs. The most interesting stone object discovered was a ‘slab of sandstone, chequered into thirty-six squares’, believed to be a games board of some type.The doctor and his crew of labourers used the measurements of other Irish forts such as Staigue Fort in Co Kerry as the comparative basis for the restoration project at Grianan of Aileach. The finished product is a fort that stands . metres in diameter and more than five metres tall with walls that are almost four metres thick.Dr Bernard later described a part of the building project by saying: “To bind our work into a complete unity we had to gather around the hill about  or  loose stones-certainly not more,so many-and to split from the adjoining rocks, cropping up through the heather,  coping stones. These are supposed to serve instead of those removed by King Murdock O’Brien in .”Only speculation can be used to assessthe interior of today’s fort accurately resembles its ancient predecessor, but when the alternative was the complete disappearance of the Iron Age construction, then surely Bernard’s efforts become even more admirable.The fort has stood for centuries as a silent witness to major events of Irish history. From the top of Grianan fort you can just make out the location of the Co Donegal village of Rathmullen on the western bank of Lough Swilly.It was from Rathmullen in  that the chieftains Hugh O’Neill and Rory O’Donnell sailed with their families after the final defeat by the English taking with them the last symbols of the old Gaelic order once enshrined in its pomp by places such as Grianan of Aileach. Behind them in the distance the old fort sat on its hilltop as a fading reminder of a society and its traditions that would never .A legend says that in a secret cave on a hill beneath Grianan O’Neill’s warriors rest in a bewitched sleep in full armour and sitting on their horses ready for the next fight. The spell, says the legend, will only be broken when the next destined leader of Ulster arrives to lead them to victory.It is a myth that would have no visible attachmentit had not been for the passion of Dr Walter Bernard in the late th century in restoring Grianan of Aileach to something approaching its former glory.A tourist road to the fort was opened on September ,  by President of Ireland Eamon De Valera who was accompanied by Fine Gael TD for Donegal West, Pat O’Donnell, then Minister for Local Government. In the early s the Office of Public Works in the Republic of Ireland carried out further repairs to Grianan of Aileacgh after a wall collapsed. But as late as October  the Irish Government was being severely criticised by political representatives in Donegal for still failing to establish tour guides and other facilities at the ancient site.In his obituary contained in the Universities and Colleges magazine of December , , it was reported that Dr Bernard died suddenly at his residence in Buncrana on eight days previously on December . He was -years-old and was buried in Derry City Cemetery.Dr Bernard’s obituary ended: “He leaves a widow. His le was deeply scarred by three great sorrows, the deaths of his three children.”CAPTION: The volunteers involved in the restoration of Grianan of Aileach pictured at its official re-opening in ."},{"url":null,"title":"national hunger strike commemoration take place strabane sunday","story":"This Sunday, August , for the first time the National Hunger Strike Commemoration will be held for the first time in Strabane.Thirty-eight years after ten republicans died in Long Kesh during the spring and summer of , thousands of people from across Ireland will march from Lford across the border to the west Tyrone town to remember the prison battle conducted against the Thatcher administration’s policy of criminalisation.Speaking at the announcement that Strabane will host the event, Sinn Fein’s West Tyrone MP Orfhlaith Begley said it was a privilege for Strabane republicans and the rest of the constituency to host the event.“The  hunger strike was a watershed in Irish history and had a profound impact in terms of radicalising communities throughout Ireland. This impact was particularly felt in areas like here in Strabane where pride in the hunger strikers, their courage and sacrice still remains undiminished almost  years on.”The roots of what took place in  began several years earlier, when in  Belfast republican Kieran Nugent became the first man to refuse to wear a prison unorm. In , republicans had been accorded what the British termed Special Category Status recognising the political nature of their offences.By the mid-s however, political status had been withdrawn and as the cages of Long Kesh were replaced by the concrete H Blocks, the new British policy of ‘normalisation’ was wholly designed to strike any notion of political credence away from the IRA campaign.When he entered the H Blocks, Kieran Nugent was instructed to put a prison unorm on by the authorities. He answered, ‘you’ll have to nail it to my back.’ This began five years of protest inside the prison and heightened violence outside it which resulted in dozens of deaths.The blanket and no wash protests of the first four years of the prison conflict yielded no concessions on the issue of political status.The years of isolation and living in dire conditions eventually brought the situation to a head. The choice was plain and stark. The protesting republican prisoners could either concede and serve out jail sentences classed as ‘ordinary criminals’ or escalate the protest to the last ‘weapon’ available to them inside a prison-the hunger strike.It was not a new tactic for the republican movement, and it drew its inspiration from stories from the old Gaelic order.It’s recorded in the annals of Irish history that when a citizen felt slighted by the ruling order, it was not uncommon for them to lie outside their dwelling and refuse food in the hope of publicly shaming the guilty party into reparation and or an apology.In , Thomas Ashe died in Mountjoy prison in Dublin after being force fed whilst on hunger strike demanding political status. Then, in , the Lord Mayor of Cork Terence McSwiney died after  days whilst on hunger strike in Brixton jail. And, next year in  to mark the centenary of the death of McSwiney, the National Hunger Strike Commemoration will take place in Cork city.Back in , Michael Gaughan died in Parkhurst on the Isle of Wight after  days on hunger strike, and shortly before the beginning of the prison blanket and no wash protests in Long Kesh, in February , another Mayo man, Frank Stagg died at Wakefield jail in Yorkshire after  days without food.The first Long Kesh hunger strike began on October , . The protestors set out a list of five demands: -The right not to wear a prison unorm -The right not to do prison work -The right of free association with other prisoners -The right to organise their own educational and recreational facilities and -The right to one visit, one letter and one parcel a week.Seven men, including Sinn Fein MLA Raymond McCartney said they would fast to the death in the pursuit of the re-establishment of political status. Simultaneously, three female republican prisoners also embarked on a strike in Armagh jail.As Christmas  approached, the British offered a deal which appeared to agree to the central demand of the right not to wear a prison unorm. One of the hunger strikers, Sean McKenna was close to death at this stage and the strike was called off. It later emerged that was really being offered was a deal to allow prisoners to wear ‘civilian type clothing’ supplied by the prison regime. The scene was therefore already set for a second strike.It began on March ,  when Bobby Sands refused to eat. Raymond McCartney said: “Obviously everybody’s memory of  is the fact that ten people died on hunger strike.“On March ,  the British Government removed political status. I think most people thought that this was a half-hearted attempt and they’d roll over within a short period of time.“But, clearly what was emerging was a complete change in policy by the British Government who were intent on the idea of ‘normalisation’, ‘criminalisation’ and ‘Ulsterisation’.“Instinctively, any of us who found ourselves in prison at that time, knew we were political prisoners and any attempt to criminalise us just wasn’t going to work. It became a battle of wills.“But, I think by the end of the hunger strike in October, , most people looking on were saying that whatever was going on in the North that nobody in their wildest notion thought it was a criminal conspiracy. They certainly saw it as a political conflict. They may not have agreed with the armed actions of the IRA, but they certainly viewed it as a political situation.“So, for us by that stage, the process of criminalisation was in tatters. But, there was a very high price paid because  people had died in prison and  or  people had died on the streets.“Within the prisons we knew that we still had work to do because what we had to do was turn that acceptance of political imprisonment into every day conditions. By the end of the hunger strike I suppose there was a big recognition of the dference between the criminal’s unorm and our own clothes was one manestation of it. And, over the years we continued to ensure the conditions in Long Kesh reflected that.“By the late s and early s, journalists were frequent visitors to the prison and left with the overwhelming impression that we were a ‘dferent type’ of prisoner. They may have gone out and had questions about who you were and what you were about but they were in doubt that we were political prisoners. That was a big source of validation.”The intensity of the events and scale of death and destruction between  and  in retrospect now seems enormous, but Raymond McCartney maintains that it paved the way for future political developments.“It was only five years, but it was a very intense five years. It is only when you get a bit older you realise just how short a time span it was, because when you roll onto  and the Good Friday Agreement there was an acceptance of the framework that there was a political conflict which had to be resolved by political means-the recognition of political mandates, the political framework to address all these issues, but at the core of that was the acceptance of political prisoners.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“There is no doubt there is evidence that there were elements within the British Government were determined that political status should not be granted for whatever reason.“Even in , when there was internment without trial and up to , people were held in conditions where they wore their own clothes. There was a recognition of the political conflict of one nature or another.“How that was defined by dferent people is a dferent matter. I know that other people have made the observation that for too long the British tried to deal with the North as a security issue. therefore, when you have a security mentality or emergency laws, emergency courts, emergency interrogation centres, everything is changed and turned upside down.“If you follow their logic from that point of view and they say ‘you cannot now say you are political prisoners’ whilst trying to pretend that everything  about the situation isn’t political too then the penny drops in a whole lot of ways.”The almost  years since  have provoked much debate within wider nationalism about whether or not the hunger strike was harnessed as a catalyst for the republican movement to embark on the path to politics.The election of Bobby Sands to Westminster and Kieran Doherty to the Dail was followed quickly by a debate within Sinn Fein about ending their policy of abstentionism from political institutions that would lead to a split in the republican movement in . The Derry News asked Raymond McCartney for his view on this.He said: “It is interesting now, because everyone has their story about what the origins of the peace process was. But, there is absolutely no doubt that when you look back as far as  that Gerry Adams that there needed to be a political way of resolving the conflict, because military stalemate was exactly that.“The famous Glover Report from the British Army accepted that there was not going to be a military defeat, was them in their own way, saying the IRA was a political force and that the guys in Long Kesh were political prisoners. They job they were sent to do, they couldn’t do and that was to impose a military defeat and by extension their laws of oppression were not going to work either.“It made the situation painful and made the conflict last longer. Then, whenever the formula for the Good Friday Agreement was put forward, some former prisoners will tell you that it was too high a price to pay, but the core accepted it was a political problem and without political solutions it was never going to be resolved.”When the first hunger strike ended in October of , Raymond McCartney had gone without food for  days. So, what are his own personal recollections of the physical effects of what took place “I suppose when you look at that time in , Martin Hurson died after  days whilst others like Kevin Lynch were approaching  days when he died.“In a very strange way hunger strike affects dferent people in dferent ways. Even the day the hunger strike ended in , I was still walking about, I was out of bed. But, there is no doubt that your body slows down.“My ability to see was greatly affected. But, the body is a remarkable piece of equipment and resilience is obviously built in. As you get older you reflect on it and it is dficult to work out in your head that you could sustain doing without food for  days and others for  days.“I suppose when you look at that time in , Martin Hurson died after  days whilst others like Kevin Lynch were approaching  days when he died.

But, there is no doubt that your body slows down. My ability to see was greatly affected.“As you get older you reflect on it and it is dficult to work out in your head that you could sustain doing without food for  days and others for  days.”Undoubtedly, it was Margaret Thatcher more than anyone  within the British establishment at the time who demonstrated complete determination to use the protests in Long Kesh to ide and break the republican movement.Many commentators have pointed to the INLA assassination of her colleague Airey Neave in  as one reason why the British Prime Minister embarked on a path of total intransigence towards the IRA. However, Raymond McCartney believes that her thinking was a lot wider than that.“Whatever her antipathy towards Ireland was and what came with that, she was setting out a broader political stall. Look at how she treated the miner’s later on.“Reading state papers now, years after these events, her take on the miner’s strike wasn’t just a battle about conditions in the mines, it was about strategically tackling trade unions. It was a case of her saying who is the strongest union-who is the spine of the working class and acting on that.“I always remember that being in jail gives you the time to reflect and read and think and I also always remember that Bobby Sands out of all the people who had been in jail was very clear about what he was there for because he wrote it all down. Some of the things he wrote captures the way a writer works-it’s all encompassing and puts it out there in a very vivid way.“I had previously been interned, I had an understanding about what being a political prisoner was. You had your own clothes and a bit of freedom to associate with other prisoners and you didn’t feel that sense of captivity although you were locked up. Bobby Sands caught on very early that the British were trying to defeat us in the prisons. It wasn’t just about trying to give you a hard time or denying you your own clothes, it was that they had a core idea to break us.“One of the rewarding things for me personally was that the system we had in the end in jail was one based on equality. That we treated people as equals. If you couldn’t treat the person beside you as a comrade and an equal that you couldn’t expect anyone  to believe that you’d treat all people as equals as you went on through le.”Those wishing to attend the th National Hunger Strike Commemoration are asked to assemble on Sunday, August  at .pm at the Diamond in Lford before marching across the border into Strabane where Martina Anderson MEP will deliver this year’s main oration.CAPTION: Raymond McCartney spent  days on hunger strike in ."},{"url":null,"title":"trade union blasts delusional derry employers treatment frontline workers","story":"A public sector trade union has blasted “unscrupulous” local employers for their “arrogant” mistreatment of workers.UNISON activists attended the recent NIHE Public consultation standardised regional payment rates event in the City Hotel to provide a voice for frontline workers employed through the Supporting People Programme.Earlier this year Derry City  Strabane District Council unanimously backed a motion in support of workers’ rights.The Supporting People programme, which has been operating since , provides housing support services delivered in partnership with service providers across the public, private and voluntary sectors.Support is provided to more than , vulnerable people every year, to enable them to live independently in their own homes, sheltered housing or in supported housing accommodation.Client groups include, Women’s Aid, the House in the Wells, Cheshire House, the Shepherds View Young Parents Project, Francis Street Young Persons Project, Apex Housing - Beechway House and the Simon Community.Its broad objectives are to achieve a better quality of le for vulnerable people, allowing them to live independently and maintain their tenancies. To provide housing support services to prevent problems that can often lead to hospitalisation, institutional care or homelessness.And finally, to assist with a smooth transition to those leaving an institutional environment to independent living.Following a review of the Supporting People programme by the Department for Communities in , it was recommended that payment rates across all Supporting People providers should be standardised.The new rates are supposed to ensure all schemes represent value for money.However, UNISON Community Branch members have questioned the commitment of certain employers within the sector.Niall McCarroll, UNISON Community Branch Chairperson said: “The Supporting People Programme has at its core the fundamental desire to improve the quality of le of those in our communities who need housing related support at any particular time.“However, the standards of living and quality of le frontline workers are experiencing does not reflect the work they complete, as a result of substandard terms and conditions of employment increasingly pushing them into debt, putting them at risk of homelessness and forcing them to use foodbanks.”‘Amoral employers’The UNISON delegation attending the Public Consultation impressed upon the NIHE that the current measures in place to protect frontline workers were inadequate and gave “unscrupulous employers” too much power. “Power which they use to disadvantage many workers whilst their inner circles led lavish lestyles on enhance contracts of employment,” Mr McCarroll added.He said the decision-making on how to manage staffing is at the behest of Supporting People funded organisations, this needs to change.UNISON told the NIHE that the current consultation process in place, designed to improve service delivery for vulnerable people would achieve nothing and fall short of any objectives,frontline staff were not valued and respected within the programme.The NIHE estimate that frontline workers should be in receipt of band  hourly rates with no mention of other band  terms and conditions such as sick pay or sht allowances. UNISON challenged this benchmarking estimate and its lack of detail in other areas, stating this was not the reality for many Supporting People Programme workers.Mr McCarroll continued: “A UNISON delegation of frontline workers will be meeting with the NIHE to further discuss our members’ concerns and we thank the NIHE for agreeing to continue the discussions on how best to protect and value workers, not forgetting that we are all involved in this programme to work together changing the lives of vulnerable people.“UNISON would like to put on record our appreciation of the position and approach taken by the NIHE in engaging with the trade unions and our continued disappointment at the right wing, anti-trade union position and approach taken by some Supporting People funded employers.“These employers operate with an arrogant, delusionary sense of entitlement, the UNISON led Supporting People Campaign will expose these employers and continue to organise workers to stand up and fight, bringing to an end the increasingly shaky gravy train which stops only at head office, bypassing frontline services.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh\"Head office staff receive  months full sick pay while frontline workers receive just  week in any year.  This particular contractual entitlement along with signicant dferences in take home pay is leaving frontline workers feeling undervalued.\"A NIHE spokesperson said the objective of the consultation is to hear the views of service providers, current and potential service users and their families and carers to enable the Housing Executive to identy the best option and approach for implementing this recommendation.The consultation runs for  weeks, it began on  June  and ends  August .Interested stakeholders are invited to participate by completing an online questionnaire at: https:consultations.nidirect.gov.uk nihe-supporting-people srpr"},{"url":null,"title":"waterfoot park residents take council task proposed construction development","story":"Derry City and Strabane District Councilhas pledged to engage fully with a group of residents in the Waterside after they accused the local authority of failing to fulfil their obligations in relation to their objections to a potential building development in their district.In July last year, residents of Waterfoot Park in the city lodged a formal objection to plans for a housing development in the area seeking to construct four semi-detached houses, two detached houses and six, two-bedroomed apartments.The Waterfoot Park residents objected to the proposed development on several grounds which included the potential impact of the construction project on existing properties at the site and that the planning application had not indicated accurate separation and height dferences between the proposed new project and the existing homes.A statement from the Waterfoot Park Residents Objectors Committee to the Derry News said: “The proposed dwellings are three stories in height on ground over two metres higher than the existing houses with restricted separation distances between both.“The layout would result in loss of privacy, natural light, sunlight and overbearing dominance, creating a sense of being hemmed in for us existing residents living adjacent to the boundary line.“Our concerns are also for the natural habitat of wildle species and the overall vast vegetation and trees. No details were provided on how existing vegetation will be retained and no bioersity checklist was provided.”The residents also employed planning consultant Lee Kennedy, who told the Council of his concerns that some demolition work to existing buildings on the proposed development site had already taken place, prior to planning approval and that trees had been felled along the rear boundary of the site close to the homes of the objectors.A spokesperson for the Waterfoot residents said: “Mr Kennedy went onto state that residents have expressed genuine fears about a threat to the remaining vegetation on the application site.“He reminded Council that they hold a duty of care to work in the public interest and offer protection to the remaining mature trees, by the serving of a Provisional Tree Preservation Orderunder the  Planning Act.”Mr Kennedy confirmed to the Derry News that he had submitted a request for a TPO from the Council, but “no action had been taken.”However, the Waterfoot Park residents say their fears were heightened again earlier this month when a team of workers appeared on the proposed development site and began to cut down more trees.A spokesperson for the residents told the Derry News: “On Friday, July  at .am the neighbours were woken with the sound of several power saws and saw a full team of tree cutters on site behind them.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“Within an hour they had created absolute mayhem on the site, with trees felled all around and they were left when they fell.

The residents are up in arms. It should never have been allowed to happen as Council was made aware last year about their responsibility of a duty of care to work in the public interest. The residents feel unsupported to date in their endeavours to the Council.”Addressing the residents’ concerns, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council said that: “During the processing of the application,  objections have been received to the proposed development.“Correspondence to the Planning Department from Planning Consultant, Mr Lee Kennedy acting on behalf of the objectors, was received on August ,  and raised concerns regarding the trees on the site, and a request for a Provisional Tree Preservation Orderto be served on the site.“These concerns were raised with the Planning Department’s Tree Preservation Officer on September ,  who advised on September , that in his professional opinion, a TPO was not appropriate for this site given the nature, type and scale of trees.”On April  this year, Planning Department officials met with objectors at the city’s Council offices, where again, the Tree Preservation Officer advised that a TPO was considered but was unnecessary when assessed against the criteria required for a TPO.The Council spokesperson continued: “The site was further inspected by planning officers on June ,  and officers met with objectors on site.“More recently, the case officer wrote to the agent and the applicant on June ,  to advise that further information was required. Amongst other things requested, the case officer advised that a tree survey of the site was required, a landscaping plan to show existing trees and vegetation to be retained and additional planting to be shown and a bioersity checklist was to be submitted to advise on any existing ecology on the site.“The agent confirmed in correspondence dated, July  that a Phase  habitat survey was instructed to be carried out as well as a tree survey and would be submitted in due course.”However, the Council spokesperson added: “The Planning Department were made aware by an objector by email on July ,  that eight trees along the boundary of the site adjacent to properties in Waterfoot Park had been felled on July  at .am.“Council takes its obligations in respect of these matters seriously and has undertaken an appropriate course of action to ensure that the opinions of residents are and will be fully considered in the processing of the planning application.”CAPTION: Residents of Waterfoot Park have accused the Council of failing to provide a duty of care in relation to a proposed building development."},{"url":null,"title":"machynlleth carnival 2019 event celebrates","story":"Moon landers : Olivia Garrod , Harry Smithand Izzy Owen ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgt drop in on Machynllltspan classtruncate-full-screengteth Carnival.

If we all do a little bit, wersquoll ensure the service is maintained for today, tomorrow and future generations.Earlier this year, local politicians agreed to take the lead in securing financial support for the air ambulance service and also make a monetary contribution to help meet the servicersquos poundm annual running costs.The Department of Health allocates around poundm in annual funding to help keep the helicopter service in the air with money used to finance the air ambulance crew, medicines and medical equipment. Charity funds, including public donations, sustains the aviation side of the operation.It was announced recently that as part of the ongoing consultation on reshaping stroke services, the Department has made a commitment to extend the partnership with Air Ambulance Northern Irelandto enable the helicopter emergency medical service to provide a secondary response to incidents, including strokes, by .Health officials have also confirmed that any changes to the existing arrangement would be subject to the completion of an appropriate business case and agreement with the air ambulance with regard to any funding implications..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Charity Beer and Bubbles 5k run in Finnebrogue  ","story":"M B McGRADY  Co Chartered Accountants is setting the pace this September with the launch of the Beer and Bubbles k run in a bid to raise money for Air Ambulance NI.Open to competitors of all ages and experiences, the race will take place on Thursday, September , at Finnebrogue Woods, nestled on the outskirts of Downpatrick.This is the first k race to take place at the idyllic venue, with the route mapped out so runners take in the stunning woodland and finish close to the lakeside, where they will be able to soak up the atmosphere while enjoying a glass of local beer or prosecco.The event follows on from last yearrsquos successful M B Grady  Co Ultimate Aqua Challenge,.Conaill McGrady, director of M B McGrady  Co, said: ldquoWe are delighted to be supporting Air Ambulance NI for a second year and helping to contribute to maintaining the vital work that they do.

Two special zones will be developed for car parking on either side of the beach and a park for upwards of  cars will be provided in the centre, off the beach area.Under no circumstances, however, will cars be allowed to drive up and down the beach area and the council is expected to appoint full-time beach inspectors to supervise parking during the summer season.The private entrances presently used by beach-goers will be blocked off and two new public driveways will be constructed.

Mr Wilson said that Mr Johnson should tell the taoiseach: “No, no, no.”Mr Varadkar made clear that Ireland is not prepared to renegotiate the backstop – the insurance policy which it insists is crucial to ensure an open border on the island of Ireland but which unionists have overwhelmingly opposed because it would erect barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.When askedno-deal was now the most likely outcome, Mr Varadkar said: “I think that as time goes on, it becomes more likely. I’m not sure at what point you say it becomes more than % likely or not – and I’m not sure what that necessarily achieves anyway because we’ve always been preparing for the possibility of no-deal, and been doing that for years now. “But I’m certain it can be avoided.”Mr Varadkar set out three means by which no-deal could be avoided: MPs ratying an agreement with the EU, an extension to again delay Brexit “which is an optionit is put forward for a good reason” or “ parliament and the government were to decide to – and it would have to be their decision it’s not my decision – to revoke article ”.He insisted that “ no-deal happens on October , it will be as a consequence of decision made in London, not one made in Brussels or Dublin”.The taoiseach said that he “would be very keen to over the course of the next few weeks to actually sit down with Prime Minister Johnson and talk through with him how we got to this point because I think there’s a bit of an effort now to make out that the Withdrawal Agreement, including the backstop, was an invention of the Dublin government or imposed by the European Union. That’s not the case.”He added: “What I’d like to do is talk through how we got to that point. Our analysis is dferent – we ended up with the Withdrawal Agreement and the backstopbecause of all the red lines that were drawn up by the British government. “Nowwe’re going back to square one and those red lines are being changed, then we’ve something to talk about.”Leo Varadkar: Stormont needs to be restored to give Northern Ireland a Brexit voice Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Theresa May’s key red lines were that the UK would leave the single market, would leave the customs union, would end free movement and would bring an end to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in Britain.However, playing down any hopes of even such a substantial sht by Mr Johnson leading to a sudden deal which would see the UK leave at the end of October, he said: “It’s very dficult to see how you could conclude a dferent agreement between now and October  when the last one took two years to negotiate.”Pressed on whether, even in the event of Mr Johnson changing the UK’s red lines there could be a deal by October , he said: “I think it becomes extremely dficult. But again, October st is a deadline that was agreed between the EU and the UK. “The European Union is saying thatthere’s a good reason we can do a further extension.”When askedhe knew what would happen at the Irish border on November the UK was to leave without a deal, Mr Varadkar said: “Well, I suppose that’s still something that we’re still trying to work out in our discussions with the European Commission.“What will certainly happen is thatthe UK leaves without a deal and reverts to the WTO rules, then yes, we will have to impose WTO rules ... that does involve tarfs on imports, both north-south and also east-west and it does involve businesses having to file customs forms and tax forms and so on.“And we’ll have to have some form of checks somewhere. Obviously we don’t want to have them on the border and our preference would be to have them at the ports of entry, at business level and random checks too.”When askedbusinesses could at least have certainty that any checks will not be able to be imposed immediately and therefore trade will not halt on November , Mr Varadkar did not directly answer the question.Pressed on when those checks would begin, he said: “If the UK decides to leave without a deal and reverts to WTO rules and leaves without a deal, it would happen immediately – that’s my understanding of the legal position anyway, and it’s not something that we want it’s something that we want to avoid.“Butthat’s the decision that’s made ... you’d have the tarf barriers, which is cost, and you’d have all the other non-tarf barriers to trade as they call them – having to fill in all the forms, having to pre-declare and so on.”He said that even a no-deal Brexit or a withdrawal agreement without the backstop would not bring certainty for businesses because it would be “just kicking the fundamental questions about the Irish border and about trade between the UK and Ireland into the implementation phase or the transition phase ... so you end up with another two or three years of business uncertainty and that’s not a desirable outcome”.Responding to the argument often made by many Brexiteers and unionists thatthe UK and Ireland agreed not to erect a hard border then that can be avoided, Mr Varadkar alluded to his country’s willingness to ensure that border checks take place, saying that “from our side we would have to uphold the integrity of the single market and the customs union”.He also said that “the idea that the UK could withdraw from the European Union, join the WTO and then the first thing the UK would do would be to break the WTO rules – it’s not a basis for a future trade policy or free trade agreements with anybody, really.”try catch  TrendingN.I.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners.

He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

The paper, which examines the negative impact of a ‘no deal’ EU exit, warns the “Northern Ireland Civil Service’s assessment remains that a ‘no deal’ would have a profound and long-lasting impact on NI’s economy and society”. Among its key points, it says a ‘no deal’ “could lead to a sharp increase in unemployment, with at least , jobs at risk, based on EU export exposure”. “The impact of EU tarfs could reduce NI’s exports to Ireland by % and the inclusion of non-tarf barriers could see a decline of %,” it says. Once again, it raises serious concerns over the agri-sector in particular, meat in particular, and beef especially, in regards to “increased vulnerability to low cost non-EU imports in the GB or NI market”. Its not just the physical goods, though as it says Northern Irelands IT sector is facing the cost of exporting services increasing, by an average of .%. And regarding foreign direct investment– one of the big business buzzwords here over the last few years – it says “under a ‘no deal’ exit, NI’s FDI attractiveness would be negatively impacted”. “A ‘no deal’ would see losses in the medium to long run of % per annum in the case of the number of FDI projects and of .% for FDI-related new jobs.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/hamilton_hotel.jpg","title":"new  bedroom hotel for titanic quarter","story":"Posted on Monday  July  by John Mulgrew Belfast looks set to get a new -bedroom hotel amid freshly submitted plans for a development across from Titanic Belfast.

A statement, signed by  business organisations and trade bodies, says that “two and a half years on from the collapse of the Executive, and now approaching the likely conclusion of the Brexit process, the Northern Ireland business community is deeply concerned at the continued absence of a ing administration and is calling on political representatives to redouble their efforts to reach agreement to get the Assembly and Executive working again”. “There has seldom been a time when strong and effective leadership has been more necessary, both to deliver on the domestic agenda and also to speak up for Northern Ireland in the Brexit process. “We need a fully ing administration to agree and deliver a Programme for Government that will build infrastructure, reform our health service and education system, ensure we have a strong economy, and create opportunities for our young people. We also need effective representation in the Brexit discussions, even at this late stage in the process, to ensure that the economy is protected through whatever changes arise and that all necessary mitigations are sought and secured. “The business community will give encouragement and support to those politicians who stretch themselves to reach a compromise.
