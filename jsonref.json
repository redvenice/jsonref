Biden wants to send a message to dissidents and other opposition figures, but it is an area where it will be challenging to make progress.\u0027Navalny\u0027s death would be another indication of Russia has little or no intention of abiding by basic fundamental human rights. It would be a tragedy,\u0027 Biden said this week when asked what it would mean should he die in prison.\u0027We should not lose sight of the fact that Navalny is the most famous of several hundred political prisoners,\u0027 said Matthew Rojansky, director of the Wilson Center\u0027s Kennan Institute in Washington. He said Biden may want to raise the question of Russia\u0027s political prisoners more broadly. He said the U.S. should hold Putin to international standards and its own commitments as well as Russia\u0027s own constitution. \u0027We should try to hold them to those standards. The problem is the regime views these behaviors as essential to its survival. They’re not things we can convince them that they should reverse,\u0027 he noted.\u0027If Biden didn\u0027t already know it, he should be prepared for Putin trying to turn the tables on him by bringing up domestic U.S. politics. In recent days he has spoken about the prosecution of Capitol rioters while discoursing on Black Lives Matter protests, a go-to tactics when outsiders seek to call attention to stifling of internal dissent or lack of press freedoms. Biden also must decide how direct he wants to be when he warns Russia about ransomware attacks the U.S. believes come from its soil, even if not government-run operations. Biden said this week: \u0027I\u0027m going to make clear to President Putin that there are areas where we can cooperate if he chooses. And if he chooses not to cooperate and acts in a way that he has in the past relative to cybersecurity and some other activities, then we will respond. We will respond in kind.\u0027 The two men are set to meet in Geneva at the Villa de la Grange, a building with a long history that is located near the luxury hotel where Biden is staying. With its stocked Empire bookcases, Trompe l\u0027oeil ceiling details, and colorful rose garden, the building and grounds offers bountiful opportunities for photo-ops and small talk. "},{"url":null,"title":"Rogue TV reporter Houston releases secret recordings Fox Corp bosses","story":"Share this articleBREAKING: Fox 26 Reporter Releases tape of ‘Corruption,’ ‘Censorship.’ Fox Corp Boss told Hecker “cease \u0026amp desist” posting on Hydroxychloroquine \u0026amp ‘Poor African-Americans’ don’t care about  ..."},{"url":null,"title":"Jared Kushner book deal publication expected 2022","story":"Share this articleShare this article He said he wanted to try to establish a \u0027simpler\u0027 relationship with his father-in-law - one where they are only family members and not colleagues. The family outing came as they continue to settle into their new life in Miami after much of the Trump clan relocated to the Sunshine State when he left office.  The Kushners moved to Miami in January, signing a one-year lease on a condominium in one of Miami\u0027s most coveted oceanfront buildings, Arte Surfside, while they await the completion of a permanent home on the exclusive Indian Creek Island. Arte is one of the most expensive complexes in the Surfside neighborhood, with an average rental price of nearly $47,000 per month.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Ministers told not roll Covid jabs children scientists data","story":"Share this articleThe appeal to Parliament had raked in 54,895 as of Tuesday morning as it called on the government to avoid jabbing youngsters.Retired paediatrician Dr Ros Jones created the page and called for officials to delay giving doses to under 18s until after \u0027Phase 3 trials are complete\u0027.She wrote: \u0027A risk vs benefit calculation does not support giving COVID-19 vaccines, which use novel technologies and are still in Phase 3 trials, to healthy children.\u0027Any rollout should not start until trials are complete and all findings are published and peer-reviewed on long-term safety data.\u0027Healthy children are at low risk from COVID-19 yet face known and unknown risks from COVID-19 vaccines.\u0027Rare, but serious, adverse events and deaths are being reported to monitoring systems around the world.\u0027Official guidance is updated as the side-effects become more apparent.

which is at least 80 per cent more infectious than the Kent one and twice as likely to put unvaccinated people in hospital.But, in a glimmer of good news, Covid cases appear to be flat or falling in the first areas to be hit by the new Indian \u0027Delta\u0027 variant, official figures show.The infection rate in Blackburn with Darwen, which took over from Bolton as the country\u0027s hotspot at the end of May, is now falling after appearing to peak on June 4 when there had been an average 143 cases per day over the previous week.It remains the worst-affected place in the country but if the trend keeps up the change of fortunes could suggest that, as was seen in Bolton, simple surges in testing and vaccinations and tougher advice on travelling in or out of the area and social distancing could be enough to keep a lid on local outbreaks.Ministers urged another 3.6million people in Birmingham, Liverpool, Warrington and parts of Cheshire to try to avoid travelling and be more careful about virus control measures in a bid to slow outbreaks there.Boris Johnson yesterday announced a four-week delay to plans to end social distancing rules on June 21 as planned, saying not enough is known about the Indian variant and how difficult it will be to control.The other areas that were first to be hard hit by the strain when it emerged in April – Bedford and Burnley – also appear to have arrested the spread of Covid by scaling up local efforts to stamp it out and test and isolate everyone.Those four areas, Bedford, Blackburn, Bolton and Burnley, were the first to see cases surge, the first to get extra help from the Government to control the virus, and now appear to be the first to see infections levelling off.But infections are still rising fast in many areas that have been added to the official hotspots where advice has been upgraded, with cases going up in twice as many areas as they are flat or falling.Department of Health positive test figures show that there has been a plateau in the numbers of people testing positive for coronavirus in those hard-hit areas, offering proof that the Indian variant can be controlled.In Bolton the infection rate had risen to 453 cases per 100,000 people on May 21, with an average of 186 people testing positive each day, but this has since plummeted to 309 per 100,000 and an average 127 daily cases.There are hopes that the trend there, where the council offered free regular testing to all adults and stepped up its efforts on contact tracing and vaccinations, will translate to other areas that see outbreaks of the variant.It may be beginning to happen in Blackburn, which took over as the hotspot at the end of May with the rate of cases per 100,000 people hitting 667 by June 7, but since dropping to 599. Average daily cases appear to have peaked at 143 on June 4 and since fallen to 128.In Bedford a similar trend is playing out, with an infection rate high of 208 per 100,000 on May 23 now having fallen to 154 per 100,000, and average daily cases peaking at 52 on May 20 and now down to 38 per day in the past week.Burnley also appears to have seen a levelling off in cases, although the trend is less certain and only recent. The seven-day infection rate was 370 per 100,000 on June 8 and fell to 367 by two days later, with average daily cases having levelled off at around 47 per day since June 5.There are 34 areas now on the list of places to face tougher guidance, which offers a \u0027package of support\u0027 from the Government to include surge testing, enhanced contact tracing and financial support to Covid cases and their contacts who have been asked to self-isolate.Recent data from these 34 areas show that infections appear flat in 10 places, are falling in two (South Ribble as well as Blackburn) but are rising in 22 places.Most of them are recent additions to the enhanced support list and ministers will be hoping the extra measures help to turn the tide on infections in those places, too.Boris Johnson\u0027s delay to the original June 21 \u0027Freedom Day\u0027 by four weeks came amid fears a third wave of Covid could overwhelm the NHS.Top scientists hope the move will give the health service more time to vaccinate as many people as possible, offering the nation as much protection against the Indian variant as possible.Experts say because the mutant strain is so infectious, it will spill into unvaccinated groups and the small percentage of people for whom the jabs don\u0027t work.   As well as pledging to offer jabs to all over-18s by July 19, the Prime Minister\u0027s new vaccination target is also to fully vaccinate two-thirds of adults. The figure currently stands at around 56.9 per cent, or 30million. He also pledged to shorten the gap between two doses to just eight weeks for over-40s, bringing them in line with over-50s.The aim of dishing out jabs to all younger adults is entirely dependent on the supply of the Pfizer and Moderna jabs. AstraZeneca\u0027s vaccine is not recommended for under-40s because of its rare links to blood clots. Sir Simon said: \u0027It is now very important that we use the next four weeks to finish the job to the greatest extent possible for the Covid vaccination programme, which has been a historic signature achievement in terms of the effectiveness of delivering by the NHS — over 60 million doses now administered.\u0027By July 19 we aim to have offered perhaps two thirds of adults across the country double jabs.\u0027And we\u0027re making great strides also in extending the offer to all adults — today people aged 23 and 24 are able to vaccinate through the National Booking Service.\u0027I expect that by the end of this week, we\u0027ll be able to open up the National Booking Service to all adults age 18 and above.\u0027Of course, vaccine supply continues to be constrained, so we\u0027re pacing ourselves at precisely the rate of which we\u0027re getting that extra vaccine supply between now and July 19.\u0027Sir Simon added that just one per cent of hospital beds in England are currently being used by Covid patients.He said: \u0027At the moment about one per cent of hospital beds in England are occupied by patients with a Covid diagnosis and the age distribution has really flipped as a result of vaccination.\u0027Back in January, it was 6040 — 60 per cent of beds occupied by people over 65, 40 per cent under 65.\u0027Now it\u0027s flipped to 3070, so it\u0027s about 30 per cent occupied by people aged 65 and over 70 per cent by younger people whose prospects are much greater.\u0027Meanwhile the NHS has been given orders to \u0027gear up\u0027 for new Covid-19 treatments, which the NHS expects to come online in the next few months which will also help to prevent severe illness and death.These new treatments are expected to be given to people in the community, without the need for hospital treatment, within three days of infection.Sir Simon said: \u0027We expect that we will begin to see further therapies that will actually treat coronavirus and prevent severe illness and death.\u0027Today I\u0027m asking the health service to gear up for what are likely to be a new category of such treatments, so-called neutralising monoclonal antibodies, which are potentially going to become available to us within the next several months.\u0027But in order to be able to administer them, we\u0027re going to need community services that are able to deliver through regional networks this type of infusion in patients before they are hospitalised, typically within a three-day window from the date of infection.\u0027So the logistics and the organisation and applying the full excellence of the sort of networked NHS services locally through integrated care systems, we\u0027re going to need to harness all of that, to be able to benefit from the new monoclonal antibodies.\u0027We are setting out a set of asks as to how to bring that about in each integrated care system so that as and when the treatments become available to us, they can immediately begin to be deployed.\u0027Mr Johnson delayed the final stage of unlocking by a month after dire predictions by No10\u0027s top scientific advisers warned the Indian strain could kill up to 500 people in a day had Freedom Day went ahead as planned. Unveiling the bad news, the PM defied fury from Tory MPs and the hospitality industry to insist he could not press ahead until more people are double-jabbed. He said he was \u0027pretty confident\u0027 that restrictions will be able to be lifted by then, adding that the disease cannot be \u0027eliminated\u0027 and the country will have to learn to \u0027live with it\u0027 in the future. Chief medic Chris Whitty, flanking the PM as usual alongside Sir Patrick Vallance, told a Downing Street briefing hospitalisations had risen 61 per cent in the North West in just a week, a trend that was predicted to follow suit nationally if June 21 went ahead. \u0027The assessment of risk has fundamentally shifted,\u0027 he said.The move means that current rules will essentially remain in place until July 19 — with social distancing in force in bars and restaurants, and the edict to work from home where possible staying.The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation currently has no plans to revise its guidance on the OxfordAstraZeneca jab. But sources said members may reconsider advice if the balance of benefits and risks changes, potentially as a result of a rapid surge in infections.A total of 79.4 per cent of adults have now received at least one dose of Covid vaccine and 57.4 per cent – more than 30million people – have been given both doses.Yesterday NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said all over-18s in England would be able to book a jab by the end of the week.However, he admitted: \u0027Vaccine supply continues to be constrained so we\u0027re pacing ourselves.\u0027It is thought many people may have to wait a fortnight to receive their vaccine.Mr Johnson has set a target of offering all adults a first vaccine dose and two-thirds a second dose by July 19. Professor Karol Sikora, a former World Health Organisation director, said: \u0027The Government needs to work hard to get the speed of the vaccination programme back to its peak level.\u0027It should be putting pressure on Pfizer and Moderna to increase supplies so we can quickly vaccinate ourselves out of lockdown.\u0027Dr Simon Clarke, of Reading University, said: \u0027It is more likely lockdown will end on July 19 if the UK can increase the number of people it is vaccinating each day. \u0027The Government needs to do all it can to maximise uptake as quickly as possible. There are plenty of people who want them.\u0027Meanwhile, London Mayor Sadiq Khan has lobbied vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi for an extra 367,000 doses of Pfizer and Moderna jabs.   "},{"url":null,"title":"The Andrew Lloyd Webber Ministers plan test event Cinderella","story":"Share this articleAndrew Lloyd Webber’s show will go on after a big song and dance | News | The Times"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c7bc7c42db1506fca617dec6c5412fde684858f/206_263_3645_2188/master/3645.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=227a79502c2538bc608f03fde9c1e4e7","title":"lets go velo six of the best cycling routes in north west france","story":"1. Noirmoutier circuitsAccessed along a paved causeway, the tidal isle of Noirmoutier is famed for the mimosa trees found amid its superb sandy beaches, salt marshes and oak forests. Three designated riding loops navigate the isle’s varied terrain – with the most central circuit also yielding such quaint villages as windmill-speckled La Guérinière. The cycle routes can be completed in one day or, if you prefer, at a more leisurely pace over successive days.  Noirmoutier is a three-hour drive from Saint-Malo’s ferry port, accessible via Brittany Ferries – allowing travellers to easily get to north-western France in the comfort and safety of their own car. 2. The Jade CoastAround a third of La Vélodyssée, France’s longest cycle route at more than 745 miles, is given over to the Atlantic Loire Valley region. South of Nantes (get there by train from Saint-Malo’s ferry port, via Rennes) and the Loire estuary, few trails are prettier than those tracing the 27-mile Jade Coast. Here, between Saint-Brevin-les-Pins and Bouin, riders will find rocky seascapes, broad Blue Flag shores, secret coves, traditional harbours and even the occasional bourgeois villa to admire. Dismount on Pointe Saint-Gildas, a wild headland affording fine estuary views, and look out for pêcheries: spindly little huts perched on pontoons to enable fishing with poles. The many charming resort towns, including Pornic, work well as bases thanks to their lively, strollable streets, seafood bistros and patisseries – this corner of France is the home of brioche. Thinking of seafood, the local specialties include sardines, anchovies, oysters and mussels. From the town of Ducey-les-Chéris, you’ll follow lanes with little traffic through woods, arable pastures and sleepy villages – vintage rural France, in other words. After a few hours and possibly a picnic, the Unesco-listed Mont-Saint-Michel will appear, with that marvellous, abbey-topped citadel. Out on the tidal island, the restaurant La Ferme St Michel majors in fresh, local products – think roasted apple with camembert and cacouyard or terrine of salt-meadow lamb. Rejuvenated? Then either continue onwards for 42 miles along the Vélomaritime past swimmable coves to reach Brittany Ferries’ port of Saint-Malo (in Brittany), or turn back and spend two days pedalling beside bocage-hedgerow landscapes north to Cherbourg. 4. Longues to ArromanchesEast of Cherbourg’s ferry port, the Vélomaritime route descends the Cotentin peninsula’s gorgeous reaches and passes all five of Normandy’s D-day landing beaches – offering a chance to combine cycling with fascinating, vital history. The five-mile route follows greenways from Longues-sur-Mer, crossing the cliffs above Gold beach to Arromanches-les-Bains. As it’s a short ride, there’s plenty of time to stop and take in the views whenever you like. The German battery at Longues remains well preserved, and has a visitor centre, while the British-built mulberry harbour at Arromanches also survives and houses a museum. You’ll find restaurants, too: the Cotentin is known for salt-meadow lamb while, what with this being Normandy’s calvados department, apple and pear brandies are guaranteed to be in good supply. It’s easy to explore the other D-day beaches en route as you pedal on toward the ferry port of Caen. 5. The Nantes-Brest canalLa Vélodyssée – France’s portion of the EuroVelo 1 route – starts at Roscoff, a port served by ferries from Plymouth, and takes in part of the glorious Nantes-Brest canal. The two meet just south of Carhaix-Plouguer and the partnership lasts for around 162 miles. Perfect for fun-filled family day trips by bike, the canal’s towpath promises a steady, gentle diet of barges, woodland, lakes, and locks garlanded with flowers. Especially photogenic is the steep-sided Blavet Valley, thanks chiefly to lush vegetation and imposing lock-keepers’ buildings. Kids too young to ride could perch in child seats, or you might consider hiring tandem bikes. Cycling a canal section makes for a lovely inland interruption to holidays otherwise spent exploring the sandy seasides and ancient fishing hamlets and towns around Roscoff, Quimper or Vannes. 6. Dinard to QuestembertOne of Brittany’s long-distance cycle paths – Route 3 – winds south from Dinard (a boat-hop across the Rance river from Saint-Malo), initially along the Canal d’Ille et Rance. At more than 124 miles and mostly confined to quiet roads or greenways, it’s ideal for cycling enthusiasts or families with energetic teenagers. The best section comes after Malestroit, when you’ll cross the Landes de Lanvaux’s high, open heathland riding on smooth paths. Before that, close to Mauron, the trail fringes the Forest of Brocéliande, whose Arthurian-legend locations include the Valley of No Return, the Golden Tree and – supposedly – Merlin’s Tomb, all possible ersions. It’s easy to pitch up along the way at pretty campsites such as Brocéliande’s Camping Merlin l’Enchanteur, where two swimming pools (one for kids) await. Four days is the typical Route 3 duration, but many go slow and take a week. From Questembert, trains can have you back on Saint-Malo’s beaches in a little more than two hours. The lungfuls of fresh air will continue during the ferry home too, what with so much open space both inside and out on deck. Book your journey to north-western France at brittany-ferries "},{"url":null,"title":"mise en scenic seven spectacular walks in north west france","story":"The big one: GR34 in Brittany A whopper of a long-distance route, the GR34 in Brittany runs for more than 1,240 miles from the dramatic tidal island monastery of Mont-Saint-Michel all the way around the Brittany coast to Saint-Nazaire, where the Loire kisses the Atlantic. For a bite-size section, head to pretty Perros-Guirec, two hours’ drive from Saint-Malo, being sure to try traditional galettes at Crêperie du Ranolien, before hiking the Pink Granite coast, with its rosy boulders reminiscent of Seychelles. Alternatively head for the Crozon peninsula, a three-hour drive cross-country from the port, for lovely swimming creeks and imposing headlands jutting into water the colour of mouthwash. The island loop one: Belle-Île-en-Mer, BrittanyWho knew there was a tiny island paradise so close to home, where white sands meet turquoise waves, lighthouses decorate promontories and sweet seaside cottages are painted candy colours. A little like a French take on the Isles of Scilly, Belle-Île-en-Mer has long attracted creatives such as Claude Monet, who painted its imposing Port Coton needles, and one of the early stars of the screen, the bohemian actress Sarah Bernhardt, who moved into the military fort here in 1894, hosting glamorous parties, with Edward VII among her guests. The fort is now a little museum, in a beautiful spot on the Pointe des Poulains, one of the highlights of the 51-mile coastal path that circles Brittany’s largest island. The path threads together the sheltered coves of the east, steep cliffs in the south, dunes for children to tumble down, and Le Palais harbour. Le Palais, the island’s main town, is where you’ll arrive if you take the hour-long ferry ride from Quiberon on the mainland. Ride the bus to different sections of the path and be sure to have an evening cocktail at Le Grand Large hotel, overlooking the sea. The magical forest one: Brittany’s mythical forestHolidays to Brittany are very often all about the sea, but there are magical walking routes too in the interior’s marshes, forests and hills. Brittany’s once-vast forest of Paimpont, west of Rennes, is thought to be the one referred to in medieval folklore and myths as Brocéliande, an enchanted, fairy-filled forest associated with Arthurian legends. Today, themed trails and a museum at the Château de Comper bring the stories to life, adding an ethereal slant to family walks on the forest’s network of fern-lined trails. Your closest base could be Brittany’s vibrant capital, Rennes, an hour’s drive south from the ferry port at St Malo. The dramatic one: Normandy’s Alabaster coast on the GR21For anyone yearning to tackle one of Europe’s mammoth GR hiking trails there couldn’t be a handier starting point than that of Normandy’s iconic GR21, which begins in the city of Le Havre, arrival port for the Brittany Ferries crossing from Portsmouth. Whether you ditch your car immediately and strike out to walk the full 115-mile route north to the fishing village of Le Tréport, which usually takes seven to 10 days, or drive to stroll shorter sections, is a matter for you and your thigh muscles to decide. The geology of this stretch echoes that on the other side of the Channel, with dramatic high white chalk cliffs earning it the moniker the Alabaster coast. While the beaches of Normandy might still be associated with the noisy barrages of D-day, now only the wind tussling the leaves and the odd gull call will prick your ears, leaving mental space for contemplation on a peaceful route voted best hiking trail in France in 2019’s annual French Hiking Federation survey. The path doesn’t always follow the coast due to the fragility of the cliffs, but descends often to beaches and villages tucked into ravines where rivers meet the sea, such as Fécamp, with an abbey, and Dieppe, with wonderful seafood restaurants. Look out too for second world war sites and Delacroix’s painting subject, St Pierre-en-Port. Just a little past Le Tréport, the lovely belle epoque seaside resort of Mers-les-Bains, with quaint bathing huts on a lively seafront, is a fabulous place to finish up. The boozy one: Normandy’s cider routeWhether you stagger it, swagger it or dart along like a teetotal hare, the 25-mile cider route is a beauty, connecting more than 20 cider farms in the lovely Pays d’Auge region of lower Normandy. Densely wooded hills, villages of colourful timber-framed houses, chateaux and farmland comprise a gorgeous backdrop for immersion in the appley booze-making expertise of the area. You’ll learn to appreciate the slightly bitter flavour of local ciders – neither sandpaper dry or juicy-sweet – perfect for quenching the thirst of parched hikers. Calvados (apple brandy), sometimes mixed with apple juice to make pommeau, has to be tasted along with perries and cheeses. Where should you base yourself? Try any of the characterful hotels in ancient towns such as Cambremer. The cultural one: the Loire estuary The Loire river may be most famous for the beautiful chateaux that decorate its banks, but many other interesting features lend it character as it wends its way west to the Atlantic. At its finale, a wide estuary forms a fascinating natural and semi-industrial environment that’s fun to explore on foot. A 37-mile trail through the estuary from Nantes to the ocean, takes in fishing villages, nature reserves and a fantastic art trail, the Estuaire Nantes\u0026lt\u0026gtSaint-Nazaire, featuring 33 mind-bending sculptures, dotted along the water’s edge. Picking out one section for a day’s walk, you might opt for the lively 11-mile stretch from Paimbœuf, a village of brightly coloured houses, to the seaside resort of Saint-Brevin-les-Pins, on the southern side opposite Saint-Nazaire. It offers sandy beaches, fishing huts on stilts and the art trail’s “Serpent d’Ocean” by Huang Yong Ping, a huge skeleton of a sea serpent submerged in the breakers that’s thrilling for children. Alternatively there are dozens of other shorter walking trails of a few miles throughout the southern estuary area, which are easily doable for little legs. The hilly one: the Alpes MancellesFor not-too-tough hiking challenges in a mountainous region that resembles a mini version of the Alps, head to the pretty Alpes Mancelles in the Atlantic Loire. The mountains here top out at only 200-400m, bless them, so are relatively easy to conquer, but will still earn you the kudos of having summited some of the highest peaks in western France. Le Mont des Avaloirs, at 416m, is the big boy of the region, providing wonderful views of the Sarthe river from a Brutalist-style concrete lookout point at the top.

But, all part of the fun.“Ronaldo wiping £4 billion off Coke’s global shares might just be the greatest thing he has ever done. Maybe Messi could respond by rejecting Pepsi?”In the pre-match presser on Tuesday, Italy’s defensive stalwart Leonardo Bonucci said of his squadmates: “This is the greatest team spirit I have encountered. At no time have there been any issues in the squad. It is a very tight group and it is little wonder then that we are getting results.” He also said England were the team that have impressed him the most so far at Euro 2020. The 34-year-old said: “Besides the teams that still need to play – who will of course impress us because they are all top countries – England have really stood out to me. For the approach they showed, the way the were willing to work hard for one another and the fact they sought three points, England are the team that have impressed me most so far.” The Swiss playmaker Xherdan Shaqiri, who is up against his former Internazionale manager Roberto Mancini, who brought him to San Siro in January 2015 for a truncated six-month spell, said: “I am really looking forward to the game and I look forward to seeing Roberto. He is a great person and I am really happy that it is going well for him and he has made Italy a top team. “They are one of the favourites for this tournament. They will try to attack. It is not the Italy that used to defend all the time. It will be a challenge but we will try to create problems for them. It will be a difficult game but we are confident.” Italy could make one enforced change with right-back Alessandro Florenzi doubtful with a calf injury.Anyway, Manchester City start their title defence at Tottenham, who may or may not have a manager and a broader strategic purpose by then. More here: And talking of Elis, here’s his latest, on watching Wales away – at home.Later, it’s crunch time for Wales, who need to improve on a slightly flat and disjointed opening display against Switzerland when they face Turkey, who produced an even flatter performance in being eviscerated by Italy. Wales are braced for a feisty atmosphere at a game where Turkey supporters will be in a clear majority. Our man in Baku, Ben Fisher, previews it all here. But Wales’s hardy travelling fans are well used to being miles from home, outnumbered, odds stacked against them, and coming home with a few tales to tell. All of which gives me an excuse to re-up Elis James’s wonderful pre-tournament piece about the Wales away counterculture, and not just because a couple of longstanding mates get some airtime. Not just about Wales but about what football fandom in general can be with the right attitude: It was all something of a headline-stealer from His record-breaking feats with Portugal earlier in the evening. Cristiano Ronaldo embellished a not totally convincing Portugal performance against a tenacious Hungary with two late goals, having missed a sitter earlier in the game, to become the European Championship’s record goalscorer. It all sets up Portugal v Germany on Saturday deliciously. Ronaldo’s also been sticking it to The Man by seemingly single-handedly wiping off millions from the value of soft drink conglomerates.

The whole thing seems so strange, I can’t believe there wasn’t an element of cock-up somewhere along the line as those in charge of women’s cricket at the ECB would have wanted a new pitch. It is so OBVIOUS that a new pitch was necessary and what the players deserved. But whatever the excuse, there was definitely a communication breakdown between the ECB and Bristol - we wait to see who made the final decision. An email from a cross Ruth Purdue “I am very very angry at the ECB about this pitch. I can’t speak for the players who took a admirable tone when asked about it. It comes to the point now at how much the ECB care about equality. They can get the men to wear their little t-shirts but when it comes to action, they fail, again.How many times are they going to just talk and not act?Good luck to all the players on this pitch and I hope it is a fantastic match and lasts till the last day.” Swaminathan Natarajan writes in to say that in India the coverage is on Sony Ten. Thanks Swaminathan!An amazing stat from TMS: there have been 140 women’s Tests in history, England have played in 96 of them. Forty wickets have fallen in only six.Hi Ajwad, it is being shown on Sky in the UK, with live commentary on BBC radiointernet. I presume it is being shown in India but I’m afraid I don’ t know where. Perhaps an OBOer can help?“I’ll watch basically all and any sport, so whilst it’s a shame about the pitch, as a generalist, will it make all that much difference apart from, one assumes, take spin earlier from being roughed up? Comments gratefully received.“Mind you, that being said, it’s not at all respectful if the players were told “You’ll have a new wicket to play on”. “I have to say though, yet again, I’d love one of the flats at the Ashley Down Road end of the Brightside.” The beef with the pitch is that a used one could turn early, but more likely it will slow down and flatten out, thus being more likely to produce the dull cricket which women’s Tests have been criticised for in the past (while being played on used pitches.) Men’s Tests would never (very rarely?) be played on a used pitch.Elite cricket then but, whoops!, on a second-hand pitch - which is a niche product to try and flog in the push for equality. It was revealed yesterday that the pitch had already been played on for 39 overs in a T20 Blast game on Friday night. Where the cock-up originated, we don’t know, but there it is. Next time, do better. Or as Heather Knight, whose services to diplomacy should be snapped up when she retires, said, “We can moan about it later - we’ve just got to play what’s in front of us, we can’t use it as a negative or an excuse or frustration.” While the ICC have been pushing limited overs cricket for women, some of the players themselves have been pining for more red ball cricket, Katherine Brunt and Megan Schutt, for example. Test cricket for women has often been dismissed as slow and boring, and playing on a second hand pitch at Bristol, which may grow sluggish and flatten as the four days progress, isn’t going to help that perception or prove anything.   The ECB sounded contrite: “We know that England Women deserve a fresh wicket and we are sorry that we were unable to provide that in this instance, With the Test only being added to the calendar in mid-April, coupled with the lack of available first class grounds, we knew a fresh TV pitch was going to be a challenge.” But, hang the pitch for a minute, the game is going to be a novelty for everyone involved. India haven’t played Test cricket for seven years, with only eight of their squad having red ball experience. England have squeezed in more Tests, but only against Australia, and they haven’t won in that time. The last time these two sides played each other, India won by six wickets.

Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 170 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?Dose: Two doses, 12\u0026nbspweeks apart (there are plans to reduce this to 8 weeks).EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top nine cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3), people aged 16 to 69 who are at very high or high risk (cohort 4 and 7) and those aged 50 to 69 (cohorts 5 and 9).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be residents of long-term care facilities aged 16-64 (cohort 8), followed by people aged 64 years and younger, alongside people aged 64 and younger who are living or working in crowded settings.

However, he expects the final figure to be closer to 800.“The HSE approved 1,045 of the pharmacies that were interested in getting involved in the programme but then some of those pharmacies decided not to participate because they felt they didn’t have enough over-50s in their area.“They felt very strongly that they didn’t want to be responsible for vaccines being unused and going out of date in their fridge.”Mr O’Loughlin said pharmacists will play “a sweeper role” by administering some 140,000 vaccines to those over 50 who, for whatever reason, did not register with the HSE portal to be vaccinated at mass centres or by GPs.“Many pharmacists are telling us that there are lot of people who aren’t yet 50 but are in vulnerable groups, such as people working in meat plants and immigrants working in unskilled jobs, who tend to live in crowded groups.“A single-dose vaccine such as Janssen would also be more effective for other vulnerable groups as the homeless and Travellers and Roma, because it may be difficult to get them back for the second dose on schedule.”Cork chainAmong those involved in the rollout is the Pharmacy First Plus Group, which has a chain of pharmacies in Cork city and suburbs.“There has been a lot of interest and it’s all down to the convenience – the rollout is for over-50s but we have had a lot of interest from others via WhatsApp, text messages, emails – we’ve had lots of people contacting us,” said Keith O’Hourihane, superintendent pharmacist for the group. “Six weeks ago I was contacted by a woman who had got her hip done – she was due to get vaccinated down at the centre in Páirc Uí Chaoimh but with the hip, she wanted to know could she come to us because it would be easier.”James Griffin, support pharmacist at Murphy’s Pharmacy in Midleton, east Cork, is planning how they will administer the vaccines now that they have been approved by the HSE.“A lot will depend on the demand – we are getting a batch of 50 doses of Janssen, which is a one-dose vaccine, but we are thinking of running morning clinics and we are hoping to do as many as we can on certain days of the week,” he said. “Once the vial is open, you have to use it within a certain period of time. We’re hoping to get the actual doses from tomorrow but we got the packs with syringes for delivery today so we’re gearing up to go later this week.”Delayed involvementMr O’Loughlin said pharmacists had been waiting to play their part since December when the Cabinet approved their involvement in the vaccination programme but it’s only now that they are getting vaccines to administer.“Pharmacists should have been involved months ago but the HSE only operationalised the rollout in GPs’ surgeries and mass vaccination centres, not to pharmacies, so our involvement has been delayed.“The public has demonstrated a desire to get vaccinated in a pharmacy because it’s local and accessible and convenient but we have not been able to get involved because we were not given supplies of the vaccines until now.”Mr O’Loughlin said pharmacists would be paid the same rate as GPs for administering the vaccine – €25 per dose plus €10 per patient.“Last year pharmacies administered one in four of the flu vaccines, and there is no reason why we could not give that level or more of Covid-19 vaccines if we had the vaccines.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"vaccine registration for people aged 30 39 set to open within week","story":"People aged 40 and over can register online for the Covid-19 vaccine.

They said that the “profile will change” over the course of July with a focus on using the two mRNA vaccines in the future. AstraZeneca will continue to be used to complete second doses for those who already received a first dose of AstraZeneca.The HSE has said it hopes “to move to the next age cohorts as swiftly as the previous ones and they will be advised to register shortly”.People aged 40 and over can register online for the vaccine while pharmacists will begin administering jabs from this week.

They do not need to register online for the service but will need to book a vaccine appointment with a participating pharmacist, a list of which can be found on the HSE’s website.On Tuesday the Department of Health reported another 283 confirmed coronavirus infections. It said there were 60 people in hospital with the virus, of which 23 were in intensive care.A further 115 people in Northern Ireland tested positive, according to the North’s Department of Health. There were no additional deaths. Fifteen people were receiving hospital treatment for the virus in the North on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan has said most people who received the AstraZeneca vaccine will have got their second jab by the time international travel restrictions are eased next month.Responding to reports that hundreds of thousands of people waiting on their second dose will not be able to travel abroad, Mr Ryan said they would be getting texts in the coming weeks to attend appointments for their next inoculation. “This mainly applies to those over 60 who have got a first AstraZeneca jab,” he told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland. “A lot of them because they got it in in early May or late April should be getting texts within the coming weeks. In that timeline, by the time international travel starts to open up on July 19th, most of them should have had their second jab.”Deputy chief medical officer Ronan Glynn has urged people who are not yet vaccinated to remain vigilant.“One thing that we’re particularly concerned about is the Delta variant and what impact that may have over the coming weeks,” he told Beat 102-103 on Monday.“We’re very keen for people, particularly people who have not been vaccinated, to continue to follow the basic messages so that we don’t run into trouble over the coming weeks.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"children say using internet better than playing with friends study finds","story":"The research found using the internet was most commonly reported as the favourite activity of nine-year-olds. Photograph: iStockMore than half of nine-year-olds have said their parents allowed them to use the internet without checking on what they were doing or watching, according to new research from the Growing Up in Ireland study.Almost all of the more than 8,000 children interviewed for the major study had access to the internet, with tablets or iPads more popular than smartphones or games consoles.The research found using the internet was most commonly reported as the favourite activity of nine-year-olds, tied with playing football and ahead of playing with friends or reading.Some 27 per cent of children surveyed said their favourite activity was using the internet, while 23 per cent said they most enjoyed playing with friends.Growing Up in Ireland is a long-term study that has tracked several cohorts of children at various stages of childhood. The latest findings, published by the Economic \u0026amp Social Research Institute (ESRI) on Wednesday, were drawn from interviews with nine-year-olds in 2017 and 2018.More than four-fifths of the group reported playing games on the internet – the most popular online activity, followed by watching YouTube videos.Some 53 per cent of nine-year-olds said they were allowed to use the internet without supervision, the study found.OverweightNearly a quarter of the children involved in the study were overweight and 5 per cent of the cohort were obese.Girls were more likely than boys to be overweight, as were children from lower-income families. Nearly a third of children from the lowest-income families were overweight, compared with 15 per cent of children from families with the highest levels of income.As the interviews with children and their parents took place in 2017 and 2018, the results shed no light on the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on this cohort of young people.The researchers said the findings pointed to a significant improvement in most families’ financial situations, compared with the years following the financial crash.Some 13 per cent of parents reported being under financial strain and having difficulties making ends meet when interviewed. The study said this was a “substantial improvement” compared with 2013, where more than a quarter of the same parents reported being under financial strain.However, the study noted financial stress was still high among single-parent families. Nearly a third of lone parents reported financial difficulties, compared with 10 per cent of two-parent families.Children in two-parent families, households with higher incomes, or where parents were better educated, were likely to be healthier than nine-year-olds in lower-income homes.Reading scoresThe study found most children liked both school and their teacher, while negative attitudes were rare. Only 5 per cent of children said they never liked school, and 3 per cent said they never liked their teacher.Some 28 per cent of nine-year-olds said they never liked learning Irish, while 11 per cent said the same for maths. Reading was the most popular learning activity.The study pointed to a “significant” gap in reading test scores based on children’s socio-economic backgrounds. Children from the highest-income households had on average 10 per cent higher scores than children from disadvantaged backgrounds.The research noted this “socio-economic gap” in reading test scores had widened since the cohort of children had started primary school.The Growing Up in Ireland study is funded by the Department of Children, with a contribution from Atlantic Philanthropies.

File photograph: Dave ThompsonPA WireThe Ombudsman for Children has raised fears that some children who were at risk of abuse or neglect went under the radar during 2020 due to school closures.In the Ombudsman’s annual report, published on Wednesday, the Ombudsman Niall Muldoon highlighted the wide-reaching impacts of school closures on children and their mental health.Dr Muldoon said 2020 was a “devastating year for children”. He said home was “not always a safe place” for children, and he fears that children who were at risk of abuse or neglect and other issues that were not visible due to school closures will “come to the fore this year”.There were 316 fewer reports to the Ombudsman last year than in 2019 when there were 1,503, as many services were closed. Six per cent of complaints to the OCO last year came directly from children, up from three per cent in 2019. This rise can largely be attributed to children contacting in relation to education issues and the OCO has taken it as an indication of the level of upset among students. Every child who reached out to the office mentioned the impact of the pandemic on their mental health. Almost half (46 per cent) of complaints were in relation to education, a similar proportion to previous years, but with new issues arising such as remote learning difficulties, lack of clarity about exams, and the impact on children with special education needs. Dr Muldoon said his office heard “heartbreaking stories” about children with additional needs regressing. The pandemic has shown the need for “proper investment to bridge the inequality gap and ensure all children are given the support they need to thrive”, Dr Muldoon went on. He described a “once-in-a-generation opportunity” to reflect on the learnings of the pandemic and recognise how much can be done when energies are focused.“We must build upon the momentum and transformative change that was the hallmark of the pandemic and use this energy to ensure no child is left behind.”Dr Muldoon said there can be no return to “the old normal, where babies learn to crawl in emergency accommodation, teenagers in severe physical pain wait years for scoliosis operations or those in mental turmoil wait years for psychological intervention and where Traveller children are bullied for where they live.”The Ombudsman also noted that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs was under threat in May of being subsumed into other departments which would have led to an “abdication of responsibility and accountability when it came to upholding children’s rights at a pivotal time”.

Bloomsday marks the single day in which Joyce’s Ulysses is set: June 16th, 1904.For the second year, the events will be held virtually, and Mr Higgins took an opportunity to note the “fundamental role of the arts in our lives”. “As we mark and honour the pioneering work of literature that was Ulysses, let us do so by resolving to seize a golden opportunity to commit to supporting our artistic community,” he said.The “great and groundbreaking” novel Ulysses changed the path of 20th century literature, said Mr Higgins. However, the offering of artists, he said, has “not always been given the recognition for its vital contribution to our lives”.Mr Higgins commended the artistic community for fighting back against “courageously” against adversity and for finding inventive ways to ensure cultural engagement remained. “In doing so they have demonstrated the generous breadth of the cultural space and the rich capacity of the arts to unite us in the most challenging of circumstances,” he said. The President noted that Covid-19 restrictions threw a harsh spotlight on the “precarious and uncertain circumstances” many artists find themselves in, where they are “devoid of the dignity, financial security or freedom from fear that is the right of all citizens”.Emerging from the pandemic, artists must be assured of the public’s respect. Mr Higgins said it is his hope that the arts will be accommodated and valued in a post-pandemic world. Meanwhile, a 36-foot mural of James Joyce has been unveiled in downtown Buffalo, New York. The University of Buffalo Libraries is home to the world’s largest James Joyce collection. Consul General of Ireland in New York, Ciarán Madden, said the Joyce collection at the university is “distinct and special”. “The links between Ireland and Buffalo, and Western New York more generally, are deep and longstanding we will always celebrate them,” he added.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"unionists criticise leo varadkar over united ireland remarks","story":"UUP leader Doug Beattie in the Great Hall of Parliament Buildings at Stormont in Belfast on Monday. Photograph: Liam McBurneyPA WireTánaiste Leo Varadkar has been criticised for making a strongly pro-united Ireland speech while a political crisis is unfolding in the North threatening the collapse of the power-sharing Stormont Executive.While the views of unionists must be “acknowledged, understood and respected”, Mr Varadkar insisted “no one group can have a veto on Ireland’s future.”Former Stormont first minister Arlene Foster suggested Mr Varadkar’s remarks contravene the principle of consent enshrined in the Good FridayBelfast Agreement.Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie suggested the remarks were unhelpful at a time when Stormont is facing collapse in a row between the Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn Féin over Irish language legislation and loyalist tensions are simmering over post-Brexit arrangements.“Good man, Leo, for bringing up Irish unity again when we are in a crisis,” he said.“Let’s throw that into the mix, because that is really going to be helpful for people here in Northern Ireland.”Speaking to RTÉ’s Morning Ireland, Mr Beattie suggested the Fine Gael leader was making his Irish unity remarks to gain voters.“Of course, he has a right to say that. I think he is saying that more because there is a great opportunity for him to ensure he is the next taoiseach,” he said.In his online address, Mr Varadkar said: “We should be proud to say that unification is something we aspire to. It should be part of our mission as a party to work towards it. We can do so in many ways.”Mr Varadkar rejected what he called the “crude vision espoused by Sinn Féin”, which he described as “a cold form of republicanism, socialist, narrow nationalism, protectionist, anti-British, euro-critical, ourselves alone, 50 per cent plus one and nobody else is needed”.Instead, he said, “unification must not be the annexation of Northern Ireland. It means something more, a new state designed together, a new constitution and one that reflects the ersity of a bi-national or multi-national state in which almost a million people are British. Like the New South Africa, a rainbow nation, not just orange and green.”"},{"url":null,"title":"britain can expect few favours from joe biden","story":"US president Joe Biden speaking with British prime minister Boris Johnson at a Nato summit in Brussels on Monday. Photograph:  Olivier MatthysPOOLEPAThe cold war film Dr Strangelove owes its shelf-life to its portrait of US-UK, not US-Soviet, relations. The straight man of the piece is a British exchange officer who must talk American hot-heads out of a nuclear first-strike. There was more to this account of the US as a feral giant than the snark of an Anglophile director. Real life bore it out when Britain abstained from the Vietnam war. It continued to chime as London tried to nag Washington into such internationalist ventures as the Kyoto protocol and the Iran nuclear pact.How weird to be living through a reversal of these roles. For perhaps the first time since the Suez crisis, the US is the more committed of the two nations to the norms and institutions of the global commons. As Britain tampers with the Northern Ireland protocol, an Irish-American president looks on with scarcely concealed dismay. While Joe Biden aims to increase US foreign aid, Britain, according to one of its own government’s MPs, is the only G7 state to make a cut.And this comes after an odd few years for Britain’s moral standing in Washington. There was no shame in the initial cultivation of President Donald Trump. Emmanuel Macron made no less a fuss of him during his first summer in charge of France. What distinguished (if that is the word) Britain was the decision to keep it up after it became plain that Trump was bent on a spoiling role in the world. The governing Democrats are too busy to be vindictive about such bygones. But the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who kept a scrupulous distance from the last White House, will be the first European leader to visit the new one.It is hard to convey the desire in an Asia-facing US for zero distractions in the rest of the world. The waiving of sanctions over the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, the exit from Afghanistan, the presidential talks with Vladimir Putin, all suggest a nation set on minimising non-Chinese sources of stress.European cohesianTo that end, Biden views the EU (a “strong and vibrant entity”) as a guarantor of European cohesion, like all pre-Trump presidents. In Washington, there is no bitterness or even much discussion any more of Britain’s decision to leave it. But nor is there the slightest qualm about engaging with the continent through Berlin or Paris, if London renders itself peripheral or eccentric.The logic of Brexit might further distance the two countries. To make a go of it, the UK will have to show an opportunism that jars with Washington’s new view of the world. One case in point is regulatory and tax competition. The ink was still damp on the US-led accord for a minimum corporate tax rate when Britain suggested exemptions for financial services.On a grander canvas, a post-EU UK must also entertain Chinese trade and investment, with all the qualms that implies in Washington. It is true enough that several G7 members favoured a softer communiqué on China than Biden secured over the weekend. But only one has just lost the safety in numbers of its regional trade bloc.For all the pomp of the new “Atlantic Charter”, Britain and America will keep returning to this crux. The point of Brexit is the flexibility to scour the world for commercial and diplomatic openings. But the new US vision is one of pan-western solidarity: against economic undercutting, against the raw weight of China.It is a vision that animates Biden ever more. With his domestic plans stalled, his best chance of a consequential presidency lies abroad. In essence, he is going through a sped-up version of the outward turn that US leaders perform after a midterm loss of Congress.Israel contacts For a sense of the change, consider that it took him only a reported two hours to call Israel’s new prime minister, Naftali Bennett. His predecessor, Binyamin Netanyahu, waited almost a month for the same contact. Whether this reflects anti-Netanyahu pique or a less pandemic-occupied Biden, it amounts to the same thing: a president who regards shoring up the West as an ever larger priority.All UK governments get things wrong about the US. My favourite is their inflated sense of how many Americans have an ancestral link to Britain (even the white ones are more likely to be Germans than “cousins”). But this one stands at a particularly odd angle to the White House.You have to be in at least the September of your life to remember when it was the US chiding the UK to honour global norms. If those days are back, the junior nation should not assume it will be costless. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2021Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons june 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2020 by clicking here or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Politics latest news: Minister backs mandatory vaccinations for care staff, saying \u0026#39I\u0026#39d want it to protect my parents\u0026#39Revealed: The schools that get the most pupils into each Oxbridge collegeBiden-Putin summit: US and Russia leaders meet for crunch talks in GenevaCoronavirus latest news: Children should not be vaccinated just to protect others, says Sage memberWatch: Huge spider web blankets bushland in AustraliaScotland lockdown roadmap: What are the current rules and will restrictions ease on June 28th?When will over-18s be offered their Covid vaccine?

But it is tight.It was the only rabbit the Prime Minister was able to brandish from a very tattered hat. Amid the bad news – the country will remain stuck in restrictions for another four weeks – the rollout of vaccinations would be accelerated, Mr Johnson said. Jabs are the biggest weapon in the virus war and, with this in mind, all over-40s will be offered second vaccines sooner, with the target for first doses brought forward. In fact, the changes to the rollout have merely prevented it from shuddering to a near-halt.While Britain is on track to give second doses to all over-50s by next week – and has now given both jabs to 30 million adults – without changes to the schedule it would have fallen into a lull for two weeks before over-40s became eligible, according to analysis by The .Meanwhile, a closer look at the Prime Minister\u0027s headline pledge reveals the scale of its ambition. According to the government data, speeding up second doses will only require vaccinations to run at half the current pace. While two million people got second jabs in the last week, just six million in their 40s and 50s are due second jabs in the next five weeks in order for the Government to hit its target. In truth, senior health sources said, the speeding up of second doses was not a major challenge because most were AstraZeneca, of which supplies are plentiful. But the programme of first doses is moving far more slowly in younger groups. Thanks to decisions by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) to largely restrict AstraZeneca to older people, the rollout is now almost entirely dependent on Pfizer and is only managing to give around 1.2 million doses a week compared with three million a week in March. On Tuesday, Sir Simon Stevens, the NHS chief, told a conference of the NHS Confederation that the rollout can go no faster than supplies allow. The programme has opened to those aged 23 and over and is expected to open bookings to all over-18s later this week, but some have been forced to wait several weeks to secure a slot.Last week, NHS England announced that a drive to the finishing line over the coming four weeks would see £20 million in extra funding handed to GPs and local vaccination centres to increase staffing.But staff at mass vaccination centres have instead been warned to expect their shifts to be cancelled due to shortages of the Pfizer vaccine. In a letter seen by The , NHS bosses at Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust told staff and volunteers at the Derby Arena centre that they may not be required to come into work.As Derbyshire will not be receiving large quantities of the Pfizer vaccine, which we need for the younger cohorts, it means activity at the vaccination centre will be reduced for a few weeks, the letter said.This inevitably means some shifts will be cancelled, and I\u0027m very sorry for the inconvenience this may cause. I\u0027m hoping this at least gives you a chance to take a well earned break and recharge your batteries ready for when we have a better supply. We are being advised there will be more vaccine in July to carry on with our younger adults.MPs are understood to have challenged the health minister Edward Argar over Pfizer supply shortages during an all-party Zoom call on Tuesday morning.In Birmingham, GPs were said to have no Pfizer in the fridge, with only enough supplies to vaccinate 10 per cent of the city\u0027s 18 to 29-year-olds against the spreading Indian or delta variant.Ian Ward, the leader of Birmingham City Council, said the Government may have to abandon plans to fully ease restrictions on July 19 unless the Pfizer shortage is addressed swiftly.In four weeks\u0027 time we will be in the same position unless we have vaccinated enough of those people below the age of 30, given the pressures on hospitals, Mr Ward told the .In Birmingham, we\u0027ve got 37 per cent of people unvaccinated in some areas because of our younger population. Unless the Government can deliver the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines in the right numbers, it\u0027s hard to see how we could safely unlock on July 19 – and that goes for the whole country.We have told Matt Hancock that we need whatever increased supply they can get their hands on. We could be doing 100,000 jabs a week if we had enough vaccine. The Government say they plan to \u0027lean in\u0027 to the problem, but I have no idea what that actually means.Liam Byrne, the Hodge Hill MP, said GPs in his constituency had warned that there is no Pfizer left in their fridges. There is no certainty about when it is going to arrive, and they do not know how much they will get when it does come. We cannot unlock until we unblock this pipeline, he said.Health leaders in Salford have been told to expect Pfizer supplies to drop next week, despite the area experiencing among the highest Covid case rates in the country, with 311.4 infections per 100,000 people.They\u0027ve told us to expect 3,500 doses of Pfizer this week, and then only 2,200 doses next week, said Barbara Keeley, the Worsley and Eccles South MP.When the virus was peaking in Bolton, they were vaccinating 4,000 people every day. But we simply aren\u0027t getting the supplies. The whole point of the month delay was meant to be to get more jabs in arms – and that won\u0027t happen at this rate.The challenge has been further complicated by family doctors increasingly giving up their vaccination responsibilities in order to restore normal service to patients.They feel they need to go back to concentrating on business as usual and then come back in the autumn when there will be a need to give booster shots, said Prof Martin Marshall, chairman of the Royal College of GPs.A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: There are no shortages of PfizerBioNTech vaccines and deliveries are coming in on time and as ordered.Our vaccination programme continues to make phenomenal progress, with more than 71 million vaccines administered so far –including 30 million second doses – and we are on track to offer a jab to all adults by July 19. We have been clear that everyone who is due a second dose should receive it on schedule.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"biden putin summit us russia leaders meeting talks geneva","story":"US president arrives in Geneva ahead of crunch summit with Putin Biden meets Putin: Six key issues to watch out for at summitPutin press conference begins at 5pmIn what is likely to be one of the central issues in today’s talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Joe Biden, the Kremlin raised alarm on Wednesday morning about a potential Nato membership for Ukraine.Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, in comments run by Russia’s Channel One, said Moscow was concerned by Mr Biden’s statement that he would hypothetically support a membership for Nato for Ukraine, describing it as a “new element.”Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula and threw its weight behind separatist rebels in 2014, souring once friendly relations.US President Biden arrives in Geneva, Switzerland ahead of meeting Russia\u0026#39s Vladimir PutinUkrainians leaders have been portraying a Nato membership as the only way to deal with Russian aggression.“Moscow paid full attention to the (remarks),” Mr Peskov said, adding that Mr Biden’s comments on the US commitment for Ukraine’s Nato membership were a first.He also said that Putin would make this position understood at the summit.“Putin is also clear about articulating Russia’s ‘red lines’ including in tough discussions like the one we’re going to have today,” he said.Ukraine’s Nato aspirations have been hampered by the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine that would prevent the country from joining the alliance.Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, said earlier this week that he was worried that the Putin-Biden summit would leave his country’s separatist conflict in limbo and pressed on Nato to give his country a clear timeline about a potential membership.He said he would like to get “specifics” from President Biden: “Yes or no.”“We must get clear dates and the likelihood of this for Ukraine.”Mr Zelenskiy created a Twitter storm earlier this week, suggesting that “Nato leaders confirmed that Ukraine will become a member” of the military alliance.President Biden later confirmed that Ukraine did not yet meet Nato membership criteria.Kyiv was dealt a heavy blow earlier this month when the US decided not to block Russia’s Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, something that Mr Zelenskiy described as a “geopolitical victory” for Russia.Coronavirus latest news: Children should not be vaccinated just to protect others, says Sage memberPolitics latest news: Minister backs mandatory vaccinations for care staff, saying \u0026#39I\u0026#39d want it to protect my parents\u0026#39Revealed: The schools that get the most pupils into each Oxbridge collegeWatch: Huge spider web blankets bushland in AustraliaScotland lockdown roadmap: What are the current rules and will restrictions ease on June 28th?When will over-18s be offered their Covid vaccine?

We hope this may help bring commercial success in the years that follow. Who knows, this could be the birth of ferries that fly across the Channel.”Brittany Ferries confirmed to The  that the first models of Seaglider would not be able to carry cars and would only be for foot passengers.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"joe biden meets vladimir putin six key issues watch summit","story":"On one thing Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin do agree - relations between the United States and Russia have reached a particularly low point.Mr Biden has vowed to deliver a stern message to Mr Putin at their summit in Geneva on cyber attacks, election interference and human rights.By contrast, the Kremlin sees the very fact of the summit as a triumph that recognises Mr Putin\u0027s standing on the world stage.Mr Biden has been preparing intensively for the summit.At the G7, he reportedly spent the mornings reading up for the meeting with Mr Putin and apparently asked other leaders there for their input.Asked if her husband was ready, the First Lady Jill Biden said: He\u0027s overprepared!A senior White House official said: He will go into Geneva with the full support and solidarity of all of our Nato allies.The official said there would be a meeting including a small group of aides, and another larger one.Mr Biden has decided not to do a joint press conference after the meeting, in order to deny Mr Putin a platform.The US president said: This is not a contest about who can do better in front of a press conference or try to embarrass each other.Here are six things to watch out for as the two leaders meet.No major breakthroughs are expected and instead the US wants to create a manageable relationship with clearly defined boundaries that should not be crossed.The areas where we don\u0027t agree, make it clear what the red lines are, said Mr Biden. I\u0027m not looking for conflict with Russia, but that we will respond if Russia continues its harmful activities.For his part Mr Putin has also been talking about red lines.That includes Ukraine being admitted to Nato. On the eve of the summit Mr Putin said: At least 50 percent of Ukrainian residents don\u0027t want entry into Nato and these are smart people.They understand, they don\u0027t want to wind up on the firing line, they don\u0027t want to be bargaining chips or cannon fodder.Fyodor Lukyanov, editor of Russian in Global Affairs, said: “Russia and the US need a manageable confrontation - an awareness of genuine disagreement, their priorities, and at least a basic idea about red lines.”Both sides have been talking about nuclear weapons as an area where they can cooperate and maintain strategic stability.Donald Trump withdrew from the Cold-War-era Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 2019 and Russia followed suit.Just weeks into his presidency Mr Biden agreed to extend the New START treaty, the last remaining nuclear arms agreement between the two countries.Sergei Ryabkov, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, said arms control was something that the two countries ought to deal with immediately: “We can’t keep it on the back burner any longer.Relations between Russia and the US are now as hostile as they were during the Cold War, which in a way makes it easier for both parties to produce something tangible at the summit that can be touted as an achievement.The time for all sorts of ‘resets’ is in the past,” said Mr Ryabkov. We should be focusing on small, specific steps which will hopefully contribute to building more mutual trust and possibly changes for the better.”Mr Biden will raise the poisoning and jailing of Alexei Navalny, the Russian opposition leader.“Navalny’s death would be another indication that Russia has little or no intention of abiding by basic fundamental human rights,” the US president said on the eve of the summit. “It would be a tragedy.”Then there is the issue of American hostages in Russia.Paul Whelan, an American sentenced to 16 years in a Russian jail for espionage, which he denies, has appealed to Mr Biden to take decisive action against hostage diplomacy.Similarly, the parents of Trevor Reed, another American held in Russia, said: He\u0027s being held as a pawn to try and leverage concessions. It\u0027s time to let him come home to Texas.Mr Reed was jailed for nine years for endangering Russian police officers in an altercation, which he denies. The US ambassador said his trial was a theatre of the absurd.The suggestion has been made that the Kremlin wants to swap them for Russian citizens in US jails.Mr Biden wants to nail Mr Putin down on debilitating cyber attacks that have targeted US government agencies and private companies.The most damaging recent attacks have included ones on the Colonial Pipeline, which sent petrol prices soaring, and the JBS meat production firm. Both companies had to pay millions of dollars in ransoms.Mr Putin has always denied any involvement but US intelligence agencies are clear that those responsible are in Russia.Tony Blinken, the US secretary of state, said: No responsible country should be in the business of harbouring in any way criminal organisations engaged in cyberattacks, including ransomware.Mr Putin raised the suggestion that the two countries could exchange cyber criminals.Mr Biden said he was open to it and the offer was potentially a good sign of progress.However, the White House later rowed back on the idea, denying that Mr Biden had been accepting the idea of a cyber prisoner swap.Russia wants to shut down the last humanitarian crossing into Syria from Turkey next month but Mr Biden will try to convince Mr Putin to keep it open.The United Nations Security Council will vote on July 10 on whether to extend the authorisation for the Bab Al-Hawa crossing into rebel-held Idlib, where four million Syrians now live.Russia holds a veto on the vote and has previously closed all other international aid crossings, insisting that Damascus should oversee the distribution of foreign aid.After 10 years of war, Moscow is eager for its client Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad to cement his victory.But Mr Biden will argue that closing the crossing point will result in greater civilian suffering. With the ability to impose sanctions and as the largest single donor to UN humanitarian aid operating out of Damascus, the United States in theory should be able to impose its will. “The US has immense leverage but I think they are unlikely to use it,” said Elizabeth Tsurkov, a fellow with the Newlines Institute for Strategy and Policy. “The US has tried to placate Russia instead by using carrots rather than sticks” by not imposing further sanctions, she said.Even if they do manage to agree on some things, this will be a frosty affair.Mr Biden has known Mr Putin for a long time and has never trusted him.The US president told the Russian leader in a meeting a decade ago that he had no soul and more recently called him a killer with no soul on television.In response, Mr Putin said: It takes one to know one.We always see our own traits in other people and think they are like how we really are, he added.State television in Russia went on to report that Mr Biden was elderly and confused.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"playing special relationship gift eu left","story":"Boris Johnson’s dislike of the term the Special Relationship for the links Britain has with the United States, because he thinks it makes the UK look “needy”, is bizarre. It plays into the hands of the Left, which has been sneering at and denying the very concept of a Special Relationship for years, and contradicts the actual experience of Anglo-American relations since even before Boris’s hero Winston Churchill coined the phrase in his Iron Curtain speech at Fulton, Missouri, three-quarters of a century ago in March 1946.Equally bizarrely, Boris is contradicting the Queen, who said, during the state banquet during the state visit of President George W Bush in 2003, “Despite occasional criticism of the term, I believe it admirably describes our friendship. Like all special friends, we can talk frankly and can disagree from time to time – even sometimes fall out over a particular issue. But the depth and breadth of our partnership means that disputes can be quickly overcome and forgiven.”It is always dangerous to prophesy anything in international relations, but I predict that by the end of Boris’s premiership, which I hope will be a record-breakingly long one, something will have happened that will rekindle his clearly waning belief in the Special Relationship. Its obituary has been written so many times over the past three quarters of a century, yet events constantly revivify and underline what Her Majesty called “the depth and breadth of our partnership”.At present, the impertinent and uncalled-for demarche that the American embassy issued to the British Government over the Northern Ireland Protocol – on the eve of the G7 summit, of all inappropriate times – shows precisely how special friends can “fall out over a particular issue”. For a country that lost up to 700,000 of its own citizens in a civil war over the issue of whether it should stay unified now to encourage Ulster to be alienated in trade from the rest of the UK is obtuse, but as special friends “we can talk frankly and can disagree from time to time”.There will come a time in the Biden presidency when he will notice the same truth that almost every president recognises at some stage: that Britain can be trusted in a great endeavour in the way that France, Germany and other allies cannot. And when Britain is not to be found beside America – as in Vietnam – it is usually because the endeavour is not as great as it seemed at the time. Even Barack Obama, who started his presidency as no lover of Britain, by 2011 was giving a toast “To Her Majesty the Queen, to the vitality of the special relationship between our peoples”.Similarly, Boris will undoubtedly discover – especially in a post-Brexit world where China and Russia are getting ever more brazen and threatening – that there is nothing needy about relying on the Anglosphere countries that most closely resemble Britain in terms of law, language, and shared history, including the United States.Unlike the European countries of Nato, virtually none of which meet the 2 per cent of GDP spending on defence to which they are committed, the United States spends over 5 per cent, and is the rampart which protects us from the rising tide of totalitarianism in the world today. There is a difference between needing something and being needy, and Britain is on the correct side of that ide, but we do need the United States, and they need us.With Germany over the Russian Nordstream 2 gas pipeline, which the United States has given up sanctioning, or President Macron saying that the EU should be “equidistant” between the US and China, Biden will recognise, as almost all his predecessors have barring Lyndon Johnson, that Britain is a far better ally than any of the available alternatives. The volume of our mutual trade, the interaction of our nuclear cooperation and intelligence agencies, the sheer “depth and breadth of our partnership” enormously outweighs any Left-inspired fantasy of our appearing “needy”.At a time when Liz Truss is making superb post-Brexit trade deals such as the recent one with Australia, underlining the continued strength of the Anglosphere and the huge benefits in freer and easier trade between the English-speaking countries, it is strange that Boris should be playing down the Special Relationship. Great days are still ahead for it, but also possibly testing days while Vladimir Putin is on the loose and President Xi is plotting at least regional domination.As a biographer of Churchill himself, Boris will be well aware of Churchill’s words in the Iron Curtain speech 75 years ago. “Neither the sure prevention of war, nor the continuous rise of world organisation will be gained without what I have called the fraternal association of the English-speaking peoples. This means a special relationship between the British Commonwealth and Empire and the United States.” The Empire has gone, but the Special Relationship continues, not just for the good of the British and American peoples but for that of mankind too.

Use our interactive graphic here to explore the results. Search by college, then click on the result for full details. We asked each Oxbridge college to tell us the top 10 schools to which it has made the highest number of offers  between 2018 and 2020.In most cases, the same number of offers were made to multiple schools, meaning the list we obtained from each college was often longer than just 10. Using our geographical search tool, you can enter your postcode and see which are the best schools in your areas for getting pupils into Oxbridge. Then you can click on each school to view the colleges where they have sent the highest number of pupils over the past three years. The data reveal the success of a handful of grammar schools and highly selective state sixth-form colleges. Six colleges - three at Oxford and three at Cambridge - gave the highest number of places to pupils at Hills Road Sixth Form College in Cambridge. Loreto College, a state-funded Catholic sixth form in Manchester, got 11 offers from Mansfield College, Oxford, and five from Cambridge\u0027s Magdalene College over three years.But there are still a handful of private schools that dominate offers at particular colleges. Half of Oxford’s college handed out the most offers to pupils from just two elite public schools: the £44,000-a-year Eton College and Westminster School, where fees are £31,500-a-year for day pupils. Of Oxford’s 32 colleges, nine made the highest number of offers to students from Eton and a further seven gave the most offers to those from Westminster. Finally, use this graphic to explore which schools - both in the UK and overseas - have got the most Oxbridge offers over the past three years. You can click on each school to get a breakdown of the colleges they have sent the most pupils to. Tomorrow on  we will publish a series of articles detailing the top 25 best private, state, grammar and international schools for getting your children into Oxbridge.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"22 days delay india variant","story":"News days of delay on India iant that may have sparked setback in UK Covid battleEXCLUSIVE The Mirror now understands the data used for the decision to leave India off the red list was almost a month old by the time the changes took effectmirrorShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical CorrespondentDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video boris-johnson-announces-four-week-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:TZnmLGg,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

Even after a mutation from India was placed under investigation by scientists, it still took the Government  days to put the country on the red list. Meanwhile, Bangladesh and Pakistan - both of which saw much lower infection rates in people arriving in the UK - were both added to the red list, while India remained on amber for almost a month. Itaposs led to claims that the Prime Minister wanted to delay the change so he could complete his planned trade visit to India first - an allegation both No and Health Secretary Matt Hancock deny. But the Mirror now understands the data on which the decision to leave India off the red list was partly based was almost a month old by the time the changes took place. And later decisions were based on much fresher data. Hereaposs how it happened, what the numbers said at the time - and the factors that might have influenced the Governmentaposs decision making. Matt Hancock has repeatedly said that at the time the decision was taken to leave India off the list, infection rates in people arriving in the UK from Bangladesh were three times higher. One of the measures the Government uses to decide on travel restrictions was at the time the number of people who test positive after arriving in the UK from each destination. Mr Hancock repeated in the Commons last night that test positivity of travellers ing from Pakistan was .%, three times the .% positivity of ing travellers from India. The Mirror has been trying to track down the source and timeframe for this data for about a month - because it is at odds with published data from a similar time period. Figures collected between March  and April  show the positivity rate of arrivals from Bangladesh was .% and from Pakistan was .% - neither of which is three times the figure from India, which was .%. Today - we believe for the first time - the Department of Health and Social Care has confirmed the data cited by Mr Hancock was collected between March -. That means that by the time the decision was made to leave India off the list on April , the data was already  days old. And by the time Bangladesh and Pakistan were added to the list, it was  days old. Is that normal  A good question, and one weaposve asked DHSC, but they have yet to answer. What we do know is that later in April, the data used to finally place India on the red list was fresher. The decision was taken on April , to take effect from April . And the data used to take the decision was from March  - April , according to documents produced by Public Health Englandat the time. That makes the data used to put India on the red list about a week fresher than the figures used to keep it off the list. The Mirror has asked the Department of Health and Social Care whether it is normal for such decisions to be based on weeksapos old data - and to provide copies of the data used in this instance - but they had not at the time of publication.  Why would the Government want to keep India off the red list  The Government faces growing claims that the decision to keep India off the red list was political - with Boris Johnson accused of wanting a photograph with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Labouraposs Shadow Home Secretary Nick Thomas Symonds said: It was unbelievably reckless that on his list of priorities Boris Johnson put having his photograph taken with Prime Minister Modi ahead of protecting the British people. Nobody is blaming people who travelled when they were permitted to do so the blame lies with the Prime Minister for his unjustiable delay. It was a fortnight of failure and we are all suffering the consequences. Matt Hancock told the Commons last night: I took action to tackle this iant before it was designated even as a iant under investigation as I was worried about what was happening in India. He added: On the Delta iant, we acted before it was recommended as a iant of concern by the scientic process. In fact, I have kicked off a review of that process because I think it is the process and the scientic advice that should advise me of the iants of the concern. But having looked and seen the data in India, we took action even before it was recommended. Hereaposs a rough timeline of how the India iant - now known as the aposdeltaapos iant - arrived in the UK, including the data that was available at the time.  Early February After falling since November, Covid cases in India begin rising - slowly at first. The weekly number of new cases rises from , around February  to , around February . That then rises again to , around February , according to the World Health Organisation. February This is date we now know, with hindsight, that the B.. iant of coronavirus was first detected in the UK.It was detected in the US a day later. The earliest recorded instance of it in the world is currently October . B.. would later be split into three sub-strains, with B... the most harmful. Early MarchCases in India begin to rocket. From a weekly rate of , or so cases round March , they reach , around March  and , around March . March  -  The percentage of people testing positive for Covid- from India is .%, much lower than that of people ing from Pakistan . This data was later used to inform the decision to place Pakistan on the red list, but initially leave India off. March  School closures and shopping restrictions loom as new cases in India see the highest daily increase in more than three months. At this point India is the world’s third worst affected country after the United States and Brazil. “It’s a proper second wave,” says Amit Thadhani, medical director of Niramaya Hospitals in Mumbai suburb Panvel. March  India’s Ministry of Health and Family Welfare revealed the discovery of a “double mutant iant”. It said not enough cases had yet been found to confirm the iant was responsible for soaring case numbers. But it added: “These mutations have been found in about -% of samples and do not match any previously catalogued Variants of Concern.” It was later claimed Indiaaposs health ministry sat on this statement for two weeks and the words high concern were removed. March  - April  Data collected during this period shows the positivity rate of arrivals from India had rocketed from .% to .% in a little over two weeks. The same figure for arrivals from Bangladesh was .% and from Pakistan was .%. Data for a similar time periodwas used to inform the decision to finally put India on the red list.March India’s daily count of new Covid cases rises above , for the first time since November. Mumbai confirms plans to raise hospital bed capacity from , to ,, while the Rajasthan government restricts celebrations of Holi and Shab-e-Barat.  March  The British Medical Journal publishes an article warning India’s cases have “taken a sharp upward turn since March”. The article adds: “Globally, India has had the third highest number of confirmed cases and deaths from Covid- after Brazil and the US. As of  March, India had  million cases and   deaths from the disease.” April  Public Health England declares B... - closely related to the more worrying B... - a “iant under investigation”. Officials will later say B... and B... are under surveillance but not yet iants under formal investigation.  April  The UK announces four countries, including India’s neighbours Pakistan and Bangladesh, will join the red list for foreign travel. This means arrivals must quarantine in £,-a-head hotels rather than at home. But India remains off the list. By this time India’s overall rate of new cases has shot from a low of around , a day to , a day. April Questions begin raging about Boris Johnson ’s planned visit to India later in April, as daily new cases pass ,.Despite the mounting fears, Downing Street say the trip will go ahead while the situation is “kept under review”. April  The travel ban on Bangaldesh and Pakistan takes effect at am, with India still off the red list. By this point, as NHS Test and Trace data will later show, more than half of Covid-positive people who flew in from India were carrying iants of some kind. Between March  and April , , travellers who flew from India to England were tested for Covid. Of the  who tested positive, around halfwere thought to have iants of concern or iants under investigation. By comparison, , people flew to England from Pakistan and  tested positive in the same period. But only four iant cases were found - a much lower rate than India of just %. Altogether, scientists found  iant cases in passengers from India to England between March  and April . This figure does not match up with percentages, because only some cases are sequenced to check for new iants, not all. April  The B.. iant appears on official statistics of cases in the UK for the first time, with  detected. At this point it is labelled a “iant under investigation” and not split into its sub-families, ,  and , on the government website. Days earlier, the weekly case rate in India has passed .million, with media reports suggesting bodies are piling up at crematoria waiting to be dealt with.  April  By this point Boris Johnson’s India visit has been scaled back to a day, but officials are insisting it will still go ahead. A No source strongly denies suggestions India is being omitted from the red list to avoid jeopardising trade talks. They describe the claim as “total and utter bull***t”. While this is going on, thousands of people continued to fly in from India to England without having to quarantine in a hotel. Between April  and April , , travellers will be tested after flying from India to England. Of those,  test positive for Covid- - up from  in the previous two-week period. And % of those are thought to have iants under investigation or of concern. April  The UK faces the reckoning over the iant as the number of UK cases rises from  to . Downing Street announce Boris Johnson will no longer visit India while Matt Hancock announces a travel ban. The Health Secretary says India will be placed on the red list after all - but only four days later, on Friday  April at am. A government statement admits: “There is a high volume of travel between India and the UK.” But Mr Hancock insists the decision is being taken on a “precautionary basis”, and expert Prof Sharon Peacock says it’s still not knownthe B.. iant family is the “main driver” for India’s new wave.  April  New data is published showing the number of cases of B.. in the UK has risen again to . April  Travel ban from India takes effect. All arrivals must now quarantine in a hotel rather than in their own homes. April  New figures separate out the B... iant and show there are  known cases in the UK. At the same time, B... - now the ‘India strain’ we refer to - is escalated to become a “iant under investigation”. Matt Hancock will later use this fact to defend his approach, saying the strain wasn’t even being investigated when he banned travel. But the closely-related B... iant was under investigation since April . Meanwhile the weekly case rate in India hits .million. May  Barely a week after being put under investigation, B... is reclassied as a “iant of concern”. It comes as startling new figures show the number of Indian iant cases in the UK has risen from  to . Surge testing begins in Bolton, which will later be identied as a hotspot for the new strain. Meanwhile MPs on the all-party coronavirus group attack the government’s border measures, saying passengers from high- and low-risk countries are being bunched together in arrival hall queues.  May  Despite the rising threat, Boris Johnson boasts “it looks to me” like he’ll be able to axe social distancing from June . He adds: “The data reflects what we already knew – we are not going to let this virus beat us. The roadmap remains on track.” By this point, according to EU figures, some  cases of the new iant have been detected in the UK. That compares to  in the US,  in Singapore,  in Australia,  in Germany,  in Japan and  in Denmark. May  Four days after the UK, the World Health Organisation classies the Indian strain as a iant of concern. It joins those from Kent , South Africa and Brazil. We are classying this as a iant of concern at a global level, Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO technical lead on COVID-, told a briefing. There is some available information to suggest increased transmissibility.  May  It emerges there are , cases of the iant in the UK - up from just  the week before. Surge testing is launched in Formby as questions begin to swirl about whether the roadmap can proceed as planned. May  Days after he expressed his confidence, Boris Johnson tells the nation the iant “could pose a serious disruption to our progress and could make it more dficult to move to step four in June. That could mean the end to social distancing and reopenings of places like nightclubs are delayed. He continues: I do not believe that we need, on the present evidence, to delay our road map.” But he adds: “If the iant is signicantly more transmissible weaposll have to face some hard choices. The PM says a huge step in England’s unlocking, with groups of six allowed to meet indoors and hug, can go ahead from Monday. May  Matt Hancock announces the number of Indian iant cases in the UK has risen by , in four days to ,, in  council areas. The Health Secretary defends his actions, saying: “We put India on the red list before countries such as Germany and Canada stopped flights from India.” Downing Street says updates on when full-sized weddings can resume and social distancing can end may now be delayed. Boris Johnson had suggested they would take place around May  and May  respectively, ahead of a June  launch date. But the PM’s spokesman says these updates may need to wait longer until more is known about the transmissibility of the iant. Meanwhile, No refuses calls from areas like Bolton, Blackburn and parts of London to give surge vaccinations to people in their s and early s whoaposve not had one dose yet. June  After weeks of speculation and rising cases, and with the Delta iant tearing through the country, Boris Johnson announces plans to remove most remaining Covid restrictions will be delayed. Confirming the delay, the PM said the spread of the Delta iant meant we have obviously faced a very dficult choice. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said there has been a “rapid acceleration in cases” - and experts believe England could suffer a wave of hospitalisations as bad as the first wave last Aprilstep four went ahead on June . Nationally there are around , new cases per day, the highest since February. Ministers have been told cases are growing at % week-on-week and in around a third of the country, are doubling every week.

The government has proposed changing the law to make vaccinations a condition of deployment for staff in care homes for older people in England. There had been warnings it could hit staffing levels, and trigger legal action by workers who could claim the rule is a breach of European human rights law. But the BBC and The Times revealed ministers have now decided to press ahead with the policy to protect care residents. Whitehall sources confirmed the plans. Trade Secretary Liz Truss refused to confirm the details but said an announcement is very imminent. Itaposs understood it will be made within days after a consultation closed last month. Affected workers will have  weeks to have the vaccine or face being fired under the policy, according to the BBC. Separately, ministers have indicated they will also open a consultation on forcing some or all NHS staff to have the jab in the same way. What do you think  Have your say in comments below  The Department of Health and Social Carewill reportedly launch two separate consultation exercises in the next few days into making Covid and flu jabs mandatory for NHS staff. Vaccine Minister Nadhim Zahawi said earlier this month: We’ve been consulting in terms of a condition of deployment into social care. I think it’s only right that we look at the healthcare system as well. “It’s absolutely the right thing, it would be incumbent on any responsible government, to have the debate, to do thinking, as to how we go about protecting the most vulnerable by making sure those who look after them are vaccinated. “There is precedent for this. Obviously surgeons get vaccinated for Hepatitis B. So it’s something we are absolutely thinking about.” Ministers believe the arguments in favour of protecting patients from potentially infectious staff now outweigh those that gives health workers the right to choose whether or not to be jabbed.The British Medical Association, which represents doctors, said that while they want all NHS staff to get jabbed, “compulsion is a blunt instrument that carries its own risks. It said: “While some healthcare workers are already required to be immunised against certain conditions to work in certain areas, any specic proposal for the compulsory requirement for all staff to be vaccinated against Covid- would raise new ethical and legal implications. Staff working some areas, such as surgery, must be vaccinated against some viruses such as hepatitis B. The chair of the National Care Association, Nadra Ahmed, warned the move could lead the sector to collapse. She told Times Radio: “We have got % [of staff] already vaccinated. We have over  or % of residents vaccinated.“We absolutely back the fact that the vaccine is the way out of the pandemic in some shape or form. But compelling somebody, I think thataposs a whole new territory. “If we lost the other -% who do not want to have this vaccine, we will find a sector in collapse because we wonapost have the workforce to deliver the care to the most vulnerable people in this country...How are we going to make this work ” The NHS Confederation, which represents health service trusts in England, has described plans for compulsory vaccines for staff as “unhelpful”. It also warned that hospital bosses are “unlikely to welcome the move. One NHS boss told the : “If you are going to go down this route of mandation for NHS staff, you will get into a direct confrontation with a group of staff who you’re forcing to do this at a time when you’re denying them a decent pay rise but also saying how much you love them.  “The government hasn’t thought through the consequences of this. Hospital trusts could end up having to suspend or even dismiss members of staff who continue to refuse to be vaccinated against Covid in defiance of a policy requiring them to get jabbed,” the senior figure said. The Government is drawing up the plans despite data showing that % of NHS staff had had their first dose and % had had both as of June . But take-up has been lower among social care staff with statistics showing that .% of staff in adult care homes had received at least one dose and .% had been double-jabbed by June .

He will tell us this cursed Delta iant is rising exponentially, that we do not know yet its full impact on hospitals or deaths, and we need one last heave due to an abundance of caution so as not to lose all we have gained, and thereaposll be a short delay of a mere four weeks before we can get back to normal. I havenapost seen his speech but Iaposm guessing thoseaposll be his buzzwords. And Iaposll likewise take a punt that he WONaposT say  weeks to flatten the curve,  weeks to turn the tide, eat out to help out, we can save Christmas, or freedom by next Easter, perhaps,youaposre lucky and I fall down a hole.He might use the word unprecedented, though. Which is a lie: every single freedom you want and he wonapost give you has been lost, not because of something unforeseen, but because our pillock of a PM has done almost everything wrong at every stage.  A delay to freedom was predictable, because every time heaposs locked down he did it late, and every time he opened up, cases rose. A fresh, catchy new iant running rampant was inevitable, with planes still arriving from high-infection areas every single day, self-isolation payments too low to be effective, and a test and trace regime that is better than it was but still pretty dire. And the long-promised end of all restrictions was never anything more than a holiday, before he gives Britain another big pile of Covid- for Christmas. There were always going to be complaints that the freedom he promised is not materialising at the time he said it would. What has he EVER done, except let people down   Children. Wives. Voters. Taxpayers. Colleagues. Bosses. Publishers. Sub-editors. Tailors. Veterans. Restaurateurs. Lawyers. The Queen. The man has a long and consistent history in disappointing and lying to absolutely everyone heaposs ever met, and millions more that he hasnapost. So when he tells you this is unprecedented, remember that it is entirely precedented. This world-beating agglomeration of cluster-f***ery was visible from space as soon as anyone gave him the keys to the clown car. You wanted a disruptor, you got one. There are some points of light, though. Every Tory backbench headbanger talking about Orwellian hellscapes, a bonfire of masks, and mass civil disobedience is reaping their own personal whirlwind of backing a prat for a PM. It is their pressure which deterred him from doing better. It is the rabid barking of every self-styled aposBrexiteerapos in the commentariat that has stopped him locking down sooner, which would have been shorter and more successful, and left us with fewer hotspots now. And thereaposs also something peculiarly pleasing about all those complaining about the delay to Freedom Day. He sold it to them so well that they are demanding something theyaposve mostly got, and which heaposs probably going to keep withholding for months even as a third, and then fourth, wave appears.  You can already go to a wedding, the cinema, and the pub. You can choose whether to work from home, use public transport, and your children are all at school. Holidays are what they always have been - a luxury for those who can afford them.You can even have a barbecue on the beach,you want, without any of the daily testing, double-jabbing, or security details and extra rules that the G leaders and their contingents had to follow in Cornwall. Imaginehe came out and asked you to get tested every morning before you left your house. In one way, at least, the PM is facing tougher restrictions than you or I. One rule for us, a shedload for him. But from whence did those wingnut backbenchers and media freedom fighters spring  Those noisy, demanding, fact-free, Iaposm-all-right-Jacques that plague the school run, the supermarket, and the airwaves were all born of Boris - the millions of unacknowledged children that are the result of his  years in public le. They came from the Eurosceptic Tories he fed with lies about bendy bananas, from columnists who thought they could be as well-known as him, from the newspapers and magazines where he published unjustiable bilge. They combined to create the grandchild of Brexit, and from that beastaposs fecund loins we have Creationist politicians, sausage wars, freshly-warlike murals on the Shankill Road, and a long-term refusal to spend money on important, thoughtful things, like an economy that doesnapost depend on shopping for tat we donapost need and a health service that doesnapost nearly expire in the mildest of flu seasons. He didnapost do it all, he didnapost do it alone, and he didnapost do it intentionally. But he did it so well that now heaposs first among the equally gittish, and of course he hasnapost put common sense or normal people first. He doesnapost know what either of those things are. He let the disease in. He ignored the science. He locked down late. He let the bodies pile high. He imports the potential for new iants every single day, while hoping against all scientic advice and knowledge that the vaccines which represent his administrationaposs one success will be enough. The fact they have been, so far, is because they were someone aposs idea. So when he tells you freedom is delayed, remember: itaposs freedom he promised from the mess he created, and itaposs delayed because he didnapost stop making more.

Think tank UK In A Changing Europe has sounded the alarm over the June  cut-off for the Home Officeaposs EU Settlement Scheme. Its new report believes huge numbers of EU nationals will miss the key date, due to little public awareness and huge gaps in government data on immigration, and will immediately and irreversibly lose their rights of residence within days. Catherine Barnard, deputy director of the think tank. said the schemeaposs aposdigital by defaultapos applications deterred many, while thousands of low paid workers in agriculture, the care sector and manufacturing may not even know about the deadline. The scheme was set up so EU nationals who came to the UK when Britain was part of the blocaposs freedom of movement policy can apply for ‘settled status’ or,they have less than five years residence, ‘pre-settled status’ post-Brexit. But those who failed to apply by the deadline, and who do not have a good reason for missing the cut-off, will have no legal immigration status. The report says they will therefore be considered ‘undocumented’ and become subject to the ‘hostile environment’ and the risk of removal. There will inevitably be a rush to apply in the final few days of the scheme, but some will not make it, the report says, adding that vulnerable people and those with more complex cases could be hardest hit. Ms Barnard said: On one level, the EUSS is a massive success in terms of providing a quick and efficient system which has reached huge numbers of people. But it is about to enter a phase that will require sensitive management where the government will need to show pragmatism and flexibility in dealing with dficult cases. “The ultimate effectiveness of the scheme can only be judged when we know not just how many people successfully applied but how many of these hard to reach groups were left undocumented at the end of the process and how the government dealt with them.” The report highlights that the scheme is perhaps the largest of its kind in the world and has been hugely successful. Ministers have repeatedly faced calls to extend the deadline given the chaos of the Covid pandemic. The government has previously said it is the Home Officeaposs intention to grant settled or pre-settle status to those that apply, but it remains unclear what will happenthe deadline is missed.

His daughter Jo Cox, while very close to her family, was not known for remembering birthdays or occasions. He could barely remember Jo sending something for Father’s Day. But, that year, , Jo had remembered. She had stopped at Kings Cross station on a trip between her constituency home in West Yorkshire and her houseboat in London, bought some biscuits with the word ‘DAD’ iced in big letters and posted them. Then, on June , three days before Father’s Day, Jo was killed by a far-right extremist while out doing the job she loved – standing up for the people of her beloved Batley and Spen as their proud MP. Her murder sent shockwaves around the world. “Father’s Day was very hard that year because Gordon got Jo’s present,” her mum Jean says. “She’d posted it before she died. He didn’t open it for six weeks.” What is your view  Have your say in the comment section Gordon laughs, but is tearful. “It was a bloody miracle she’d sent it,” he says. Five years later, we are sitting in Gordon and Jean’s garden in the Yorkshire sunshine, having tea and Fox’s biscuits from the local factory, and sharing stories of Jo. Today is the fth anniversary of her murder and Father’s Day will follow four days later. Jo’s birthday – she would have been  – is next week. Five years ago, Jo’s parents were sitting down with a cup of tea to watch England play Wales in the Euros when they received a phone call and heard the le-changing words: “Jo’s been shot.”  Wales are playing today, too. “It’s a reminder every day, every television channel, every radio station is talking about the Euros, you can’t get away from it,” says -year-old Gordon, a former toothpaste factory worker. He believed his daughter would survive. “People get shot, I thought, they get through it,” he says. “I thought, OK let’s deal with this.” Jean, , and daughter Kim knew immediately their lives had changed for ever. Jean says: “One phone call and your le changes. That’s happened to so many people over the last  months.” Five years on, Gordon is facing a battle against kidney cancer, with Leadbeater humour and vigour.  He looks remarkable for someone very recently out of hospital, and he and Jean are upbeat. “We are still optimists, after everything that’s happened,” says Jean, a former school secretary.Jo’s -year-old sister Kim is standing as the Labour candidate in Jo’s seat, which became vacant last month when Jo’s successor Tracy Brabin become the first Mayor of West Yorkshire.For a family who have been through so much, it was an immense decision. The Leadbeaters had lost one daughter to the same job. “I have decided not to be worried,” Jean says. “You can’t live like that in fear. We support Kim’s decision to stand, and trust those around her to keep her safe.”  Kim has been out on the doorstep in the two very dferent halves of the constituency all day, the Yorkshire stone of Batley and the bungalows of the Spen Valley, listening to people’s worries. She has Jo’s passion for fairness as well as her smile. She told her parents: “I don’t want it to go to someone who doesn’t love the community the way I do.” The Leadbeaters are determined to remember Jo – an MP, aid worker, campaigner for social justice, brilliant mum and generous friend – for the vibrant way she lived, not how she died. Jo’s presence is inescapable. The family are stopped several times a day by people wanting to share memories.  There is a Jo Cox Wood, a garden, a national day to combat loneliness, The Great Get Togeth-er this weekend, even a square in Brussels where Jo worked for Labour MEP Glenys Kinnock.The Jo Cox Foundation continues her compassionate work. Her values and mischievous smile live on in herchildren Cuillin,  and Lejla, eight. She feels present to all of us. “We talk about her every single day,” Gordon smiles.Jean adds: “Jo was friends with so many people. “You still can’t go anywhere without people saying, ‘Jo was friends with my we’, or ‘Jo helped us with this’.” After her death, when Gordon and Jean were visiting her husband Brendan and their children in London, they were on a bus when a woman came up to them. They are used to being recognised by people who want to offer condolences. “The woman said she’d jumped on the train from London to Yorkshire without her wallet. Her dad was seriously ill and she wasn’t thinking properly,” Jean says. “When she realised she didn’t have her wallet she started crying. “She said a woman came to her and askedshe was OK. She had given her some money and seen her off the train.” Gordon takes up the story. “Later she thought, I wonderI will ever see that woman again to thank her. Then she saw Jo on the news the day she was killed and realised who she was. ‘It was your Jo’, she said.” It’s an amazing story but her parents say such things happen often. Gordon adds: “We have had so many people come up to us and never had a bad word said against her. It’s a lovely legacy. After five years, people still know Jo Cox.” Jean says: “There are so many things in Jo’s name. Just look at her wood, all the work that went into it – you can see that people really care for her. We have tremendous friends and family, but it was also the community who got us through.” Today, Gordon and Jean are planning to spend the day with Kim and her partner, but Jo will be present. “We might have afternoon tea in the garden. Kim will have the day off campaigning,” Jean says. “We’ll be together, that’s the important thing.”  As I get up to leave, Jean stops me for a moment. “We miss her every day,” she says, quietly. “Every single day.” Ways to remember Jo today  Leave your tribute to Jo on the Virtual Wall of Hope at the People’s History Museum’s exhibition about Jo’s le moreincommon.phm.org.uk wall-of-hope   The Great Get Together takes place this weekend.

I would like to think someone would have told us it had.” The Prime Minister, French President Emmanuel Macron and Brussels chief Ursula von der Leyen clashed at the G Summit in Cornwall over a looming “sausage war” as restrictions on chilled meats come into force next month. Brexit Minister Lord Frost admitted talks with the EU were making little progress. The two sides disagree over the way the Protocol – the part of the Brexit deal aimed at avoiding a hard border with Ireland – is being implemented. He again restated the UKaposs threat to unilaterally suspend parts of the arrangement – a point the PM stressed at the G in Carbis Bay. The peer told MPs there are discussions going on the whole time with Brussels. Itaposs happening all the time, itaposs just that we are not making much progress despite all the ideas that we have put in, he said. He insisted all options remain on the table in the row.  Weaposd prefer to find negotiated ways forwardswe can, he said. If thataposs not possible, obviously other options remain on the table, as the PM said over the weekend. Asked about the uncertainty the row was causing for businesses, he said there comes a point where the unsatisfactoriness of the current situation and the attempts to operate it contributes to the uncertainty and instability. Committee chairman, Conservative MP Simon Hoare, told the peer he should not have been “blindsided” by problems with the system, because he negotiated it. Mr Hoare added: “Effectively youaposre saying there are elements of the Protocol that are unsatisfactory – but this is the Protocol the the Government signed up to.” Lord Frost said the Protocol issue had become more dficult because of the weakening of consent for the arrangements in unionist groups. The dficulty that we have had since the start of the year, or at least the end of January, is there has been a very visible weakening of consent in one community in Northern Ireland for the arrangements in the Protocol, and thataposs obviously produced instability and uncertainty, he said. DUP MP Ian Paisley told the minister: “The business community feel at best hamstrung.” Fearing the row could fuel tensions in the run-up to July  Orange order marches, when protestants mark King William of Orangeaposs victory over the Catholic King James II at the  Battle of the Boyne, added: “This canapost go on much longer before something gives, and Iaposm seriously worried about the fabric of our society.” Lord Frost admitted support for the Protocol had “corroded” among unionists. But he said the key tool for cracking the Brexit deadlock left “a lot of loose ends” and the plan was always to fine tune the pact after the transition period ended in January this year. The Tory peer told the committee there were “a lot of loose ends and open-ended provisions for subsequent negotiations” when the deal was struck. He added: “The spirit of good faith that was necessary to make the Protocol work and was so prevalent in , we hope it can continue to be as we find ways to operate it.” Lord Frost claimed problems lay not in the regime itself but the way it was being run.FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnConservative PartyEuropean UnionBoris JohnsonPoliticsBrexit"},{"url":null,"title":"agnes akom human remains found","story":"NewsAgnes Akom: Human remains found by police in search for missing -year-old womanAgnes Dora Akom, , who is originally from Hungary, was last seen alive in the Cricklewood area of north west London on May , with Neculai Paizan subsequently charged with murdermirrorShareByStephen BeechMatthew Dresch:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsAgnes Akom went missing in London in May \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Charlotte Bowcockaposs parents waved her off as she went for dinner on August  last year - and tragically never saw her alive again. She went out to an expensive restaurant with a man in the centre of Manchester before going back to his suite at the Hilton Hotel. But Charlotte was found dead the next morning, with an inquest ruling that she had ingested cocaine and her prescription medication.Her family told the Manchester Evening News they are still haunted  months on by what happened in her final hours.They said Charlotte, , had always been careful and believe there are still question marks over what happened that evening.Got a story  Email webnews@mirror. She had never taken drugs and drank very little alcohol, her family told Manchester coroneraposs court. Months before her death, she had been in agony with period pains and asked her mum to drive her to AE when she was scared of overdosing on two paracetamol she took earlier than she should have, the inquest was told. Her dad, Sydney Bowcock told the inquest: This is where she was at with her medications, she was always careful. During the inquest, coroner Zak Golombeck read statements from Paul Jackson - the man who had been with her that night, the paramedics who came when he called  at am and police officers who arrived to search the room. The inquest heard student nurse Charlotte met Mr Jackson, , at Australasia in Deansgate. Footage showed them drinking champagne and cocktails and went back to the Hilton Hotel at around am. Mr Jackson then left the room at am to get two cans of lemonade and chocolate from reception. Nobody  left their room or went inside until am when the paramedics arrived. Mr Jackson, who was not at the inquest, initially told paramedics that the pair had taken cocaine and had been drinking, but later said they hadnapost taken any drugs to police and that he aposdidnapost want Charlotte to get into troubleapos, the inquest heard. DI Mark Astbury, who went to the hotel at around .am, told the inquest there had been aposno evidenceapos of drug use in the room but that it was impossible to saythe pair had taken cocaine there, at the bars, in the toilets or before they arrived. He also said that there had been no-third party involvement in Charlotteaposs death and that Mr Jackson was never treated as a suspect. Body-worn footage from that morning showed white powder on the floor but DI Astbury said he didnapost see anything suspicious when he searched the room. He said: I didnapost see any white powder. I donapost know[that powder] was talcum powder or what it is, Iaposm not sure. I did a thorough search and we didnapost see any white powder. Itaposs a huge hotel room.  Mr Bowcock told the inquest Charlotte had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but aposstill got up every morningapos. He added she was aposvery, very sensibleapos. Mr Bowcock told the inquest: I was thinking of bringing her here today because it is what we are left with now. Her ashes. I may come over as a crazed, demented and grief-stricken parent and maybe one or two of these are true. Where do you go from here  All I am asking is that the police look into this. The coroner recorded a verdict of aposdrug-related deathapos, saying Charlotte died from cardiotoxicity after taking her prescription medication and cocaine at some point in the evening of August  or in the early hours of August . The family said they felt aposlet downapos and aposdisappointedapos following the inquest. Mr Bowcock, who filed an official complaint to the police about their investigation, said: Weaposve not had any closure. I was shut down at the inquest. I know it is not a criminal court but one of the things the inquest is for is to find out how she came to her death - this is what I wanted to know, how. We are chasing the answer, how  We can only hope that somebody listens to us. We feel so strongly about this that we actually have sold our home to accommodate for cash to fight this, we are not going to let it go. Itaposs not justice to me. Iaposm not going to rest until this is resolved. Iaposm not a deranged person, I just want justice. A spokesman from Greater Manchester Police said: Firstly, our thoughts and deepest sympathies remain with Mr Bowcock and his family at this dficult time. GMP received a complaint from Mr Bowcock, which was in turn dealt with by the City of Manchester District. A letter outlining the outcome of the complaint was sent to Mr Bowcock on the th October , which addressed the complaint in full. This was then subject to review by the Mayoraposs Office. The review was not upheld, and the matter was referred to the Coroneraposs Office which concluded its inquest on Thursday  June. GMP is always open to learning and improving where appropriate, however in this case GMP found no misconduct and a thorough investigation was carried out. Our thoughts are with friends and family of Charlotte following her tragic death. A spokesman for Manchester coroneraposs court said they would be unable to comment on a case following judicial proceedings.

Boris Johnson announced earlier this week that the final easing of lockdown restrictions would be delayed by four weeks, giving enough time for more vaccinations to take place.Confirming the delay the Prime Minister said it would aposgive the NHS a few more crucial weeks to get those remaining jabs into the arms of those who need them.apos The final step of the PM’s roadmap - which was to remove most remaining restrictions in England - is expected to take place from July . The latest figures show that more than half of UK adults, over  million people, have had their second dose of a vaccine, while almost four in five had been given a single dose. Now, the Dailyreports that a shortage of the Pfizer vaccine will slow down the rollout of jabs in spite of the delay to easing lockdown restrictions.The publication claims that supplies of the Pfizer jab to virus hotspots where Covid case rates are rising in younger age groups have been cut. On Tuesday, the head of the NHS was reported to have said the service couldnapost go any faster amid the limited supplies. Supplies are said to be so short that staff at some mass vaccination centres were told their shts would be cancelled in the coming weeks, according to a leaked letter. NHS bosses at Derbyshire Community Health Services NHS Foundation Trust reportedly told staff and volunteers at the Derby Arena centre that they may not be needed to come into work because of limited supplies, expected to replenish in July. Ian Ward, the leader of Birmingham City Council, said the city would be in exactly the same position by July  unless the shortage could be solved. He told the paper: Unless the Government can deliver the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines in the right numbers, itaposs hard to see how we could safely unlock on July  – and that goes for the whole country.  Nahim Zahawi, the vaccines minister, said Pfizer supplies will be tight in the coming weeks. He was reported to have said: Pfizer have done a great job in being consistent on their delivery schedule, adding the company had done remarkable things to increase their production, not just for us but for the whole world, for Europe and the US as well. But it is tight. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman reportedly said: There are no shortages of Pfizer BioNTech vaccines and deliveries are coming in on time and as ordered. Our vaccination programme continues to make phenomenal progress, with more than  million vaccines administered so far –including  million second doses – and we are on track to offer a jab to all adults by July .

Paul Harvey created a tin foil bikini for his raw roast before liberally sprinkling gravy granules over its exposed flesh and bunging it in the oven for two hours. The -year-old even placed teaspoons over the chickenaposs aposchestapos to create a defined bikini cup line and then spent an hour carefully carving tiny carrot boots for the bathing beauty. Inspired by aposover-cookedapos Brits on the beach, the chicken was then topped with a potato head, purple caullower hair and appeared to have harsh tan lines. Dad-of-two Paul then laid the figure on a bed of polenta to give the effect the woman was sunbathing on a beach. Social media users praised the street food chefaposs handiwork, claiming the finished product was a dinner doppelganger of chain-smoking Madge Harvey from hit sitcom Benidorm.  Paul, from Swadlincote, Derbyshire, said: When I saw the cooked chicken I just kept laughing at it, it really made me chuckle. When I got it out of the oven my father Graham was visiting. He asked aposoh whataposs this apos and took the cover off it. His face was a picture, he said aposwhat the hell is that apos Iaposve seen Benidorm and it definitely looks like Madge. Itaposs just a bit of fun, I donapost take it seriously. The reaction has been great, Iaposve loved reading the comments. Itaposs great to make people laugh, which is the reason I did it.

A third wrote: This has made my night seeing this lol. I am not alone wishing for that mad rush to pack and get away. Just love the nice sun tan on your bird lol. After rustling up the fun fowl dish in June last year, Paul decided to share the picture recently as a throwback post. Paul said: I made the dinner last year when I had a chicken that had gone out of date. The chicken would have gone in the bin otherwise. I hate throwing things away, so I decided to have a bit of fun with it. It was an off-the-cuff idea - I just made it up as I went along. The carrot shoes took ages to carve as they were quite intricate. It took me a good hour to make them - I spent about  minutes on each one. I boiled the caullower aposhairapos and some extra further down for modesty reasons because there was a big gaping hole there and it didnapost look right.  The polenta was to give it the proper beach effect. This isnapost the first time that Paul has whipped up quirky dishes, having already made a giant feetloaf - a foot made out of minced meat - and a Cookie Monster burger. Paul said: I made a big foot out of out-of-date mincemeat last year - instead of meatloaf itaposs aposfeetloafapos. The toenails were made out of onion and there was a cheese topping - it was absolutely disgusting.

Photographer and videographer Heywood Taylor, , was born with a birthmark on his left cheek, under his eye. As a child, he was often asked what was wrong with his face, while other children mistook his birthmark for a bruise or a burn. Despite remembering being told on one occasion that his birthmark was aposuglyapos and that he should get it removed, Heywood doesn’t remember feeling any misery as a result of his birthmark in his youth. But by the time he reached his late teens, he began to struggle with looking dferent from his peers and in public he felt paranoid about what people thought.  Noticing people staring he developed social anxiety and agoraphobia - a disorder in which a person develops anxiety when in unfamiliar situations or surroundings. Heywood went on to discover the gym and by getting into shape his confidence grew as did his desire to cover his body in art. Although Heywood, from Newcastle, still receives stares from strangers, he says that by covering such visible parts of his body in artwork, he has managed to ‘take back control.apos He hopes that sharing his story will help normalise facial dferences and make them less taboo. He said: “I remember people staring and often asking meI was ok. A couple of times I was told it was ugly and that I should get it removed, but at the time I didn’t pay it much notice.  “I don’t remember too much anguish regarding having my birthmark though. “It wasn’t until my late teens and early twenties that I really began to struggle with having a birthmark. “I remember getting very paranoid when in public and uncomfortable, not because people would or had ever said anything, but simply because of people staring. “I felt awkward as a teenager as many people do, so the added stares of the birthmark enhanced this awkward anxiety. “By my twenties, I developed agoraphobia - particularly of public busy places. I would never be in public alone andfor example I had to travel, I would often feel very vulnerable within myself.  “I could not stand people looking at me and then looking away awkwardly. It made me feel horrendous and I suffered from cold sweats. He said he struggled with years of anxiety, alcohol and ADHD before losing his mum at , which made him apostip over the edge.apos He added: “I found myself overweight and miserable, contemplating the end so I joined a gym and it saved me at that time. “I would gradually regain my self confidence and after a few years, I had learned to believe in myself again, and with a good boost of ego I grew in confidence. “It was at this point that I started really getting tattooed. “I had had a few tattoos before, but once I was getting in better shape and my confidence grew, I actually felt more comfortable to start getting tattooed more. “As the skin got gradually covered in permanent ink, I found my confidence grew even further. He said that with his face covered in tattoos he has aposnever felt more comfortableapos with how he looks. He added: “To those who are self-conscious about their birthmark, it can really suck and the mental health implications are real. “The only thing that has changed for me with my relationship with my birthmark is that I am no longer anxious about it and that’s because I worked on myself. “I love the little red thing, and I’m grateful for it because it has shaped me in far more positive ways than negative. “As people, we are all much much more than just a face - just some of our faces are a little less boring than the norm.”FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnMental healthTattoos"},{"url":null,"title":"mirror newspaper tablet offer promotion","story":"NewsGet The Mirror free on tablet for two months*Its packed with breaking news, sport and entertainment - and is perfect during lockdownmirrorShareByDave MastersDigital Commercial Editor:,  APR Updated:,  APR News\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Professor Chris Whitty, Englandaposs chief medical officer, showed the map during Mondayaposs press conference, and identied where the number of Covid cases is rising. The areas shaded in dark brown are the ones where Covid cases are increasing the most, while infections are decreasing in the green regions. It shows that cases are rising the most sharply in the North and the west Midlands. There were also hotspots sprinkled further south, towards Wales and in the south west. Prof Whitty said the map shows cases are rising all across the country and not in any one region.  He was making the case for why the government is delaying the lting of Covid restrictions rom June  to July .Professor Whitty appeared alongside Prime Minister Boris Johnson to update the country on the roadmap for reopening from lockdown.He said: The dark colours here on this map are where the rates of increase are greatest. But anywhere that is shaded in yellow or orange colours or dark brown, rates are increasing. Where theyaposre in green, rates are decreasing. And you can see in this map that the increase in the new iant is occurring across the whole country. This rise breaks the governmentaposs third roadmap test on lting restrictions.  The test involves whether infection rates are rising so quickly and at such a rate that they overwhelm hospital capacity, putting unsustainable pressure on the NHS. At the press conference it was also revealed that the Delta iant of the virus, which originated in India, is  to % more transmissible than the Alpha strain, first identied in Kent. If the final stage of unlocking had gone ahead in England next Monday, the number of people in hospital with Covid might have reached the same level as at the beginning of the first lockdown last March.  It comes as new measures including surge testing and maximising vaccine uptake will be rolled out in Birmingham, Liverpool and Cheshire to tackle the Delta Covid iant. The package also includes additional support in Birmingham, Blackpool, Cheshire East, Cheshire West and Chester, Liverpool City Region and Warrington to slow down the spread of the concerning strain. Anyone living in those areas is being urged not to travel. The new support is the same package which was rolled out in Greater Manchester and Lancashire last Tuesday, and in Bolton which has since seen a drop in cases. Those who live or work in Birmingham, Blackpool, Cheshire East, Cheshire West and Chester, Liverpool City Region and Warrington are also being urged to minimise the amount of travelling they do in and out of the affected areas.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"nurse sues royal british legion","story":"NewsNurse sues Royal British Legion over despicable birthday card joking about her ageEileen Gleeson said that the birthday card, which featured the caption Its not about age, its about attitude, was \"insulting\" and tried to sue the Royal British Legion for discriminationmirrorShareCommentsByMilo BoydReporter:,  JUN NewsEileen Gleeson took issue with the birthday card sent by her colleagues \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The card also featured a photo of a pensioner riding a motorbike and prompted Eileen Gleeson to take the veteranaposs charity to an employment tribunal. The -year-old told a hearing she was offended by the card, which she branded unprofessional and insulting. But the mother-of-one ultimately lost her claim after a judge ruled that aposin the contextapos making a reference to someoneaposs age is not discriminatory. Following the judgement, Ms Gleeson, from Southampton, said: I thought the card was insulting - a picture of older people with grey hair, and just the way it was worded.  Itaposs the sort of card,my -year-old son got it for me I would say itaposs a bit cheeky, but it was unprofessional from co-workers. You have got to be very politically correct these days. I thought it was despicable and very unprofessional and the fact that we were all nurses and should be caring people made it quite shocking. It was probably the most traumatic experience I have gone through. An employment tribunal held in Southampton, Hants, heard that Ms Gleeson worked as an admiral nurse at the Royal British Legion for around eight months in . The role required her to work with carers who were supporting people living with dementia and their relatives. Just three months into the job it was Ms Gleesonaposs th birthday and the rest of the team sent her a card. The card had a picture of an older person on a motorbike, along with the words apositaposs not about age, itaposs about attitude!apos. Ms Gleeson told the tribunal that although she thought it was nice of the team to send her a card, she didnapost like the message and felt that it wasnapost appropriate coming from people she didnapost know very well. However, the hearing was told she never raised the issue throughout the rest of her employment.  Instead, over the next few months the work gradually began to get on top of Ms Gleeson, the tribunal heard, and her managers became concerned about her performance. She was having dficulties dealing with clients and failing to keep accurate records. Eventually, after a number of unsuccessful attempts by her managers to engage with her and improve her performance, she was dismissed. Ms Gleeson, who had worked for  years in the NHS, alleged she felt she was made to feel like a aposburdenapos to the organisation and that she was being managed aposinappropriatelyapos. She took the Royal Legion to the tribunal claiming victimisation, age discrimination and unfair dismissal. However, her case was dismissed. Employment Judge Catherine Rayner concluded: I find that the sending of a birthday card making reference to age is not in this context capable of amounting to a detriment or of unfavourable treatment ofand I find thatherself did not in fact consider it to be so at the time. Judge Rayner added that on a day to day basis within the organisation, there was no discrimination against Ms Gleeson as a result of her age. She added: EvenI had found any less favourable treatment, I could not have drawn any inference from the primary facts I have found, thatage, or her part time status played any part whatsoever in the way she was treated by the . It waslack of cooperation and her refusal to communicate with her managers which caused the ongoing dficulties and ultimately led to the termination of the contract.

However, it seems one man might have turned this advice on its head after sharing his thoughts on the matter.An old Reddit post has resurfaced online and people have been moved by a y comment left by an unnamed old man - whose words still hit home today even though it first wrote it nine years ago.The initial post on the social media  read: My friend just died. I donapost know what to do. In response to this, the man said: Iaposm old. What that means is that Iaposve survivedand a lot of people Iaposve known and loved did not. Iaposve lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbours, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I canapost imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But hereaposs my two cents.  I wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I donapost want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I donapost want it to aposnot matterapos. I donapost want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. Andthe scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to le. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to le. Scars are only ugly to people who canapost see.As for grief, youaposll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, youaposre drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnicence of the ship that was and is no more.And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe itaposs some physical thing. Maybe itaposs a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe itaposs a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive. The comment continues: In the beginning, the waves are  feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come  seconds apart and donapost even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, youaposll find the waves are still  feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can . You never know whataposs going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is le. Somewhere down the line, and itaposs dferent for everybody, you find that the waves are only  feet tall. Or  feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at OaposHare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but youaposll come out. Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you donapost really want them to. But you learn that youaposll survive them. And other waves will come. And youaposll survive them too. If youaposre lucky, youaposll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.

An interactive map released by the Wellcome Sanger Institute shows what proportion of an areaaposs coronavirus cases is the Delta iant.In several UK locations popular with British holidaymakers the mutant strain, which first arose in India, is the dominant one. Cornwall, which was expected to welcome in , guests during half term alone, has a Delta case proportion of between  and  per cent. While the actual number of cases in the south-western county remains low, the presence of the highly infectious strain - along with huge numbers of holiday makers - is a cause for concern. Lancashire, known for its rugged beauty and beaches, is another holiday hotspot with a high case proportion of the Delta iant, sitting between  and  per cent across the county.  The case count is much higher in Lancashire than in Cornwall, with Blackburn in the north-western county recording the second most cases -  per week - of anywhere in England. Great Yarmouth in Norfolk, which offers long sweeping beaches and classic British seaside charm, has a  per cent Delta iant case rate. Further south and around the headland into Kent, Canterbury has a  per cent proportion of Delta iant cases, as well as a stunning Cathedral and access to renowned oyster beds in Whitstable.  Those looking for a city break could do worse than Newcastle, which boasts the Angel of the North and the Tyne Bridge as well as world famous nightle. It now also has a Delta iant proportion of  per cent in the city and  per cent in nearby North Tyneside. However, some parts of the country appear almost untouched by the Delta iant, and have endured zero cases in the two weeks to June . They include popular destinations such as West Devon, New Forest, Hastings, Harrogate and Scarborough, There have been at least , cases of the Delta strain in the UK so far since it emerged in mid-April. That figure is only based on genetically screening around half of all positive tests, so the true number may be twice as high.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnDeltaCoronavirusHolidays"},{"url":null,"title":"selfless single dad adopts sixth","story":"NewsSelfless single dad adopts sixth child - and says he might have anotherSingle dad, Ben Carpenter, , from Huddersfield, has adopted six kids with special needs over the years, after setting out on a mission to help the most vulnerable of childrenmirrorShareCommentsByBeth Kilgallon:,  JUN NewsLily, Jack, dad Ben, Joseph and Ruby Carpenter \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Ben Carpenter, , from Huddersfield, adopted his first child at the age of just . Over the years he has adopted another five children with special needs, after setting out on a mission to help the most vulnerable of children. In April last year, Ben brought home his sixth adopted child, two-year-old Louis, after he had taken some time out to grieve following the tragic death of his fth child, Teddy. Benaposs first child was Jack, now -year-old, who has autism. He also has Ruby who has complex needs, age , nine-year-old Lilly who is profoundly deaf, and Joseph, age six, who has Downaposs Syndrome. Benaposs fth adoptive child was Teddy, who sadly passed away in November . Although Teddy had a rare genetic disorder called Cornelia de Lange syndrome, he passed away from sepsis and not as a result of his complex needs.The doting dad then took a break from adoption to allow himself the time to grieve the devastating death of his son before adopting for the sixth time last year. In April , Ben brought home his sixth and most recent adopted child, Louis, who has cerebral palsy and is blind. Ben, who worked in the care sector before setting out on his adoption journey, says that he always knew he wanted to have a family but not necessarily be a biological dad.  He added: Iaposve always known what I wanted. I never wanted to become a biological dad because being a parent is so much more than that. I wanted to help kids that were the most vulnerable and the ones that were most in need of a loving and caring home. I had a lot to prove at such a young age. I needed to show that I was mature enough and could offer these kids what they needed. The good thing about adoption that you canapost do in pregnancy is picking the gender of the child. So to begin with I chose a boy and then a girl because I thought that would be the perfect set up and luckily got accepted and matching with my son and daughter, Jack and Ruby. I was then askedI would take my biological daughteraposs sister which I agreed to do. So I had two girls and one boy and I thought I should even it out again and adopt another son.  So I applied for a boy with Down Syndrome and within three days I was matched to a baby boy who had just been born with the condition. A few years later, Ben had been reading a magazine article which is how he came across the next boy that would join his family. He says that he read about a severely disabled boy, Teddy, who was in desperate need of a family and got in touch because he thought he could help. Ben added: There were lots of conversations and visits and it was agreed that we would be a lovely match and the adoption was approved. I then had my five kids and I was so happy. They were all doing amazing. However in , Teddy tragically passed away as a result of sepsis. I was devastated and I felt guilty for a while because I kept wonderingthere was something I could have done to fix it. Before Teddy passed away, I had been contacted to seeI would consider another child. It was a little boy with [severe] brain issues. I had said yes, but when Teddy passed I needed to put the process on hold to allow myself to grieve. In early  I realised that this little boy also needed me and I could be his last option so I called the social worked and started the process again. In April , Louis came home to be with us and has gone from strength to strength ever since. Ben says that all of his children have amazing sibling relationships and that his house is full of love and joy which has allowed them to flourish. He added: I had always dreamed about having a big family and I am so happy that my kids are a part of it and that they have so many siblings. I often sit and imagine them all at each otheraposs weddings. They are all so supportive of each otheraposs needs and I am so proud that I have created a happy, loving and stable environment for them to grow up in. As much as I have changed their le, they have also changed mine. And I would never say never to having another child.Ben is raising money to create a sensory room to support his childrenaposs needs.

The -year-old had beaten breast cancer in , but when the disease ed it had spread to her lung, liver and spine. Mum-of-three Jo defied medics’ expectations as she bravely fought the illness for two years.  Before she died, Jo, who was not close to any other family, said Erin was “the perfect choice” to raise the youngsters because she was “a born carer” with “a heart the size of Newcastle”. “I’ve been caring for my mum since I was ,” Erin said. “It’s been quite hard but it’s what I’ve got to do.” Jo was first diagnosed with breast cancer in , but went into remission after chemotherapy and a mastectomy.

Erin, who will now raise Liam and Lily, said: “It’s hard but I’ve got to be alright for the kids. “My little brother’s not taking it so well and my sister doesn’t really know what’s happening. “Every day’s going to be dficult, I’m not used to doing it all myself, but we’ve always been a close family. “My partner’s been amazing and I’ve got close friends helping me.” Erin, who got a retail job in September, said: “It’s been quite dficult to have my own le and have my own proper job. I’ve got to put my le on hold for the moment. “My mum always said she didn’t want this on me, but I would say. ‘It’s got to be me.

Taylor Humphrey, , from Mendlesham in Suffolk, “fell in love” with sunbeds as soon as she was old enough to use them and even asked her parents to buy her a bed of her own. She now spends  minutes on a sunbed every day and says she will not leave the house without a tan. But Ms Humphrey has received criticism online from those who accuse her of pretending to be black - also known as “blackfishing”. She rejects this and says she just loves having a dark tan. I first went on a sunbed as soon as I was legally allowed to when I was , said Ms Humphrey. I fell in love with it straight away because I have olive skin and could see great results, so I asked my parentsthey would buy one for me and they agreed.  I was so happy. When I first got it I started off doing eight minutes at a time and built it up over a few months.” Ms Humphrey says she now spends  minutes on the sunbed every day, which is the maximum recommended amount of time. She added: If I donapost have a tan or go on my sunbed for one day I just donapost feel myself at all.  If I didnapost have a tan then I just wouldnapost leave my house. Going on the sunbed is the thing I look forward to most every day. Not everyone is as thrilled about her tanning regime. Ms Humphrey said: I have received some stick for my tan but itaposs not like I am using fake tan. I canapost help itmy skin goes this tanned.  Someone had even posted a TikTok about me and my tan saying that I was doing blackfishing. But I just took it as a compliment that they took the time to do that amount me. Some people even wanted me to delete my social media.” She added: I just try to ignore people when they say stuff like this about me and donapost retaliate. I just like having a tan. It is one of the most important things to me and makes me feel the most confidence.”  Ms Humphrey said her sunbed broke during lockdown for a couple of months and this left her depressed and not wanting to see anyone. It was a horrible time, and I just felt really bad about myself, she said. “I didnapost want anyone to see me without a tan and I had to wear lots of makeupI ever needed to leave the house so I felt better about myself.”  Experts have said just one sunbed session can increase a personaposs risk of developing skin cancer by up to %. Ms Humphrey is aware of the dangers of using sunbeds, but says there are risks with everything. I know there are risks that come with going on sunbeds but it is like that with everything”, she said. “There is a risk that smoking and drinking can cause cancer too and people still do that.” She is not going to let the trolls online stop her getting her regular tans. I couldnapost imagine my le without a sunbed”, she said.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnFake tanTeenagersOnline trolls"},{"url":null,"title":"uks first official red light","story":"NewsUKs first official red light district to shut down  years later after fall in numbersThe £, a year scheme - known as the Holbeck Managed Approach - was first launched in , becoming the only place in the country where on-street sex work was legalisedmirrorShareCommentsByKristian JohnsonWilliam WalkerNews Reporter:,  JUN NewsThe scheme was launched in  \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters. Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeThe UKaposs first official red light zone is to shut down nearly seven years later after plummeting numbers of sex workers during the pandemic. The scheme - known as the Holbeck Managed Approach was first launched in , becoming the only place in the country where on-street sex work was legalised.Prostitutes were allowed to solicit for punters at certain times overnight without the fear of being arrested in the £, a year scheme, Leeds Live reports.It was set up in a bid to make sex work safer for women, but quickly became a point of contention among nearby residents. Locals claimed sexual activity spilled onto their streets, while others said women and young children were approached by men who came to the area looking for sex.  Several protests were held against the scheme, despite figures suggesting it made sex workers feel safer. On Tuesday, Leeds City Council and West Yorkshire Police announced that the Holbeck Managed Approach would formally close, just a year after a £, independent review suggested it should continue without any cutbacks. Support will continue to be given to sex workers and the council says it remains committed to managing on-street sex work in the most appropriate manner possible in order to reduce harm associated with on-street sex work. A police presence will also be maintained for their safety, but women will no longer be allowed to freely work on the streets of Holbeck. I accept that it has been a bumpy road for some of the residents in the local community, said Cllr Debra Coupar, deputy leader of Leeds City Council.  What I would say is that we have had many benefits from the Managed Approach the policing resources and the cleansing resources. I accept that over the years the benefits have not always been sustained, but over the last two or three years we have put dedicated resources which have made a huge dference to the people in Holbeck. But Iaposll leave it to the residents to judge whether it was a success or not. The Managed Approach has officially been closed since last year, when the Safer Leeds Partnership executed emergency measures to temporarily shut the zone due to the Covid- pandemic. All powers will be used to prevent the sale or purchase of sex in the area, said a statement in March . The temporary decision will effectively be continued indefinitely, although continued support will be given to sex workers in a bid to help them exit the industry. Figures show the number of women in street sex work in Holbeck has fallen by around  per cent since , although there are still an estimated  women working as prostitutes in the area. We have to acknowledge that the pandemic has had an impact in terms of those numbers, said Paul Money, chief officer of the Safer Leeds partnership. There is a risk that when social distancing restrictions are fully lted, we could see an increase, but our intelligence is not telling us that it will be a signicant increase. Responding to the news, a spokesperson for the Save our Eyes and Voice of Holbeck campaign groups said: By , it became clear that there were major failings and that the women it was intended to help could not respect either the operational area or the operational hours. This led to a huge detrimental impact on the residents living nearby, whose streets were taken over by prostitution and kerb crawling in addition to the allocated streets. We are pleased to hear that some of our recommendations are being adopted, such as banning kerb crawling and punters on foot. Men who prey on vulnerable women in street prostitution are no longer welcome or tolerated in Holbeck.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnProstitution"},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather england hotter bahamas","story":"NewsUK weather: England to be hotter than Bahamas ahead of four days of thunderstormsThe soaring weather is due to high pressure which has made its way from the Azores island in Portugal and settled across the Midlands and the southeast of EnglandmirrorShareCommentsByLorraine King:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsBrits enjoyed the hottest day of the year on Tuesday \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Sun worshippers flocked to beaches and parks across the UK to enjoy the sweltering heat following a weekend of glorious sunshine that saw the mercury climb to .C at Londonaposs Heathrow Airport. And it promises to rise even higher. Thunderstorms will shatter the mini-heatwave later this week but there will be blast of heat before the rain creeps in as temperatures are expected to surge to C.The soaring weather is due to high pressure which has made its way from the Azores island in Portugal and settled across the Midlands and the southeast of England. This resulted in Tuesday being hotter than the Bahamas as temperatures in the West Indies holiday island only reach C. The glorious heat on Tuesday has beaten the previous record of the hottest day which was almost two weeks ago when temperatures of .C were recorded in Northolt in West London, on June . But influences from the Atlantic are predicted to bring wet weather over the northern and western parts of England with cloudier skies and patches of rain.  This will see the UKaposs sunshine disappear as a monthaposs worth of rain is forecast to fall in just two hours. On Wednesday some areas could endure downpours of up to mm which is the average amount of rainfall in South East England for the entire month of June. A cold front will bring in cooler air which will trigger cloudier and wetter conditions to northern England, southern Scotland, and Northern Ireland.  The south of England will experience clear spells but rain will fall in the North.From pm there could be thundery breakdown which has prompted the Met Office to issue a yellow weather warning for some parts of the UK.The thunderstorms are expected to move across the country and potentially eastern Wales but the timing and exact locations are still uncertain. Experts have warned there could be torrential downpours, hail, lightning and strong winds from late on Wednesday through to Friday morning. Met Office forecaster Becky Mitchell said: Large swathes of England and Wales could potentially see some heavy downpours on Thursday.  After that, it will bring in fresher air from the West and so that will clear away the hot weather. The thunderstorm warning covers quite a large area of England and Wales. Closer to the time we will have a better idea of where exactly they should be. UK Weather Forecast Today: Fine for many, with some hot sunshine for much of England and Wales before evening thunderstorms develop for some. Further north, a few showers over Scotland and Northern Ireland. Tonight: Thunderstorms moving northwards across parts of England and Wales with heavy rain and lightning, these mainly across southern and central areas. Scotland and Northern Ireland clearer with a few showers. Thursday: Band of cloud and light rain across central and western areas. Risk of thunderstorms southeast of this. Mainly dry with sunny spells across much of Scotland and Northern Ireland. Outlook for Friday to Sunday: Mostly dry with sunny spells, although heavy, perhaps thundery, rain will affect much of England and parts of Wales on Friday.

They have much to discuss. The only thing the pair have so far agreed on is that relations between the two superpowers have never been so low. So bad is the stand-off, neither currently has an ambassador in-country as Trump’s cosy relationship with Putin is all but a distant memory. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section Long gone are the times when the former Apprentice star was sycophantically toadying up to the Russian leader, putting him above his U.S. intelligence services. Instead, Biden has not forgotten the interference Moscow carried out in helping put Trump in the White House, tensions on the Ukrainian border and the state-sponsored attempted murder of Sergei Skripal on U.K. soil. White House sources have told the Mirror the US leader will go into the meeting with open eyes and well-prepared to confront Putin over Russia’s aggressive conduct and to lay out consequences for further provocations. Although expectations are low, here is what the meeting means. Alexei Navalny Ahead of the summit, President Biden issued a warning to Putin that the death of jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny would damage Moscow’s relationships with the rest of the world. “Navalny’s death would be another indication that Russia has little or no intention of abiding by basic fundamental human rights,” Biden said on Monday following the NATO summit.Like news to one of the Mirroraposs newsletters “It would be a tragedy. It would do nothing but hurt his relationships with the rest of the world, in my view, and with me,” he said. In January, Navalny flew to Russia from Berlin, where he had spent nearly half a year recovering after having been poisoned last summer. He was arrested at passport control as soon as he landed. A month later, a Russian court sentenced Navalny, , to more than two years in jail for parole violations, charges he said were politically motivated. How have we got to this point   The choice of Geneva as a setting harks back to a Cold War encounter in  - the first summit between Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev. Under the two leaders, America and Russia began building much closer relations, which continued during the Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin era. It brought greater stability throughout the world. That was until the spring of  with the Nato bombing of then-Yugoslavia and relations began to deteriorate.  However, they started taking a much more sinister turn in , due to the crisis in Ukraine, Russia’s annexation of Crimea in , dferences regarding Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War, and from the end of  over Russia’s alleged interference in the  and  US elections. There’s no prospect Wednesdayaposs meeting event will match the Reagan Gorbachev summit for personal rapport or political progression. What is the goal  Although Moscow and Washington view each other with intense mistrust, both sides grudgingly appreciate the need to have a working relationship to avoid disaster. “Russia still has, together with the United States, the largest nuclear arsenals on Earth,” says Eric Green, the National Security Council senior director for Russia.  “Russia is still a permanent member of the security council at the U.N. That means whether we like it or not, we have to work with Russia on certain core challenges that are out there in the world.” Both sides will want some form of “stable and predictable relationship” however it seems unlikely. “Whether we can have a stable environment, I don’t think so,” said Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Centre. “I believe that the most that can be done as a result of the Geneva summit is the clarication for both sides of where their real red lines lie.” Whataposs on the agenda  The topics for discussion will be vast. Fresh from the G summit in Cornwall, while their allies thanked Biden for his readiness to tackle Putin. An immediate priority will be rebuilding diplomatic ties between America and Russia. “They need to work out at least a minimum of the reestablishment of diplomatic ties so that the U.S. can get on with doing the business that it needs to do in Russia and the same for the Russians here,” said Angela Stent, director of the Centre for Eurasian, Russian, and East European Studies at Georgetown University. The U.S. leader will be eager to raise ongoing issues in Iran, Syria, Afghanistan and North Korea - all countries heavily influenced by Russia. Both parties recognise they have no choice but to work together on strategic stability and arms control.  Biden is also anticipated to raise the recent hijacking of a Ryanair flight by Belarus and reaffirm America’s support to Ukraine. Climate change is also set to be discussed. What can they realistically achieve   Putin told state television there were “issues where we can work together” with America, beginning with new nuclear arms control talks, discussing conflicts including Syria and Libya, and climate change. He said:” If we can create mechanisms for working on those issues, then I think we can say the summit was not in vain.” Some in Moscow suggest a truce in the “diplomatic wars” may also be possible. Putin may allow its ambassador back to Washington as a minimum move. Does the relationship still matter on the global stage   Although Russia’s relationship with the West is plumbing depths of hostility and common dferences unseen since the original Cold War, it shows just why the relations between Moscow and Washington matters more than ever. As China’s influence grows, it is vital America and Russia step up to ensure global stability for the rest of the world. Presidential relationships Before Donald Trump poodled up to Putin, the last time the two leaders of the countries met in an official summit was in  when Barack Obama met with Dmitry Medvedev in Prague. The meeting was cordial with a commission set up “identying areas of cooperation and pursuing joint projects and actions that strengthen strategic stability, international security, economic well-being, and the development of ties between the Russian and American people.” However behind the scenes was Putin, who for the ten years previously held power with an iron fist. Medvedev was a symbolic president with his predecessor still holding the controls. Obama would go on to meet Putin several times although failing to hold an official summit together. Despite starting off well in , seven years later in Hangzhou, China, he famously stared down the Russian as relationships faltered at the G meeting. Before Obama, Putin had enjoyed a warm relationship with George W Bush holding two summits together. The then US president even once welcomed his Russian counterpart into his home, holding discussions and a barbecue dinner on his ranch which included lessons in how to dance the Cotton-Eye Joe. Bush would later say of Putin: “I looked the man in the eye. I found him very straightforward and trustworthy. I was able to get a sense of his soul.” Bush’s top security aide Condoleezza Rice later wrote the phrasing had been a serious mistake. “We were never able to escape the perception that the president had naïvely trusted Putin and then been betrayed,” she said.Population -  millionFounded - Wealth - £, billionGDP - £,,,,World happiness -  Average monthly wag e - £Domestic burglaries per , people - Russia Population -  millionFounded - Wealth - £, billionGDP - £,,,,World happiness -  Average monthly wage - £,Domestic burglaries per , people -  FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnJoe BidenDonald TrumpRonald ReaganMikhail GorbachevBoris YeltsinVladimir PutinCold WarHuman rightsRussia"},{"url":null,"title":"jilted girlfriend gets revenge love","story":"NewsJilted girlfriend gets revenge on love rat by confronting him on holiday with other womanAn alleged love rat who was seeing another woman for eight months despite having a girlfriend was caught red-handed after the scorned women teamed up to confront him in a dramatic fashionmirrorShareCommentsBySophie NorrisRosaleen FentonAudience Writer:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsThe duo hatched an audacious plans just a few days before jetting off \" %, rgba, rgba, url\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your dayInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.SubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Moments after arriving, the pair mutually dumped their shared lover and waltzed off to enjoy the sights of Istanbul. Kristen Bishop said she first learnt something was wrong at the end of March, after Sophie Miller,  got in touch to reveal she was also dating her boyfriend* Adam, , and had been for their entire eight-month relationship. Naturally, she refused to believe it, but Sophie, , reportedly confirmed it by video-calling her while inside Adamaposs apartment. In a bid to get their own back, they planned to confront him in Turkey, where Kristen was set to travel with Adam to Instanbul for eight days. The audacious stunt saw Kristen reveal she knew about the affair just moments after landing on Turkish soil on April nd. Moments later, technical sales manager Sophie appeared - and the pair dumped the cheating Casanova at arrivals, leaving him flabbergasted. Engineer Kristen, from Houston, in Texas, US, said: I found out about him cheating about four days prior to the trip. [Sophie and I] honestly had a phenomenal time. From the moment we met, we instantly connected, over an unfortunate circumstance. We became friends quite quickly after we met up. We had lots of time to get to know each other and develop the friendship that came out of it. We really bonded over the eight-day trip and itaposs by far the happiest thing out of this unfortunate situation, that I found a great friend. There was some shock when it first came about. Any person is going to take some time to process and learn [from this]. Sophie and I are strong people, with strong morals, and weaposre taking this as a lesson learned. A girlsapos trip is infinitely better than trying to travel alone to a foreign country. As soon as she offered to join me, I was  per cent on board. I said aposthis is the start of something great. Letaposs do itapos. Kristen met Adam on Hinge in August  and although the pair planned a holiday together to Turkey, after becoming exclusive. The couple had planned three days admiring the hot air balloons in Cappadocia, before ing to Istanbul to enjoy the bazaars. But just four days before the -hour flight, Kristen received a voicemail out of the blue from Sophie, sharing the truth. Kristen said: Shortly before departing on our trip, I learned that he was not [just] with me and there was another girl who had been in the mix since we met up. She contacted me and left me a voicemail and thataposs how I found out. She left me a short voicemail, to the point, that basically said aposhey, Iaposve just learned about you. Iaposve been dating this person for nine months and I thought youaposd like to know about me. Give me a callyou have any questionsapos. After the initial shock, I gave her a call and we chatted for a bit. It was clear very quickly that she was telling the truth and we needed to talk some more to get to the bottom of what was happening. He met her on the same dating app about one month before he contacted me. He reached out to both of us initially on the app. At first, getting the phone call was a bit shocking and [I was] in disbelief. Sophie was a really good team player about it and at the time I made first contact with her, I was asking questions and she said aposIaposm at his house nowyouaposd like to seeapos. I said aposno, no, heaposs out of town this weekendapos, because thataposs what I believed to be true. She Facetimed me to show me where she was. We decided to get together the next day to piece together what was happening and figure out the real truth. The following day, the pair met up and discussed their relationships, before planning to confront Adam. A couple of hours later, Sophie had booked on the trip and the pair were planning how to tell Adam heaposd been caught out. Kristen said: At that point, because it was so close to the trip, we couldnapost cancel anything fully, so I decided to take the trip anyway and confront him upon arrival in Turkey. From the moment that Sophie and I met, we connected very well. It was obvious she had a good heart, she was a good person, and I was thankful she was coming to me, to tell me what was going on. She was very supportive. I was supportive of her. She decided to leave the relationship, which is a dficult decision to make. I told her I was going to be travelling solo to Turkey. Iaposm not afraid to travel alone, itaposs something Iaposve done before. But she offered to join me so I wouldnapost have to be alone. Once Sophie offered to come on the trip, she booked the tickets a couple of hours later. Sophie planned to come in on a dferent flight than we did. We didnapost want to have him see her on the way there.  She arrived a couple of hours before we did. She was already waiting at the airport when we arrived. We planned not to talk to each other after we got on the plane. I told her Iaposd see her in Istanbul and weaposd touch base as soon as we landed. Once I was at the airport, I had a message from her saying aposhereaposs where Iaposm going to be sittingapos. We touched base in the womenaposs bathroom for a quick moment. We said aposhey, Iaposm here. Hereaposs what Iaposm wearing where you can find meapos. We had a spot picked out where I was going to confront him. In the terminal, Kristen says she confronted her boyfriend, revealing all of his reservations had been changed to Sophieaposs name - and demanded he never contact the pair again. Kristen said: I showed him some photos. One was a photo of me and Sophie, after we met up on that first night. At which point I said aposplease do not contact me again. You have no reservations in Turkeyapos. He askedhe could explain and I showed him some additional photos that Sophie had provided me, which proved that while I believed he was in one location, he was actually with her in another location. His reaction was pretty stunned. He had never been speechless before, until that moment. There were several circumstances like that. It was very firm and I would not be convinced to change our mind on this. I knew the details and it was final.  I told him not to contact me again or follow me out of the airport. At which point I turned around, waved over to Sophie and she walked up. His jaw dropped when he saw her. She reiterated my message, we turned around and walked away together. There was not much commentary on his part. He had already attempted to paint her in a negative light prior to that. He had tried to say theyaposd been broken up. I knew that wasnapost truthful. There wasnapost much opportunity for him to respond. After leaving Adam at the airport, newly single Sophie and Kristen went to a hammam, cruised the Bosphorus River and explored caves. They did end up meeting Adam once again though - after ending up sitting behind him on the flight home. Kristen said: He ended up being on our flight home. Other than that, we have not heard from him. There was a very short-lived attempt to mention something, but we werenapost interested. We were actually sitting behind him on the flight back. Thataposs a -hour flight. We just sat there chatting, giggling and enjoying the flight, and he heard every word. Now Kristen is sharing the warning signs so other women donapost fall victim to cheats. She said: From my perspective, the warning signs were [he was] not willing to integrate or engage. If they can only meet up on one day of the week or arenapost willing to commit to a plan or activity, I think the total lack of communication on those times when he was away is definitely a big sign. When he said he was away for the night, he would mix and match. Typically it was aposI have to workapos. Sometimes it would be aposIaposm going hunting with the boysapos. He was very inflexible. He tried to control the way everything went, on which days weaposd get together and where we would go. Always trust your gut, know your worth and empower other women. Adam was contacted for comment. *Not the ex-boyfriendaposs real name.

But is it really as amazing as we might think it would be - and would we truly be happy ! The answer is yes, according to a single mum who was lucky enough to win just under £ million on the Lotto a few years ago. However, it seems there can be a few downsides to coming into that much money.This is what weaposve learned after the woman anonymously took to Mumsnet to answer questions about winning the lottery - including the first thing she purchased, how she won and whether she has any regrets. She wrote: I won the lottery a few years ago, ask me anything...The post was quickly flooded with comments, with many keen to know whether she had picked her winning numbers or played a lucky dip.The mum claims she won on a lucky dip paper ticket and before that day she had been playing the lottery fairly regularly for over a decade.She goes on to say that sheaposs not usually a lucky person and that she believes it really is luck of the draw. So how did she realise she had won and what was her reaction to finding out  Pretty much what youaposd expect, though she didnapost quit her job on the spot, throw a party or announce it to the world.  She explains: I think I checked my ticket a few days after winning, it was during work because I heard the numbers on the radio and they sounded like the ones on my lucky dip. I then checked online and nearly fell out of my chair! Had to compose myself as still had a full day of work left. Didnapost even call the lotto office until I got home after work. After this she says she told her son the good news and they both went out for a nice dinner to celebrate  Two months later she quit her job and she says itaposs been everything sheaposd hoped it would be and more. Though, she acknowledges that winning wasnapost completely straightforward and there was a lot of complicated admin to deal with after the shock had worn off. Had to open a private bank account, hire financial advisors and accountants, she explained. There is no tax on the amount you win, only interest gained.But thankfully the National Lottery people were very supportive throughout the entire process. Her first purchase after winning was a Mulberry handbag sheaposd always wanted - and she now claims to own  of them. She admits that initially she was a little reckless with the money, buying designer clothing and household items as well as several holiday homesbut has since ed to her baseline of spending and has the majority of the winnings left. But the best thing sheaposs bought so far  Her house. My biggest dream was buying a home. We grew up in a council house and I always rented. I know itaposs not a big thing but it was always my dream, I regularly surfed rightmove looking for my dream home. Itaposs changed my le for the better, she told fellow Mumsnet users - but has it changed her as a person  I donapost think it has, I used to be so much more frugal but Iaposm not as tight as I used to be. You might have to ask my friends though, maybe it has changed me and Iaposm just unaware.  While sheaposs been living happily as a millionaire, she reveals that winning has cost her relationships with certain family members and friends. The mum says she wishes she had never told anyone other than her son about the winnings as it brought out some peopleaposs greedy side. The only thing I would have changed was not telling anyone, she wrote. Iaposve lost contact with some friends but mostly family members. I do not for one second regret winning, I just wish my family members werenapost so greedy and entitled. I would have happily helped many of them with their mortgages and getting them on the property ladder but the way some of them thought I owed them a living was crazy. She adds that she regularly donates money to charities and instead of giving chunks of money away to people she purchases nice gts for loved ones. And while she no longer has a need for a full-time career, she doesnapost just sit around at home doing nothing all day. Instead she uses her time to do volunteer work three to four days a week so as not to die of boredom. But perhaps the most interesting tidbit of all  She confesses that she still continues to play the lottery -the jackpot is over £m.What would be the first thing youaposd do after winning the lottery  Let us know in the comments below.

Spencer started off by explaining that, statistically, more attacks take place in stairwells than they do in lts, soyouaposre ever in doubt over whether to take the lt or the stairs, always opt for the lt. Stop keeping your car keys right at the front door when you enter the house, that is not a good idea Instead, she added. Itaposs a really good idea to keep your car key on your nightstand. If anything happens at night, you can grab your car key, press your panic button and the alarm will go off. Spenceraposs next tip will no doubt come as a surprise to some people, as so many of us go out wearing our hair in a ponytail everyday, however she says we should never wear our hair in a ponytail while out for a run. It is so pathetic for me to say this, but do not wear your hair in a ponytail when you go for a run, it is such an easy thing to grab and pull you onto the floor, the teen explained. Do not overshare on social media. I see so many young girls sharing their locations, telling people theyaposre home alone, just donapost. She went on to say thatyouaposre ever out and about, and get the feeling that someone is following you, you should turn around so they can see your face. A group of rapists interviewed said that the target becomes less attractive to them after theyaposve seen their face, Spencer explained. And, last but not least, she suggested that women and girls should arm themselves with a mini bottle of hairspray, because itaposs legal to carry around and will hurt like s***you spray it in someoneaposs eyes.Will you be implementing any of these safety tips  Let us know in the comments section...

World leaders discussed the theory when they met at the G Summit in Cornwall, amid claims the virus could have been unleashed in an accident at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The UK doesnapost believe the pandemic leaked from a lab in Wuhan, the Foreign Secretary said, but only for now. Dominic Raab said the UKaposs best information remained that it jumped from animals to humans – but admitted they did not have all the answers.US President Joe Biden said of the issue: “I have not reached a conclusion because our intelligence community is not certain yet.  “Whether or not this was a consequence from the marketplace of a bat interfacing with animals… or whether it was an experiment gone awry in a laboratory.” He added: “It’s important to know the answer to that.” In a new interview Dr Zhengli denied the claims that the virus was a man-made disaster. She told the New York Times: My lab has never conducted or cooperated in conducting gain-of- experiments that enhance the virulence of viruses. She said that claims the lab bolstered the virus and kept information about itaposs spread secret were speculation rooted in utter distrust and said: This is no longer a question of science.  She added: Iaposm sure that I did nothing wrong. So I have nothing to fear. In a text message she was reported to have said: I don’t know how the world has come to this, constantly pouring filth on an innocent scientist. She also denied recent reports that three researchers from her institute had sought treatment at a hospital in November  for flu-like symptoms before the first Covid cases were reported. The city was at the centre of the initial outbreak in December . A team of experts from the World Health Organisation and China said in February that the virus was extremely unlikely to have entered the human population as a result of a laboratory-related incident at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.But the WHO has said all hypotheses still remain on the table and wants to carry out a second phase of its work, while US President Joe Biden has ordered an investigation into the origins, including the leak theory.WHO director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who has previously urged China to fully cooperate with investigations, said grieving families should have answers over the theory. He added: The respect these people deserve is knowing what the origin of this disease is.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnWorld Health OrganisationCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"couples incredible diy transformation untouched","story":"NewsCouples incredible DIY transformation of untouched s French mansion into modern homeLilian Gougeon and Valentin Richard planned to renovate the entire house and began the makeover in December .

Lilian Gougeon and Valentin Richard, both , purchased the property in Saint-Omer, Pas-de-Calais, in , paying £, . They planned to renovate the entire house and began the makeover in December . The couple worked on their home for eight months, then took six months off and completed the rest of the renovation during lockdown. Lilian and Valentin completely transformed the space, doing most of the work themselves. The stylish update, which gave the house new colours while retaining its original features, cost the couple just under £,.  The couple said: We were looking for a house with a lot of character and very quickly found this magnicent mansion, which we fell in love with. There was a lot of work to be done to bring it up to date but we still embarked on this renovation project. Our goal was to transform this house into a modern and colourful cocoon. Lilian and Valentin planned the interior themselves, adding small details to each room to get a feel for the aposmoodapos of the space.  As for the work itself, they did most of that too - although got some help for trickier aspects such as electricity, plumbing and window replacements. Starting with the staircase, the couple stripped the plaster off the walls by hand and then removed the tiling on the floor. They added new tiling with an old, rustic effect and painted two of the four walls black, at a total cost of ,. For the kitchen, the couple added wooden furniture purchased from local craftsmen and painted these black to make the pieces stand out against the rustic brick wall.  Lilian and Valentine also installed new lighting fixtures, a kitchen island and several kitchen appliances. The furniture cost £,, while the building material and plumbing came to £,. Next up was the laundry room, where the pair replaced the old flooring and tiles on the walls, and installed plasterboards.  They painted the walls in a green shade and added white furniture to create a fresh and natural ambience to the room, which cost £, in total. Additionally, they added a new bathroom to the mansion, which was previously an office - meaning they had to install a new plumbing system, bringing in local contractors to help. They removed the carpet to expose the parquet floor below and sanded it down to make the flooring look as good as new, before painting the walls white and green.  The bathtub, cabinet and a new toilet were added, along with plant decorations. The couple also upcycled furniture, creating a vanity unit from an old chest of drawers found at a flea market. An existing bathroom hadnapost been touched since the s - but has now seen a complete makeover too, after being thoroughly gutted.  The couple said: We broke everything to redo everything a concrete screed, tiling on the floor and on the walls, the creation of a washbasin cabinet, the installation of a shower and airing. We have chosen a aposspaapos atmosphere in this room with black, ecru and turquoise tones. So far, Lilian and Valentine havenapost done much to their living room and dining room - except paint the walls blue to brighten up the space - but have plans to tackle these in the future.  Over in the three bedrooms, they removed the carpets to expose the original parquet flooring, which they sanded down. Additionally, they added mouldings on the headboards and new wallpaper on the walls. Lilian and Valentine also spent £, on new windows and £, on heating systems.  Lilian said: The most enjoyable part of our renovation was clearly the fact of being able to project oneself. We love creativity a lot and being able to imagine the decoration of a room throws us a lot: colours, furniture, decoration, lights. The result suits us perfectly, it is exactly the type of atmosphere we envisioned when we started our project.  The only downside is the atmosphere in our living room, which does not live up to our expectations and which we will surely have a look at re-doing this the summer. The best advice you can give to someone with a home improvement project is to get started. We didnapost know anything about renovation before we started and we trusted ourselves. You have to trust yourself and you can only be surprised by yourself!

Gosiame Thamara Sithole was believed to have given birth to the seven boys and three girls, who were conceived naturally, through C-section and at  weeks in Pretoria on June . The news and pictures of Gosiame, , spread last week with claims she had broken a world record having given birth to  babies. But now, in a dramatic twist, her partner Tebogo Tsotetsi has reportedly said he has aposnot seen proof the decuplets existapos.  A statement from his family says they have therefore concluded there are no decuplets born between Tebogo Tsotetsi and Gosiame Sithole until proven otherwise. Worries are also mounting over the whereabouts of Gosiame with a missing persons case opened, according to reports.The statement from the Tsotetsi family, reported by News , read: Hemade several attempts to visit his girlfriend and the babies but she has failed to disclose her whereabouts and the condition of their babies.The current uncertainties and public discourse about the decuplets is of major concern to the family, especially in the absence of any proof of the decuplets existence other than telephonic and WhatsApp messages from the mother. The family has resolved and concluded that there are no decuplets born between Tebogo Tsotetsi and Gosiame Sithole, until proven otherwise and wishes to apologise for any inconvenience and embarrassment. Government officials had previously said they could find no evidence of a woman giving birth to  children. Tebogo Tsotetsi had informed local outlets including Pretoria News about the decuplets based on information he had received from his girlfriend, according to reports. Spokesperson for the family Russell Baloyi told Times Live: We realised that as messy as the situation was for the country, given the conflicting statements that have been coming out, it’s about time we put this thing to rest and work on the facts. The whereabouts of the mother are still unknown. In terms of the pregnancy, the reality of it was that the mother was pregnant.

development body is “past its sell by date” and should be scrapped, a St Andrews academic claims.Professor Ross Brown believes Scottish Enterprise is “past its sell by date” and needs overhauled.He believes it should be replaced with new institutions focused on entrepreneurship.Mr Brown also suggests the abolition of the First Minister’s council of economic advisers.Instead, he would like to see successful entrepreneurs and investors involved in a National Entrepreneurship Council.Representatives of financial institutions and entrepreneurship policy experts should also be involved, he said.Mr Brown said of Scottish Enterprise: “The mainstay of the business giving out grants to businesses I don’t think has been very effective.#I think the business community would probably echo that sentiment.#The paper, for Reform Scotland, also claims Scotland has an “uneasy relationship” with entrepreneurialism.He points to “strategic and sophisticated” interventions by the Israeli government for developing their business sector.Mr Brown said: “Israel is an interesting one.  There are lessons we can learn.“Some of their public policies have been very effective at developing the entrepreneurship in that country.”mdash reformscotlandJune , Mr Brown also wants to see women, immigrants and people with disabilities targeted to unlock their entrepreneurial power.“Immigrants are much more likely to produce new businesses,# he said.“Having a more inclusive immigration policy could be of benefit for Scotland.#Mr Brown also believes thatScotland were to gain independence, re-joining the European Union could be crucial.Businesses may look to move from where in the UK to set up base in Scotland to allow them access to the EU market.He said: #That could give Scotland an extra benefit that companies may relocate here from other parts of the UK.#He said Scotland will need to #embrace a revolution in entrepreneurialism#it is to thrive as independent country.That will be particularly important as the country looks to find its feet during the Covid pandemic recovery, Mr Brown said.Reform Scotland director Chris Deerin said Mr Brown#s proposals were for a #revolution# in the way Scotland supports its entrepreneurs.“These are the people that can make the dference for Scotland, that create the jobs and pay the taxes that support our public services.#They deserve better support.#Our political culture needs to grow up and start appreciating the vital importance of the private sector.#Mr Brown called on the Scottish Government to #lay the foundation# to help entrepreneurs.Scottish Government business minister Ivan McKee said: “Since , the agency has invested over £ million in early stage businesses and that has helped promote £. billion of investments.“Scotland is now one of the most active areas in the UK for venture-backed firms.“As the national development agency, Scottish Enterprise is responsible for delivering a signicant, lasting effect on the Scottish economy, working with partners in the public and private sectors.#He said support for entrepreneurs, start-ups and spin-outs remained #a key element# of Scottish Enterprise#s work.The business minister adds: #It is making entrepreneurship more inclusive and widening participation from under-represented groups like women and young people.“This is helping enable the economy’s sustainable recovery.”Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE

opportunities to open new stores across the country.”Earlier this year, Aldi formally lodged proposals to build its fourth Aberdeen store, a ,sq ft shop at the junction of the city’s Wellington Road

However, there now seems to be an acceptance in Transport Scotland that a new solution has to be found.In a letter to the press, George Allan points out that the -mile route from Strathlachlan to Colintraive and the eight miles between Ormidale and Tighnabruaich were designed and constructed in  or  years.I was a member of the survey and design team on these routes. I was also involved in the construction of  miles of the A between Perth and Inverness in  years. These civil engineering schemes demonstrate what can be achieved when there is real political will and commitment to prioritise projects.I realise Transport Scotland has its own procedures for appointing consultants for the design processes and there are detailed environmental impact assessments to be done. It does, however, seem to me that its programming of the Rest and be Thankful improvement is completely lacking in ambition.As a former director of roads and transport in Highland, perhaps I may be permitted to comment on the long-term solution.I would saythere are no geological features found on the other side of the glen which will cause a repeat of current problems, then the construction of a new road in ersion would cause less disruption to traffic than trying to form landslip shelters or tunnels adjacent to the existing carriageway.The main thing though is for Transport Scotland and their political masters to just get on with it.Philip Shimmin, Inverness.Sir,I would like to say thank you to all the lads who have been working at the Crinan Canal # often when the north winds were blowing and water was pouring down from the hills into the empty canal more quickly than the pumps were able to remove it.The men greeted me each morning as I walked past to go over the temporary bridge. They were trying to renew the basement concrete which supports the new bridges in spite of the wet, cold weather.Fortunately, April was drier and they managed to fit the new gates thanks to the massive cranes and the skill of the lorry drivers carrying these heavy loads to and from the canal.Others have cleared the rubbish, including lots of old car tyres, which had been dumped.It is good to see the canal filled and in working order again.J Thorgrimsson, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters a unique holiday destination","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowHave you ever thought of holidaying on the moon No Covid- up there, and apparently some space tourism start-ups will be offering moon trips from around , so not long to wait.Butyou’re intent on actually landing on the moon’s surface then there are several major problems: it has little gravity, no oxygen, no water and no food. But never mind, Chinese astronauts, who regard a moon base as essential for probing outer space, have just about solved these problems with a bioregenerative le support system called Yuegong-, or Lunar Palace  . LP is a temperature and humidity-controlled, sealed, articial human-animal-plant-microorganism ecosystem in which oxygen, water and food sources are recycled to create an Earth-like environment. The latest experiment had LP in use continuously for a whole year, with two crews of four each having two periods of occupation and the maximum stay being  days. All emerged fit and healthy.LP comprises a living area, two cabins for growing plants , an animal-raising room housing yellow mealworms and waste treatment and storage rooms.Crew requirements # food, water, oxygen and waste disposal # are accommodated as follows: plants and mealworms provide food, the latter being processed into ‘flour’ for bread.Plant photosynthesis provides oxygen and consumes CO, while puried water from plant transpiration and condensation provides drinking and washing water.Nitrogen puried from crew urine generates plant fertiliser, while the remaining urine is puried along with waste water for plant irrigation.Crew faeces mixed with straw are fermented by bacteria to produce CO for plant photosynthesis, while fermented vegetable waste is fed to the mealworms. The whole system achieved  per cent recycling, the only non-recyclable product requiring storage being solid waste from fermented faeces.All this represents huge progress, but we are not there yet. Running LP requires massive energy input, particularly since lunar days and nights each last an Earth month, and the nights are freezing.But still, I have read of plans to build kilometre-high lunar towers bearing solar  , possible because of the moon’s zero gravity, but don’t hold your breath!* https:doi.org . ...# arxiv.org abs ."},{"url":null,"title":"crinan the backdrop for students hard work","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowAs settings for end-of-year art exhibitions go, you could do a lot worse than Crinan.A group of five HND students at Argyll College UHI were faced with the prospect of having no such climax to their hard work, with the college and other indoor venues out of bounds due to Covid restrictions.Undeterred, the group # Clare McCartan, Mo Clerk, Erine Fyfe, Pat Madej and Suzi Thomson # decided instead to head for the great outdoors and the stunning location of the Crinan basin, a perfect backdrop.Though intended as a digital experience and not open to the public, this failed to stop a number of curious onlookers visiting throughout the exhibition on May .The Contemporary Art Practice HND classmates are all keen to continue with their studies through to degree level, but the artwork on show was selected from this year#s coursework, tackling subjects such as climate change, domestic abuse, observational drawing, mixed media, printing and ceramics."},{"url":null,"title":"star return to action with away win","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Lochgilphead Red Star travelled to Station Park, Cardross last Saturday to play their first competive match since February last year in the rearranged Jimmy Marshall Cup group stage.In an understandably tense opening  minutes, both sides looked slightly nervous as the teams got to grips with the game after the long lay-off.

But they’re not complaining. This is what the Scottish public ask of them, to save and improve lives, wherever the need arises, and they fulfil their role with courage and pride.Our exemplary performance during this national crisis has been a tribute to how far SCAA has come in just eight years and I am immensely proud of what the SCAA team has achieved.But our operational teams are acutely aware we are only able to provide this critical service thanks to the continued public donations which you have maintained throughout these dficult times.

As the report notes, the majority of adult mental health problems begin in childhood with  per cent of mental health problems established by age .This is a reason why my party will continue to push for  per cent of the health budget in Scotland to be spent directly on tackling mental health issues.Although NHS Highland’s waiting time track record is better than the Scottish average, with . per cent people seen within  weeks, that is still well below the Scottish Government#s own target of at least  per cent of patients being seen within that timeframe.It has never been more important to ensure that young people receive the help they need, when they need it. Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,The Scottish SPCA is pledging  miles to Keep Scotland Beautul’s Summer Clean.Keep Scotland Beautul is asking people to pledge time to pick up litter over the campaign from May  until June  where one hour equals three miles.Staff members across the society will be taking part in the Paws on Plastic initiative, alongside Keep Scotland Beautul’s campaign, encouraging people to pick up at least two pieces of litter per dog walk.Scotland’s animal welfare charity received  calls to its helpline about animals affected by litter from January to May.That’s almost two incidents every day and a similar figure to the same period in  when there were  accounts.We see first-hand the devastating consequences litter can have on animals. Seals and birds get caught up in fishing line or wire or animals can ingest small pieces of rubbish and choke or die.The sad thing is that these injuries and deaths are entirely avoidablepeople just disposed of their rubbish responsibly.We are proud to be making a dference by taking part in Paws on Plastic for the Keep Scotland Beautul’s Summer Clean.The Scottish SPCA is dedicated to improving the lives of animals through protecting environments and habitats to ensure Scotland’s wildle can thrive for years to come.Picking up litter will help people respect their environment and protect animals from the dangers of litter.No matter how small, it has the potential to be hazardous or lethal to pets, wildle and farm animals.The public should exercise caution and be careful when picking up litter and we ask that children taking part be accompanied by a responsible adult.We recommend picking up litter with a dog bag or litter picker to avoid direct contact with any litter and do not pick up anything that could be harmful like glass or sharp objects.Any syringes found should not be picked up but reported to the local authority emergency waste uplt informing them of the location of the syringe.Anything that can be done to protect animals is so appreciated and it will have a wonderful effect on the local community too.Mike Flynn, Scottish SPCA chief superintendentSir,It was disappointing to find one of the new Tory MSPs has written to the UK Foreign Office questioning Scotland’s international presence.I call it disappointing as even before devolution in  Scotland had a Brussels office, which was established under these same Tories. This presence was developed under Labour and the Liberal Democrats and has been continued since  by the SNP.Now there is a network of offices around the world that promotes Scotland, its economy and tourism.Scotland House in Brussels, for example, acts as the eyes and ears of the Scottish Government, Scotland Europa, Scottish Enterprise and Scottish Development International.It is an effective  to manage diplomatic engagement, economic engagement and cultural promotion.Scotland is one of more than  regional and sub-state authorities, including  from Germany,  from Italy and  from Poland.And non-EU states like Norway are also represented by six regional offices.Indeed, Scotland has a smaller international presence than many sub-states such as Baia, Flanders and Quebec.In addition, Denmark and Belgium give the Faroes, Greenland and Flanders officials parity of esteem, and work together with central government, recognising the important role they play.While everyone  is doing their best to promote themselves, it is bizarre, but maybe not unexpected, for the Tories to try to undermine Scotland’s ability to do so.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,I  got my first Covid- vaccine dose on Saturday June .A huge thanks to all of our hard-working NHS staff involved. I would encourage everyone to get vaccinated when they are offered an appointment.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 11 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowWe have three photographs to feature in this week#s edition.PIC:This atmospheric photograph was submitted by Avril Lockhart, showing poppies as the sun sets over the Crinan Canal at Cairnbaan. no_aYourPictures_AvrilLockhartPIC:Colin Barr always has his drone ready for a good photo, and this one certainly fits the bill.

Hospitalisations are double what they were in early May, meaning people were being discharged more quickly and spending less time requiring treatment than the earlier stages of the pandemic, she said.Level zero allows more people to meet inside their homes, including overnight, and permits greater number of people from dferent households to gather indoors in places such as cafes, pubs and restaurants.Level zero also allows greater numbers of people to attend weddings and would also herald the start of a #limited and phased # to office work, although people will be encouraged to work from home where possible."},{"url":null,"title":"the search is on for incredible businesswomen","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowThe search is on for the country#s most talented and dedicated female entrepreneurs.As part of the  National Business Women#s Awards, the Lockdown Leader and Business Chameleon categories will feature for a second time following their success in .These two categories recognise and celebrate those who have thrived and blossomed during the coronavirus crisis.From providing job security and strong, decisive leadership to a team to completely adapting a business service or product to meet a new need.Incredible, high-achieving women in business and industry have until Thursday August  to enter the awards.They recognise successful women who not only run outstanding businesses but in many cases also juggle the needs of their families as they work.Each candidate can enter up to three categories, at a cost of £ plus VAT per entry.

fever sufferers around the UK are in for a tough few months - and this summer could be tougher than most as experts warn about incoming high levels of pollen.The high pollen levels could make allergy symptoms unbearable for millions of sufferers as grass pollen is the most common hay fever allergy, affecting  per cent of sufferers.High levels of pollenThe Met Office has issued a warning in its pollen forecast, with much of the UK predicted to suffer from ldquovery high levels.The upper end of Scotland, including Ornkey and Shetland, Highlands and Grampian, have managed to get away with low levels of pollen, however the further down you move in the UK, the higher the levels get.The Lothians, Strathclyde and Fe areas are slated for medium pollen levels, as is Northern Ireland, but the majority of England is set for ldquovery high levels of pollen.The Met Office explains that the ldquopollen count monitoring network combines Met Office weather data with expertise from organisations such as the National Pollen and Aerobiological Unit to produce pollen forecasts for  days ahead across the whole of the UK.How do I knowI have hay fever The NHS website lists the symptoms of hay fever as the following:Sneezing and coughingA runny or blocked noseItchy, red or watery eyesItchy throat, mouth, nose and earsLoss of smellPain around your temples and foreheadHeadacheEaracheFeeling tiredIt also claries that these symptoms will last weeks or months, making it easier to dferentiate between allergies and a common cold which only lasts a week or so.Asthma sufferers may also experience a tight feeling in their chest, shortness of breath, wheezing and coughing.Symptoms of hay fever can last for weeks or months, according to the NHS, unlike a cold which usually goes away after around one or two weeks.How do symptoms dfer to coronavirus Some people have mistakenly confused symptoms of hay fever for coronavirus, as there are a number of similarities.However, while signs of hay fever include sneezing and a cough, much like coronavirus, the main dference is that it does not usually cause a high fever.Hay fever sufferers also generally do not feel too unwell with it, unlike with coronavirus.People who do suffer with hay fever are advised to compare their symptoms to what they have experienced in previous yearsthey are concerned.How can I relieve hay fever symptoms There is currently no cure for hay fever, but there are a number of remedies you can try to relieve symptoms when the pollen count is high.The NHS website issues the following advice for avoiding the brunt of hay fever symptoms when the pollen count is high:Put Vaseline around your nostrils to trap pollenWear wraparound sunglasses to stop pollen getting into your eyesShower and change your clothes after you have been outside to wash pollen offStay indoors whenever possibleKeep windows and doors shut as much as possibleVacuum regularly and dust with a damp clothBuy a pollen filter for the air vents in

But our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.The uncertainty during the Covid lockdown over access to basic shopping and medication, a lack of information in accessible formats, the social isolation, the barriers to being guided because of social distancing # these have all added to and compounded the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.But we want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.To contact the Need to Talk service, phone the RNIB Helpline on    or email needtotalk@rnib.org.uk"},{"url":null,"title":"leader may 28 2021","story":"It is amazing the opportunities that can arise from a simple Tweet.When Dalintober Primary School additional support needs assistant Mairi Campbell tagged Judy Murray in a Tweet about the school#s tennis work, she probably did not expect the coaching ace to offer to come and visit the pupils.The aim of Judy#s foundation is to improve access to tennis opportunities across Scotland, taking the sport to rural and disadvantaged areas.We are lucky here in Kintyre to have a brilliant tennis club, with some fantastic, experienced coaches, and inspirational schools which promote the sport, but we are remote, meaning visits from people like Judy are not always easy to arrange.A coaching session with the mother of two of the country#s best tennis players could be enough to encourage Dalintober#s young sports fans to stick in and hone their skills.A simple Tweet could lead to the creation of the future stars of Scottish tennis – let#s keep an eye out for Campbeltown names appearing on the scoreboards at Wimbledon!"},{"url":null,"title":"letters may 28 2021","story":"On May , you printed a letter from Ian Mitchell in which he claimed he did not receive any reply to an email he had sent me asking questions about Liberal Democrat policies.I replied to Mr Mitchell three hours and  minutes after receiving his email. Mr Mitchell acknowledged receipt of these answers.I was alarmed and saddened by the headline #Failing# school is #betraying# pupils and the community# in last week#s Courier.Coming from a retired Campbeltown Grammar Schoolteacher, it is hard to believe that someone who has worked in the profession could have such criticism for his her fellow colleagues.Although clearly passionate about the future of CGS, perhaps retirement has helped this inidual forget what a challenging job all school staff face.It is commonly known that CGS has not had its troubles to seek in recent years with major staff shortages due to ill health and other unforeseen circumstances.The league tables do not make good reading but, on their own, I don#t think they reflect the efforts of the staff.It is a well known fact that you can take a horse to water but you cannot make it drink. Is the behaviour of pupils the greatest barrier to success Despite the efforts of teachers to discipline the pupils, there are few deterrents for the offenders, especially where the pupil is aware that,they ask, the parent will fight their corner instead of backing the school.The responsibility of teaching our children to behave and respect others needs to be instilled from early years by us all and not just when the child reaches CGS.Maybe the retired teacher should offer his her skills and visit CGS and see the problems that all staff are facing It is time for the community to pull together and support our school and encourage our children to believe that a good education is very achievable in CGS.Recently, an investigation by the Herald newspaper uncovered that #just over half of Scotland#s leline ferry network is operating outwith its working le expectancy#, with  vessels out of  in operation over  years old.Despite the huge challenges created by the Covid- pandemic that our hard-working ferry crews have to deal with,  residents rightly expect a high quality ferry service that runs on time and has enough space to ensure they can travel to and from the islands, businesses can transport goods to the mainland and tourists can visit our islands to boost the economy.Unfortunately, cancellations and delays continue to plague routes. I have been working closely with residents, our community councils and other parties to find long-term solutions.This pressing matter simply can#t be left on the backburner.The  National Lottery Awards are now open for entries.Once again, the annual search for the UK#s favourite National Lottery-funded people and projects will recognise those iniduals and organisations who have made an extraordinary impact in their community – especially during these unprecedent times.National Lottery players raise £ million every week for good causes and we know this money is being used in amazing and inspiring ways.As part of The National Lottery Awards, we want to celebrate those whose selfless dedication and fantastic work makes such a dference in villages, towns and cities across the country.Encompassing all areas of National Lottery funding, you nominate local legends and hometown heroes in the following categories: culture, arts and film, community charity, heritage and sport.In addition, there will be a young hero award for someone under the age of .Groups or organisations are eligible to enter The National Lottery Project of the Year category, where shortlisted finalists will face a public vote later in the year.All award winners will receive an iconic National Lottery Awards trophy and £, for their organisation.Nominations can be made by completing an entry form on our website at www.lotterygoodcauses.org.uk awards.All nominees must have been funded by The National Lottery or be associated with a National Lottery funded project. Entries must be received by midnight on June .Now, as we approach summer with hopefully fewer restrictions, we can start to make plans about how we will spend time with family and friends.Following the challenging year we have experienced, we could all do with a bit more play in our lives. Play is a hugely important part of childhood and has a whole host of benefits, including improving physical and mental health and wellbeing.Throughout this pandemic, children have had to deal with so many dficult challenges some having to stay in unsafe homes and many living with families who are struggling with health worries and financial issues.Children have told Childline that they have struggled to cope and their mental health has suffered as a result.It doesn#t matter how people choose to play this Childhood Day , whether it#s organising a sponsored kickabout in the park, a game of cards, a musical get-together or an online gaming tournament, we just want as many as possible playing and raising money to help us keep children safe.We look forward to hearing how your readers plan to support the NSPCC and children across Scotland this Childhood Day.To find out more and download a fundraising pack, visit www.nspcc.org.uk childhoodday or search online for NSPCC Childhood Day."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week may 28 2021","story":"This was one of the questions explored last Sunday at our Springbank Evangelical Church meeting in Campbeltown.It was enlightening and interesting to listen to a iety of responses.One member of the congregation admitted that she had sympathy for the disciple Thomas and identied with his reaction to the news that, after three days, Jesus had risen from the tomb.The Bible tells us that Thomas said: #Unless I see the scars of the nails in his hands and put my finger on those scars and my hand in his side, I will not believe.# A week later, when Jesus appeared to Thomas and showed him his wounds, He imparted a deep and signicant lesson to us all, as he uttered a short, challenging sentence: #How happy are those who believe without seeing me.#Poor Thomas. Did he feel embarrassed in front of his friends who did not share his doubts, did he feel ashamed that his faith had not remained resolute or was he able to put those feelings aside and share the joy of the risen Lord We do know that Thomas responded with the words: #My Lord and my God.#More than two thousand years later, we may feel embarrassedour faith falters and doubts set in.However, we should focus on the happiness of which Jesus speaks.Have the strength and hope to echo the words of Thomas: #My Lord and my God.#Do not beat yourself up for doubting – have the strength to believe."},{"url":null,"title":"close scoring in machrihanishs may am am","story":"The sun shone throughout the day as  teams participated in the recent competition sponsored by Springbank Distillery and Kintyre Hire.An early score of  from Andrew Wallace, Andrew McCallum, Mitch Graham and Michael McKinlay proved too hard to beat although second place came close with a score of , with third, fourth and fth level on .A club spokesperson said: #Thank you to all of the hole sponsors for their generous donations.

I worked out of K Division in Paisley.#As well as policing the Rabies Act, animal cruelty acts and so on, the job included licensing animal movements, attending markets, keeping records of sheep dippings, checking farmers# animal movement records and even the disposal by burning of diseased farm animals and the occasional reports to the procurator fiscal in serious cases.#The compulsory sheep dipping programme has been completed for another year and whilst rumour in the farming industry has it there will be no more compulsory dipping, we will have to wait for confirmation or otherwise.On reflection, I recall a dipping incident of about  years ago, when an elderly hermit-type Ayrshire farmer had flatly refused to comply with the dipping regulations.For two years he had complained that his sheep did not have #scab# disease and that he should not be compelled to dip them, but each year after gentlepressure he had complied.This third year, however, he declared that he would not purchase sheep dip insecticide and would most definitely not make any effort to dip his sheep and, by the expiry date of the compulsory period, he hadn#t.A conference of DOAFS animal health vets and Strathclyde Police animal health inspectors decided action was required to reduce any sheep scab disease risk by carrying out the dipping themselves.Consequently, on a bright morning in late November, three hardy iniduals – one ministry vet and two police animal health inspectors – arrived at Old Alex#s farm to #swim# his sheep.After half an hour donning protective clothing and reconnoitering the layout of the dipper, sheep pens, gates, fields, sheep, etc, the #shepherds# became aware of mutterings in the background.This was our unfriendly farmer Alex. Again, the reasons for our presence were fully explained to Alex but he continued to claim that his sheep did not require dipping, and assured us that no assistance would be forthcoming from himself.He also appeared to have uncovered some facts on the parentage of all three officials!The dipper was full of last year#s – or maybe the year before#s – stagnant, foul-smelling, slimy, liquid-like substance and had to be emptied and refilled with fresh clean water.Our only source of water was an old well from which the water was raised by means of an antiquated pump, operated by a removable, antiquated, heavy, cast-iron pump handle.We located this handle and found that it operated the pump most effectively when #elbow grease# was used with it.At this stage, we made our major error! It is a big mistake not to recognise the opposition, but a gross miscalculation to underestimate him – and we suffered for that.Alex surreptitiously removed and secreted the #handle# and it was some minutes before we realised it had gone and some further time elapsed before we were fully aware of the truth of his muttered, #Ye#re no gaun tae dip ma sheep!#"},{"url":null,"title":"leader june 4 2021","story":"Shopper-Aide#s volunteers have received a just reward in the form of the Queen#s Award for Voluntary Service.So many people would be lost without the charity#s staff and volunteers who not only help with practical things like shopping, cleaning and transferring clients to appointments but are there on a personal level.They offer a listening ear through the #phone buddy# initiative and provide company through the ious social activities which Shopper-Aide organises under normal circumstances.The last year in particular makes us wonder how we managed before Shopper-Aide or what we would do without it.

What a lovely surprise to see how good the town centre is looking.There are so many independent shops and they all have something interesting to offer.I was so pleased to see how the shopfronts have all been painted and look so well-kept.Congratulations to everyone who has made this possible. You have done a wonderful job.Kintyre is beautul and the town centre has caught up with it.I think it is an over-simplication to point the finger at Campbeltown Grammar Schoolas being a possible reason for people not wanting to move to Campbeltown.As I am sure you are aware, there were no national exams last year, and grades were based on teachers# assessments. One might wonder how it could be that CGS dropped roughly  places in the league table, while Lochgilphead High School suddenly jumped  places.How did the processes compare between the two schools, and how could that have been possible  The issue certainly bears looking into.In addition, it seems like the Courier and local politicians are awfully quick to blame the school and teachers, while ignoring aspects such as local culture, where education sometimes seems to be less valued, where many children seem to be just biding their time until they can leave at  and work on the farm or on the fishing boat or in the local Tesco, what have you.Roughly  to  per cent of CGS pupils leave for a #positive destination#, but for about a third of those, that destination is employment, rather than higher education or further training.Pupils who have no intention of seeking higher or further education are not motivated to engage in or work towards higher qualications.Teachers cannot force students to take higher classes and higher exams, cannot force students to engage with learning, cannot force parents to engage and to encourage their children to engage academically.As an example, in the follow-up inspection report last year, the report stated: #Staff continue to make improvements to the curriculum in the broad general educationfrom S to S.#The school has increased the range of learner pathways and qualications that young people can choose in the senior phase. Young people in S to S can now take six courses instead of five.#Young people can choose from a range of Skills for Work programmes, and Foundation Apprenticeships provided by Argyll College and the Argyll and Bute Learning and Development Team, but uptake has been limited.#As the old saying goes, you can lead a horse to water#The situation is much more complex than is being presented in your paper and where and this does a disservice to the school, teachers and school management, and by extension to pupils, parents and the community, by simply assuming that the drop in the league table is due solely to a #failing# school.The publication in the Courier on Friday May  with regards the position of Campbeltown Grammar Schoolwithin the league tables came for me as a sigh of relief that somebody  was on the same page.We cannot defend where CGS sits within the factual results, it#s the result of a lack of hard work from pupils and staff, and the influence from parents.The Scottish Government publishes an annual breakdown of pupils# attainment for which we have poor results and require inspectorate visits.The league table cannot be defended but acknowledged. Leadership of the school and particularly the council would benefit morethey actually illustrated #yes, there is a problem# and we can fix it.  Perhaps benchmark with a preforming school close by.Defending the situation with alternative measures that are perhaps encouraging for certain iniduals is not the way forward.As a parent who wishes to have the option to allow their child to choose further education, we need to start getting the grades to grant entrance.The results are a summary of many years of learning and not simply the year the child was assessed.All years should be considered important, particularly the early years, so that they can achieve highly with determination and effort.There is an enormous amount of pressure at home to find alternative methods via tutors for homework and purchasing of materials due to non-provisions within the school.S to S should be receiving homework in academic subjects and getting it marked in order to improve study skills.For the last three years I have been campaigning within the parent council to ban mobile phones within the school. It has been proved in other Scottish schools that this ban gives best results.Education leaders should be considering a change in policy across all Scottish state schools. Teachers will face fierce resistance in the classroom, however, should we not be acting in their best interests There would be focus on study, better communication and behaviour issues would disappear.How welcome would it be to see pupils chatting and laughing with each other instead of heads down scrolling through screens Covid has clearly had an impact on education this year but every school is in the same boat.Everybody is experiencing a global pandemic, but some like to treat it as wrong Covid and not long Covid.I have been contacted by many of my constituents from across Islay about the ongoing littering problem at Donald Caskie Square in Bowmore.Unfortunately this matter has been dragging on for months now and I have discussed this atwith Islay Community Council, council colleagues,  businesses and the head teacher of Islay High School.It#s clear to me that patience is running out and that something needs to be done.If police had a presence in the square, particularly over the lunch time period, this would help to prevent a lot of the littering that has been taking place.I have also been getting complaints about Morrison Court in Bowmore.It goes without saying that this is a minority of people who are not bothering to use the nearby bins but sadly this is something that affects everyone.A litter-strewn location looks dirty and unsightly, making it a less pleasant environment for those who live in or use it.This irresponsible behaviour should not be tolerated.As we approach summer with hopefully fewer restrictions, we can start to make plans about how we will spend time with family and friends.Following the challenging year we have experienced we could all do with a bit more play in our lives.Play is a hugely important part of childhood and has a whole host of benefits, including improving physical and mental health and wellbeing.Throughout this pandemic, children have had to deal with so many dficult challenges some having to stay in unsafe homes and many living with families who are struggling with health worries and financial issues.Children have told Childline that they have struggled to cope and their mental health has suffered as a result.It doesn#t matter how people choose to play this Childhood Day , whether it#s organising a sponsored kickabout in the park, a game of cards, a musical get-together or an online gaming tournament, we just want as many as possible playing and raising money to help us keep children safe.We look forward to hearing how your readers plan to support the NSPCC and children across Scotland this Childhood Day.To find out more and download a fundraising pack, visit www.nspcc.org.uk childhoodday or search online for NSPCC Childhood Day."},{"url":null,"title":"members compete for medals at glenralloch","story":"Sheena Ferguson took the honours in the ladies# event with  followed by Georgie Dickson on  and Angela Vernel on  .In the gents# section, it was Chris McArthur who romped in with a nett  to leave the rest of the field trailing in his wake.The usual suspects were next Bruce McLean on  and Peter McLean jnr on .Tomorrow , the Harbour Gallery gents# open takes place when locals and visitors will gather for the coveted event.The club is forever grateful to Stuart Herd for his continued support.Impressive youngster Connor McCrae headed to Glenbervie Golf Club last Sunday for his first stroke play event in the Stephen Gallacher Foundation event.A delighted Connor took third place with , only one shot behind the winner on .

Some had an estimated three years# growth of wool on their backs and with such an extra weight – possibly  plus lbs – to carry, were hardly able to walk.One aged tup had to be helped through a muddy patch in the field as at each step, he became bogged down and was too weak and emaciated to lt his feet out of the mud.Alex witnessed the tup being assisted and bawled out: #Cruelty! I am going to phone the polis to come.#That was good news because more help would have been useful.Whilst the #shepherds# were intent in gathering the  sheep from an outlying field prior to driving them into a smaller field closer to the dipper, Alex was seen approaching the gate.Good, we thought, he#s beginning to see sense and coming back to help us gather the sheep.It transpired, however, that such a helpful thought was not uppermost in Alex#s mind.He stopped at the gate the sheep were about to be driven through and closed it before running off towards the farm.The ministry man was closest to the closed gate and, as he opened it and looked towards the farm, he saw that Alex had reached the dipping pens for holding the sheep and was attacking the pens with a hammer, in an attempt to destroy them.The ministry man went towards Alex who, having destroyed one pillar, retreated towards his house, uplting the bucket and two packets of sheep dip en route.The ministry man was in hot pursuit. #Here Alex, that#s not your property, you are stealing DOAFS property!#Alex stopped and considered, then lted one packet from the bucket and threw it at the official who, with great skill and agility, managed to catch the packet and prevented its landing in the thick mud.The second packet came through the air and, with a skill normally seen only in test cricket, it was also held.Now, supremely confident, the ministry man shouted as Alex made off: #Now our bucket!#Alex also appeared to possess some cricketing skills and this was his best throw. A slow motion movie camera would make a better job of recording this piece of action but the outcome was that the bucket, after an irregular journey through the air, made good contact with the ministry man who, now badly off balance, fell headlong face-down into the wet, oozing mud.He did not appear overjoyed as he slowly resumed the upright position with some mud sliding off him."},{"url":null,"title":"from our files june 11 2021","story":"History was made last week when a Campbeltonian sailed the biggest Caledonian MacBrayne ship to visit the town into the port.David Allen brought MV Isle of Arran to dock at the ferry terminal in Campbeltown and said it was the first time he has been able to walk to work since he started with CalMac  years ago.What made this journey more signicant is that normally ships over  metres need to have a pilot to bring a ship in.At  metres in , Harbour Master Stephen Scally was confident David could do the job himself.The ship normally covers the Kennacraig to Islay route and is in Campbeltown on standby.She is due to stay in the harbour until June  unless called away before then.

The society refused to pay the wages of band members who would have lost a day#s work through being present at the show.The band, of course, was always a popular attraction on the show day.Band secretary Mr William McCallum, a local butcher, said yesterday that the society felt that the wage bill was too high.It is understood that the society would have to pay the band in the region of £ to cover the pipers# and drummers# expenses.Added Mr McCallum: #The band never made any profit from the show, only enough to pay the members# wages.#The society#s president, Mr Robert Millar, of Auchaleek Farm, said that the band#s performance last year was not satisfactory at the show because they only played a few tunes.Mr Millar said that last year the band played quite a selection on the way to the show ground from the steamer, but this was not the responsibility of the society.He said that at a meeting of the society directors recently, a unanimous decision not to invite the band to the show was arrived at.He added that the band always received free luncheons and free drink on the day of the show.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOEditor#s note: The following article contains Latin abbreviations no longer in common use: viz, videlicet, meaning #that is to say# and inst, instante mense, referring to the current month.The annual live stock show of the Kintyre Agricultural Society, held in the Showfield, Castleacres, on Friday third inst. proved eminently successful, and in respect of drawings and attendance provided an agreeable surprise to the directors, who were prepared, looking to the unprecedented conditions prevailing in connection with transport facilities to and from the town, for a decided drop in the gate drawings.To the happy result which crowned the proceedings of the day there were two main contributing factors, viz., a particularly fine entry in all sections of the show and lively competition in several classes which attracted uncommon interest amongst the general public and, secondly, weather conditions of a kind that could not have been bettered for an open air event.The day was one of glorious sunshine, and the attraction of the showfield was one that must have been almost irresistible to anyone having even the slightest interest in the great annual agricultural event of the Kintyre peninsula.Many people travelled far to attend the show. There was a great influx of motorcars to the town and, by good fortune, the Campbeltown and Glasgow Steamboat Company were able to arrange sailings which proved of great convenience to many, especially judges and dealers, who were able to travel by sea on the inward journey on Thursday andon Saturday morning.The judging rings were surrounded by eager and interested crowds from the early forenoon, and the keenness displayed in all the events never showed any sign of waning although the time table fell considerably behind towards the afternoon owing to the very big entries in the Clydesdale classes and the unormly good quality of the stock."},{"url":null,"title":"leader june 11 2021","story":"David MacPherson#s Ben Nevis challenge was an incredible achievement.It was inspirational, demonstrating what can be achieved with the right equipment and attitude.After months of preparations, it must have been devastating for the team when part of the wheelchair broke.However, their quick-thinking in repairing the hinge with bits and pieces they had with them saved the day.But safety has to come first and the team made the right decision not to continue to the topthere were any doubts about the makesht repair being able to handle the challenging final section.David senior told the Courier that he didn#t think it would be possible to even get as far as they did.One comment a supporter made of the team#s ascent and the subsequent repair on the Joëlette summed up the situation very well: #It says a great deal about the strength and resilience of the team that the Joëlette broke before they did!#Well done to all those who helped David live his dreams."},{"url":null,"title":"letters june 11 2021","story":"Having waited five weeks for the delayed start of our ferry to Ardrossan, I was excited to plan a trip out of Kintyre.Since the new timetable has all sailings stopping in Brodick, allowing only four hours in Glasgow, I decided on a trip to Arran.However the price for this is off-putting. Campbeltown to Brodick – a distance of . miles – for a carjourney is £., only marginally cheaper than thefare from Campbeltown to Ardrossan which is £..Compare this with thefare from Brodick to Ardrossan at £. for a distance of . miles.With the additional stop in Brodick giving a journey time of three hours  minutes, I can#t see many Kintyre residents using this service.It seems that the CalMac ferry fleet is not fit-for-purpose but it is very interesting to note that between  and  the passenger steamer Glen Sannox ran a seasonal service from Ardrossan to Campbeltown which took only two hours  minutes!Surely after  years we could expect a better service with faster, more efficient ships for the st century.I was out for my evening walk in Port Charlotte recently and sadly came across a vandalised hand sanitiser dispenser which was previously attached to the bus shelter just across from the Rhinns Medical Centre.I gathered up the broken parts of the hand sanitiser dispenser and placed them on the bus shelter seat.This is yet another incident of vandalism that has been happening on Islay recently.Unfortunately I have had many reports from my constituents of littering, vandalism and general anti-social behaviour.This is not typical of our friendly and welcoming island community and must be addressed with a more active presence of our local police.I have contacted the police about this and have also raised these ongoing issues at a council level.#Business as usual# is not the right approach to this problem in my opinion.Resourcing mental health treatment for young people has never been more important, after new statistics from Public Health Scotland indicated that  young people in the NHS Highland area sought treatment between January and March .Sadly, the pandemic and lockdown restrictions have taken a toll on the mental wellbeing of many young people across the country including here in the Highlands and Islands.We should remember that the consequences of this can be long-lasting. As the report notes, the majority of adult mental health problems begin in childhood with  per cent of mental health problems established by age .This is a reason why my party will continue to push for  per cent of the health budget in Scotland to be spent directly on tackling mental health issues.Although NHS Highland#s waiting time track record is better than the Scottish average, with . per cent people seen within  weeks, that is still well below the Scottish Government#s own target of at least  per cent of patients being seen within that timeframe.It has never been more important to ensure that young people receive the help they need, when they need it.The Scottish SPCA is pledging  miles to Keep Scotland Beautul#s Summer Clean.Keep Scotland Beautul is asking people to pledge time to pick up litter over the campaign from May  until June  where one hour equals three miles.Staff members across the society will be taking part in the Paws on Plastic initiative, alongside Keep Scotland Beautul#s campaign, encouraging people to pick up at least two pieces of litter per dog walk.Scotland#s animal welfare charity received  calls to its helpline about animals affected by litter from January to May.That#s almost two incidents every day and a similar figure to the same period in  when there were  accounts.We see first-hand the devastating consequences litter can have on animals. Seals and birds get caught up in fishing line or wire or animals can ingest small pieces of rubbish and choke or die.The sad thing is that these injuries and deaths are entirely avoidablepeople just disposed of their rubbish responsibly.We are proud to be making a dference by taking part in Paws on Plastic for the Keep Scotland Beautul#s Summer Clean.The Scottish SPCA is dedicated to improving the lives of animals through protecting environments and habitats to ensure Scotland#s wildle can thrive for years to come.Picking up litter will help people respect their environment and protect animals from the dangers of litter.No matter how small, it has the potential to be hazardous or lethal to pets, wildle and farm animals.The public should exercise caution and be careful when picking up litter and we ask that children taking part be accompanied by a responsible adult.We recommend picking up litter with a dog bag or litter picker to avoid direct contact with any litter and do not pick up anything that could be harmful like glass or sharp objects.Any syringes found should not be picked up but reported to the local authority emergency waste uplt informing them of the location of the syringe.Anything that can be done to protect animals is so appreciated and it will have a wonderful effect on the local community too."},{"url":null,"title":"strength and resilience gets david up ben nevis in wheelchair","story":"Last Saturday, -year-old David, who suffered le-changing injuries in a car accident more than  years ago, took on the Ben Nevis challenge in the Joëlette wheelchair.The special wheelchair was created by social inclusion charity JAPES: Joëlette and People Experiences.He was joined by his dad, David senior, volunteers from JAPES, members of Lochaber Mountain Rescue team and friends from Kintyre and as far afield as Nottingham and Essex, who all helped to lt and pull the wheelchair.All was going well until disaster struck about half-way up when a crucial hinge sheared under the strain of the climb and the terrain.A quick assessment and a repair – using cable ties, a piece of threaded rod and a walking pole – meant the team was able to continue the climb.But about , metres up, the decision was made that it would not be safe to continue to the summit and, after  hours on the mountain, the team ed to the bottom.David senior told the Courier he #can#t put into words# how grateful he is to the volunteers who overcame such adversity to help his son achieve his dream.He said: #What a challenge it was!

Izzy ran to him and gave him a tight bear hug, still shaking.ldquoThank God, thank God yoursquore safe, she spoke with a breaking voice.ldquoAunty yoursquore squashing me!Izzy released her embrace but held his two hands in hers.ldquoWhere have you been sweetie, oh my God I was so worried.ldquoSorry aunty, said Finn. He didnrsquot look distressed at all, in fact cheerfulanything.ldquoI have a story to tell you, but can we have breakfast first, Irsquom starving.Izzy burst into tears. Her nephew gave her a hug, and spoke to reassure her.ldquoIrsquom fine aunty, honest, I was scared at first but wait till you hear what happened on the moor. Please can we eat now She lit a small fire in her dish on the rocks by the river. They sat together watching the flames curl around the wood making a snake of smoke which kept the midges away. Then she set up her stove. Its soothing hiss blended with the sound of the river cascading over the rocks.Soon the porridge began to bubble and steam. A big grin came over Finnrsquos face he was very hungry. Izzy dished the porridge into bowls and Finn added jam and banana and devoured it. Above them the Buachaille began to make a gradual appearance.Finn noticed his aunt looking up at the mountain and followed her gaze. He watched as veils of mist swirled around it, hiding then giving tantalizing glimpses of parts of its rocky mass.ldquoYou were right aunty, Finn observed, ldquothe mountain is dancing this morning.She smiled, but it was a forced one. This would have been a perfect moment having breakfast by a tumbling river under the watchful gaze of the Buachaille as the sparkling sun of a Highland morning seductively lts the morning mist.But the shock and trauma of what had just happened wouldnrsquot leave her. Her heart was still racing, her emotions were flowing faster than the river. But on the surface she kept herself together. She waited for Finn to finish his porridge then he told his tale.ldquoI needed a pee and didnrsquot want to wake you. So I went outside. It was getting light but it was really misty, and it felt cold. The mist was so thick you could hardly see anything. It was so quiet, it was spooky, I mean really spooky.ldquoThen I turned and saw this shape in the mist. It was huge, and it was moving. I thought it was a kelpie aunty, I really did. My heart was like going like the clappers, I was so scared, but I didnrsquot want to scream in case it attacked me.Finn picked up some juice to have a drink before continuing his story.ldquoI just stood there but it moved closer towards me. It was then I saw its antlers and realised it was a stag. It stood between me and the car, and its eyes stared at me.ldquoIt started to stamp its hooves. I knew it was going to charge at me. My legs suddenly had electricity. I ran as fast as I could, just ran and ran, I dunno how long. Eventually I couldnrsquot run anymore and I realised I was lost on the moor. The mist was so thick I had no idea where I was. I walked for a long time but couldnrsquot find my way back to you.ldquoI was lost like the redcoats you told me about in the story. I was so scared and was calling out for you, but you didnrsquot answer.Izzy ran her fingers through her hair, shaking her head: ldquoIrsquom so sorry Finn, I never heard you, I must have been fast asleep in the car.She laid her hand apologetically on Finnrsquos arm and lowered her head.ldquoItrsquos OK aunty because thatrsquos when he helped me.Izzy looked up with a startled expression: ldquoWho helped you ldquoAn Duine Mor , you know, the great man of Rannoch moor, the ghostly helper you told me about last night. Hersquos real, and yoursquore right, hersquos a kind ghost.Izzy wasnrsquot sure what to make of this. Was Finn joking, perhaps testing her reaction  He seemed to be waiting for her response.ldquoEr, OK, how did he help you, and, erm, how did you know it was him ldquoHe knew my name aunty, I didnrsquot see him at first, just heard him in the mist. He called out to me and told me not to be afraid. He said hersquod help guide me safely off the moor. He told me he was an Duine Mor and it was his job to help people who were lost. He said to follow his voice. And so I did. It was a calm and kind voiceldquoAnd, erm, Izzy spoke nervously, clearly agitated, ldquodid you see him ldquoI just saw his dark shadow in the mist, just like in the stories. He led me to the road and told me to follow it. Then he just vanished. I walked along the edge of the road in the direction he told me to. Soon after I heard you calling for me, and, well, you know what happened then.Izzy nodded and looked away, which Finn interpreted as her not believing him.ldquoItrsquos true aunty, the great man of Rannoch helped me. I wasnrsquot scared because yoursquod told me the stories about how hersquod helped so many people lost in the mist. Now my story is part of the moor too.She gave Finn a kindly smile.ldquoI believe you Finn, Irsquom just so relieved you are safe. Please never, ever, do something like that again. Do you promise ldquoI suppose aunty, but I didnrsquot mean to get lost. I am kind of glad I did though. Canrsquot wait to tell mum what happened!Izzyrsquos heart sank at the thought of her sisterrsquos reaction to all this. She was tempted to suggest to Finn he wait till they all got home the following day before telling her. But she knew that wasnrsquot a good idea and, besides, she mustnrsquot ask him to keep a secret from his mum.By the time they had packed up the mist had lted, only whisps remained around the mountain tops. Before they, left Izzy stood on the rocks by the river, arms outstretched looking at the mountains, then she closed her eyes.ldquoWhat you doing aunty  Looks like you are praying.She remained in her pose for a few moments more then opened her eyes.ldquoIrsquom being in the moment Finn.ldquoYoursquore such a hippy, aunty, he replied.The sound of a car passing caught Izzyrsquos attention. It crossed the nearby bridge and towards the main road to Glencoe. It was Ewen. Hersquod kept his son safe in more ways than one Izzy was ashamed shersquod doubted him.They spent the early morning in Glen Etive, swimming in a hidden deep-sided rocky cauldron on the river Etive where a white waterfall cascaded into deep dark waters. Old Scots pines which clung to the riverrsquos edge were their only audience.As they dried themselves, Izzy told the ancient story of Deirdre of the Sorrows whom, according to the legend, spent her happiest time in the Glen before she ed to Ireland to meet her tragic end.ldquoThe Highlands doesnrsquot have many happy stories does it  laughed Finn.ldquoYes it does! There is the story of a young lad lost on Rannoch moor, who was saved by the ghostly great man, although his aunt almost died of panic when she realised hersquod gone missing!The plan now was to head for Glencoe and a walk up into to the Lost Valley. Well,Finn could be persuaded to do so that is. But first Finn needed to make his morning call to his mum. So they wound their way along the narrow road back to the Kingshouse.Izzy waited nervously as Finn spoke privately, expecting at any moment to be told ldquomum wants to speak to you.But he hung up and came to her with a big grin: ldquoLetrsquos go.Izzy was confused. ldquoHow was your mum ldquoShersquos good, I didnrsquot tell her about getting lost, she would just worry and probably tell us to end the trip. I donrsquot want her to feel worried. I can tell her the story tomorrow when we get home.The gaping jaws of Glencoe were before them, guarded by the Buachaille. Beyond, in the glen, the Three Sisters waited to tell their tales legends of Finn MacCoul, tales of cattle raids, the Jacobites, and the infamous massacre of the MacDonalds.Izzy played her music they ventured into the glen, the landscape making Finnrsquos spine tingle. She parked with the view of the Three Sisters of Glencoe before them and Finn was excited to recognise the scene from the movie Highlander.Here Izzy told Finn the story of the massacre of the betrayal of trust and desecration of hospitality. She wove an image of the MacDonalds of Glencoe, a hardy, brave, sometimes ruthless clan, who used the mountains as their fortress, herding their lted cattle into what people now called the lost valley.Finn followed the route to the lost valley with his eye. The path vanished into the mountains. It was steep and for Finn very long. But Izzyrsquos storytelling had done the trick. He agreed to try it.What Finn couldnrsquot see was that the person sitting on a boulder in the distance by the path was his dad. He was watching in the shadow of Gearr Aonach, like a sentinel clansman waiting for the arrival of his kin.The plan was hersquod climb to Coire Gabhail just ahead of Finn and Izzy, so he could watch his son from a distance but feel close to him and share the experience with him. That was the plan anyway."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-courier-peeps-past-making-news-25-50-100-years-ago","story":"A TRIUMPH for tree campaigners was front page news in the East Lothian Courier of June , .The protestors of Pressmennan are celebrating victory after East Lothian Council agreed to slap a tree preservation order on the ancient oaks they have fought to save and to probe the possibility of buying the woodland for the public.In addition, the council are to consider protecting other special areas of woodland after hearing of Scottish Office plans to cut local authorities out of the protection consultation process.Marina Findlay, who led the protest, could hardly contain her delight.ldquoItrsquos just brilliant, brilliant, she said. ldquoI can hardly believe that the council has decided to act independently.

Asthe whole knee taking gesture has anything to do with football players.Kier Starmer, who opposes booing, believes the knee taking is an ldquoimportant collective decision by the team. Starmer also condemned Boris Johnson as a coward for not denouncing the booing. The real cowardice, however, comes from those hiding behind the England players and putting the onus on them to make the knee taking decision. The same pressure has been placed on Scottish players.Former PM Gordon Brown, unable to see the real world, argues that England players taking the knee, ldquobrings the whole country together. Demonstrating that Brown continues to live on another planet, he has warned against fan booing because, apparently, it would be bad for Britain ldquo a culture war started to develop. And I thought the point of being ldquowoke is that yoursquore actually awake. Well wake up, Gordon, that ship has sailed, and it wasnrsquot football fans who started it.:Stuart Waiton: Do not panic about racism in footballWhen we live in such intolerant and immature times that you face having your international career destroyed by teenage Tweets, the ldquochoice of knee taking is not the freest one yoursquoll ever make.Sport and politics donrsquot mix, it seems, except when it is the politics of the new elites.But then again, the constant anti-racist message fed to football fans is arguably not politics in any meaningful sense because with politics you have dferent arguments, debates and ideas promoted. Here you have simplistic mantras and chants, \"Say No to Racism or ldquoBlack Lives Matter flashed across your screen and around stadiums. Like lab rats, the imagined simplistic fan will lap this up and, hey presto, the country magically comes together.Manager Gareth Southgate has gained praise for his ldquoDear England letter where he explains his patriotism and notes that for football players, ldquoItrsquos their duty to continue to interact with the public on matters such as equality, inclusivity and racial injustice. And I thought their duty was to kick a ball around a pitch The point of course is that many a booing football fan is sick of being lectured to about racism. They also have questions about the BLM movement, despite the ludicrous attempts by the authorities to say that taking the knee has nothing to do with events in the US, or with their own moralistic crusade.:Stuart Waiton: It was only a matter of time before football fans rebelled against taking the kneeWhen you read fan statements, they make these points. They dislike the subservient gesture of getting on your knees. They oppose the culture war that has resulted in the attack on statues, and they hate the cancel culture that is evident everywhere, from universities to workplaces in popular culture and, of course, sport.Ironically, the denunciation of the booing and the moral pressure being placed on fans is an expression of cancel culture itself and indeed an enforcement of the culture war that Mr Brown can only see when it comes from the other side.When it comes to ldquoeducating yourself, it is in fact our new elites who need to be educated about the meaning of tolerance and the importance of allowing people to express themselves in public, whether you like what they say or not.If the England fans are all racist, then simply telling them to shut up or flashing slogans at them is unlikely to have any effect. If there is more to it than that perhaps you need to listen to people and have some debates and discussions about what the problem is. Perhaps most of all, you should realise that you should be doing this in the world of politics not sport.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

The answer was, like ourselves.This gradual, sometimes painful process was effectively the reverse of an art restorerrsquos job, in which years of accumulated grime are rubbed off an old master to reveal the original in all its vivid glory. For those who were previously dyed, what we uncovered was at the other end of the spectrum: less bright, but maybe not so awful either.Is it any surprise that this trend has gathered pace in the wake of the MeToo movement  Hardly.

Meanwhile their female counterparts are expected to spend fortunes on beauty treatments and surgical procedures, simply to maintain the fiction that time cannot wither them.Now, as proved by the likes of Helen Mirren, with her glamorous glossy white hair, or Andie MacDowell, who has emerged from lockdown with a smoky grey mane, to be seen with salt and pepper hair is no longer one step from morphing into Miss Marple. Silver foxes come in more than one gender.A grey haired modelRecognising that therersquos no shame in going grey is a major advance for older womenrsquos status. For the middle-aged, working in offices alongside younger colleagues or taking Zoom video calls where the lens cruelly adds a century or two, can seriously dents confidence. You feel an all too visible relic of the past.The sense of freedom this grey-roots movement offers stems from a dawning awareness that women donrsquot need to pretend to be something they are not. As with MeToo, when thousands spoke out about long-hidden abuses and challenged a system designed by and for men, finally to appreciate grey heads as a positive and upbeat look for women allows us to regain our self-respect.In fact, embracing rather than obliterating grey hair might be as important a step as when women first wore trousers. Those trailblazers ndash hussies was the word more commonly used at the time ndash scandalised a society that saw such practical garb as offensively unfeminine. Worse, it would ruin their chances of catching a man. ROSEMARY: Pray for an end to AlzheimersNow, by defying the out-dated stereotype of blondes having more fun, or the fear that the first streaks of grey signal the beginning of the end, women can proudly display their vintage and their hard-won experience. Enlightened employers ought actively to welcome tangible proof that they have members of staff whose appearance immediately denotes authority and wisdom.Nor is it women alone who might benefit. Since the advent of Grecian , men have faced merciless mockery for trying to turn back the clock by hitting the bottle ndash remember President Trumps attorney Rudi Giuliani, whose dye ran when he began to sweat  ndash or having hair implants to cover their bald pates. Maybe now, as women find the courage to allow nature to take its course, men might feel they can follow suit.But more than anything, this new acceptance of advancing years is about women finding and feeling comfortable in their rightful place. Going for silver rather than gold is a political as well as a personal statement. It is a gentle reminder that far, from being cast into the shade, age and maturity should be allowed to shine.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

To do so with one sentence in a press release, and no answers to the crucial questions it raises, shows a staggering contempt for Britainrsquos farming communities.According to the Australian Government, beef and sheep meat tarfs will be removed after a decade.For beef, they said that ldquoIn the subsequent five years a safeguard will apply on beef imports exceeding a further volume threshold rising in equal instalments to , tonnes, levying a tarf safeguard duty of  per cent for the rest of the calendar year.On sheep meat, the Australians said: ldquoSheep meat tarfs will be eliminated after ten years. During the transition period, Australia will have immediate access to a duty-free quota of , tonnes, rising in equal instalments to , tonnes in year .ldquoIn the subsequent five years a safeguard will apply on sheep meat imports exceeding a further volume threshold rising in equal instalments to , tonnes, levying a tarf safeguard duty of  per cent for the rest of the calendar year.The National Farmers UnionScotland said the trade deal failed to provide ldquolasting assurances for Scottish farmers.The organisationrsquos president Martin Kennedy said: ldquoAs detail on the proposed terms of agreement around an Australian trade deal emerge, deep concerns will remain about its impact on Scotlandrsquos farmers, crofters and our wider food and drink sector.He said the suggestion of a cap on tarf free imports for  years was ldquomerely a slow journey to the Australians getting unfettered access to UK markets adding there were ldquono guarantees that the promises of other safeguards will address the fact that very dferent production systems are permitted in Australia compared to here in the UK.He added that MPs should be able to scrutinise the deal properly, and the Government must provide an impact assessment ldquoon what it may mean for the agriculture and food sectors.\"An FTA with Australia, and the way it has been agreed without proper industry consultation or scrutiny, sets a dangerous precedent for other Free Trade Agreements, including those with other major farming and food producing nations such as New Zealand, Canada, Mexico and the United States he said.ldquoThe cumulative impact of all such trade deals on extremely vulnerable sectors such as farming, food and drink could be hugely destructive.Earlier today Boris Johnsontweeted that ldquothe deal is done as he insisted British farmers will benefit from new arrangements ndash which are the first to be negotiated from scratch since Brexit.Mr Johnson said it was ldquogood news for services and manufacturers in the UK, with British products such as cars, Scottish whisky and confectionary set to be cheaper to sell to Australia because of the tarf-free agreement."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12448129.jpg?type=article-full","title":"education-scotland-hope-47k-a-year-specialist-teachers","story":"The new posts will allow staff to establish themselves as specialists in particular areas of learning, pedagogy or policy, with opportunities also planned at the local authority and regional  national level.Crucially, those taking up the roles will not be considered part of school management, meaning they should be able to move up the hierarchy while still developing teaching expertise.They will also be given a reduction in weekly class contact to allow them to carry out additional duties.Union bosses hope the change will provide richer career progression possibilities and attract trainees in shortfall-hit areas such as science, technology, engineering and mathematics .:Glasgow school goes ScandinavianProvisional figures published earlier this year indicated that intake to initial teacher education through a secondary-level graduate diplomaand other routes had fallen well below target in a number of subjects, including chemistry and physics.The statistics led to warnings that failure to maintain a steady inflow could increase the likelihood of classes being led by staff whose main qualication is in another discipline and who may not have the same degree of expertise, passion or interest. This creates the risk that young people lose enthusiasm for the subject before they reach the senior phase, potentially depriving the economy of scientists, engineers and mathematicians.Seamus Searson, General Secretary at the Scottish Secondary Teachersrsquo Association union, said lead teachers would provide crucial additional expertise and could help boost staff retention. But he stressed that signicant investment would be required to embed the change.ldquoThis role should be about continuing as a teacher, he told The Herald.SSTA General Secretary Seamus Searson has high hopes for the new lead teacher post.ldquoOne of the things the SSTA wants is for every school to have a lead teacher in every subject, a specialist who rolls up their sleeves and works alongside the other teachers ndash although the fear is that that headteachers,theyrsquore paying more money, will want these teachers to have management responsibilities.ldquoI see the lead teacher position as something that will mean improvement for probationers and new teachers coming into the profession, since it will give them a lsquogo torsquo person for subject-specic help or advice, and also something that could help keep more experienced teachers.ldquoThis new position could really help not just with recruitment of trainees, but also retention - and not just in STEM but in all subjects.Salaries will range from just over pound, to nearly pound, depending on whether posts are at the school, council or regional national level. But Mr Searson added: ldquoUnless therersquos proper funding, itrsquos not going to happen.

Instead, the White House is looking for a more modest though vitally important goal: to move towards a more predictable relationship and attempt to rein in Russiarsquos disruptive behaviour.Mr Bidenrsquos first overseas trip was deliberately sequenced so that he will meet with Mr Putin only after spending days meeting with European allies and powerful democracies, including a gathering at Nato, the decades-old alliance formed to serve as a bulwark to Russian aggression.He hoped to project a sense of unity and renewed co-operation after four years of tumult under former president Donald Trump, who often tried to cosy up to the Russian president.Mr Biden will push Mr Putin to stop meddling in democratic elections, to ease tensions with Ukraine and to stop giving safe harbour to hackers carrying out cyber and ransomware attacks.Aides believe that lowering the temperature with Russia will also reinforce the United Statesrsquo ties to democracies existing in Moscowrsquos shadow. vw,vw,px, px\"Swiss police block a road in Geneva that will be used by Mr Biden and Mr Putin National security adviser Jake Sullivan said Mr Biden would look for ldquoareas where, in our common interest, we can work together to produce outcomes that are mdash that work for the United States and for the American people.Mr Sullivan said that Mr Bidenrsquos other message would be more stick than carrot: ldquoHow do we send a clear message about those harmful activities that we will not tolerate and to which we will respond There have been brief moments of common ground. Moscow and Washington have shown a shared interest in restarting talks on strategic stability to work out a follow-up deal to the New START, the last remaining US Russian arms control pact that was extended for five years in January.Mr Biden will exhort Mr Putin on human rights, including the poisoning and imprisonment of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, not to support the regime in Belarus that carried out a recent skyjacking and to stop interfering with other nationsrsquo elections.Cyber will also be a focal point, with the Geneva summit coming just days after Nato expanded its Article  mutual defence pact to include cyberattacks.But the US president acknowledged that there may be no way to keep Mr Putin in check. vw,vw,px, px\"Mr Putinrsquos main goal will be to draw his red lines for the new US administration Meanwhile, Mr Putinrsquos main goal will be to draw his red lines for the new US administration and negotiate a tense status quo that would protect Moscowrsquos vital interests.The Russian leader does not hope for a new detente to mend the rt caused by Russiarsquos  annexation of Ukrainersquos Crimean Peninsula.Nor does he count on a rollback of the crippling US and EU sanctions that have restricted Moscowrsquos access to global financial markets and top Western technologies.Mr Putinrsquos task now is more modest mdash to spell out Russiarsquos top security concerns and try to restore basic channels of communication that would prevent an even more dangerous destabilisation.The main red line for Moscow is Ukrainersquos aspirations to join Nato. Fearing its bid for the alliance membership, Mr Putin responded to the  ousting of Ukrainersquos Russia-friendly president by annexing Crimea and throwing Moscowrsquos weight behind a separatist insurgency in the countryrsquos eastern industrial heartland, where the seven-year conflict has killed more than ,.When tensions along the line of contact in Ukrainersquos east rose earlier this year, Russia quickly increased its troops near Ukraine and warned Kievrsquos leaders that it would intervene militarilythey tried to reclaim the rebel-controlled regions by force.While taking a tough stance on Ukraine, the Russian leader could show a degree of flexibility on other global hotspots. vw,vw,px, px\"Flags of the US and Russia being waved on the Mont Blanc bridge in Geneva ahead of the summit Even though Moscow has been critical of the US-led military campaign in Afghanistan, it is interested in a settlement that would prevent the country from plunging into chaos following the US troopsrsquo withdrawal later this year, fearing that instability could spill into ex-Soviet Central Asia.Russia also has been involved in painstaking international talks to help repair a nuclear deal with Iran that was spiked by Mr Trump, and it has expressed a willingness to co-operate with the US in efforts to restart the stalled Middle East peace talks.And the Kremlin would be interested in working out a deal on Syria, where Moscowrsquos military campaign helped President Bashar Assadrsquos government reclaim control over most of the country after a devastating civil war and the US has maintained a limited military presence.Russia has said it is ready to include its prospective doomsday weapons mdash such as the Poseidon atomic-powered, nuclear-armed underwater drone and the Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile mdash in the talks, on condition the US brings its missile defence and possible space-based weapons into the equation.Mr Putin also has emphasised Russiarsquos readiness to make joint efforts to address climate change and cope with the coronavirus pandemic.He called for establishing a dialogue on cybercrime, noting that Moscow could agree to extradite cybercrime suspects to the USWashington assumed the same obligation.The White House has strongly downplayed the idea of a cybercriminal prisoner exchange.copy -.

He has said several times we will do whatever is necessary, and that is the view that is held across Government because we are extremely concerned about the situation.He added that he senses there is a ldquoslight misunderstanding within the EU over the constitutional position of Northern Ireland.It followed reports that French President Emmanuel Macron had said to Mr Johnson at the G summit that Northern Ireland is not part of the UK.Lord Frost said: ldquoI think wersquove sensed that this sort of slight misunderstanding about the status of Northern Ireland has been around for some time, possibly quite a long time.ldquoIt is obviously rather concerningpeople see things in that way it doesnrsquot seem to us to be consistent with the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement, which are very clear on that.copy -.

He has said several times we will do whatever is necessary, and that is the view that is held across Government because we are extremely concerned about the situation.He added that he senses there is a ldquoslight misunderstanding within the EU over the constitutional position of Northern Ireland.It followed reports that French President Emmanuel Macron had said to Mr Johnson at the G summit that Northern Ireland is not part of the UK.Lord Frost said: ldquoI think wersquove sensed that this sort of slight misunderstanding about the status of Northern Ireland has been around for some time, possibly quite a long time.ldquoIt is obviously rather concerningpeople see things in that way it doesnrsquot seem to us to be consistent with the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement, which are very clear on that.copy -.

He battled bravely until the age of eight when he sadly passed away. After Mark’s passing, the Lynn family decided to start a foundation in his memory with the aim of helping other families facing similar issues.Mark’s parents, Donna and Geoff, who live at Ballykeel, have been deeply touched by all the support the foundation has received from far and wide.And they have been particularly moved by the efforts of those who took part in the ‘ mile challenge’ which reflects their late son’s love for the pop classic.During April and May, volunteers have been stepping out through rain and shine to clock up the sponsored miles to raise money for the foundation.And one of those walkers has taken the challenge right back to the homeland of The Proclaimers with a tough walk along the West Highland Way. LJ Shanks, from Ballymena, said: “ I was really impressed by what this foundation brings to families across Northern Ireland so I decided to walk  miles across the West Highland Way to rasie funds.”With its spectacular scenery of hills, mountains, rivers and lochs, the  mile West Highland Way is Scotlands premier trail walking route. Starting from the north-west suburbs of Glasgow this way-marked route takes walkers from the lowlands to the Highlands of Scotland taking in Loch Lomond, Glencoe and Ben Nevis.LJ added: “Mark enjoyed every essence of le, always smiling and making others smile back. I’m hoping my walk will go a little way towards keeping the families helped by the Mark Lynn Foundation smiling during dficult and trying times.”Donna Lynn said she had been ‘truly humbled’ by the efforts shown by all those who took up the ‘ mile challenge’. She said: “A super big thank you to all the walkers and bikers who took part in the miles challenge in April.“Between them they blasted through the miles! well over  miles was achieved.They raised a fantastic pound.“So well done to Dawny Jo Ritchie, Caroline Montgomery, Jessica Shire, Chrisy Bruce and Zarra-louise Bamber.“ Mark lynn CHD Foundation is totally grateful for all your hard work and support.

Addressing his MLA colleagues as he unveiled the framework at Stormont on Tuesday morning, Mr Swann said: “Our waiting times are the worst of any UK region. It is simply not acceptable to me that the people of Northern Ireland should receive a lower standard of care than in other parts of the UK.We have a health service that prides itself on being available to all, free at the point of access. But with the current scale of our waiting times we are creating a two tier system. Daily Headlines Newsletter  EveningNewsletter Receive todays headlines directly to your inbox every morning.  Enter email address   This field is required  Sign Up      A system whereby those who can afford to pay privately receive diagnosis and treatment while those who cannot afford to pay languish on never ending waiting lists. It is abhorrent.There is little or no doubt that long waiting times will exacerbate, and perpetuate, existing health inequalities.This issue transcends politics - five Ministers from three dferent political parties have held the Health portfolio in this period – but it will require political will from all of the parties in the Executive to fix it.I view today as a staging post in the long struggle to turn our health service around. This crisis has been building up for years.There is a very heavy responsibility on all our shoulders. We must live up to it and deliver better public services.I have said it before about waiting lists, but it bears repeating. I cannot think of a more important issue facing not just my department, but the whole Executive and Assembly.Covid green sites will be set up to reduce the likelihood of theatre lists being disrupted by the virus, while megaclinics, which will enable patients to see a range of specialists under one roof, will also be established.Green prescription slips, familiar to patients across Northern Ireland, will also be axed to make way for a paperless prescribing system.Operating theatres in NHS hospitals will also be leased to private healthcare providers so they can help to address the massive backlog of patients waiting for surgery.However, the UUP minister has warned it will take £.m of additional money to fund the plans.“I realise this is a big ask at a time when there are many financial demands on our public sector,” he said.“However, we should have no illusions that this is a crisis that has already dragged on far too long.“We owe to it patients and our great health and social care staff to push ahead with the painstaking process of rebuilding our health service.“That must include a relentless drive to bring down waiting times.“These are not statistics, but real-le stories of people waiting far too long in pain and discomfort.“The time for talk is over. What we need now is concerted action.”According to the framework, subject to funding approval by the Executive, no patient will wait longer than one year for a first outpatient or inpatient appointment, or  weeks for a diagnostic test by March .At the end of March this year, , people had been waiting longer than  weeks for a first outpatient appointment and , people had been waiting longer than one year for inpatient or day case treatment.The framework has warned that, without action, the number of people waiting longer than a year for a first outpatient appointment will rocket to , by March .The number of people waiting longer than one year for inpatient or day case appointments will also rise signicantly by % to , patients.Mr Swann has set a series of tough targets to ensure the smooth roll out of his plans.Among them, all trusts will move to provide a minimum of % of outpatient appointments virtually by October this year.Megaclinics for orthopaedic outpatients, cataract services and pre-operative assessments will be in place by this September.Breast assessment services will move to a regional booking system by the end of the year, while specialty assessment units, which aim to ert patients away from overstretched emergency departments, will be in place in a matter of months.The way wait times are monitored will also be changed which will show how long patients wait for treatment from the point of referral.In the longer term, Mr Swann wants operating theatres toseven-days a week, although the framework acknowledges staff shortages will have to be addressed.“There are, however, signicant challenges to this,” it states.“In addition to the necessary investment in the workforce, this will require signicant engagement with staff.“This is therefore a longer-term aspiration and is subject to the delivery of additional recurrent investment.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadPastor apologises for Ian Paisley ‘dishonouring Jesus’ remarks by joining Van Morrison’s verbal attack on Robin SwannMother whose son was offered place at Irish language school despite not speaking Gaelic slams Stormont over transfer shamblesLagan Search and Rescue condemn footage of man jumping into river for dareNI’s sausage firms ‘ready to replace GB products’New IRA orders units in Northern Ireland to target prison officersTop VideosPlayNorthern Ireland bonfire association to give residents #thermal protection# for homesPlayVan Morrison and Ian Paisley in anti-Robin Swann chants at Europa Hotel eventPlayExplainer: What is the Northern Ireland Protocol Latest HealthRegular testing introduced for all asymptomatic care home visitors in Northern IrelandCoronavirus Northern Ireland: No further deaths and  new positive casesBelfast woman’s poem on male mental health inspires new videoLisa SmythOpinionPoliticians must do the right thing, for sake of our health serviceCovid centres closure plan halted by Delta iant fearsLatestVehicle testing in Northern Ireland to resume at full capacity in JulyFuneral and crematorium directors ordered to make prices clear for customersFrost admits UK and EU are ‘not making much progress’ on Brexit rowCovid riskScotland fans gather in London, mayor Sadiq Khan warnsCare home staff with first dose of Covid- vaccine, by local authority,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He has said several times we will do whatever is necessary, and that is the view that is held across Government because we are extremely concerned about the situation.”He added that he senses there is a “slight misunderstanding” within the EU over the constitutional position of Northern Ireland.It followed reports that French President Emmanuel Macron had said to Mr Johnson at the G summit that Northern Ireland is not part of the UK.Lord Frost said: “I think we’ve sensed that this sort of slight misunderstanding about the status of Northern Ireland has been around for some time, possibly quite a long time.“It is obviously rather concerningpeople see things in that way it doesn’t seem to us to be consistent with the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement, which are very clear on that.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadPastor apologises for Ian Paisley ‘dishonouring Jesus’ remarks by joining Van Morrison’s verbal attack on Robin SwannLagan Search and Rescue condemn footage of man jumping into river for dareMother whose son was offered place at Irish language school despite not speaking Gaelic slams Stormont over transfer shamblesNI’s sausage firms ‘ready to replace GB products’New IRA orders units in Northern Ireland to target prison officersTop VideosPlayNorthern Ireland bonfire association to give residents #thermal protection# for homesPlayVan Morrison and Ian Paisley in anti-Robin Swann chants at Europa Hotel eventPlayExplainer: What is the Northern Ireland Protocol Latest Northern IrelandMalaysia court rules against coroner verdict in Nora Quoirin’s deathVehicle testing in Northern Ireland to resume at full capacity in JulyUK could bask in hottest day of the year ahead of thunderstorm warningsFrost admits UK and EU are ‘not making much progress’ on Brexit rowNorthern Ireland traffic alerts: Security alert forces Glenavy road closureLatestMalaysia court rules against coroner verdict in Nora Quoirin’s deathVehicle testing in Northern Ireland to resume at full capacity in JulyMet chief faces further criticism at prison break shooting inquiryLockdown spring cleaning saw record amount of electrical items recycledUK could bask in hottest day of the year ahead of thunderstorm warnings,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Its final repayment date is June .Other PFI projects include a £.m loan to build the Laganside Court Complex and a £.m loan to construct Lisburn City Library, as well as several schools.

Enter email address   This field is required  Sign Up      Alliance Party finance spokesperson Andrew Muir said: “The colossal amount spent on PFI projects is a stark reminder about the scale of taxpayer monies poured into a now-discredited funding model and the need for newly established fiscal council and commission bodies to explore better ways to finance much-needed investment in public services that cost less and benefit the public much more.”The Department of Financesaid PFI should only be used where it offers better value for money than other means of procurement.As with all expenditure, the Department of Finance approve expenditure for PFI projects above delegated limits, the department said.This approval takes place before expenditure is incurred and in the case of PFI projects before contracts are signed and is based on the information available at that time. Inidual departments are responsible for their respective PFI contracts including ongoing monitoring and assessment.PFI loans have been controversial as they come with very high interest rates. For instance, in , the Belfastrevealed that a total of  PFI loans taken out to build schools, hospitals and roads in Northern Ireland will cost the taxpayer £.bn more than their value over the next  years.Until  the primary model of PPP was PFI. A review of PFI was carried out by the Government aimed at addressing criticisms of this form of contracting and PF, the successor to PFI, was launched in December .One of the key dferences between PFI and PF is that the Government now acts as a minority co-investor to give greater visibility of the inner workings of projects. Measures have also been put in place to reduce procurement times, and frontline services have been removed from the standard contract.There is also improved transparency of the process, including publication of equity s from the private investor.According to the DoF: For every project, there should be an initial economic appraisal according to NIGEAEguidance to determine a preferred option in terms of the public services to be delivered.This should be followed by a separate assessment of all the relevant alternative procurement options available to deliver the preferred option, including conventional methods and others where relevant..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadPastor apologises for Ian Paisley ‘dishonouring Jesus’ remarks by joining Van Morrison’s verbal attack on Robin SwannLagan Search and Rescue condemn footage of man jumping into river for dareMother whose son was offered place at Irish language school despite not speaking Gaelic slams Stormont over transfer shamblesNew IRA orders units in Northern Ireland to target prison officersNI’s sausage firms ‘ready to replace GB products’Top VideosPlayNorthern Ireland bonfire association to give residents #thermal protection# for homesPlayVan Morrison and Ian Paisley in anti-Robin Swann chants at Europa Hotel eventPlayExplainer: What is the Northern Ireland Protocol Latest Northern IrelandMalaysia court rules against coroner verdict in Nora Quoirin’s deathVehicle testing in Northern Ireland to resume at full capacity in JulyUK could bask in hottest day of the year ahead of thunderstorm warningsFrost admits UK and EU are ‘not making much progress’ on Brexit rowNorthern Ireland traffic alerts: Security alert forces Glenavy road closureLatestMalaysia court rules against coroner verdict in Nora Quoirin’s deathVehicle testing in Northern Ireland to resume at full capacity in JulyMet chief faces further criticism at prison break shooting inquiryLockdown spring cleaning saw record amount of electrical items recycledUK could bask in hottest day of the year ahead of thunderstorm warnings,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

After crossing the bridge, I head up the hill and pull the car in opposite the Vivo and the magnicently named Rio Grande bar. Parks Rio Grande, the Faughan River, flows through the centre of the village, which this afternoon sits under an angry-looking sky. A woman walks her dog down Learmount Road, her face set against the stf breeze that is swishing through the trees surrounding the village. The scene on Learmount Road leading up the hill. Rain starts to fall as a mother guides her toddler out the doors of the Vivo, one hand clutching hers and the other gripping the bottle of juice he has just been bought. googletag.cmd.push A large plastic ice cream cone sits hopefully outside the shop. Up the hill comes a learner driver seemingly on a lesson. She stops outside Learmount Resource Centre and disappears into the building, before emerging with her child in tow to resume her lesson. A delivery driver pulls into the yard of Devine Kitchens. He s to his cab and pulls out a hammer. Things must be getting serious. As I cross the bridge, I spot the wheel from an old watermill by the river side, almost reclaimed by its surroundings. A remnant of an  flax mill known as Quigleys Mill.     Perhaps the most clear view of the mill is from the top of the hill outside Park Hardware and DIY. Greg McElhinney and Matthew Devine. Inside, owner Greg McElhinney says the last year has been busy. “With construction and everything  closing down last April, we were very busy, which was good for us because people from the local area were able to do home projects,” he tells me. “The weather was good as well, so youd a lot of painting and decorating – fences and gardens and stuff like that – going on. “People were happy there was a local business still operating, because a lot of the bigger hardware stores had closed. “It got to the stage when it was hard to source materials because suppliers were closed until June time, but people were happy enough to occupy their time. They had nothing  to do.” The remains of Quigleys Mill, Park. Parks postal area recorded an increase in Covid cases last week, and despite the attachment to Derry city skewing the numbers, Greg admits there is still a degree of worry locally. “The majority of the population feel we still have to be serious about this. Its drilled into everybody at this stage, like putting your seatbelt on in the car,” he says. “The worry now is were straddling the Donegal border to a certain extent and case numbers are very high either side of it. “There is more positivity now than there was maybe six weeks ago though. Society is opening up again, and the vaccinations are a positive thing.” Covid has taken its toll on rural le too, and compliance with regulations has come at a social cost for village communities. “Where were based is very much a rural area, with a lot of the farming community and tradesmen and stuff,” says Greg. “You get some people who, by chance, meet up outside the shop here and have an opportunity to have a chat that maybe havent seen each other in a few months. “Those guys would have been at markets or farm meets every week, or pubs, but now you see them sitting out there for half an hour chatting to each other. “The social aspect, face to face, is the biggest thing. “The local community group have done a lot of work with the walkways there over the past number of years, which is very good.” Caroline Lynch and Catriona Doughty from Learmount Community Development Group. The local community group to which Greg refers is Learmount Community Development Group, which is nestled down a lane next to the entrance to Learmount Forest. Over the last year, Caroline Lynch and Catriona Doughty have noticed a big increase in people using Parks hidden gem. “We would have come down here some mornings and that car park would be full,” says Caroline. “Our secret Learmount Forest isnt a secret any more, and thats great, because everybody wants out, and weve had drop-ins coming from that.” “The forest has been fantastic for people being able to get out and safely meet their neighbours,” adds Catriona. “Theyll maybe call in at quiet times to have a socially distanced cup of tea. That social aspect has been missed, they are missing company and casual conversation.” Caroline feels the experience of the last year has sharpened focus on the issue of loneliness that had been hiding in plain sight. “We had a man who lives alone and had been sick for two or three days,” she says. “He hadnt been out and had no food in the house, so thankfully we were able to help with that. “You just know people are lonely and looking to get out again, but at the same time are a bit anxious about it. “Theyre happy to take the summer out of it and see what happens. There is certainly a lot of loneliness, isolation and depression though. “You could obviously be in the middle of a housing site and still be lonely, but when you see some of the people on their own, up a lane, they see nobody. They barely even see the postman now.” Working with both young and old people, the group have seen the effect the pandemic and its associated lockdowns have had on both generations.  “A lot of our work is with older people, and whilst theyre saying theyre fed up, some of them are getting a wee bit set in their ways,” says Caroline. “You just know by talking to them. We had a woman who always came in every week, even when it was bad, and she hasnt been in about two months. “Its highlighted how much we miss the social side of things, not being able to get out and meet friends. Even for the youth. “People always think all they need is their phone, because thats all theyre sitting on, but you can see now how the youth are crying out as much for social contact as any other generation.” There is hope though, that with the vaccines roll out and the upcoming warmer weather, that the group will be able to run some of their usual summer events. “We are looking at putting together a summer programme, but wed be a bit nervous ourselves about bringing a group of people into the room,” says Caroline.  “It would be perfectthere was good weather, because it will be planned outdoors. If the weather is bad, well take it over to Park hall, because its a bit bigger than here. “We have funding for dancing and music, which I think people would love to hear. Wed love to have tables out there on a nice evening, with a bit of a barbecue and a bit of music. “Youd like to think by September, we should be able to get going.” On the way back through the village, the shutters are half up on the Rio Grande as preparations continue inside. By the time you read this it will have reopened its doors. Hospitality has ed throughout the county, another step on the road to recovery. The farmers outside Greg McElhinneys store now have somewhere  to shoot the breeze. For the next few weeks at least, Covid fears will be drowned out by clink of glasses, the audible relief of the repressed socialite and the laughter of friends reunited. Dancing, however, is still prohibited under the regulations. It may need to be done across Parks Rio Grande, rather than inside it.  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --\u2028\u2028      \u2028  \u2028--    googletag.cmd.pushMost Popular Picture Gallery - Take a trip down memory lane overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"THROWBACK TUESDAY: Strictly Come Dancing in Ballerin \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"THROWBACK TUESDAY: Charity Strictly Come Dancing event in Ballerin  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry Death Notices - Tuesday, th June,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Man with ‘horrendous record’ live streamed himself on Facebook as he destroyed Derry flat overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The car park at Shantallow Health Centre.Derry car park compared to Grand Canyon because of large potholes to be repaired as part of new council plan overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Should there be railway stops at Strathfoyle, City of Derry Airport and Ballykelly  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Michael Gove arrives at the Destined centre in Derry.

The bank holiday weekend is just hours away and the good weather is attempting a coup. A dull brightness begins to break through the grey clouds, leaving walkers on the street squinting and furrowing their brows. The clouds snarl in response to the affront, and tentative droplets of rain begin to find their way to the ground. Even in the warm, muggy air, the smell of a turf fire floats down the villages main street. Theres always one. Two school pupils are heading out the Clady Road. I glance at the time. .am. Exam season creates a flexible timetable. googletag.cmd.push The sporadic sound of traffic has all but given way to the birdsong, and the proleration of feeders in the local gardens are fuelling their melodic reverie. Two men stand outside a house on the way to Portglenone, in conversation with a woman across the street. One is brandishing a golf club in an apparent visualisation exercise, swinging it absent-mindedly around the garden.  The people I approach are not in a talkative mood, and after a few stops the reason becomes fairly clear. A power cut has left Clady in darkness at an inopportune moment. Hospitality is about to kick off its first fully reopened weekend – a bank holiday weekend no less – and local businesses are reeling from this latest setback.     Gym-goers at Pink X Fitness are making the most of the natural light to persevere with their workouts. In the Vivo, an exasperated manager tells me it could be  oclock by the time the power is back. In Teady McErleans bar, a solitary drinker sits at the bar, the chink of light from a half-raised shutter illuminating the pint in front of him against the darkness. With the village in a flap and counting the opportunity cost of losing out on a few hours electricity, no one is keen to fill two pages for a reporter. Out the Clady Road, heading towards Lavey, is an oasis of serenity by the road side. Opposite the Waterwall Bar sits Clady and District Angling Club.  There are two men sitting on a memorial bench outside the club house when I arrive, and within seconds of explaining myself Im inside and the kettle is on. The pandemic initially hit the club hard, closing all activities for months in the early days of uncertainty and fear, but gradually its role became crucial. One member describes it as a type of mens shed for the local community. “At the start there was no fishing whatsoever, but as things eased, people joined the club to get out and about,” he tells me. “Im glad to be alive, I had a run in with a bit of cancer in the lung and Im glad to be fit to move around at all. “I go up to the wee path for a walk, right up every day for a bit of exercise. Id have done that even before I took ill, I used to do the Fishermans Walk. I started when I retired. “I would probably know two or three that have passed away from Covid. Bad, bad times. Thank God everything is on the turn, the vaccine made a big dference. I feel safer.” The members explain the facility is benefiting not just the local anglers, but the whole community, with the pathway experiencing a huge increase in footfall since the first lockdown began last Spring. Francis McKenna and Danny Henry taking the time to answer our questions last week. While the other members chat to me, club member Gerard Webb has been busy procuring further interviewees. Sisters Laura and Clare McQuaide are part of a younger generation who are making the most of the clubs grounds, stretching both their own legs and those of their dog, Evie. “We just take our dog for a walk here most days, especially when there is good weather. We just find other, bigger places are not as clean and tidy, and this is handy for where we live,” says Laura. “I do think it is better now. This time last year, you were still able to get out for walks, but it was tough. I work in Ballymena and have been pretty much working during the whole thing. “We closed for two months, but Ive been working since last May and its weird seeing how people have adapted to it. It is better now, obviously with the vaccine. “People kept asking me how I found it, but for me, it was just the same. I work in Subway in Ballymena and it never changed –anything we were busier. “We used to always go to the cinema and its been a real loss. Just simple things – you dont realise how much you value them until you cant do them.” After Laura and Clare disappear over the bridge with a restless Evie, I head back inside the club, where Francis McKenna has arrived and is holding court. He tells me people need to be mindful that Covid- hasnt gone away. The gates at St Oliver Plunkett GAC, Greenlough. “Its still scary. In a way, Im still afraid that things arent right, and people are abusing it. People think its completely over, some people,” he says. “That really annoys me, when you see a couple of hundred standing with no masks on them. It doesnt feel right at all. “It affected my nerves at the start when I heard how many were dying with it. My we wouldnt have gone out of the house or let anyone in, including our own family. “That was the worst part. They could come to the window and all that craic, but she wouldnt them in. Shed even be wary today about letting them in.” Experienced enough to remember the feeling of war, even the muted panic of rural County Derry, Francis says the pandemic has created more fear. “When the war was on, the siren went and you knew to hide, or go to an air raid shelter or go somewhere safe, but with that type of thing, the authorities dont even know,” he says. “Theyre doing their best to tell the truth, but they dont even know the whole truth. Its very scary.” The sheer number of people using the facility has surprised Danny Henry, who has sidled into the room while Francis was in full flow. “One Sunday I came down here and there were  cars here,” he says. “The police actually came because they were parked in front of the Water Wall and thats a really dangerous corner. “At the start of the pandemic, I was up one Sunday morning, about  oclock, and there was this man and woman, a brave age, looking at a phone. “They were looking at Google Maps, and they asked me, because they were trying to work out where this pad takes us. “They were from Larne. They were here at  oclock on a Sunday morning. The pad leads right to Greenloughs old chapel. I dont even knowit was on Google Maps at all. “Im living here this  years, and I would never have thought of going to Larne to walk, and they were coming here.”  After a guided walk from Gerard Webb as far as the hand-crafted insect hotels on the pads, the uplting effects of such a serene, natural facility becomes very clear. There are horses grazing on the opposite side of the river. Ripples spread across the reflective bliss of the still water as fish top and tail in the May heat. Sunshine has won the battle of wills and is now bathing the village and its surrounding areas in light. On the way back through Clady, the power appears to have been restored. There are lights in the chippy. The hum of the drier from the hairdressers. Probably the boom of music from the gym. Normal service is resuming, and long may it continue.  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --\u2028\u2028      \u2028  \u2028--    googletag.cmd.pushMost Popular Picture Gallery - Take a trip down memory lane overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"THROWBACK TUESDAY: Strictly Come Dancing in Ballerin \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"THROWBACK TUESDAY: Charity Strictly Come Dancing event in Ballerin  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry Death Notices - Tuesday, th June,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Man with ‘horrendous record’ live streamed himself on Facebook as he destroyed Derry flat overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The car park at Shantallow Health Centre.Derry car park compared to Grand Canyon because of large potholes to be repaired as part of new council plan overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Should there be railway stops at Strathfoyle, City of Derry Airport and Ballykelly  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Michael Gove arrives at the Destined centre in Derry.

Two hundred and fty invited guests enjoyed sets from ROE, No Oil Paintings, Ports and Jealous Of The Birds, as they observed social distancing guidelines set by the gig organisers. The social distancing rules saw people watch the gigs from tables and inidual audience pens in bubbles of four to six people. A one-way system, hand sanitizing stations, toilet cleaning, signage and social distancing marshals also added to the safety protocols and ensured that the event could take pace as safely and as socially distantly as possible, without taking away from the atmosphere of the event. googletag.cmd.push Stendhal Festival director, Ross Parkhill, said it was a huge thrill to be able to host live music at the farm again and that the event went off exactly to plan with no major issues what so ever. “It was absolutely brilliant,” said Ross. “We’ve missed this so much so to be able to put on a gig again means the world to absolutely everyone involved with Stendhal.” He added: “We are used to doing much bigger gigs but this one really felt special. It felt like a real release and you could feel that throughout the audience, the performers and the staff here. It felt like hope realised.”     Ross added: “In terms of the numbers, we could have had more people but along with getting a gig on stage this was also about getting a trial run of our social distancing procedures before we welcome larger crowds in July and August. “Safety of our visitors is always our number one priority at any edition of Stendhal but it will be our number one, two and three priorities this year. “We are really pleased with how everything went in that sense, everyone who we spoke to at the end said they felt safe, felt that the Covid measures were easy to follow and more importantly, said that it gave them a bit of confidence venturing back into crowds as we hopefully are seeing the back end of this terrible pandemic.” The Northern Ireland Executive announced on May  that outdoor events for up to  people, including concerts could take place from May  and Ross said once that announcement was made, Stendhal simply had to act. “When we read that outdoor concerts for  people were back on the agenda we sort of had to do a double take to seewe had read it correctly. “Then we emailed the Executive Office and the Department for Communities to clary and validate that the press release was correct and when that came back in the affirmative we knew we had to act right away.” Naomi Hamilton, of Jealous of the Birds, was one of the performers on the night and following her first live performance to an audience since March  she said it was a night of high emotion. “What a joy,” she said. “The show was an absolute joy and a testament to the fact that outdoor music and festivals can run safely and smoothly in this time of covid recovery. People need the arts and music now more than ever and being able to share that together between artists and audience was pretty stellar.” ROE was also playing her first ever gig with a full band, a direction her live performance was just about to take before the pandemic put the brakes on everything. She said: “It was the best feeling in the world to be back on a stage in front of an actual crowd again. “Everyone was in amazing spirits, and it felt so right to be there. This is something that Northern Ireland. really needed and I think the crew did an incredible job of making everyone feel safe and welcome.” With this successful trial run under their belts, the team at Stendhal are now preparing for their th anniversary events next month and August and Ross said that he hoped the overall total of  people currently allowed to gather for concerts would have increased by then. “We are hoping that we can have , people here in July and , here in August. The pilot events in England and around Europe have shown that events of that size can take place safely without social distancing, so what we are planning will be even safer. “We need guidance on the overall ‘outdoors summer’ and our place within that as soon as possible. We are good to go, we will do whatever it takes to safely deliver some much needed festivity for artists and audiences this summer.” A very limited numbers of tickets remain for Stendhal’s July and August anniversary events.  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --\u2028\u2028      \u2028  \u2028--    googletag.cmd.pushMost Popular Picture Gallery - Take a trip down memory lane overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"THROWBACK TUESDAY: Strictly Come Dancing in Ballerin \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"THROWBACK TUESDAY: Charity Strictly Come Dancing event in Ballerin  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry Death Notices - Tuesday, th June,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Man with ‘horrendous record’ live streamed himself on Facebook as he destroyed Derry flat overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The car park at Shantallow Health Centre.Derry car park compared to Grand Canyon because of large potholes to be repaired as part of new council plan overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Should there be railway stops at Strathfoyle, City of Derry Airport and Ballykelly  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Michael Gove arrives at the Destined centre in Derry.

Speed bumps. Frustrating to some, a necessary safety measure for others, but one thing the reduced speed does allow is for drivers to get a better look at their surroundings. Upperlands is very green. The village of Upperlands has some beautul scenery. To the right is dense woodland. Tall trees stretch towards the sky, while next to the road, an abundance of leafy branches shields the contents of the wood from view.

The Roman numerals on its clock in the courtyard, and the red post box on the edge of the square give the area a retro feel in keeping with the rest of the village. Further up the road, a piece of public art depicting the villages flax mill heritage, with a number of wheels arranged around a brick pillar on the corner of River View. Across the way, a raised row of stone-walled cottages projects an idyllic, country village vibe to the numerous vehicles that make their way through.     The sound of a strimmer floats down the hill through the trees. The owner could do with taking it into the forgotten park area next to the bridge. Long grass threatens to consume a neglected picnic bench in the corner of the park, while two wooden bins also fight to remain sovereign against its growth. A footbridge next to the road carries pedestrians across the river, next to the Flax Visitor Centre, which lies closed at present. Broken seats outside what was the Flax Coffee Shop. Bright orange barriers fence off what looks like an outdoor seating area at its attached coffee shop, where recently painted wooden seats sit disused and broken. There are red, white and blue painted kerb stones in the village, and since the turn of the year, signs opposing the Northern Ireland Protocol and a so-called sea border have been erected. They hang within eye shot on lamp posts and telegraph poles, displaying their stark message to the villages through traffic. On the Tirgarvil Road, a little circular sticker denouncing the sea border has been placed halfway over the L of Tirgarvil, which is a pity, as it would have fitted perfectly on the O of Road. The road itself is peaceful, with just the swish of the breeze in the upper echelons of the trees accompanying my footsteps.

The Body Gym has sat at the side of the road in Upperlands for as long as I can remember. It long predates the explosion of fitness suites and personal training that has marked the last ten years. As I enter at mid-morning on a Friday though, the buzz of clanking iron, pumping music and excited yelps is missing. It is deserted. Yellow arrows mark a clear path around the building to help gymgoers navigate an impressive array of equipment and machines. Brendan McQuaid pictured at his gym.

It was a shock to everybody using the gym and to ourselves, but we had to just go by the law.” With over  years experience in the business, Brendan is well-used to the challenges, but says the last  months have created a perfect storm for the fitness industry. “Lockdown has knocked the crowd back a bit, its hard to get the same people in,” he says. “Whenever people did come back in it was just like starting all over again. It was great the first day back, but at the same time, there were a lot who didnt come back. An anti-NI Protocol sticker has been attached to a road sign on the Tirgarvil Road. “We had it all painted the first time and done up, with new machines, so the second time it was just lying there. We had to just stick on the heat now and again to keep it right.” The surge in popularity in people exercising at home during lockdown has also had a knock-on effect on the industry. “The other thing is the home gyms. A lot of people have set up in their garages now and theyre not coming back to the gym,” says Brendan. “It knocks you back. Weve lost around  customers. Theyre training at home, andthey come back now itd be silly, after them spending thousands in their own sheds and garages. “We hope to build it up again. “Weve set up dferent prices and competitions to try and get people back in again. You have to be creative.” Brendan has a background in Strongman competitions, and the gym community is currently preparing to back one of their own in a reassuringly normal way. “We have one fella going for Irelands Strongest Man down in Letterkenny in a couple of months time, so hes training hard for it now,” he says.

Hopefully we can get back to normal soon.” Its the promise of normality that has sustained everyone throughout this prolonged ordeal, but the paradox of pushing forward while concern rises over the Delta iant has not gone unnoticed. For now though, it is a case of keep calm and carry on. Summers heat and the universal theatre of an international football tournament will provide a distraction. The children of Upperlands, though, will not be emulating Kalvin Phillips and Raheem Sterling anywhere near the villages industrial square. “No ball games,” screams a sign mounted high on one of the walls.

Michael Gove took the opportunity to call at local charity Destined at its North West Learning Disability Centre on Foyle Road on his way to fly back to London from City of Derry Airport after attending the Irish-British Council meeting in Enniskillen on Friday. Established in August , Destined, which also has a centre in Feeny village in Co Derry, is a voluntary charitable organisation which seeks to address the needs of people with learning disabilities. googletag.cmd.push Empowering people with learning disabilities and promoting social inclusion, Destined has as its core ethos the involvement and full participation of its members in all aspects of activity and at all levels of the decision-making process. During the visit, Dermot OHara, chief executive of Destined, made Mr Gove aware of a unique cocktail of problems facing Derry, including deprivation and rising mental health issues. The Minister was informed that the centre was damaged in an arson attack last year and receives very little funding. “Money is very, very tight, leaving the disabled community in a dire condition,” Mr OHara said. He urged Mr Gove to recognise the dficulties facing the city as it emerges from the Covid- pandemic and called on the British Government to make a ‘one off contribution to get us over this hill.     Speaking at the meeting, Donna Burke, of Dove House Advice Services, said they work closely with Destined. She took the opportunity to point out that Derry had the highest unemployment rate and some of the most deprived wards – the council area features in five of the top ten most deprived areas in the entire country. “People are having to choose between eat or heat,” she said. Most people with learning disabilities or autism are in receipt of Personal Independence Payment . She asked Mr Gove why these iniduals were being reassessed whenever they were lelong disorders. She added: “The duration of the award is a huge problem, how can claimants with learning disabilities receive an award that needs to be reviewed in two years  “It is a serious waste of departmental time because these are lelong conditions.” While acknowledging that Universal Credit aims to get people back in to work, Ms Burke said it was nowhere near enough to live on, adding: “There is not enough work for people in this area. “It needs to be addressed. Social welfare reform is failing to deliver. “We are extremely reluctant to put someone on Universal Credit because of the five week waiting period. “They have to borrow money and a deduction is made after the first payment.” In response, Mr Gove accepted that people were having to turn to payday loans or ‘unscrupulous’ lenders. He said the British Government was aware of problems and was trying to make the process ‘less traumatic’. Charles Lamberton, of Triax Neighbourhood Partnership, raised the issue of Brexit and how it would impact on local com- munities. He said PEACE funding and the European Social Fund targeted the most deprived areas and without them, places like Derry would suffer additional hardship. Mr Gove said the British Government would be replacing these funding pots with ‘at least the same amount of money.’ Mr Lamberton questioned that assertion, saying ‘we are a lead partner on the ESF programme’ and the funding being offered was ‘nowhere near the same amount of money.’ He added that City Deal monies were about skills and said the British Government should compensate Derry for what it would lose through EU funding. Assurances were given by Mr Gove that ‘specic funding’ would be examined ‘to ensure that no damage is done as a result of the transition’ with ‘new funds to take up slack in other areas.’ Explaining the dference Destined made to their lives, service users, including Roisin Doherty and Carmen McCallion, told Mr Gove that moving to a bigger facility had been ‘amazing.’ To round off the visit, service users gave Mr Gove a guided tour of Destineds facilities and the adjacent Foyle Valley Railway Museum.  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --\u2028\u2028      \u2028  \u2028--    googletag.cmd.pushMost Popular Picture Gallery - Take a trip down memory lane overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"THROWBACK TUESDAY: Strictly Come Dancing in Ballerin \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"THROWBACK TUESDAY: Charity Strictly Come Dancing event in Ballerin  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry Death Notices - Tuesday, th June,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Man with ‘horrendous record’ live streamed himself on Facebook as he destroyed Derry flat overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The car park at Shantallow Health Centre.Derry car park compared to Grand Canyon because of large potholes to be repaired as part of new council plan overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Should there be railway stops at Strathfoyle, City of Derry Airport and Ballykelly  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Michael Gove arrives at the Destined centre in Derry.

Nichola Mallon, Minister for Infrastructure, made her comments in a response to a question at Stormont.

Mrs Mallon said she wasambitious for the rail network and is keen to do all that she can to progress rail improvements within the limited budgetary envelope that I have available.

I have also commissioned additional studies to explore the possibility of a half hourly service from Derry to Belfast as well as providing additional halts at Ballykelly, Strathfoyle and City of Derry Airport Eglinton. In terms of their scope, the feasibility studies are considering the future demand and benefit for those future halts located between Bellarena and Derry.

A local councillor today compared the car park at Shantallow Health Centre to the Grand Canyon because of the large number of potholes. Derry City and Strabane District Council agreed today to carry out repairs at nine car parks under its management, including the Shantallow car park. The total cost of the repairs has been estimated at pound,. When the council was established in  as part of the Review of Public Administration, the local authority took on control of  off-street car parks from Transport NI. googletag.cmd.push A meeting of the councils Business and Culture committee was today told that an inspection was recently carried out on the state of the local car parks. As part of the inspection, the car parks were rated as high, medium or low based on the nature of the repairs needed. Nine car parks, including the one at Shantallow Health Centre along with car parks at William Street and Simpsons Brae in Derry and the council-owned car park in Claudy, were identied as high, which means they require immediate action. The other five high level car parks are in Strabane, Newtownstewart and Castlederg.     The estimated cost of the repairs to the Derry car parks would be: Shantallow Health Centre , William Streetand Simpsons Brae . According to the recent inspection, five other car parks in Derry have been identied as medium in terms of the repairs needed. These are located at Victoria Market, Carlisle Road, Foyle Valley Railway, Foyle Street and Spencer Road. The report stated that these car parks were in a satisfactory condition but do require some remedial works. The other eleven car parks in the council area inspected were said to require no action. Councillors at todays meeting agreed to approve a budget of pound, from council reserves to cover the costs of the car park repairs. SDLP councillor Rory Farrell said the initiative was very good news in particular for staff and patients who use Shantallow Health Centre. That car park is in a particularly bad state of repair and it is reminiscent of the Grand Canyon so people are going to be happy when this remedial work is completed, he said.  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --\u2028\u2028      \u2028  \u2028--    googletag.cmd.pushMost Popular Picture Gallery - Take a trip down memory lane overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"THROWBACK TUESDAY: Strictly Come Dancing in Ballerin \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"THROWBACK TUESDAY: Charity Strictly Come Dancing event in Ballerin  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry Death Notices - Tuesday, th June,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Man with ‘horrendous record’ live streamed himself on Facebook as he destroyed Derry flat overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The car park at Shantallow Health Centre.Derry car park compared to Grand Canyon because of large potholes to be repaired as part of new council plan overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Should there be railway stops at Strathfoyle, City of Derry Airport and Ballykelly  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Michael Gove arrives at the Destined centre in Derry.

Members heard that as the city and district gradually moves out of lockdown and the gradual lting of restrictions, teams within the council are progressing cautiously with a plan to progress with the festival in a new and revised format subject to COVID regulations and public health advice. Aeidin McCarter, Head of Culture with the council, explained that as the city and district takes tentative steps back towards le as we knew it pre-Covid, the council continues to follow the guidance from on managing COVID- with the Festival and Events team continuing to closely monitor the evolving situation and working closely with Tourism Northern Ireland, Tourism Ireland, Northern Ireland Tourism Alliance and other industry bodies. googletag.cmd.push She said that the council is very mindful that there is still a risk of proceeding with an event in its pre COVID- format. “Not only is it a potential risk to the general public who might attend the event, but to Council staff, contractors, artists, statutory authorities and agencies who collaborate with Council to deliver the events programme. For that reason there is likely to be a focus on a local and domestic audiences with international travel restrictions likely still to be in place, however there is an opportunity to promote to an international audience for future events through the delivery of quality digital content.”     She added that given this new environment, officers have been working with the public, private, voluntary and community sectors to create and plan programme content for Halloween . She said should some restrictions remain in place in October it is hoped a programme of some scale can be rolled out based on the learnings from Halloween , in particular the large scale inflatable trail. She informed elected members that with possible restrictions still in place the primary focus in planning for this year’s event is to be the extension and expansion of the Awakening the Walls programme out from the City Walls and into the wider city centre.  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --\u2028\u2028      \u2028  \u2028--    googletag.cmd.pushMost Popular Picture Gallery - Take a trip down memory lane overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"THROWBACK TUESDAY: Strictly Come Dancing in Ballerin \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"THROWBACK TUESDAY: Charity Strictly Come Dancing event in Ballerin  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry Death Notices - Tuesday, th June,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Man with ‘horrendous record’ live streamed himself on Facebook as he destroyed Derry flat overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The car park at Shantallow Health Centre.Derry car park compared to Grand Canyon because of large potholes to be repaired as part of new council plan overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Should there be railway stops at Strathfoyle, City of Derry Airport and Ballykelly  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Michael Gove arrives at the Destined centre in Derry.

Many of the songs were written in the living room of his family home in Downpatrick where his mother, Rosalind, still lives.Tim recently described  as a ldquocoming of age record.ldquoTherersquos a purity and innocence about  that rally captured the atmosphere at the time of its release, he said.ldquoItrsquos a coming of age album which has stood the test of time. We were all about  or  at the time.ldquoThe stars aligned for us. It was the right time. But in saying that, there was a pressure on us too. We were having to write the rest of the album, having already had a few hits. We had a lot to live up to.According to Rick, the band could not have foreseen their unexpected success, as  knocked Alanis Morrisettersquos Jagged Little Pill off the number one spot.ldquoWe werersquot expecting to write a number one album. We werenrsquot thinking of its legacy or anything like that, he said.ldquoWe were on a bit of a roll, starting from the previous year when wersquod release Kung Fu. Every time we released a single leading up to the album coming out, it brought us up to another level.ldquoIn a way, we thought we could do no wrong. But at the same time therewas pressure on us to finish it and get Goldfinger ready for a single release.The band had planned a year of touring last year to promote their Teenage Wildle:  Years of Ash, which traced their early days up to the  album release, Islands.Now back living and working in London and New York, Tim spent a good part on last year at home in Downpatrick as he was unable to travel back to New York due to the covid travel ban.He said: ldquoWe were all spread far and wide during lockdown so it was brilliant to be together again, playing music. Itrsquos the longest wersquore ever gone without seeing each other and playing as a band.However, he had good news for local fans and promised a gig at The Limelight in Belfast in December.Saturdayrsquos online show came just ahead of the band releasing an exclusive vinyl, BBC Sessions -, limited to , copies, on June .This collection highlights how they grew up in public, from Northern Irish underground garage band, through the years of the mad fame of the number one debut album, to the expansion of the line up and sound with the introduction of guitar legend Charlotte Hatherley.Some of these tracks are being made available for the first time since they were originally broadcast and include the voice of the late great John Peel introducing Ash for one of his Peel Acres sessions in April .Run with Stabal viewers can download the Stabal Viewer App to watch on a mobile device, tablet and on Smart TV when they purchase a  day on-demand pass, with exclusive access to bonus content..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9June2021-Ballynahinch.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch earmarked for £1m funding boost  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH could be in line for a near poundm investment to overhaul sports and community provision in the town.The Recorder understands that plans are being drawn up to invest around pound, on a major upgrade of the Windmill Street community centre, with pound, being earmarked to finance internal alterations of the local authority-owned Market House in the town centre.An ultra-modern G sports pitch is being considered for the Langley Road playing fields with the adjoining sports pavilion also in line for a major upgrade. The ious proposals have been outlined to Rowallane councillors who are excited at the proposed investment.Last year, the Recorder revealed that a major drive was underway to signicantly improve leisure provision in Ballynahinch with the local authority now putting the wheels in motion to achieve this goal.Politicians asked council officials to address the local authorityrsquos under investment in the town and ensure that enhancing leisure facilities was a critical component of the organisationrsquos future investment plans.Council officials had previously been asked to examine the potential of extending and upgrading the existing community centre at Windmill Street or a complete new-build, potentially on available land at the townrsquos Langley Road or at the Newcastle Road.However, they have opted to commit pound, on a major upgrade of the existing complex which will include a reconfiguration of the internal floorspace in a bid to increase the buildingrsquos usage.Major new leisure provision has recently been provided across the council area including Downpatrick, Saintfield and Newry, with plans in the pipeline for signicant investment in new leisure services in Newcastle.Politicians say while Ballynahinch has missed out on major local authority investment over recent years, the organisation needs to address this now to cater for the needs of local people and sporting organisations.While the planned investment is at the early stage, politicians have welcomed the local councilrsquos commitment to Ballynahinch and are keen to see the plans supported by the full council when they come to discuss them.It is understood that the proposed Ballynahinch investment will be discussed at a forthcoming meeting of the local authorityrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee which will then make a recommendation to the full council.Politicians are keen to work in partnership with council officials and the Ballynahinch Community Collective to improve sports and community provision in the town to meet the needs of a wide range of people.Elected representatives say Ballynahinch needs to be at the heart of planned investment in future leisure provision across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area.One politician said given the huge amount of money already investment in towns like Downpatrick and Saintfield, it is vital that Ballynahinch is no longer ldquoleft behind and gets a fair share of local authority funding.ldquoIt is early days as far as the proposed work is concerned, but with everyone on board we all hope that major progress can be made this year. There have been a series of constructive meetings to date and we hope progress can be made, said the politician.ldquoThere is an excellent working relationship between all the elected representatives across the Rowallane area and they are keen to improve leisure provision in Ballynahinch which requires modern leisure, sports and community provision.ldquoIt will be interesting to see the final costings for these ious schemes and to see work progressing on this much-needed work and included in the councilrsquos capital development programme. We are at the start of an exciting journey for the people of Ballynahinch..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9June2021-Bright.jpg","title":"Bright prove much too hot for Dromara  ","story":"DROMARA welcomed Bright to St Michaelrsquos Park last Friday night in the Corn na nGael competition.Dromara started well and were first to score on four minutes through a Paddy Doyle point. After a further decent passage of play, Brendan McNeill opened his account with a fantastic strike from about  metres and soon after added a free for Dromara to go three points up.Bright shot a few wides before a defence splitting run cut through the Dromara defence and the Bright attacker was pulled down in the box. The resultant penalty was brilliantly drilled down the middle and the scores were tied.Dromara hit back straight away with neat points from Eoin McEvoy and Michael Toner.Dromara lsquokeeper Seamus OrsquoHare was called into action and made a fantastic save to deny Bright the lead by forcing the ball around his post.The Bright shot-stopper took the resultant  and hit a sweet point straight between the uprights to leave Dromara one ahead at the water break.After the break the game got scrappy with both teams missing chances. Paddy Doyle was pulled down just outside the box and converted the free himself on  minutes.Dromara were defending in numbers and Bright could not make any headway, especially past the outstanding Daniel McNeill.The away side scored again in the th minute with a point that could have easily flown into the Dromara net.The hosts finished off the half with a number of blistering attacks which saw Michael McNeill and Colm Kelly scoring form great flowing movements and a terric long range shot from Brendan McNeill to finish the half in the ascendency.It was all tied at half-time with the scores Dromara - Bright -.Bright started the second half with a flourish and scored three points to bring the game back to just one between the teams.Dromara were still getting good possession through Paul and Colm Kelly in the middle while Conor Burns and Liam Kelly were moving well around the edges.However, Bright were playing ultra defensively and had  men behind the ball frustrating Dromararsquos attacks.Long range points were nearly the only way to score as Conor Burns and Colm Kelly duly obliged with two cracking points from way out the pitch.Bright hit back with a lovely long range point and as Dromara were camped on their opponentsrsquo  metre line, the home sidersquos attack broke down and Bright raced down the field to hit a superb counter attacking goal.Shortly afterwards Dromara lsquokeeper Seamus OrsquoHare pulled off another brilliant save to deny Bright but minutes later fate struck twice as the visitors dispossessed Dromara again and surged down the field to hit another goal.This score really sealed the victory for Bright, who added two quick points to pull away from Dromara with only several minutes remaining.To their credit Dromara battled on to the end and added two points to their tally from Colm and Liam Kelly but they will be left very frustrated by the fact that they controlled most of the possession but still lost the game.The Bright team left very pleased with their eveningrsquos work, having soaked up lots of Dromara pressure and hit great scores on the counter to win an entertaining encounter.Dromara -Bright -CORN NA

being supported by the National Lottery Heritage Fund.The local authority is spearheading an ambitious four-year project to signicantly enhance facilities at the sprawling park, with the lottery funding earmarked to restore a number of key features to help maximise its tourism potential.The Heritage Fund has already provided almost pound, in financial assistance and has now backed that up with an additional pound.m, with the local authority investing pound.m in the revitalisation scheme.Planners have also agreed to provide listed building consent for aspects of the investment scheme, with construction work already underway at the Bothy Yard in the forest park thanks to funding from the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs and the EU.Work on the main restoration project is scheduled to start shortly and complete by December , with the local authority agreeing a lease for the core areas within the park from the Forest Service until .Proposed work includes new landscape and drainage within The Grange courtyard, a new pedestrian path from the entrance gates to the main car park, a new vehicular road of Castle Avenue to the existing car park.There will also be a new traffic control barrier at Castle Avenue.Caravan spaces will be relocated with the feature entrance gates at the Castle Avenue entrance restored, alongside the restoration of The Grange courtyard buildings and the reconstruction of a derelict building block.The parkrsquos th century greenhouse is also being restored with the reconstruction of the propagation house and cold frames, while one of several outbuildings will be converted to an office and volunteer space.Elsewhere, visitor facilities will be created in the Stove Conservatory including an interpretation centre, with a  lt installed to provide access to the terrance for people with reduced mobility.Since , the local authority has been progressing with plans to restore the natural and built heritage of the forest park with several key stakeholders including Forest Service.The councilrsquos vision is to create a heritage-led destination which protects the heritage of Castlewellan Forest Park for future generations, whilst also providing opportunities for local people and visitors to learn more about the landscape.The so-called ldquoRe-rooting our past in the Future: Castlewellan Historic Demesne project is designed to connect people with the built and natural heritage within the forest park, as well as restoring and celebrating its unique bioersity.This includes the restoration of a living arboretum, containing some of the most signicant collection of trees and shrubs on the island of Ireland.As part of the project, the Grange will be developed into a visitor core with the creation of a welcome centre, community space and cafeacute facilities, with the courtyards transformed into a vibrant visitor hub and dedicated centre for community use with interpretation, activities, events,

hoping to play its part in the drive to tackle the districtrsquos dog fouling problem.Its members have started spraying dog dirt with bright pink chalk and explained that there are two reasons for this.The Drumaness and District Community Association is spraying the dog dirt to make people aware of its presence and hopes that by doing so it will encourage dog owners to clean up after their pets. Group members are using chalk as it is not harmful to the environment.Group chairman Malachy Hillen said dog fouling and littering were the two most common complaints received by the association.ldquoWhile most dog owners are very responsible and pick up after their pets, there are those that still think that it is acceptable to leave the mess for children and others to walk through, he said Malachy hopes that by spraying dog dirt with the pink chalk people will not walk through it.ldquoWe also hope that our initiative can kick-start a conversation about the scale of the dog fouling problem across the district and hopefully shame owners into lting up after their pets, he said.He added: ldquoWe need to send out a strong message that this bad behaviour will not be tolerated and that Newry, Mourne and Down Council will issue pound fines to those who do not comply with the law.News of the Drumaness grouprsquos decision comes after the local authority decided against using DNA testing on dog dirt in a bid to trace animals whose owners allow them to use public areas as open air toilets will not come as a major surprise.In addition, council officials have ruled out publicly naming and shaming dog owners who do not clean up after their pets but admit that fouling is a major issue that issue must be addressed and those who deliberately flout the law need to be punished.Council officials say that enforcement is a key issue moving forward, but when it comes to dishing out fines, Newry, Mourne and Down Council is lagging well behind its neighbour, Ards and North Down Council.Local politicians insist that dealing with the problem starts with dog owners themselves who need to show more respect for their local community and recreational areas which are not solely in existence for animals to relieve themselves.There are a number of notable dog fouling hot spots across the district and the issue is one that will have been raised with every one of the local authorityrsquos  councillors.This month, a new publicity programme designed to heighten awareness around the dog fouling issue is due to be rolled out as the districtrsquos dog fouling problem shows no sign of abating..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9June2021-Drumaness(1).jpg","title":"Drumaness Superkings defeat Victoria in final  ","story":"DRUMANESS Superkings were crowned T Bowl champions after securing a four-wicket win over Victoria in an entertaining encounter on Saturday.Drumaness Superkings won the toss and asked Victoria to bat.Victoria opened with Gray and Vennard but in the third over of the match with the score on , Darren Oldroyd struck when he had Vennard caught at mid off by Gary Moore for two.Oldroyd managed to strike again three balls later with a super delivery that G McClune edged behind to Drumaness Superkings wicket keeper captain Neil Gelston.Gilpin joined Gray and the pair aimed to rebuild for Victoria with Gray being the aggressor.Victoria had reached  from twelve overs with Gray passing  with a six before Neil Walsh bowled Gilpin for seven.

Its financial support for ephemeral projects can never result in what Ulster-Scots would really need in order to avail of any supposed ‘benefit’ arising from the ‘new framework’: a properly planned infrastructure, backed by established research and commitment such as the Ulster-Scots Language Society brought to its Partnership Agreement with the USAIG.

This meant that my son, while denied the social enrichment of school and play facilities, was able to occasionally meet and have fun with his cousins.What started as a long-deprived opportunity to enjoy the company of loved ones, soon developed into a routine. On Saturday evenings one family travelled to the home of the other, the children played excitedly together while the grown-ups enjoyed a glass of wine or beer and a takeaway meal.After that we relaxed on the sofa while the kids watched a film or played video games in the next room.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...AdeleIt was in these moments of relaxation that a habit developed which is now so familiar that I cannot remember how it began, or what I did on Saturday nights before. In turn, each of the adults took the remote control and instructed Alexa to play their chosen song. The evenings passed easily in this way, with a medley of musical tastes forming the backdrop to laughs and shared anecdotes.The tenacity of the habit is such that even now, when the restrictions have loosened and we can do more things, we still almost always find ourselves in one house or the other on Saturday nights passing the little black remote control around and playing our songs. There have been plenty of dficult days in the last couple of years, but these moments have been treasured.None of which is to suggest that the game is perfect. The relaxed social environment and the addition of alcohol ensure that there is often so much chatter that the music is drowned out.My many suggestions on how to formalise the rules and improve the efficiency of the game remain unfulfilled. My entirely earnest proposition that we should erect a whiteboard to record song choices and avoid duplication, was laughed at .Similarly, my recommendations that a stopwatch should be introduced to make sure participants take no more than  seconds on their song choice, or even better, they are submitted in writing in advance, have been met equally unsympathetically. In my utopia, all of the songs would be chosen by me and everyone  would listen in respectful silence but when other people are involved, I am prepared to give and take a little.Being a middle-aged man, the majority of my song choices are predictable. There is a fair amount of Bruce Springsteen, Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan, a smattering of Dire Straits and The Housemartins and a dose of Neil Young and The Waterboys.Occasionally, I will go a bit more alternative and indulge in some Richard Thompson, Midnight Oil, Billy Bragg or Eric Bogle. To be even more obscure I might introduce some Jackie Leven or Andy White. My mind is sadly wired to think there is credibility in finding a song that nobody  has heard of.Sometimes, just to really annoy everyone, I even select a classical piece.As I have played this game over the months, and listened to my family’s musical choices, a gradual realisation has spread across me. I know absolutely nothing about contemporary songs or artists. For me, music ended somewhere late in the last millennium, around the time when Oasis and Blur were locked in battle and Britpop ruled the charts.This is not to suggest that I am entirely unaware of modern musicians, I’ve heard of Ned Shearer, Edel and Manye Vest. Nor, is this to be interpreted as an old person’s lament that all young people’s music is rubbish. I have no argument that music now is inferior to how it used to be rather the point is my absolute ignorance of it.Lately I have been wondering why this should be so. I am not aware of any particular point when I decided to pull up the drawbridge and stop accepting requests. Perhaps there was an unconscious decision at some point  years ago when my brain simply decided that it had had enough, had reached saturation point in terms of artistic acceptance.Maybe it is just a natural part of growing older, that as fashions and trends change, we all get mentally stuck, become old people yearning for the sounds that we associate with a time when we were young, ambitious and when the world still seemed full of promise. I don’t know.Then I thought about it some more. I used to have a few vinyl records and a bedroom full of cassette tapes . When CDs were introduced, I gamely tried to keep up, buying a new stereo and spending money modernising my album collection.After the demise of CDs, I’m not sure I ever really understood the process of collecting music again. It became something that people had on their phones through apps which I had heard of but knew nothing about. Top of the Pops was gone, and I never owned an iPod or an Mp player. Sales were replaced by streams and downloads. Perhaps, for me, music was the main victim of a world which was changing faster than I could understand.

This is the only way forward to finally resolve this issue.”Mr Wilson then issued a statement early yesterday morning via the DUP’s central press office, saying: “Rather than running to Her Majesty’s when they can’t get their way, Republicans should respect our mandate.“Sinn Fein is playing the politics of ransom and are placing culture above health, education and economic recovery.”When asked what the DUP may actually dothe Tories go ahead and enable an Irish language act, Mr Wilson told the News Letter yesterday: “I hope the Secretary of State has enough moral courage and political understanding to know that this would be a disastrous decision for him.“Morally, how can he possibly – for the fourth time – roll over to Sinn Fein “He did it on gay marriage. Did it on abortion. He’s done it on the Protocol.”Mr Wilson wondered how,such a “scandalous” intervention comes to pass over an Irish language act, Brandon Lewiscan “expect unionists to co-operate in an Assembly which he robs of its devolved powers every time Sinn Fein demands he does so”. Mr Wilson went on to add: “He has got to understand there is only a certain level of toleration of this.“The Assembly is of low enough standing at present, especially amongst the unionist community.“I think that, leaving aside what political parties may do, many unionists will ask the question: What is the point of voting people into an Assembly on the basis that they make certain promises to do things – or not to do things – and then are incapable of keeping those promises, because the ability to deliver on them is taken off them by the British government ”Askedhe was saying that the DUP’s next step would be to ditch its involvement with the AssemblyBrandon Lewis accedes to Sinn Fein’s demand on an Irish act, Mr Wilson replied: “Let’s put it this way. Sinn Fein say they will not participatethey don’t get an Irish language [act]. Equally, he’s got to ask himself the question: Can unionists participate in an Assembly where all the power to deal with the issues which are important to their community is taken from them at a whim by the Secretary of State “He’s got to ask himself: Would any self-respecting political party or politician allow themselves to be messed around like that ”He said that he had not discussed the matter with party colleagues, but added: “It would be humiliating to participate in an elected body where, on a regular basis , powers are taken from you just in order to keep Sinn Fein happy...“By refusing to co-operate in that game, people in Northern Ireland should recognise that we are actually defending the whole concept of local democracy.“Parties in Scotland and parties in Wales wouldn’t stand for that in their devolved administrations!”Mr Wilson also noted that, during the Sinn Fein-induced limbo from  to , the UK government “wouldn’t lt a finger” to take control of politicial decision-making in the Province “because [they] couldn’t get Sinn Fein’s agreement”.More from this reporter:  NI Protocol: Northern Ireland handles more import paperwork than whole of France Paramilitary-linked loyalist group aims to take Protocol battle to EU——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Several researchers have recently raised the problem as draining productivity across workforces.In the Vale, council bosses are trying to reduce presenteeism with digital apps, wellbeing programmes, and managing the use of annual leave. A larger driver is thought to be stress.After stress, the most common reason for sickness absences were musculoskeletal, viral infection, and operations. Four out of five days absent last year were classed as long-term sickness, meaning taking time off for more than four weeks.     Staff at the Vale council who report stress or anxiety problems are offered counselling and advice from occupational health.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe highly anticipated summit in the Swiss city of Geneva is the first time Mr Biden has met Mr Putin since taking office, and is a moment of high-stakes diplomacy at a time when both leaders agree that US Russian relations are at an all-time low.While neither side holds out much hope for meaningful areas of agreement, each leader brings his own goals to the summit table. vw,vw,px, px\"US President Joe Biden, left, meets Swiss President Guy Parmelin ahead of the summit So what is each president hoping to achieve in Switzerland Mr Biden and his aides have made clear that he will not follow in the footsteps of his recent predecessors by aiming to radically alter the United Statesrsquo ties to Russia. Instead, the White House is looking for a more modest though vitally important goal: to move towards a more predictable relationship and attempt to rein in Russiarsquos disruptive behaviour.Mr Bidenrsquos first overseas trip was deliberately sequenced so that he will meet with Mr Putin only after spending days meeting with European allies and powerful democracies, including a gathering at Nato, the decades-old alliance formed to serve as a bulwark to Russian aggression.He hoped to project a sense of unity and renewed co-operation after four years of tumult under former president Donald Trump, who often tried to cosy up to the Russian president.Mr Biden will push Mr Putin to stop meddling in democratic elections, to ease tensions with Ukraine and to stop giving safe harbour to hackers carrying out cyber and ransomware attacks.Aides believe that lowering the temperature with Russia will also reinforce the United Statesrsquo ties to democracies existing in Moscowrsquos shadow. vw,vw,px, px\"Swiss police block a road in Geneva that will be used by Mr Biden and Mr Putin      National security adviser Jake Sullivan said Mr Biden would look for ldquoareas where, in our common interest, we can work together to produce outcomes that are mdash that work for the United States and for the American people.Mr Sullivan said that Mr Bidenrsquos other message would be more stick than carrot: ldquoHow do we send a clear message about those harmful activities that we will not tolerate and to which we will respond There have been brief moments of common ground. Moscow and Washington have shown a shared interest in restarting talks on strategic stability to work out a follow-up deal to the New START, the last remaining US Russian arms control pact that was extended for five years in January.Mr Biden will exhort Mr Putin on human rights, including the poisoning and imprisonment of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, not to support the regime in Belarus that carried out a recent skyjacking and to stop interfering with other nationsrsquo elections.Cyber will also be a focal point, with the Geneva summit coming just days after Nato expanded its Article  mutual defence pact to include cyberattacks.But the US president acknowledged that there may be no way to keep Mr Putin in check. vw,vw,px, px\"Mr Putinrsquos main goal will be to draw his red lines for the new US administration Meanwhile, Mr Putinrsquos main goal will be to draw his red lines for the new US administration and negotiate a tense status quo that would protect Moscowrsquos vital interests.The Russian leader does not hope for a new detente to mend the rt caused by Russiarsquos  annexation of Ukrainersquos Crimean Peninsula.Nor does he count on a rollback of the crippling US and EU sanctions that have restricted Moscowrsquos access to global financial markets and top Western technologies.Mr Putinrsquos task now is more modest mdash to spell out Russiarsquos top security concerns and try to restore basic channels of communication that would prevent an even more dangerous destabilisation.The main red line for Moscow is Ukrainersquos aspirations to join Nato. Fearing its bid for the alliance membership, Mr Putin responded to the  ousting of Ukrainersquos Russia-friendly president by annexing Crimea and throwing Moscowrsquos weight behind a separatist insurgency in the countryrsquos eastern industrial heartland, where the seven-year conflict has killed more than ,.When tensions along the line of contact in Ukrainersquos east rose earlier this year, Russia quickly increased its troops near Ukraine and warned Kievrsquos leaders that it would intervene militarilythey tried to reclaim the rebel-controlled regions by force.While taking a tough stance on Ukraine, the Russian leader could show a degree of flexibility on other global hotspots. vw,vw,px, px\"Flags of the US and Russia being waved on the Mont Blanc bridge in Geneva ahead of the summit Even though Moscow has been critical of the US-led military campaign in Afghanistan, it is interested in a settlement that would prevent the country from plunging into chaos following the US troopsrsquo withdrawal later this year, fearing that instability could spill into ex-Soviet Central Asia.Russia also has been involved in painstaking international talks to help repair a nuclear deal with Iran that was spiked by Mr Trump, and it has expressed a willingness to co-operate with the US in efforts to restart the stalled Middle East peace talks.And the Kremlin would be interested in working out a deal on Syria, where Moscowrsquos military campaign helped President Bashar Assadrsquos government reclaim control over most of the country after a devastating civil war and the US has maintained a limited military presence.Russia has said it is ready to include its prospective doomsday weapons mdash such as the Poseidon atomic-powered, nuclear-armed underwater drone and the Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile mdash in the talks, on condition the US brings its missile defence and possible space-based weapons into the equation.Mr Putin also has emphasised Russiarsquos readiness to make joint efforts to address climate change and cope with the coronavirus pandemic.He called for establishing a dialogue on cybercrime, noting that Moscow could agree to extradite cybercrime suspects to the USWashington assumed the same obligation.The White House has strongly downplayed the idea of a cybercriminal prisoner exchange..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: What are Biden and Putin us goals at summit  article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We’re an accredited pre-school, funded by the education board and cross-community.”With an background in education Adela decided to make a move into early years provision and hired a hall from the local church to hold a public meeting, a committee was formed that night and with hard work and dedication Button Moon took shape.Initially it ran in a church hall but Adela wanted to develop the group along more cross community lines and so needed new premises.The council approached her about using the recreation centre in Tandragee and the playgroup moved into purpose built rooms there.The playgroup has enjoyed tremendous success since, with Adela as the driving force.But Adela was keen to point out: “I couldn’t have done it without the staff, parents and children - the children are the backbone of Button Moon.”She said the staff at Button Moon had given her tremendous support, with major challenges in the past year.“It’s been dficult year, we had to do a lot of remote learning and I think I’m a lot closer to the parents now because of that remote learning.”And a philosophical Adela added: “Good times like this make the bad times go away.”Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

In light of the relaxation of COVID- restrictions, which has enabled a number of close contact services to resume including driving tests, the DVA has carried out a review of its current vehicle testing processes in order toto its normal  minute test slot for cars and light goods vehicles.

To manage the transition to full service delivery, Temporary Exemption Certicatesfor all qualying vehicles will be extended by one further month.

Minister Mallon said:  “Over recent months the DVA has worked hard to increase its vehicle testing capacity but has been working at a reduced capacity due to the safety measures it introduced to help stop the spread of COVID-. “The DVA is taking steps to reinstate its normal vehicle test times from  July, which will allow all vehicles to be brought forward for a test. This will be kept under ongoing review depending on the course of the epidemic. “The DVA is in the process of revising its risk assessments, which will include appropriate mitigation measures, and will engage on them with staff and Trade Union representatives. “Existing TECs applied to eligible private cars, light goods vehicles and motorcycles aged - years will be extended by a further month from the date the existing exemption ends.  \"Four year old cars and motorcycles and three year old light goods vehicles due a first time test will have a five month TEC applied from the date their first MOT is due.” Continuing the Minister said:  \"Road safety remains a signicant priority.
