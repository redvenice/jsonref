Photograph: Christopher FurlongGetty Images The Government is discussing contingency plans with industry to organise energy rationing if the Ukraine war leads to an interruption in supplies of Russian oil and gas into European markets. The talks, acknowledged by three people briefed on the situation, have centred on concerns about the stability of winter supplies this year if there is no end to the Russian invasion and western sanctions against the Kremlin escalate. “It’s very clear that it’s a sensitive situation at the moment because of the war,” said an informed source. “There are meetings taking place. There are contingency plans that have always been there. They’re being dusted down to see if they need to be updated.”One question under discussion is the prospect of keeping the coal-fired power station at Moneypoint open for up to three years beyond its scheduled 2025 closure while waiting for new gas-fired electricity generation to come on stream. Such a move would undercut efforts to curtail carbon emissions but is increasingly seen as a step that may be necessary to boost reserve generation capacity. The talks come as Russian president Vladimir Putin raised the stakes in the confrontation by signing a decree to halt supply contracts with “unfriendly counties” if they do not pay in roubles from Friday. Big European buyers such as Germany have been refusing to pay in roubles for fear of weakening the impact of sanctions and strengthening the Russian currency. Ireland imports some 75 per cent of its gas, with the bulk of those supplies coming from Norway via the British network and only a small proportion originating in Russia. Although senior figures with knowledge of the talks said that factor provides a good degree of protection to energy supplies in the short term, there was concern even before the Putin decree of Thursday that the situation could spiral beyond control if the war is not settled.Last-resort stepsPeople familiar with the talks in Dublin said the invasion has led senior officials to discuss last-resort steps with industry to decide on the allocation of electricity and gas supplies if the energy flow is interrupted or pricing reaches unsustainable levels.Although hospitals and schools would be a top priority, one business figure said the question of maintaining food supply-chain connectivity had emerged as a big issue because of pressures on the international food supply chain. A Government energy security review, due this summer, is likely to list the possibility of State-owned liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage being developed to facilitate the delivery of reserve supplies, it is understood. Global leaders want to increase LNG imports from the US into Europe to offset demand for Russian energy. But it remains unclear whether Ireland could acquire temporary seaborne storage before building any infrastructure.

Photograph: Alan BetsonThe  Last week school principal Enda McGorman received word that four of his teachers were out for Covid reasons. The following morning, the number had doubled to eight.“This is every bit as bad as it was last January and December, if not worse,” says McGorman, principal of Mother of Hope National School, Littlepace in Dublin 15.This week the 450-pupil school had a third of staff out of action. As a result, it had to ert support teachers for special needs pupils into mainstream teaching roles to prevent classes being sent home.The school, like many others across the State, has struggling to keep its doors open during the latest Covid wave. But the rolling nature of school disruption is raising fresh concerns over the long-term scale of learning loss among pupils.“This feels different,” says McGorman. “The repeated disruption is massively damaging for schools and pupils . . . we’re seeing staff getting repeat infections now. As soon as some recover, others are off.“At least during the winter we had substitute teachers available to us. Now, they are back in college or on placement, where they’re not available to work as substitutes. Even the substitute panel of teachers, which is supposed to provide cover, has been hit by Covid.”McGorman says the scale of learning loss after three years of disruption is now emerging as a major source of concern.“We’re seeing it right across the board: they lost out on learning in the curriculum, general knowledge, fine motor skills, gross motor skills, handwriting . . . it’s right across the board. You even see it watching then playing soccer, with legs flailing around the places . . . we really have a job of work to make up those losses.”Nationally, there appears to be a similar picture.Páiric Clerkin of the Irish Primary Principals’ Network says that while Covid is not making headlines, the disruption in schools is very real.“Schools are under the exact same pressure as were during the height of the crisis,” says Clerkin.The exact scale of learning loss in Irish schools had yet to be quantified. Results of last year’s standardised tests at primary level – due later this year – should give the first sense of how far children are lagging behind.However, research elsewhere gives a clue over the scale of losses. In the UK, a survey of teachers and school leaders found that students were roughly three months behind by last July. The Office for Standards in Education found that younger students had regressed to the point where some forgot how to hold a pencil.Learning lossesIn the Netherlands, an April 2021 study found that primary school students performed on average 20 per cent worse on tests than the equivalent cohorts had for the three years before the pandemic. Among students from disadvantaged families, learning losses tended to be even greater, up to 60 per cent larger than for the general population.Both countries have spent billions on tutoring, counselling and summer programmes for children, but that extra support has not yet caught them up. Disadvantaged students and those with special needs have fared worst.In Ireland, Minister for Education Nora Foley has pointed to the Covid Learning and Support Scheme which aims to help schools mitigate the adverse impacts of Covid-19 on student learning loss.She said up to €52 million in extra teaching hours for schools has been made available during the current school year. Enhanced allocations are provided for schools with Deis, or disadvantaged, status.McGorman, however, says his school has been unable to access extra teaching hours due to a crisis in substitution cover.“Any substitutes staff we can get our hands on are being used to plug holes. We just don’t have access to teaches to run it,” he says.He is unsure if the school will be able to bank the hours it was entitled to, or if the school will lose them at the end of the academic year.“What we really need is longer-term planning. All these initiatives are happening too late, and then we can’t find the teaching staff to run them.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"huge question mark looms over ireland s energy security","story":" Delaying the scheduled closure of the coal-fired power station at Moneypoint is among the measures under consideration. Photograph: Neil WarnerVladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine has already led to surging prices for gas, oil, motor fuel and power since the invasion began in February. Now questions are being raised about the security of supplies as the threat of more western sanctions against the Kremlin and a row over payments cast uncertainty over imports of Russian energy.As if there was any doubt about the intensity of the energy market shock set off by the military campaign, German moves to activate the first phase of an emergency plan that could lead to gas rationing are salutary. The development comes in spite of chancellor Olaf Scholz’s opposition to an EU ban on oil and gas from Russia. That stance will be tested again and again in coming weeks if the Russians dig in for the long haul in Ukraine and there is no deal to end the conflict. Putin is using energy as a lever by insisting on payments for energy in roubles, something western buyers won’t accept because it would dim the impact of financial sanctions and boost the Russian currency.Taoiseach Micheál Martin was at pains to stress in an RTÉ interview on Thursday that he did not speak of winter fuel shortages when he addressed the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party on Wednesday evening. “I simply said that energy security is something we have to focus on and prepare for over the next winter period,” Mr Martin said.FalloutThis question ranks high on the agenda in talks between officials and industry on the fallout from war. Concern has been raised in such engagements, constant since the invasion began, about the stability of supplies next winter when domestic demand for gas and electricity is at its highest and the full brunt of any interruption to Russian supplies would hit markets. That in turn has led people to dust down contingency plans that deal with supply priorities if energy has to be rationed in Ireland.“It’s happening in real time,” said one energy industry figure with knowledge of the talks. “It’s a normal part of looking ahead, looking around the corner at what would need to be done.”Measures discussed to mitigate any supply crunch include the prospect of delaying the 2025 scheduled closure of the giant coal-fired power station at Moneypoint, where the ESB has already resolved to stop using Russian coal in favour of Colombian supplies. People familiar with the discussions are quick to acknowledge that such a move would blunt efforts to reach climate targets, yet the war has changed the debate. “Climate is rather important but the security of supply trumps it,” the energy figure said. Another person, familiar with the thinking in the Coalition, said: “Nobody wants to be in this space.”Liquefied natural gasAnother option under examination is the development of some State-owned liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage capacity. Such an initiative would be separate to plans by the privately-owned US group New Fortress Energy to build a €650 million LNG plant in Co Kerry, which have raised the hackles of the Greens and environmentalists. That plan is before An Bord Pleanála with a decision due in September, but Government policy is opposed to imports of fracked gas.For all that, there is some confidence in industry and official circles that a short-term gas supply crunch can be avoided. The reason for that is the source of Irish supplies, a quarter of which come from the domestic Corrib field on the western coast while the remainder is imported on pipelines into Northern Ireland from Britain, which takes much of its supply from Norway. Although the current proportion of Russian gas supplies into Britain is said to be about 6per cent, a senior business person said it would not take much of an interruption to Russian supplies to distort the UK market at a time of higher seasonal demand for gas.Still, the lesson learned in the weeks since Russian tanks stormed Ukraine is prices can rise rapidly even when gas and oil continue to flow through pipelines. If rocketing prices have created a political difficulty for the Government, any energy rationing would lead to problems of a different order.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"ireland takes to its feet for climb with charlie bird","story":"Charlie Bird  trains for his Croagh Patrick climb: While Bird will lead hundreds up the famed pilgrimage route on Croagh Patrick, many more have organised their own treks in  support for his struggle with motor neurone disease. Photograph: Maxwells From the Donegal highlands, to the drumlins of Cavan and onto the rocky headlands of Cork, Ireland is taking to its feet this weekend as thousands countrywide prepare to pull on their hiking boots with Charlie Bird. “I have no idea how many people are going to scale the Reek with me, but I feel it is going to be a day like no other,” he says. While Bird will lead hundreds up the famed pilgrimage route on Croagh Patrick, many more have organised their own treks in a national outpouring of support for his struggle with motor neurone disease (MND).Fundraisers – as far away as Australia, North America and the United Arab Emirates – are expected to take in more than €1 million by the time the first boots stomp on Saturday for the Climb with Charlie challenge. The money will go to the Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association and suicide charity Pieta. Like countless others, Kathleen Gill, of Clonmany, Co Donegal, was so moved by Bird’s disclosure of his diagnosis and determination on the Late Late Show, that she organised a climb of the 494m high Cnoc Bulaba, towering over the Inishowen village. Gill was determined to pay tribute to her uncle Jimmy Harkin, who died of MND at the age of 49 in 2009, and who always scaled Bulaba on his frequent trips home from Birmingham. “When we watched Charlie Bird being interviewed on the Late Late, it brought it all back,” she says, “how horrific the diagnosis is.” “When it affects your own family you can immediately relate to it, you know the journey he is on.”Harkin, the youngest of 10 children, was a “fantastic character, very jovial, and a great singer”, says Gill. “Like Charlie, he dealt with his diagnosis very courageously and kept a positive front. We all prayed for a miracle but it just wasn’t to be.“It will be very emotional for everybody on the day, and also to watch Charlie, who has been very open and honest about how he is dealing with it. It is lovely to know he is getting strength from the show of support and solidarity,” says Gill. With two days to go before the climb we have now raised almost Eight Hundred and Fifty thousand Euro and I think we will go beyond our target of ONE million euro. Thanks to everyone for extending the hand of friendship. I am overwhelmed by what is happening. Thanks 🙏— Charlie Bird (@charliebird49) “I think it is also very symbolic. Motor neurone is a climb you have to keep going.”Nationwide challengesOriginally from Kildare, Siobhán Bennett, now living in Connemara, organised one of the most challenging climbs planned, the 700m high Ben Gorm overlooking Killary fjord in Co Mayo. Some 50 climbers will partake in the trek expected to take three-six hours. “It is not easy by any means,” says Bennett. “But the views are stunning. “It has got the imagination of people. The fact that Charlie’s voice is going – the voice we always knew from when we were very little…” she trails off. “I think everyone has a Charlie Bird memory.”In Co Louth, Craig Ballentine is making final preparations for a 6km night-time trek from Glenmore to Barnavave peak (350m), illuminated with 100 torches. Climbers will “watch the sunset, then admire the stars and views over Carlingford, Dundalk Bay and down to Malahide”, he says. Pitched as “walk and talk therapy”, the 8pm start – “when people are biologically more relaxed” – will allow more than 20 climbers to open up about their own experiences with MND and mental health issues. With the mental health crisis after the pandemic, the success of Climb with Charlie has shown the country at its best, he adds. “This is Ireland sticking together and helping each other.” Ursula O’Kennedy will be among about 20 Irish expatriates trekking up Mount Cooke in Western Australia as much of Ireland sleeps. Based in Perth, the Newry-born special needs teacher said Bird’s story and positivity galvanised her and husband Aidan, from Galway, to plan the 17.5km trek. “It is the least we can do. He has done so much for us all over the years.“It will be the middle of the night at home. I reckon we will be the first to finish on the day, unless Sydney gets ahead of us,” says O’Kennedy. Temperatures will range between seven degrees in the east and about 10 degrees in the west “and as we climb of course it will be colder. So layer up and bring a rain jacket”.Paul Allen, a public relations consultant and former colleague of Bird, co-ordinating the treks, says they are “nearly afraid to speculate” on numbers that will turn out on the day. Such is its success, the organisers have switched mode to warning those not able for the challenge not to put themselves at risk. “People can walk in their local area, or on the beach. It doesn’t have to be a situation where people are endangering themselves,” says Allen. Bird will be joined by 500 “friends and family” including wife Claire, daughters Orla and Neasa, and five grandchildren, as well as singer Daniel O’Donnell, Matt Molloy of the Chieftains, boxer Barry McGuigan on the 2½-hour trek up and down Croagh Patrick, with plans to live-stream it online. Once atop the Reek, Bird will light five candles, for Ukraine, those suffering terminal illness as well as loved ones. A local pipe band will play on the mountain.At the peak, where he will make remarks through a voice app, he will also light a candle for friend and cervical cancer campaigner Vicky Phelan. “Vicky had hoped to be at the bottom of Croagh Patrick to wave us all off,” he says. “Unfortunately, because of her current health situation she can’t make it, but some of her family will be with us for the climb.”Bird says he “would love people on top of Croagh Patrick to have a minute of silence for the people of Ukraine as well”.“I have one goal left on my own bucket list and that is to continue to extend the hand of friendship while I can,” he adds.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillSenior figures in Government have privately expressed scepticism about plans to make directors of social media companies personally criminally liable for content on their platforms.The plans were discussed on Wednesday by Minister for Culture and Media Catherine Martin and Fianna Fáil Senators.Speaking on condition of anonymity, several senior Government figures said they thought the prospect of senior executives in social media companies being jailed was remote, and they expected the draft legislation would not be significantly toughened during the legislative process.But Fianna Fáil Senator Malcolm Byrne, who has championed efforts to strengthen the Bill, said the “goal is not to have a load of prosecutions – it’s to change the culture of these companies”.Mr Byrne and fellow Senator Shane Cassells met Ms Martin to discuss proposed amendments which would toughen the planned online safety Bill, published by Ms Martin’s department in January.While the Minister’s spokesman pointed out there is already a provision of the Bill which could be used to extend criminal liability to directors of social media companies, the amendments proposed by the Senators would make a prosecution much easier and more likely.Under the current draft, social media company directors could be prosecuted, but only when they have ignored specific instructions from the new Media Commission. Changes proposed by the Fianna Fáil Senators would make it possible to prosecute directors if they knowingly or recklessly allowed their platforms to be used for online harm.Ms Martin told the Senators she was happy to consider amendments and work with them to achieve a shared goal.Mr Byrne said the draft legislation “is nowhere near as strong as it needs to be”. He said if the algorithms used by social media companies deliberately directed people to harmful content – he cited the example of girls being directed to sites which promoted eating disorders – then the directors should be criminally liable.Spokespersons for Facebook and Twitter declined to comment.The Minister’s spokesman said she would like to see the Bill enacted before the summer recess. He declined to give details of any meetings that Ms Martin had with the social media giants on the Bill, but the lobbying register shows she was lobbied by both Twitter and Facebook.The social media giants are expected to strongly oppose the director liability measures in the Bill. Sources say they are likely to press the case with the Government that such provisions would harm Ireland’s image among tech companies as a destination for inward investment. Many of the world’s leading tech companies have European headquarters in Dublin, and pay hundreds of millions of euro in corporation tax to the Irish exchequer every year.

Photograph: Mikhail KlimentyevSputnikAFP via Getty Images France and Germany have advised energy companies to ignore a Russian decree that, from Friday, requires all energy bills to be settled in roubles – or via rouble bank accounts.Amid a growing energy stand-off with Moscow, US president Joe Biden speculated that Russian leader Vladimir Putin was growing increasingly isolated.“There’s some indication that he has fired or put under house arrest some of his advisers,” said Mr Biden, before admitting he did not “have that much hard evidence”.As week five of the war in Ukraine begins, the Red Cross hopes to evacuate residents of the devastated port city of Mariupol on Friday morning, just as Russian troops reportedly regroup in the eastern regions.In a television address on Thursday, Mr Putin said Russian energy customers could, from Friday, pay their bills only via a rouble account with the non-sanctioned Gazprombank or be considered in “default, with all the ensuing consequences”.Chancellor Olaf Scholz, after a phone call with Mr Putin on Wednesday evening, instructed all German customers of Russian energy on Thursday to continue paying as before.At a joint press conference, German economics minister Robert Habeck said Europe would not be “blackmailed” while French finance minister Bruno Le Maire said both nations were “preparing” for a scenario in which “there is no longer any Russian gas”.The White House responded with a “historic release” of one-third of its oil reserves over the next six months in an effort to stabilise crude prices.‘Build-up’ of forcesUkrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy called Russia’s eastward regrouping a retreat, forced by fierce resistance of Ukraine’s armed forces. But he warned of “a build-up of Russian forces for new strikes on the Donbas” region held by separatists since 2014.Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg also said to expect fresh Russian attacks, “bringing even more suffering”, days after Moscow promised a gradual “de-escalation”.After previous failed attempts, a convoy of 45 buses is ready to enter Mariupol on Friday after Moscow agreed a three-hour ceasefire for Friday morning from 10am local time.Mariupol, in the Donetsk region, has seen some of the war’s heaviest fighting and bombardment, and a reported 170,000 people are trapped with dwindling food and drinking water supplies.On Friday, EU leaders will urge Beijing, rather than assist Russia, to defend an international order from which it benefits economically.Full coverage of the Russian invasion of UkraineStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"on the refugee bus to ireland i m going so i can save my children s lives","story":"Karina Karpova travelled with her husband and 14-year-old son.

But it has also raised questions about Britain’s national security strategy as it was laid out in an Integrated Review of Defence, Security, Development and Foreign Policy almost exactly a year ago.The review identified Russia as the “most acute, direct threat” to Britain but it called for a tilt towards the Indo-Pacific and suggested that the future would belong to ad hoc coalitions of the willing rather than formal alliances or multilateral organisations. It said that a post-Brexit “Global Britain” could become “the European partner with the broadest and most integrated presence in the Indo- Pacific”.Britain would remain committed to European defence as part of Nato at the same time as it once again projected military power east of Suez. It would do this with a small navy, a diminishing air force and a shrinking army that will soon be down to 72,500.In a new paper (https:rusi.orgexplore-our-researchpublicationscommentaryuks-integrated-review-one-year-fit-purpose)for the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), its director of military sciences, Paul O’Neill, notes that the politics of last year did not allow the Integrated Review to acknowledge the European Union’s importance to collective security.Military capability“While Nato’s military capability dwarfs that of the EU, the EU controls vital mechanisms allowing that capability to be used – such as the regulatory framework permitting the movement of people, ammunition and equipment, and the infrastructure specifications for roads, bridges and so on – while the new strategic compass is intended to enhance the EU’s defence potential. Moreover, the defence command paper fails to provide a clear line between the threat (Russia) and the defence response. Reductions in conventional capabilities are coupled with plans for both the navy and army to spend more time persistently engaged outside Europe in pursuit of a still-undefined ‘Global Britain’ chimera,” he says.In a speech at Tufts University in Massachusetts on Thursday, Labour’s shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, said Britain could play a leading role in the debate about the future of European security. But it could only do so if it put behind it what he called the “petty\u0026nbspdiplomatic spats” Johnson’s government was pursuing to serve short-term, domestic political interests.Defence cuts“As war ravages parts of our continent we need to put past Brexit isions behind us, stop seeking rows with European partners and use this moment to explore new ways to rebuild relations with European allies through a new UK-EU security pact.”Lammy called for the Integrated Review to be revisited to ensure that the Indo-Pacific tilt should not come at the cost of European security. And he called for defence cuts to be reversed, a plea that will find support among hawkish Conservative MPs who want Britain to increase defence spending to ensure that Germany does not surpass it as the biggest European contributor to Nato.Rishi Sunak refused to increase defence spending in last week’s Spring Statement and Britain’s economic circumstances are set to get worse, with sluggish growth forecast to fall further in the next few years. O’Neill argues that throwing money at the armed forces is not a solution and that absorbing a sudden infusion of cash would create problems of its own.“At its core, any new strategy needs a focus on deterrence and defence of the Euro-Atlantic area, in which the UK works with and not in competition against its allies and partners. While more money is needed, this must be more than a sudden surge in capital funding that ignores the practicalities of spending it or resourcing the increased running costs that result. In short, a strategic approach involving measured growth across all defence lines of development and integrated with allies is required,” he says.\u0026nbspStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"\u0026lsquoEntertainment is such a good way to bring forth change,\u0026rsquo says play\u0026rsquos narratorPhenomenal success of Nigerian artists is bringing both opportunities and criticismAuthors are tackling topics from transgender rights to Islamic extremism, and picking up plenty of awardsTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"crucial role junk dna revealed whole human genome finally decoded","story":"The entire human genome has finally been sequenced, nearly 20 years after scientists first claimed to have made the breakthrough.In 2003, researchers from the Human Genome Project announced that the blueprint of life had been decoded but they had missed out around eight per cent of DNA, believing it was repetitive and unimportant.Since then experts have come to realise that this junk DNA plays a crucial role in human biology, and have finally sequenced the missing pieces - a development that may finally explain why some people develop certain traits and are at greater risk of disease.The size of the missing chunk is so large that scientists say it is the equivalent of deciphering a whole new chromosome.“Finishing the human genome sequence was like putting on a new pair of glasses,” said Dr Karen Miga, of the University of California, Santa Cruz.“Now that we can clearly see everything we are one step closer to understanding what it all means.”The 19-year endeavour to complete the picture has involved scientists from all over the world, including Cambridge University and the Wellcome Sanger Institute.Much of the newly decoded material comes from the centre of chromosomes - or centromeres - and the very tips - the telomeres - both of which are linked to cell ision and the development of cancer and degenerative diseases.The team discovered more than 100 new genes that produce proteins, the molecules which do most of the work in cells and that are required for the structure, function, and regulation of tissues and organs.However, they also found mysterious pockets of non-coding DNA that do not make proteins but still seem to play an important role in cellular functions and may lie at the heart of conditions in which cell ision runs amok, such as cancer.“We are finally digging into what we once called junk DNA, because we could not understand it or look at it accurately,” said Dr Giulio Formenti of the Rockefeller University, New York.“We now know that many diseases are linked to structural repeats in the centromere, and now that these sequences are no longer missing from the human reference genome we can begin to map the origins of these diseases.”To complete the genome, scientists used DNA from a non-cancerous tumour called a hydatidiform mole, which occurs when a human embryo rejects DNA from the mother and instead duplicates DNA from the father.This mistake in fertilisation means the tumour has DNA from just one inidual, making it easier to sequence. This, coupled with advances in genetic sequencing over the past two decades, allowed researchers to fill in the gaps.“You would think that, with 92 per cent of the genome completed long ago another eight per cent wouldn’t contribute much,” said Prof Erich Jarvis of Rockefeller.“But from that missing eight per cent, we’re now gaining an entirely new understanding of how cells ide, allowing us to study a number of diseases we had not been able to get at before.”The breakthrough could also help unpick the origins of humanity. Some of the genes that were missing in the original genome are now thought to be critically important in driving the bigger, more connected brains which separate humans from apes.Researchers also found that the centromeres contained layers of older sequences which appear to be no longer used by the cell but may hold clues to how our DNA worked in the past.“It\u0027s almost like layers of fossils,” said Dr Nicolas Altemose, of University of California, Berkeley.“As you move away from the site of the active centromere you get more and more degraded, to the point where if you go out to the furthest shores of this sea of repetitive sequences you start to see the ancient centromere.”He added: “Before, we just had the blurriest picture of what was there, and now it\u0027s crystal clear.”The research, by members of the Telomere-to-Telomere consortium, was published in six papers in the journal Science.More from NewsRussian tank convoy in Ukraine may no longer exist, says USUkraine-Russia latest news: Unclear if huge Russian convoy to Kyiv still exists, US saysRamadan 2022: Fasting, prayer and how Muslims celebrate the revelation of the KoranApril Fool\u0026#39s Day 2022: how Chaucer, calendar confusion and Hilaria led to pranks and fake newsChaos as Boris Johnson drops pledge to ban conversion therapy – then appears to row back a few hours laterMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"france germany must remember allies","story":"More from NewsRussian tank convoy in Ukraine may no longer exist, says USUkraine-Russia latest news: Unclear if huge Russian convoy to Kyiv still exists, US saysRamadan 2022: Fasting, prayer and how Muslims celebrate the revelation of the KoranApril Fool\u0026#39s Day 2022: how Chaucer, calendar confusion and Hilaria led to pranks and fake newsChaos as Boris Johnson drops pledge to ban conversion therapy – then appears to row back a few hours laterMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"jonathan van tam having sleepless nights spring covid booster","story":"Jonathan Van-Tam said he is having sleepless nights worrying about over-75s coming forward for their spring booster jabs on his final appearance as England\u0027s Deputy Chief Medical Officer.Prof Van-Tam, who became one of most familiar faces of the Covid pandemic, announced in January that he would be resigning.Speaking at the Royal Society of Medicine\u0027s Covid conference on Thursday, his last appearance in the role, he said he was optimistic that countries were better prepared to respond to future pandemicsBut he warned: I wouldn\u0027t want anybody to take away from our discussion … the idea that this is over, because case rates here in the UK are really, really high and hospitalisations in London, for example, are becoming exceptionally high again.And what keeps me awake at night is whether the people we have called, over-75s, for their second booster dose are going to come forward really rapidly in the next few days and weeks, because it\u0027s going to be important.His comments come after Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u0027s Chief Scientific Adviser, said four-monthly boosters cannot continue and that it was likely the NHS would move to an annual jab programme.The latest official figures show 15,632 people in England were in hospital with Covid as of Wednesday, up 18 per cent week-on-week and the highest since Jan 19 when the number was 15,742.Average daily hospital admissions in England of people with Covid currently stand at 2,050 – the highest since Feb 5, 2021.

He’s had to deal with the reputational damage of Corbynism, then a pandemic during which people’s faith in government skyrocketed, followed by the war in Ukraine which has boosted the domestic popularity of Western leaders. Such conditions don’t really give the Opposition much to work with.But there are no excuses left now. The Government threw away its poll lead in the autumn with its bid to avoid Owen Paterson being suspended, then trampled over any residue support with the Partygate saga. Now the nation is sailing towards a severe cost-of-living crisis, with Rishi Sunak – once the most popular politician in Britain – on the ropes. This should be Starmer’s moment to show us what he’s made of, what he believes. And today’s launch of his local election campaign was a fantastic opportunity. Yet he still struggled to generate any sense of excitement about the prospect of Labour governance, whether local, regional or national. There are, to be fair, some inidually eye-catching policies. The pledge to reduce people’s energy bills by up to £600 will get some voters to sit up and take notice. But even this is a clunky, short-term, tactical move funded by that perennial socialist favourite: a “windfall tax” on energy companies. If the Labour leader has a structural plan to deliver long-term energy security, it is being cruelly ignored by the media. In recent weeks we have seen every suggestion of ways to support energy security (fracking, small modular nuclear reactors, and onshore wind) run into difficulty, with powerful coalitions of Nimbys prepared to campaign against any change to infrastructure. How would Starmer unpick this Gordian knot? What would he build, and where? We don’t know. Just saying “this isn’t good enough” isn’t good enough. Britain deserves better than “Britain deserves better”.This problem is not confined to energy policy. A similar gap between Labour\u0027s words and policies can be highlighted as soon as Starmer criticises the Tories on the economy, as he did today. “You know the reality – prices are going through the roof, and wages are going through the floor,” he said. “A Conservative government that takes far more than it gives to working people. The biggest drop in living standards since the 50s. Taxes the highest in 70 years.”Does this mean that Labour wouldn’t raise taxes? Starmer has apparently singled out the National Insurance rise. That’s fair enough in isolation – the Prime Minister’s vaunted “social care levy” is unjust on younger people – but how else will Labour manage to fund its vast ambitions for the NHS? There are only so many “windfall taxes” one can pull off.The fundamental problem with Labour’s approach is that it is simply not possible to be on everyone’s side in a situation where different parts of the electorate have ergent, even opposed, interests. Until Starmer finds the courage and imagination to pick his side, he will never be able to carve out a better-defined and more realistic vision for the country. As times get tougher, pointing at the Tories and screaming “Bad Party!” might be enough to win Labour some new councils and perhaps even carry them back into office. But if the Labour leader has learned anything from the Prime Minister over the past few years, it should be that winning office without a coherent plan for power is a recipe for drift and missed opportunities.More from NewsRussian tank convoy in Ukraine may no longer exist, says USPutin may be self-isolating from his military advisers, says White HouseRamadan 2022: Fasting, prayer and how Muslims celebrate the revelation of the KoranApril Fool\u0026#39s Day 2022: how Chaucer, calendar confusion and Hilaria led to pranks and fake newsChaos as Boris Johnson drops pledge to ban conversion therapy – then appears to row back a few hours laterMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pupils covid should stay home three days not five says guidance","story":"Pupils who test positive for Covid have been advised to stay at home for three days instead of five amid fears of missing time in the classroom.While adults have been advised to isolate for five days if they test positive, new guidance published by the Department for Education on Thursday said under-18s should isolate for three in order to balance the risk of transmission with continued disruption to education.A UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) spokesman told The  that while the risk of harm to children and young people from Covid is low, the harms of missed and disrupted education are significant.The advice covers how schools in England should approach living with Covid from April 1. It follows guidance from the Department of Health, which said that from Friday anyone with a positive test result will be advised but not legally required to try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people for five days.The UKHSA spokesman said: There is some evidence that children have a shorter duration of illness compared to adults, and this guidance balances the risk of transmission with continued disruption to education.It came as a plan to develop vaccines within 100 days of a completely new pandemic was on Thursday questioned by the lead scientist on the Oxford jab.Prof Dame Sarah Gilbert, who led the development of the AstraZeneca vaccine, said it was going to take a lot longer than 100 days to determine whether a jab would work against a new infection.Last year, Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u0027s Chief Scientific Adviser, launched the 100 Days Mission in partnership with G7 countries, which aims to have vaccines, testing and drugs available quickly in the event of an outbreak.At a Royal Society event in London, Dame Sarah said it would be wonderful to have early access to treatments and jabs, but questioned whether the goal was achievable.What about the clinical development? she asked. What about knowing that the vaccine works? How are we going to achieve that, particularly when it\u0027s a novel pathogen and not one that we already know about? That\u0027s going to take a lot longer than 100 days.Sir Patrick said it was important to start on the road, adding: It\u0027s not going to be possible for lots of things for many, many, many, many years, but it provides a sort of an aiming point. More from NewsRussian tank convoy in Ukraine may no longer exist, says USUkraine-Russia latest news: Unclear if huge Russian convoy to Kyiv still exists, US saysRamadan 2022: Fasting, prayer and how Muslims celebrate the revelation of the KoranApril Fool\u0026#39s Day 2022: how Chaucer, calendar confusion and Hilaria led to pranks and fake newsChaos as Boris Johnson drops pledge to ban conversion therapy – then appears to row back a few hours laterMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"partygate keir starmer suggests boris","story":"Partygate: Keir Starmer suggests Boris Johnson lied to Parliament - why is he still here Labours leader came as close as he could in Commons rules to directly accusing the Prime Minister of lying - saying when is he going to stop taking the British public for fools this.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video partygate-keir-starmer-asks-boris-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:CKOlyq,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,blackFridayWidget.linkUrl:https:www.mirror all-about black-friday,prebidUseTestRuntime:true,blackFridayWidget:,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mantisRecommender.recommenderMaxMpuNumber:,mantisRecommender.autoplayInterval:,nonIframeMantisRecommender:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,amp.trackonomics.enabled:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,mantisRecommender.useIntTracking:true,blackFridayWidget.Link:https:get-latest.dev.convrse.media black-fridayblack-friday-widget-v.,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,authUI.default:true,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,adServedMastheadStripEnabled:true,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,mantisRecommender.hbEnabled:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,amp.stickyAdRefresh:,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,M.apiUrl:https:partner-widget-api-prod.tm-awx monitizer  compare prices gbp_en,publicationName:Mirror,mantisRecommender.limit:,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,authUI.version:ffefdecbcae,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,trackonomics.id:reachplc_cDEYX_mirror,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],video.ctpFloatAndPark:true,felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,convoStarterEnabled:true,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Sir Keir said: He told the House no rules were broken in Downing Street during lockdown. The police have now concluded there was widespread criminality. The Ministerial Code says that ministers who knowingly mislead the House should resign. Why is he still here  Boris Johnson scoffed hang on a minute! and accused Keir Starmer of being a human weather vane after the Labour leader stopped short of repeating his call for the PMaposs resignation last week.  The PM said the Met Police - whoaposve warned they could issue more fines beyond the  anonymous ones so far - must “get on with their job” adding: We are going to get on with our job.But Keir Starmer said: There are only two possible explanations.“Either he’s trashing the Ministerial Code, or he’s claiming he was repeatedly lied to by his own advisors and that he didn’t know what was going on in his own house and his own office. “Come off it! “He really does think it’s one rule for him and another rule for everyone  - that he can pass off criminality in his own office and ask others to follow the law.” Labouraposs leader added: When is he going to stop taking the British public for fools  It came after Boris Johnsonaposs deputy today finally admitted  staff broke the law over Covid lockdown parties - after No bizarrely tried to avoid saying they did.Dominic Raab also confirmed ministers like Rishi Sunak will inevitably disclosethey get fined. So far, No has only pledged to name Boris Johnson and Cabinet Secretary Simon Case.Scotland Yard yesterday said it would hand out  fines to people over parties in Downing Street and Whitehall.Yet the PM still appeared to be in denial. Pressed over Mr Johnson’s view, his spokesman said: “It’s for the Met to make that judgment, rather than the Prime Minister.”Today Mr Raab, who is the Justice Secretary and once prosecuted war crimes, accepted the  fined people broke the law saying: Clearly there were breaches of the regulations - that’s the only thing that could warrant the  fixed penalty notices”. Last night Boris Johnson threw a glitzy bash for Tory MPs, hours after the Met confirmed Downing Street lockdown parties had broken the law. The PM hosted around  MPs for dinner at a central London hotel as he attempted to bolster his leadership and draw a line under the Partygate scandal. Politicians were set to dine on salmon tart, chicken thighs and a chocolate praline dessert, washed down with fine wines. Top Tories walked past families who lost loved ones to Covid, who held a candlelit vigil in protest outside Londonaposs Park Plaza hotel and shouted at MPs: Off to another party, are we  One Tory MP, Michael Fabricant, told the waiting media the party would be a lot of fun adding: Itaposs great, we had a photo taken, it was absolutely super. SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford blasted: Last night millions of families will have been desperately trying to figure out how they will possibly afford the £ energy price hike that will hit them this Friday. At the very same time, Tory MPs were gathering across the street for a champagne bash in the Park Plaza. We all know the Tories partied during lockdown and now they’re partying through this cost-of-living emergency. Earlier Keir Starmer blasted the PM and “cynical” Chancellor Rishi Sunak for putting the  Tory re-election campaign over and above helping people pay their bills by promising a p income tax cut. The PM insisted he was still a “tax-cutting Conservative” - but Keir Starmer told Mr Johnson to “cut the nonsense and treat the British people with a bit of respect”. He said the Tories were imposing  tax rises, bringing the tax burden to its highest for  years and for every £ taken in tax rises, £ is given back. “Is that cutting taxes or is it raising taxes ” he mocked. Boris Johnson fumed: “I don’t know where he’s been the last two years…. “Even for Captain Hindsight, to obliterate the biggest pandemic for the last century from his memory, to obliterate the £bn we’ve had to spend… is quite extraordinary.” But Keir Starmer said: “I can only hope that his police questionnaire was bit more convincing than that. This year British people face the worst fall in living standards on record. While they are counting every penny, the Prime Minister is hitting them with higher taxes.“But in  when there just so happens to be a general election, they will introduce a small tax cut. That is not taking dficult decisions, itaposs putting the Tory re-election campaign over and above helping people pay their bills. How did he find a Chancellor as utterly cynical as he is  Prime Minister Boris Johnson replied: What we have is a Chancellor who took the tough decisions to look after the UK economy throughout the pandemic, who protected people up and down the land with £ billion worth of support. And by the way,we had listened to them,we had listened to Captain Hindsight, we would not have come out of lockdown in July last year. We would have stayed in lockdown over Christmas and New Year, with the result that the UK economy would not be growing in the way that it is. And so we would not be able to make the investments that we now are and under Labour we would have to tax more and borrow more and they cannot be trusted with the economy.

But Mr Javid refused to answer questions about Partygate - and took a swipe at his colleagues, saying itaposs never good practice for ministers to comment on a live investigation. Speaking to reporters at Barking Community Hospital in Essex, he said: The police investigation... into events in Downing Street, itaposs a live investigation. Itaposs still going on. I do know of course like everyone  that at least  fines have been issued so far but it is a live investigation. I think itaposs never good practice for ministers to comment on it. Asked why there was so much confusion in Government about the matter, Mr Javid said: I donapost think thereaposs any confusion. I mean,youaposre asking me in general about fixed penalty notices, when those are issued of course it means the police issuing that has come to a conclusion, and thataposs purely a police matter - not a ministerial matter.No again refused to acknowledge Covid laws had been broken. The PMaposs official spokesman said: The facts are not in dispute. We have been clear that mistakes were made, the Prime Minister believes it is right to respond once the full facts are known, once the investigation has concluded. Keir Starmer weighed into the row on Thursday - and said the PMaposs we Carrie Johnson should revealshe receives a fine.My focus is on the Prime Minister because he is the one who sets the culture, he is the one who oversaw this criminality at his home and his office, he is the one that came to Parliament and said all rules were complied with, which is clearly not the case, he told reporters. So I do think Carrie Johnson should be namedshe gets a penalty notice, but my focus is laser-like on the Prime Minister.

But the plans have already been criticised, with unions saying ministers have not gone far enough and the British Ports Association pointing out ports cannot enforce wage rules. Mr Shapps also outlined plans to close minimum wage loopholes and clampdown on fire and rehire practices. He will ask the Insolvency Service to consider disqualying PO chief executive Peter Hebblethwaite from acting as a company director, after the boss brazenly admitted to MPs the firm broke the law by not consulting with unions or notying the government. TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: “This plan has gaping holes. It won’t deliver a fair outcome for the  sacked workers, and it won’t stop another PO-style scandal.  “Closing the legal loophole which lets companies pay less than the minimum wage is a start, but we need much more from the Government. “Ministers must do everything they can to ensure PO reinstate staff on their previous pay – a union-negotiated rate that is signicantly higher than the national minimum wage. “That means severing all ties with DP World, including lucrative freeport contracts. “Andministers really want to stop companies firing at will, they must go further than a feeble statutory code and finally deliver the long-promised Employment Bill to boost worker protections. “Without stronger employment legislation, bad bosses will continue to trample over workers’ rights.”  British Ports Association, Richard Ballantyne, added: While itaposs right the government and the ferry industry look to improve employment rules and standards, the expectation that port authorities will need to enforce minimum wage rules in the shipping sector could be unworkable. This will place ports in a dficult legal predicament, especially before any legislation is in place. DP World-owned PO Ferries sacked its crews and replaced them with agency workers on March . The minimum wage in the UK for people aged  and over is £. per hour. Mr Hebblethwaite, whose basic annual salary is £,, told MPs on March  that the average pay of the agency crew is £. per hour, but insisted this was permitted under international maritime laws. Speaking in the Commons, Mr Shapps said: “Where new laws are needed, we will create them. Where legal loopholes are cynically exploited, we will close them. And where employment rights are too weak, we will strengthen them.” Mr Shapps said HM Revenue  Customs will dedicate “signicant resource” to ensure all UK ferry operators are “compliant with the national minimum wage, no s, no buts”.Employers will be prevented from using “ fire and rehire tactics”they fail to make “reasonable efforts to reach agreement through consultation”, the Transport Secretary said.Mr Shapps added of the proposals: “It’ll send a clear message thatyou are using British waters and British ports to ply your trade then you must accept British laws.” Shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh told the Commons that the steps announced by the Government to “insist on the bare minimum cannot come a moment too soon”. PO Ferries has accused the Maritime and Coastguard Agencyof operating with “an unprecedented level of rigour” after it detained two of its ships. European Causeway was held in Larne, Northern Ireland, on Friday, while Pride Of Kent was detained in Dover, Kent, on Monday.  Mick Lynch, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, was also unimpressed with the plans, saying: “Despite all the bluster, Grant Shapps has failed to grasp the opportunity to adequately stand up to the banditry behaviour of PO. “The Prime Minister repeatedly said to Parliament that the Government would be taking legal action to save British seafarers’ jobs, but he has failed to keep his word. “This continued lack of action and courage has meant a ferry company owned by the Dubai royal family has been able to break our laws and disrupt our ports and ruin people’s lives with impunity, and we will keep pressing the Government to ensure justice for our members. “What has been announced today is far too little, too late, and we are calling for urgent action for speedier, more radical reforms to save the UK seafarer from oblivion.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON \" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The hike in National Insurance contributions will soon follow.All this against a backdrop of runaway inflation, stagnant wages and soaring food and fuel costs. Families already struggling face a grim future as the crisis really starts to bite.The Tories are either blind to the misery they are overseeing or completely indferent to it.Chancellor Rishi Sunak had a chance in last week’s spring statement to help us through this storm. The Government did not have to sit on the sidelines. It was not powerless to act.It could have raised pensions and benefits in line with inflation. It could have imposed a windfall tax on the oil and gas giants. It could have halted the National Insurance rise coming into force on April . The fact the Chancellor opted for the bare minimum shows not only how little he understands stricken families but also displays callous disregard for consequences of poverty. This is a crisis made in Downing Street. Hard-up Britain is paying the price.  Curb killers Three young people have been killed by out-of-control dogs in less than a month. These tragic deaths are even more upsetting because they were preventable. They happened because of a failure to control ownership of dangerous dogs. Laws could have been strengthened to stop the sale and breeding of aggressive breeds. There could have been tougher penalties for owners who fail to control their lethal animals. How many more deaths will it require before ministers act  No Snickering A quarter of young people would rather have a choc bar than sex. Apparently it’s how they get their Twix these days.

The Chancellor complained that his we Akshata Murthy was not fair game following scrutiny over her shares in a company operating in Russia.He admitted he had not had the best of weekends following last weekaposs Spring Statement, which was widely criticised for not doing enough to help Brits hit by the cost of living crisis.Mr Sunak compared himself to the Hollywood actor, who slapped comedian Chris Rock at the Oscars for making a joke about his we Jada Pinkett Smith.Will Smith appeared to lose his temper when the comedian made a gag about his weaposs shaved head. She has previously spoken about deciding to cut her hair as she suffers from alopecia. Speaking to the BBCaposs Newscast podcast, Mr Sunak said: Someone said, aposJoe Root, Will Smith, and me – not the best of weekends for any of us.apos  But I feel, on reflection, both Will Smith and me having our wives attacked – at least I didn’t get up and slap anybody, which is good. Mr Sunak faced questions over his weaposs business affairs following the Spring Statement last week. Ms Murthy owns a .% stake in Infosys, an IT firm founded by her father NR Narayana Murthy, which has continued to operate from their Moscow office. Her stake is currently worth £million, while the family hold a combined £.bn shareholding in Infosys - an increase from £.billion that was last reported in .Mr Sunak told the BBC: You know, I think it’s totally fine for people to take shots at me. It’s fair game.I’m the one sitting here and that’s what I signed up for. Actually, it’s very upsetting and, I think, wrong for people to try and come at my we, and you know, beyond that actually, with regard to my father in law, for whom I have nothing but enormous pride and admiration for everything that he’s achieved.  No amount of attempted smearing is going to make me change that because he’s wonderful and has achieved a huge amount, as I said, I’m enormously proud of him. The Chancellor has previously said he “followed the ministerial code to the letter” regarding his financial interests. A Treasury spokesman told the Mirror: “The Prime Minister’s independent adviser on ministerial interests has confirmed he is completely satisfied with the Chancellor’s propriety of arrangements and that he has followed the ministerial code to the letter in his declaration of interests.” The Ministerial Code states: “Ministers must provide their Permanent Secretary with a list, in writing, of all relevant interests known to them, which might be thought to give rise to a conflict. “Inidual declarations, and a note of any action taken in respect of inidual interests, are then passed to the Cabinet Office Propriety and Ethics team and the Independent Adviser on Ministers’ Interests.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON BBCRishi Sunak\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

However, critics have called for the review to be reopened and more money to be pumped into the armed forces following the outbreak of war in Europe. Defending the study, Adm Sir Tony told Whitehall’s Institute for Government think-tank: “It rightly identied Russia as an acute threat, it reinforced that the way that we best protect our national security against that particular threat is through collective defence - and we are in the world’s most powerful military alliance, called NATO.”  The former First Sea Lord said British troops “must be more active and engaged in the world” to “protect and advance the national interest and our shared democratic values”. Rivals were trying to “challenge and undermine the international, rules-based system here in Europe and where”, warned the naval officer.  He also launched a blistering personal attack on the Russian President, whom he branded “a weaker and more diminished figure today than he was a month ago”. “In many ways, Putin has already lost,” said Adm Sir Tony, . “Far from being the far-sighted manipulator of events that he would have us believe, Putin has damaged himself through a series of catastrophic misjudgements. “He has failed to recognise how deeply the notions of sovereignty, democracy and national identity have taken root in Ukraine.  “Like all authoritarians, he allowed himself to be misled as to his own strength, including the effectiveness of the Russian armed forces. “He has failed to anticipate the unity and cohesion that exists among the free nations of the world, here in Europe and obviously far beyond. “His actions to date have done more to galvanise than ide and have shown Ukraine to have the one thing that Russia conspicuously lacks, which is real friends.” Adm Sir Tony described NATO as “stronger and more united than at any time I can remember”.

The lavish party at a posh London hotel must have cost £,, but who’s bothered when your future as Prime Minister is at stake  Partygate, shmartygate. The only party he cares about is the Conservative Party, and his leadership of it. His sense of timing is immaculate. With chilling contempt, he partied on the eve of Prince Philip’s funeral, while the Queen was in mourning. He partied on the day Her Majesty paid her last respects to her husband in Westminster Abbey. This is a politician utterly without shame, honour or decency. Like % of Mirror readers, I think he should go.  He partied while victims of Covid lay dying in hospital, with access to their bedside denied to family and friends. He partied while the nation was under virtual house arrest – on his orders. His minions carted suitcases of booze back to Downing Street to keep the party going into the small hours, while grieving parents, sons and daughters wept over their lost loved ones. Tomorrow is April Fool’s Day. Blustering Boris Johnson thinks he can fool all of the people all of the time, and get away with it. We must show that we haven’t forgotten or forgiven, and hold this apology of a man to account at the ballot box, starting with the local and regional elections on May .  ******* The most popular foreign destination to propose is the Greek island of Santorini, then Barbados, Crete, Mauritius and Antigua at sunset, says a new survey. My proposal was at night, in the winter, hiding behind a brick shed on a football pitch on Eastmoor estate, Wakefield. That was because we weren’t allowed to meet, forcibly separated and unable to marry because of my father’s opposition. I don’t recall actually asking my pregnant girlfriend to marry me , but I turned up with an engagement ring. And that was it. Next week, we celebrate  years of marriage. I advise over-romantic swains to save their money and find a quiet football pitch. And don’t forget my First Law of Matrimony: the durability of the marriage is in inverse proportion to the cost of the wedding. ******* A theatregoer walked out of York Theatre Royal’s As You Like It, whinging about the actors’ Yorkshire accents. The management was unapologetic. Forthcoming attractions include: ‘Ey up, ‘Amlet, T’Merchant o’Bratfud, Much Ado About Nowt, The Taming of the Ferret, T’Merrie Wives of Wakey, and The Two Gentlemen of Pontefract. Tickets  bob, or three Tetley bottle tops. Whippets left at the door, please. ******* And the Oscar for the Best Slap goes to... I was going to watch the Hollywood extravaganza, but switched to Midsomer Murders. Much less violence. Tinseltown is traumatised, but I think comedian Chris Rock had it coming to him.

Laura Jordan said her son Zac, now five, has spent so much time in the house that heaposs now scared to go outside. She was shocked to discover that councils are not required to get kids back into schoolthey are expelled before their fth birthday. The boy was booted out of Holly Hill Church School, in Rubery, Worcs, in October after a number of behaviour problems, including attacks on other pupils and staff.But his mum, , believes he has undiagnosed special educational needs that canapost be dealt with in mainstream schools.Worcestershire County Council has since apologised for failing to find a suitable school for Zac and said it is working with his mum to get him back into education. Laura, from Redditch, Worcs, told The Mirror: Zac started reception in September and within five weeks he had been permanently excluded.Ever since heaposs been out of school as he was only four and the compulsory school age is five. Itaposs very rare for this to happen to a child his age.Itaposs pure discrimination, the whole thing. I donapost think itaposs morally right heaposs out of school when people the same age as him are able to go to school. Heaposs been left behind because heaposs been excluded and offered no alternative schooling provision.Heaposs missed out on his education. This is going to affect him for the rest of his le.Laura said Zac has become increasingly isolated following his exclusion last October.  She added: I canapost even get him to leave the house. I have to force him to leave just to go to the shops. He used to be happy outside the house. Now he doesnapost want to leave and thataposs because heaposs not mixing with kids his age.The mum-of-two does not deny that her son has issues, accepting that he attacked other children and staff at his school. However, she believes he has autism, ADHD and speech and language problems which make certain situations aposoverwhelmingapos for him. Laura added: He was excluded because heaposs got special educational needs and the school was not able to meet his needs. They couldnapost keep him and others safe. But they couldaposve done other things before resorting to excluding him. This wouldaposve involved a possible managed move or alternative provision.  Ultimately, they didnapost give him chance or time to adjust to his environment or the new staff in his classroom.She added that Worcestershire County Council has to find Zac a new school by April after he turned five in February. The mum said: Itaposs down to the local authority to find an alternative school for him. They have requested two special needs schools but they said they are full. The council now want him in a local mainstream school. If the school accepts him, he will have no choice but to go there.I fear he will be excluded againhe is chucked into another mainstream school and we will be on this never ending cycle of him going to schools and getting excluded. Laura now thinks the UKaposs compulsory school age should be lowered to four-years-old so children cannot be expelled and left at home once they have started education. A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Suspensions and permanent exclusions should only be used as a last resort, but we back headteachers to suspend or exclude pupils where it is necessary and helps maintain calm classrooms. “We are consulting on changes to behaviour and exclusions guidance to make sure this is used in a fair way, and the cross-government SEND Review will further consult on how children with special educational needs and disabilities are supported by the system, including in alternative provision.” Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter Local authorities are responsible for arranging full-time education for excluded pupils once they reach compulsory school age.Worcestershire County Councilaposs cabinet member for education Marcus Hart said: “Parent carers have a statutory right to ask for a particular educational setting and support for their child but it can at times be challenging to find the right place that has capacity and can meet a child’s inidual needs. The law requires all children to start full-time education by the beginning of the term following their fth birthday and we are working with Ms Jordan to find a suitable and appropriate school that meets Zac’s assessed needs, ready for him to start school in April. We are sorry that we have been unable to source an educational provision for Zac that has been able to meet his needs for this period and we acknowledge this is unacceptable for Zac, indeed for any child. We are continuing to work alongside Ms Jordan and relevant healthcare providers and partners to ensure that we have a high quality, lawful Educational Health and Care Plan in place for Zac, that will help to ensure he receives the tailored help and support he needs at all stages of his educational journey.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Children SchoolsSchools\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

And the room for this virus to evolve remains very large, so we could be taken by surprise again with a iant that escapes immunity. He added: Weaposve got no idea what the next pandemic might be and it certainly wonapost be the same as this one. Whatever it is, the world needs to be ready to respond. Sir Patrick also said he is pleased that a big uplt of £ billion in funding up to  for le sciences research, including work aiming to prevent future pandemics, was included in the Spending Review.  But he added that a decade of underfunding for Public Health Englandundermined the UKaposs response to the pandemic in . He said: Some things were underfunded, and that underfunding undermined the ability operationally to do things. The underfunding of Public Health England for virtually a decade beforehand was an important part of why certain things were dficult and itaposs very important that we donapost fall into that trap again.Sir Patrickaposs speech comes as free coronavirus testing comes to an end this week for most people, as part of the Governmentaposs Living with Covid plan.From Friday, most people will need to shop on the high street for paid-for teststhey want them.

The monstrous killer, who is being held in Wakefield Prison, has already spent  years living in solitary confinement in a glass cage after he was deemed too dangerous to be around other prisoners. But although heaposs previously complained his interment reminded him of a traumatic childhood, it has been reported heaposs now quite content living in the underground box. Speaking in a new documentary aposHMP Wakefield: Evil Behind Barsapos Maudsleyaposs nephew Gavin said his uncle is perfectly happy.  He added his softly spoken, well-read uncle would kill againhe was ever released back into society. Maudsley, from Toxteth, Liverpool, was just  when he committed his first murder in .  For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here The serial killer, who had been working as a rent boy at the time, butchered one of his clients, John Farrell. The murder was so violent, cops named him blue because of the colour of his face. Maudsley was arrested and eventually convicted of murder. He was jailed with the recommendation he should never be released. When he was first locked up Maudsley was sent to Broadmoor Hospital, which houses some of the UKaposs most violent prisoners. After three relatively quiet years behind bars, the serial killer seized an opportunity to attack child molester David Francis in , with the help of fellow prisoner David Cheeseman. The pair barricaded themselves in a cell with Francis before spending the next nine hours brutally torturing the sex offender to death. During the attack, Maudsley shoved a spoon so far into Francisaposs ear, it wedged into his brain.  After the killing, for which he was convicted of manslaughter, he was deemed too dangerous to stay in Broadmoor and was transferred to Wakefield Prison. But Maudsleyaposs streak for vigilante violence continued and after heaposd settled into his new cell the following year, he strangled and stabbed we-killer Salney Darwood and hid the body under his bed. Thirsty for more blood, he hunted prison corridors for his next victim - Bill Roberts, who had been jailed for sexually abusing a seven-year-old girl. He stabbed Roberts to death before hacking at his skull with a makesht dagger. After the bloodshed, Maudsley calmly walked up to a prison guard and chillingly said there would be two fewer people at dinner that night. His rampage rung alarm bells for prison bosses who deemed him too dangerous to mix with the general prison population and a special cell was constructed to keep him in. The cell, which was completed in , was dubbed the glass cage - as it resembled Anthony Hopkinsapos cell in Silence of the Lambs. At .mx.m, itaposs surrounded by bulletproof glass which prison guards peer into to keep a close eye on him.  The only furniture is a table and a chair, which are both made of compressed cardboard, while his toilet and sink are bolted to the floor. The door of the cell is made of solid steel, which opens into a cage just inside. Maudsleyaposs bed is a concrete slab. The see-through walls contain a slit, through which guards pass him meals and other things he needs. Spending his days entombed in the cell, Maudsley is allowed one hour of exercise per day. When he goes to the exercise yard, heaposs escorted by six guards and he never has access to other inmates. When interviewed, Maudsley said he felt tortured in solitary confinement and claimed his speech has suffered from never speaking to anyone. He said: I feel no officer takes any interest in me and theyaposre only concerned with when to open the door and then to make sure I get back in my cell as soon as possible. I think an officer could stop and talk a bit but they never do and itaposs these thoughts that I think about most of the time. But in a letter to Gavin, , he claimed he is happy and content in the box and has warned killing will be on his mindheaposs ever released. Maudsley has claimed the confinement has given him flashbacks to his childhood, when he was regularly locked away and beaten. The serial killer had an abusive childhood at the hands of his father. After being dumped in an orphanage as an infant, his parents brought him and his  siblings home when he was eight. He was regularly hit and often took extra beatings to protect his siblings. Once, he was locked in a room for six months, with his only human contact coming from beatings from his dad. In the year  Maudsley asked for the terms of his imprisonment to be relaxed - begging for a pet budgie or,that request was denied, a cyanide capsule so he could end his le. Both requests were turned down, leaving him to live out his days in the glass cell underneath Wakefield Prison.

Maureen Renny, the former head of the independent fee-paying Barn School, left her £.milion seven-bed detached house to her family. However, Leigh Voysey, , claims it was left to her to save it from developers. The sprawling Hill House in Much Hadham, Herts, was the site of The Barn School until . Ms Voysey started attending the school in , when she was eight. The mum-of-one claims Mrs Renny had always favoured her, giving her the best parts in class plays, and that she reconnected with her old mentor by chance during the last three years of her le.She claims the former head asked her to write out a will and organise a friend to sign it on Mrs Rennyaposs behalf in September  over fears it would be sold to developersleft to her blood family. Ms Voysey claims Mrs Renny knew she loved the old schoolhouse as much as she did and decided to leave her everything. Mrs Rennyaposs cousins and the children of her stepson had stood to inherit it from a  will.  Now Mrs Rennyaposs relatives are fighting Ms Voyseaposs bid to claim the fortune in Londonaposs High Court. They have accused the former head girl of faking the  will. Mrs Renny died, aged , in January , four months after the new will to leave her £.million estate to the former pupil was allegedly made, court documents say. The  will ide the estate between her cousins Gillian Ayre, Angela Eastwood and Susan Vickers, and the children of her stepson, Thomas and Katherine Renny. Ms Voysey claims she bonded with her former headteacher after visiting her as a carer and then a friend in . She claims she wrote her distant blood relatives out of her will because she feared they would sell the old schoolhouse to developers. She claims Mrs Renny asked her to write out the will and have it signed on her behalf because she could not do so herself due to problems with her eyesight.  In papers lodged with the court, she says: Mrs Renny remembered exactly who I was, even though it was  years since Iaposd left her school. Mrs Renny told me that sheaposd been asking about me during the years since I had left her school. The whole experience that day was very touching. I worked one more sht as a carer for Mrs Renny, then visited her as a friend after that. After reconnecting in February , I visited Mrs Renny when I could... approximately three to four times a year. When I visited Mrs Renny, I would make us both a cup of tea and we would talk about my time when I was at The Barn. We both enjoyed that immensely. During one of my visits, she asked me what I thought about The Barn, i.e. Hill House, and I said I loved it. Mrs Renny said to me aposI hope it never gets built onapos.  Ms Voysey said the former headteacher says she wanted to leave her estate to her in a new will. In September , Mrs Renny arranged for two of the former head girlsapos pals to witness a new will because she didnapost want her family to know she was doing a new one, it has been claimed. In the papers, Ms Voysey says: Mrs Renny asked me to complete the  will and dictated to me what she wanted to be written on it. Mrs Renny was unable to sign the will herself as she had problems with her eyesight. Kate Selway QC, representing Mrs Rennyaposs family, says in the defence to the action: It is the defendantsapos case that the  will was the deceasedaposs last true will. The  will is invalid because it was procured by the claimantaposs fraudulent conduct. It is denied that the claimant had any ongoing acquaintance with the deceased after leaving The Barn School. It is averred that the only other material time that the deceased and the claimant met was on th February  when the claimant was working as a carer... and worked a lunchtime sht looking after the deceased that day. The claimant cared for the deceased only once for a few hours over lunchtime on th February . The claimant undertook no more shts as a carer for the deceased and never visited the deceased again. It is denied that the deceased made the  will or any will leaving her estate to the claimant. The alleged events said by the claimant to have taken place...never happened. The deceased never signed the  will. The  will was completed in the claimantaposs handwriting and allegedly witnessed by two friends of the claimant who were not known to the deceased. The barrister says it was impossible for the blank will to have been on the table when Ms Voysey arrived, since Mrs Renny was so frail she could not get out of her chair or even hold a telephone. Ms Voysey claimed: I think it was more important to Mrs Renny that she left her estate to me to save The Barn Hill House and the surrounding land from development rather than leave her estate to her distant blood relatives. She further claimed the former head told her she had rejected a £m offer from developers for the land and house. Ms Selway is also raising an alternative defence to the claim, stating that Mrs Renny lacked the testamentary capacity to execute the will and did not know or approve of its contents, evenit wasnapost faked. She had a stroke in July  and subsequently was recorded in the careraposs notes as talking gibberish, confused about money, vulnerable, delusional and largely living in the past. The family also say that, evenshe proves her case, Ms Voysey should not be entitled to recover money already distributed from the estate. There is currently £, remaining undistributed.

Among them were the Duke and Duchess of Cambridgeaposs older children Prince George and Princess Charlotte.However, their youngest child Prince Louis, aged three, stayed at home and did not join his parents and older siblings.But royal fans have spotted a clue that Kate and William may have considered taking Louis with them.On Twitter, Patricia Treble noted that the Court Circular, the official record of the Royal Familyaposs activities, had included Prince Louisapos name as attending the service - although it had TBCbeside it. She wrote: Interesting nugget in the Court Circular, aposPrince Louis of Cambridge [TBC]apos. Sure, he turns  next month but that would have been a long service for such a young boy. It was also picked up on the account Gertaposs Royals, with one royal fan saying: Itaposs got TBC after Prince Louis so it possible he was going, but at the last minute plans changed.

However, Gertaposs Royals wrote: Prince Louis’s name was likely just an error. I don’t think he was ever scheduled to attend. The Court Circular has now been updated to show that Louis did not attend - only George and Charlotte. Even though he made his public debut on the steps of the Lindo Wing with his parents at just a few hours old, Louis, who is four later this month, has been growing up away from the spotlight. Itaposs partly down to the Covid- pandemic, which has seen large-scale Royal Family events such as Trooping the Colour, cancelled in recent years.And this has also played a part in causing him to fail to hit one major royal milestone - going on an overseas tour. Louis has yet to go on a royal tour, which is mainly due to the travel restrictions that were in place for large parts of  and .Louisapos older siblings George and Charlotte were both considerably younger than their little brother when they went on their first overseas tour. George went on his first royal tour when he was just nine months old, visiting Australia and New Zealand with his proud parents. Charlotte made her royal tour debut in  when she joined the family on a visit to Canada at  months.

Eligibility criteria apply. aposWe had loads of jobs but not enough people to fill themapos Screenprinting business Paul Bristow Associates is just one of the employers who’ve worked with Jobcentre Plus to fill vacancies. The family-run firm, based in Wrexham, produces textiles including T-shirts and printed bags – and they’ve been keen to attract younger people to roles. “One of the issues we have is the perception of manufacturing as being something we used to do in the Victorian age but no longer,” says director Ben Bristow. “Of course that’s not the case – but it made it hard to attract young people. Working with Jobcentre Plus gave us the ability to get more young people into the business and provide them with a good grounding in print and textiles.  “Our staff collaborated really well with the team at Jobcentre Plus, who gave excellent support and deserve high praise indeed.” HR manager Lee Dixon, , agrees: “The people who work there have done a fantastic job. It’s not been easy through Covid and the fact they’ve managed to help people into work is great. “It’s also massively helpful to us as an employer, given there are loads of jobs but not enough people to fill them. Through working with the team at Jobcentre Plus we’ve built up a great rapport. They’ve been first-class. “Our recruits have been a massive help in bringing in valuable skills to our business,” says Lee. “We’ve had them working in packing, admin, sewing and sales. Another guy has got a position in sustainability after he joined us from university. We’ve also had people with additional learning needs and disabilities.”apos My team made me feel very welcome and supported me apos “When I left college in January  I didn’t finish my A levels because I wanted a change, but then obviously the pandemic happened. I didn’t particularly know what I wanted to do, but I knew I would be good in a computer-based job because it’s something that I’ve gravitated towards. “Then I saw JD Sports was advertising opportunities and I thought I’d go for it because it was an administration role in a big company. It was actually the first that I applied for and everything went through really quickly – and I got the job. “My team at JD were great from day one. They made me feel very welcome and supported me. Day to day I’d look after anything from HR queries and issuing contracts to payroll and pension questions. It gave me pretty much a whole picture of what it’s like to work in HR and I’ve been doing it ever since. “I’d always had an interest in HR, but after working for six months I realised it was what I wanted to do. “There was the option to stay on and I’m now doing an apprenticeship with JD and CIPD Level  in HR support. It was another perfect step for me and I’ve now been there for a year and I’m really enjoying it. Starting work was quite tough, but I’ve got so much support from my team. It’s a lot more friendly than I expected it to be.“Now I’m learning about dferent parts of HR, building on what I was doing before. I was struggling to find any job with noexperience, but now I’ll just keep going.”Peter Cowgill, executive chairman of JD Sports, on how the company has forged links with Jobcentre Plus. “We are proud to have worked with Jobcentre Plus to provide much-needed employment and learning and development opportunities at a time when competition for job positions has been at an all-time high. Social inequality has only been exacerbated during the pandemic, so it has never been more vital to give young people a chance to succeed. “Our relationship with the DWP now covers all three nations across the UK and gives our stores, head office and distribution centres access to new talent pipelines and initiatives, which not only facilitates our future recruitment needs, but also allows us to support candidates facing social barriers, an area we are hugely passionate about.” “When I was developing my start-up in the renewable energy sector, working with Jobcentre Plus allowed me to recruit new graduates. “We’re part of the Edinburgh Business School incubator, where we get office space, mentoring and support. Since the graduates joined, we’ve moved to the stage of building a prototype.“If it wasn’t for the scheme, recruitment would have been years away –and having a few more minds to work on the concept has given us a competitive edge.“The candidates knew when they joined that they wouldn’t just be working on their own tasks and would be learning something every single day. If you’re looking for experience, it’s a great way to get it.”apos It’s important to personalise our service apos “Our service helps employers and our customers meet each other face to face, which is crucial. Employer advisers speak to both employers and the Work Coaches, who’ll send customers over who are ready for work. “We can also help employers st through CVs and hold training events to get people work-ready and match them up with the role they’ve got available. “I’ve been working closely with Lee at Paul Bristow Associates, who came along to events at the jobcentre where groups of young people could come and speak to him about what roles they had available. “A lot of employers weren’t aware of all the great services we offer, but the feedback we’ve been getting has all been really positive. Every employer’s needs are slightly dferent, so personalising our service is really important. “There are lots of sectors that are struggling to fill places, so we can help companies find a pool of candidates. We have large manufacturing areas in North Wales that are struggling to recruit people. There are also plenty of roles in the hospitality and care sectors.”Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Department for Work and PensionsJD SportsLee DixonJobs CentreMost ReadRecommended"},{"url":null,"title":"man cycled around city randomly","story":"Man cycled around city randomly stabbing women after being stood up by dateDermott McIlveen randomly stabbed six women in Belfast as he cycled past them in what a judge called a \"violent rampage\" following a date where he was stood up and felt humiliatedDermott McIlveen stabbed six women in a violent rampage Image: Police handoutByAshleigh McdonaldTim HanlonNews Reporter:,  Apr |comments A man who went on a violent rampage cycling around Belfast and randomly stabbing women after being stood up by a date, has been jailed. Dermott McIlveen attacked six women in October  during a two hour period due to feeling humiliated and that women were responsible for the problems he had in his le, reported BelfastLive. The defendant appeared via a videolink from Maghaberry prison at Belfast Crown Court where it emerged he was arrested after family members who saw a police appeal about the attacks got in contact. McIlveen, , admitted a total of seven offences committed on October , , with the charges include wounding, attempted wounding and possession of a kne with intent to commit wounding. As he imposed a sentence of nine years in custody followed by a period of three years extended licence, Judge Patrick Kinney QC spoke of the impact the attacks have had on all six victims.  He said: There is a need to protect women from violence by men such as the defendant. McIlveen, who was diagnosed with autism as a child, cycled round the streets of Belfast City Centre on a pushbike attacking women over a two-hour period. The first victim noticed a man on a bike in the Cathedral Quarter, and after walking to McDonaldaposs, she saw the same cyclist. She noticed he had a metal object in his hand, he bumped into her and short time later she noticed blood running down her leg and a cut to her right buttock. The second woman was walking home from work and was attacked at a set of traffic lights on Ormeau Avenue. After McIlveen approached her and stared at her, he jabbed her in her left arm before cycling off. A third victim was with a friend in Donegall Square West. A bicycle came behind her, and as she stepped over to let him past he stabbed her in the neck.  Another woman was in Bedford Street around .pm when a male on a bike hit her on the back of the head. Then McIlveenaposs next attack was on a woman as she walked along Dunluce Avenue, and on this occasion he punched his victim in the throat. The final assault occurred around pm on University Street, when McIlveen brushed up against a woman as he cycled past her and stabbed her in the hip. Crown barrister David Russell said that following the attacks, police launched an extensive investigation. CCTV images of the attacker were released in a media campaign, and after recognising McIlveen two relatives contacted police. McIlveen was arrested and claimed that whilst his memory of the attacks was not clear, he told police he had been on a date with a female on the day of October .  He said that after the woman got up and left him sitting on his own in a bar he felt humiliated - and this led to a decision to go and hurt woman as he felt females were responsible for everything that had gone wrong in his le. McIlveen admitted he wanted to slash one of the women in the face, and said he attacked another woman as she made him particularly angry after stepping onto the road as he cycled past. Judge Kinney said: It is an utterly repugnant idea that this perceived rejection could in some way justy his actions in attacking vulnerable females in public places.The defendant engaged in a determined and pre-meditated campaign to cause harm to innocent and vulnerable female victims. He deliberately chose to target young women and his violence had only one objective, and that was to hurt women.The judge said that after reading victim impact statements, the common theme is the distress by those McIlveen subjected to such random and serious violence.Defence barrister Patrick Lyttle QC said it was quite clear his client will need assistance whilst in prison for a range of psychological issues. Judge Kinney said that while he accepted there were medical issues, he agreed with a probation board assessment that McIlveen posed a serious risk of harm to the public and was a dangerous offender. Due to this assessment, Judge Kinney imposed an extended custodial sentence consisting of nine years custody followed by an extended licence period of three years in a bid to protect the public. The sentence means McIlveen may not be automatically released on licence after serving half his prison term. His release will be determined by parole commissioners, and when this occurs he will be on licence for a further three years.

Minutes earlier, Christopher Walters had been spotted running in Longton where an Audi A’s windows had been smashed with a -pound sledgehammer. Garage boss Jonathan Hassall and mechanic Benjamin Hunt gave chase, following him down a path near Gladstone Primary Academy.An inquest heard today how they tried to restrain him. But what began as a citizens’ arrest turned into tragedy, reports StokeonTrent Live. Mr Walters was lying on the grass verge as Mr Hunt had him in a neck hold. The incident lasted for some minutes and he went into cardiac arrest.He was later pronounced dead at Royal Stoke University Hospital.Following his death, the Independent Office for Police Conductlooked into the time between the first police officer arriving on scene and CPR being started on Mr Walters.  It was established this gap had been one minute and  seconds – a time described by North Staffordshire assistant coroner Sarah Murphy as ‘reasonable’ considering police didn’t have the full facts when they arrived. The events unfolded shortly after lunchtime on May , . The Audi A belonged to the garage and was parked outside when the alarm went off. It was found with several windows smashed. A PE lesson was taking place in the nearby school grounds when Mr Walters was seen running down the path, out of breath and apparently ‘hugging’ the sledgehammer, with the others in pursuit. One witness, Ricky Amos, was driving past when he spotted Mr Walters lying down on the ground. “The others were on top of him,” he recalled in a statement. Mr Hunt had his arms around Mr Walters’ neck. “He had a tight grip of the man’s neck. The man was struggling to worm himself out.” Mr Amos said he saw one of the males holding the sledgehammer in the air before hitting Mr Walters’ legs with it. Another passing driver, Michelle Leese, said in a statement: “I remember just seeing arms everywhere.” She also recalled seeing one of the men pick up the sledgehammer. At that point, she told her daughter, who was also in the car, to call the police. But the use of the hammer was later disputed by Mr Hunt. The -year-old, from Longton, is currently serving a -month sentence in prison after pleading guilty to manslaughter last year.  In his basis of plea, he said he deployed a headlock, but claimed neither he nor Mr Hassall had used weapons. Mr Hassall, , sadly took his own le days before he was due to stand trial. Forensic pathologist Dr Alexander Kolar, who carried out the post-mortem, noted injuries to the legs, but no evidence of blunt force trauma. He put the cause of death down to compression of the neck. Tests also showed Mr Walters, of Winchester Avenue, Bentilee, had used cannabis at some point before his death. The initial call to the police related to the vehicle damage. It was only while en route from Stone that an officer got an update about the suspect being restrained by members of the public. Sergeant Anthony McKenzie decided to go and assist in a police riot van. It turned out he was the first officer on scene. He saw Mr Walters being held by Mr Hunt, but said the ‘grip did not appear to be firm’. He told him to release the man. Sgt McKenzie began checking Mr Walters for a pulse. It was at this point that PCSO Toni Foyle was driving past and stopped to help. She said: “Sgt McKenzie shouted to the male, ‘Are you alright, mate’. As he did this, the male’s face moved slightly. I saw his lips were blue and he had grass in his mouth. “I knelt down, putting him in the recovery position. I said, ‘This man needs an ambulance urgently’. I started chest compressions.” Addressing the inquest, Nicola Brooks, the solicitor for Mr Walters’ mother, said there was no evidence he’d shown any aggression towards the men. She added: “He was simply running away. As it turned out, he was running for his le and was cornered in an area of Wood Street, where he was set upon for some  to  minutes.” Concluding the death was due to unlawful killing, Ms Murphy said, on the balance of probabilities, Mr Walters had caused the vehicle damage. But she added: “He didn’t deserve to lose his le.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON University HospitalHospitals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Tom, , started squatting in the -year-old abandoned Grosvenor Hotel in Bristol city centre around six weeks ago after being unable to find official housing when he left rehab.He gained entry to the building when he pushed on a key card door - and it opened. The hotel - which was originally built in  - has laid untouched and unused for around two decades, with rotting furniture now piling up in the rooms and graffiti daubed across its walls. Since moving in, Tom says heaposs been tidying up the rooms - even giving some of them a new lick of paint - to make them pleasant to live in once more.Every night he climbs the grand staircase and chooses a dferent bed to sleep in, so he is slowly renovating the hotel room-by-room, Wales Online reports. He enjoys stunning views across Bristol - although he does have to dodge precarious floors and beware of non-existent ceilings. Tom has created a living room with a sofa, a table and a few chairs and has cleared some of the junk off the floor - and is even painting a few of the walls. He said: “You can tell this place used to be the real crème de la crème.aposaposSome of the wood, the dark mahogany wood, the wallpaper, the ornateness around the high ceilings, the detailed work. aposThere is so much heritage here. The people who have come through this place are amazing.” “This is a wonderful building, there’s loads to it that I really enjoy. And to have a safe space inside.aposapos Tom says he thinks the hotel could be used to home Ukrainians here saying aposaposmaybe this hotel could be an answer to some short-term problemsaposapos. He grew up in Hertfordshire and has lived in Bristol for six weeks - struggling to find any official support after leaving rehab. Tom said: “I had found a key card down an alleyway and it just happened that when I used it on the swipe, the door opened. But the door was already open. aposI thought it was to do with the key card but it really wasn’t. I’m gradually, slowly tidying up each room one at a time.  The building is caught in a planning row and Tom could be the last ever resident of the Grosvenor Hotel. The long running saga of the aposaposeyesoreaposapos near Temple Meads rail station reached its latest chapter this week. A report updating Bristol City Council plans to use a Compulsory Purchase Orderto acquire the former hotel in order to redevelop the land on which it is located. A ‘decision pathway’ submitted to cabinet includes plans for a Joint Development  Land Agreementfor the development of the Temple Square siteand the purchase of Station Approach, as well as the proposed acquisition of land at Temple Square including the former Grosvenor Hotel.  The proposed CPO of the Grosvenor is part of a scheme expected to cost between £.m and £.m promised to deliver “signicant city benefits… as an outcome of the long term economic growth driven by the George and Railway project alongside the wider regeneration achieved through a joint development and land agreement”., A decision on the future of the land and the buildings sitting on it – once bisected by a famous flyover – will be taken by Bristol’s cabinet. Bristol City Council senior development surveyor, Jan Reichel, said in her report: “The development will have the potential to achieve high sustainability outcomes, based on design proposals and the excellent accessibility of the developments at the heart of the Temple Quarter and near to Temple Meads Station.”  Tom though says the Grosvenor Hotel is not just a name on a report or a building to be acquired - it is his home. He said: aposaposI often think about the transition between the people on the outside of the building going about their day to day, trying to race for something. aposaposI’m sat here with infinite time, trying to collect myself in my own bits of meditation, but at the same time feeling like I can keep myself busy as there’s a lot to do”. The council want to buy land at Temple Square including the former Grosvenor Hotel “to support the wider redevelopment and regeneration of the Temple Quarter area” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Cheap hotelsHousingDrugs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The mould has been treated numerous times but it’s continuously growing back. They sent in one guy to paint the wall, but that didn’t do anything to help.  Hackney Council responded saying since the last treatment of mould, theyaposve received no further reports.“It’s terrible - I used to be a photographer, and I was outgoing and I could approach people and ask to take photos of them. Now, I don’t talk to people, Nic continued. I don’t go out. And because of the banging and hammeringand smashing about, I don’t sleep.” Nic said there is a rats’ nest next to his property, and that the light fittings in his flatare filled with insects.At the same time he claims to have received persistent threats and abuse from his neighbours, and that some of them often play music at full volume throughout the night. He also says his neighbours have at times urinated outside his front door. Nic’s best friend and carer Tora Peacock, , has been helping him in his fight to be moved somewhere more suitable. and because of Nic’s mental health considerations, she has been contacting Hackney Council to have her friend moved, but to no avail.  “The property isn’t suitable for Nic. Ideally we just want him moved somewhere more suitable for his back and knee issues. Getting him moved is the main priority, but for the most partis not even answering the phone anymore, alleged Tora.She claims that, when trying to reach out to Hackney Council, the response has often been hostile saying she has even been “screamed at” by staff at the councilover the phone on a number of occasions - and has been told “not to complain”.Together, Tora and Nic said they have made over  complaints about his living situation, though Tora has sent over  emails herself asking the council to act. Nic said he has requested to move homes around  times - he claims he was promised to be moved in , then again in , but is still stuck in the same place. Hackney Council’s Strategic Housing Director, Steve Waddington, told MyLondon: “This is an extremely complex situation which we have been working closely for a number of years with [Nic] and his advocate Ms Peacock to resolve. We recognise that there are some aspects of [Nicaposs] complaint that we could have handled better, and we have and are continuing to take steps to remedy this. “Following reports of mould, we carried out a survey of [Nicaposs] home last year and found the issue was being exacerbated by lack of ventilation in the property. We took steps to treat the issue - including installing new fans in the kitchen and bathroom - and have had no further reports of mould since then. We are investigatingany other longer term steps are needed to tackle the issue and have also provided some advice to [Nic] on ways he can also help prevent it occurring. “We have investigated reports made by [Nic] of noise nuisance, including visiting the property and providing noise monitors on several occasions, but so far have been unable to substantiate any evidence of this. However, we will continue to work with [Nic] about his concerns. We have and will continue to work with him around all housing options open to him.” The Mirror has contacted Hackney Council for comment.

Jane was given a new heart in October  after  months on the transplant waiting listNatalie Bailey with her daughter Maggie and mum Jane Image: Daily Mirror Andy StenningByWarren MangerFeatures Writer:,  Mar |comments Little Maggie Lawry spent her first birthday surrounded by wrapping paper and presents... but the best gt of all was the presence of her mum and grandma. Mother and daughter Jane and Natalie Bailey had both suffered from failing hearts and each had received le-saving transplants within weeks of Maggie’s birth from strangers she will never meet.Their case is so remarkable that surgeons at the country’s largest transplant centre, in Birmingham, have never seen anything like it before. Natalie, , says: “We are so lucky to have both been given a second chance. Le could have been so dferent for Maggieit wasn’t for our donors. “Andit wasn’t for Maggie, I could have just dropped dead one day from heart failure.”  Jane was given a new heart in October  after  months on the transplant waiting list. But the relief was short-lived as a few weeks later, Natalie discovered her heart was failing too. Worse still, Natalie was  weeks pregnant and the shock sent her into premature labour. She was rushed into surgery and Maggie was delivered by emergency Caesarean as doctors feared that neither would survive a natural birth. Natalie then needed a mechanical pump to send blood circulating around her body until a new heart could be found, as her own could no longer keep her alive. She was so ill she had a stroke and was put at the top of the “supra-urgent” list, so every donor heart was immediately checked to seeit was her match. Jane, , says: “I was still in hospital recovering when I found out Natalie needed a transplant too and the nurses took me to intensive care to see her. “It was the first time I’d seen her for weeks, because coronavirus meant she couldn’t visit me.“It was scary seeing her on the heart pump, knowing that was the only thing keeping her alive. I blamed myself, because we had the same heart condition. It must be genetic. “The only comfort was knowing I could answer any questions she had and support her, as I’d just been through the same thing. I knew the doctors were amazing and she was strong, so I clung to the hope she would recover and be the same person as before.” Natalie and Jane both suffered from a rare condition, dilated cardiomyopathy, which makes the walls of the main heart chamber too thin to pump blood. Jane developed breathing dficulties in mid- and scans showed her heart failing. She was fitted with a pacemaker that September and a donor heart was found just over a year later. She spent her th birthday in the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham after a transplant. When Natalie began suffering similar breathing dficulties, it was initially put down to low iron during her pregnancy. But when she was admitted to the same hospital with chest pains and her baby stopped moving, doctors found she too was suffering heart failure.Mum-of-four Natalie, from Birmingham, says: “It was terrying, all this came out of nowhere. They were giving me oxygen and I still couldn’t breathe. “The doctor looked at me and said, ‘I think we need to get that baby out of you’. Then the contractions started and they took me straight to theatre becauseI’d given birth naturally, neither of us would have made it.” Natalie didn’t even get to hold Maggie before the baby was whisked away to the neonatal unit, where she spent the next two weeks with her dad Carl camped beside her cot. Natalie’s condition got worse and two days later she was fitted with a mechanical heart. She says: “I was so ill some days I’d wake up and forget I’d had a baby.” Within a week a donor heart was found and Natalie had transplant surgery lasting more than  hours, but on the way back to the ward, she had a stroke.  When she woke, she could not speak or use her left arm or leg. But two days later, Natalie was able to see Maggie and hold her for the first time. She says: “Carl laid her in my lap and I was able to hold her bottle in my right hand to feed her. The emotion was overwhelming. “The nurses said that they saw my recovery speed up after that, because I had a reason to get better.” Natalie spent eight weeks in hospital before ing home on December . Jane says: “When she came home, I hugged her and didn’t want to let go. It felt amazing. We’d both made it through something terrible, but we were home in time to spend Christmas together.” Jane says: “I’m so grateful to my donor, their family, and to Natalie’s. My grandchildren got to keep their mum and their grandmother thanks to the courage and kindness of complete strangers.” Natalie and Jane have been recovering well after their transplants at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, and will be forever grateful to the transplant team. Jorge Mascaro, director of heart and lung transplants, says: “There was a lot of emotional pressure for the team. They had never treated two members of the same family at the same time before.” The hospital is trying to raise £million to create a national centre of excellence and increase transplants by %. As Natalie helped Maggie blow out the candles on her birthday cake, she made a special wish. She says: “I hope one day I can thank my donor’s family and that seeing what a happy, loving family we are gives them some comfort.”See organdonation.nhs.uk and support the fundraising for the new Birmingham Transplant Centre at hospitalcharity.org birminghamtransplantcentreRead MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON BabiesHospitalsPregnancyGiving birthHeart diseaseImmune systemOrgan donationHeart transplantsCoronavirusDaily Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Smile and wave, he says, standing symbolically high on his moving pedestal, the corners of his mouth slowly slipping. Why isnapost everybody cheering for the white man  Will thinks.Yes, the monarchy benefitted from slavery. Yes, protestors are calling for reparations. Yes, Iaposm completely out of touch but I got up on stage and declared slavery should NEVER have happened. What more can I do  I wonderthis was a mistake  Kate whispers - the first thought sheaposd formed on her own in a while - as she shakes the hand of a Black child through the prison- I mean gates. Safe to say, the standing symbolically high on his moving pedestal deserved the backlash it created. But from it, talk about the royalsapos hard work ethic and dedication to duty also arose. Itaposs the perfect smokescreen to move on from the controversy something the royals have had plenty of practice with. But in doing so, they stick their fingers up at the public once again, and dig themselves an even bigger hole. Will certainly takes after Daddy, Prince Charles, who is impatiently twiddling his thumbs for his five minutes of being King.  The Prince of Wales was crowned the hardest working Royal back in  - after completing  engagements. Republic states this is the equivalent of aposworkingapos  and a half days - a measly fraction of the average full-time worker, who puts in more than  days a year. And that would be fineCharles was on a pro-rata salary and just looking for a little bit of cash to fund his gardening projects. But no, the Royal has a personal income of more than £ million - meaning he gets to shake peopleaposs hands and poses for photos for an eye-watering £, an hour. We need to get rid of the idea that any of the royals are hard-working. Itaposs an insult to teachers, to NHS workers, to those scraping by on minimum wage while the monarchyaposs only job is to protect itself.

It has now been reported that, despite marrying and Claire taking her husbandaposs name, the couple are now living separately from each other in dferent homes in Glasgow, although it is understood they still see each other, according to Mail Online. The disastrous end to their wedding three years ago happened after hours of heavy drinking, leading to a fight breaking out, the Mirror reported yesterday.Claire, a mother to four children, grabbed her own mum, Cherry-Ann Lindsay, , by the hair before hitting her with a stiletto. She also put her hands around her mumaposs throat.  Ms Lindsay told the Mail: She then grabbed me and put me in a choke hold. I couldn’t breathe. I thought I was going to die. Neighbours told how the married couple are living apart in the Scottish city. A neighbour said: They don’t live together no. They’re at separate addresses a few miles apart and have been for a while. But they do still visit each other so it’s not clear what the state of the relationship is. Claire attacked her mum and her mumaposs partner -year-old David Boyd, at which time Eamonn, a former professional boxer, and his brother Kieran joined in. David was punched, kicked, bitten and grabbed at the neck by the two brothers. They also pushed their thumbs into his eyes.  Kieran Goodbrand also punched and kicked Garry Brown, another guest at the wedding. Wedding day photos show the newly married couple beaming with happiness on the dance floor and standing for photos by water. Police were called to wedding venue The Vu at Ballencrieff Toll, Bathgate, in West Lothian after the fight, which spilled onto the lawn, was reportedly caught on CCTV. The bride, groom and best man were all arrested and held in custody that night. The couple plus their best man, who are all from Uddingston in Lanarkshire, pleaded guilty to assault and injury charges at Livingston Sherf Court this week. Claire Goodbrand pleaded guilty on indictment to assault to injury but not guilty to a more serious assault to severe injury.  She admitted repeatedly seizing her mother by the hair, punching and kicking her on the head and body, causing her to fall to the ground, before striking her head at The Vue wedding venue at Ballencrieff Toll in West Lothian’s Bathgate Hills. She also admitted punching and kicking her mum Cherry-Ann to the head and body whilst she was on the ground, striking her on the head with a shoe and seizing her by the neck and restricting her breathing. Eamonn and Kieran both pled guilty to repeatedly punching and kicking David Boyd on the head and body while acting together. The charge states that they caused him to fall to the ground and continued their violent attack as he lay there. They admitted pushing their thumbs into Mr Boyd’s eyes, biting him on the head and body and repeatedly seizing him by the neck and restricting his breathing, all to his severe injury.In addition, Kieran Goodbrand admitted assaulting Garry Brown by punching and kicking him on the head and body to his injury at the reception on  June . A fourth member of the family, -year-old Brendan Goodbrand, had his not guilty pleas to two assault charges accepted by the Crown after his alibi that he had left the venue before trouble broke out turned out to be true. Sherf Martin Edington called for criminal justice social work reports on all three accused before passing sentence. He adjourned the case until  April for information on possible disposals, including social work supervision, unpaid hours of work and restriction of liberty by electronic curfew.Eamonn Goodbrand’s Facebook page reveals that he works as a professional fighter, boxing competitively as a light middleweight.It was reported after the wedding reception that one of the alleged victims lost part of a finger during the attack. The prosecution will narrate the full circumstances when the case calls for sentence. Ms Lindsay said, to her, the wedding day felt like a sick joke. She said her daughter was swearing like a banshee and the boys were drinking beer and falling over each other. She said she began to sense trouble brewing but didnapost expect it to escalate so much. The -year-old said she has moved away to an undisclosed address and does not want to see them anymore.

However, she finally darted out of the sett in Lickey Hills Country Park, near Birmingham - after  hours - on Monday. Victoria Hogan, who lives with her vet husband Brian, , in Lickey, said: “I knew she was in there somewhere. “But these setts can be extensive with several ways in and out, but I stayed there hoping she’d turn up.  “I was devastated and was believing she had been killed.

Ian Longley had travelled from the sunshine hotspot of Verona, Italy but was hit by horrendous queues when he landed back at Manchester Airportapossapos terminal two. He claims he was was trapped there for almost four hours Staff shortages and queues were the main reason for his delays after landing with on March  at .pm. But because of a litany of snags and glitches with aircraft handling, immigration and baggage Ian claims it wasn’t until after pm he finally left the airport Ian, , says he understands the unprecedented pressure that Manchester Airport is facing due to a range of issues, including staff shortages, sparked by the pandemic. But his biggest complaint is the way in which management dealt with his grumbles. He told Manchester Evening News: “I understand there are practical problems with things like Covid and recruitment but there were no staff. Not another single person in the building you could speak to.“The one engineer we saw eventually swore at an elderly lady. “It’s like passengers are an inconvenience, we are treated with contempt. There’s a lack of information, a lack of people to speak to. We are treated like cattle. I’ve had enough of it. “What I’m trying to communicate with the airport is that it’s not just about the queue, or that we were delayed. That’s bad enough. It’s about how they treat people.” Manchester Airport, meanwhile, say the issues in question are managed by the Home Office and a handling agent, while they have endeavoured to deal with Ianaposs complaint in good time.  After arrival at the terminal, they were stuck on the aircraft for aposalmost an hourapos while staff waited for ‘chocks’ to secure the wheels. Manchester Airport has said the airline’s handling agent Swissport would be responsible for this. Once off the plane, another delay ensued at Immigration, which is run by the Home Office, where, Ian claims, ‘two thirds of the automated gates were not working’. Immigration completed, Ian had high hopes for a smooth run to the door - but then came the baggage hall, a process which, again, is run by the airline’s handling agent Swissport. Ian said: “At pm not a single bag had been delivered, a Tannoy announcement told us that, due to a shortage of staff, they had been unable to unload the aircraft. There were no further announcements and not a single member of staff in the building. He claimed a man in overalls and a high-viz jacket eventually appeared and seemed to examine the conveyor. But Swissport have denied this staff member works for them. It is unclear who they report to. He added: An elderly lady asked him when the baggage would appear. His response sums up the whole problem with Manchester airport. Succinctly, ‘Its got f*** all to do with me’.” Ian says his bag finally came into view at .pm - more than three hours after arrival. His flight from Italy took one hour and  minutes. It took three hours and  minutes to reclaim his baggage, he claims.

There were no further announcements and not a single member of staff in the building.  Customer Services only led to an an automated voice, while the head office number was met with ‘this person’s phone is switched off’. He finally reached the press office and arranged a call back from a customer service supervisor who, Ian claims, ‘refused to give their name’ and issued an ‘insincere apology’, while explaining that the airport was ‘not responsible for the problems he had experienced’. Ian was promised a call from a senior manager, which he says never happened, and has since sent emails to ious staff members, including MD Karen Smart, to no avail. “This is my real complaint and it is symptomatic of the problems at Manchester Airport, they treat their customers with complete contempt. A Manchester Airport spokesman said: “We are disappointed to hear Mr Langley was unhappy with his experience when ing through the airport. We are aware of challenges faced by our partners on the day in question, which led to service standards falling below what we want to see at Manchester Airport. This includes ground handling agents handling bags on behalf of airlines, and UK Border Force managing the immigration process. The whole of the industry is facing challenges associated with recovering from the biggest crisis it has faced in a generation, and while we understand the pressure this places on all partners operating at Manchester Airport, we will work with those concerned to understand the root cause of issues. “Mr Langley raised his concerns with us on Monday morning and received a call from a complaints manager on the same day. We are aware he was unhappy with some elements of this response, and he has since had a second phone call from a senior team member to explore his concerns in greater detail. “We take all feedback about our processes and service seriously, and have offered to have further discussions with him and members of his partyappropriate. At the same, we want to be clear that rude, abusive or offensive behaviour towards any of our colleagues will not be tolerated.” “We would like apologise to the passengers who experienced delays disembarking and collecting baggage at Manchester Airport. We understand the frustration of passengers who have experienced this disruption and we are working hard with our partners to implement contingency measures to remedy these delays.” As international travel continues to reopen and passenger numbers rise, we have been clear that queue times may be longer as we ensure all passengers are compliant with the security and immigration measures put in place to keep us safe. Border Force’s number one priority is to maintain a secure border, and we will not compromise on this. We are working closely with all UK ports to ensure passengers have the smoothest possible journey, and we will continue to deploy our staff as flexibly as we can.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Manchester Airport\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Free testing for the general public ends on Friday as part of the Living with Covid plan which last month set out the government’s strategy to live with and manage the virus.From  April, updated guidance will advise people with symptoms of a respiratory infection, including Covid-, and a high temperature or who feel unwell, to try stay at home and avoid contact with other people, until they feel well enough to resume normal activities and they no longer have a high temperature, the Department of Health and Social Care says.Until this date, people should continue to follow the current guidance. Children and young people who are unwell and have a high temperature should also stay at home and avoid contact with other people, where they can. They can go back to school, college or childcare when they no longer have a high temperature, and they are well enough to attend.  From April , anyone with a positive Covid- test result will be advised to try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people for  days, which is when they are most infectious. Advice will be provided for iniduals who need to leave their home when they have symptoms or have tested positive, including avoiding close contact with people with a weakened immune system, wearing a face-covering and avoiding crowded places. Dame Jenny Harries, Chief Executive of the UK Health Security Agency, said: As we learn to live with Covid, we are focusing our testing provision on those at higher risk of serious outcomes from the virus, while encouraging people to keep following simple steps to help keep themselves and others safe. The pandemic is not over and how the virus will develop over time remains uncertain. Covid still poses a real risk to many of us, particularly with case rates and hospitalisations on the rise. That is why it is sensible to wear a mask in enclosed spaces, keep indoor spaces ventilated and stay away from othersyou have any symptoms of a respiratory illness, including Covid.  Vaccination remains the best way to protect us all from severe disease and hospitalisation due to Covid infection. If you have not yet come forward for your primary or booster I would urge you to do so straight away – the NHS vaccine programme is there to help you and the sooner you are vaccinated the sooner you and your family and friends will be protected.Under the plans set out free symptomatic testing will be provided for: Patients in hospital, where a PCR test is required for their care and to provide access to treatments and to support ongoing clinical surveillance for new iants People who are eligible for community Covid- treatments because they are at higher risk of getting seriously ill from Covid-. People in this group will be contacted directly and sent lateral flow tests to keep at home for usethey have symptoms as well as being told how to reorder tests People living or working in some high-risk settings. For example, staff in adult social care services such as homecare organisations and care homes, and residents in care homes and extra care and supported living services, NHS workers and those working and living in hospices, and prisons and places of detention , where infection needs to be identied quickly to minimise outbreaks. People will also be tested before being discharged from hospital into care homes, hospices, homelessness settings and domestic abuse refuges. Asymptomatic lateral flow testing will continue from April in some high-risk settings where infection can spread rapidly while prevalence is high. This includes patient-facing staff in the NHS and NHS-commissioned Independent Healthcare Providers, staff in hospices and adult social care services, such as homecare organisations and care homes, a small number of care home visitors who provide personal care, staff in some prisons and places of detention and in high risk domestic abuse refuges and homelessness settings.Testing will be provided for residential SEND, care home staff and residents during an outbreak and for care home residents upon admission. This also includes some staff in prisons and immigration removal centres.

Their final royal outing together was at the  Commonwealth Day service on March , , where they joined the Queen and other members of the Royal Family. And according to Hello! royal correspondent Danielle Stacey, there was a reason why their working royal status did not end until three weeks after their final engagement - and itaposs down to the end of the financial year. The publication reports that the Royal Household marks the end of its financial year on March  - and as Harry and Meghan had said they wanted to be financially independent, thataposs why the date was chosen.Since leaving the UK to carve out a new le for themselves and their children Archie and Lilibet in Calornia, Harry has only ed to the UK twice. Meghan has not ed and neither has Archie. Lilibet was born in the US and has not yet been to Britain.

Click here to sign up.This meant that earlier this week, Harry missed a memorial service for his grandfather Prince Philip at Westminster Abbey.The couple also opted against releasing a statement or a tribute to Harryaposs grandfather to mark the day. It came amid a row over their security in the UK, as Harry has said it isnapost safe for him to bring his family here.  And royal expert Ingrid Seward, author of Prince Philip Revealed, tells The Mirror she believes their silence speaks volumes. She said: The wall of silence was as loud asthey had shouted from the abbey rafters. The normally verbose Duke and Duchess of Sussex said nothing. No spokesperson spewed out long sentences of undecipherable wordage. There were no flowers with the florists name proudly displayed. No comments from Archwell. Nothing. Not even a word from their supporters on ious social media accounts.

Buckingham Palace will calculate an elderly monarchaposs above criticism on the day of her dear, dead husbandaposs memorial service. But choosing to be escorted to and from Westminster Abbey by a man who paid a reported £-million to settle a sordid sex case to avoid court was deeply distasteful. It wasnapost a sweet old maaposam who wanted to travel from Windsor Castle in state limousine with a scoundrel shunned since paying off a woman who alleged when a teenager she was force to sleep with a dad of two old enough to be her own father.  This was an elderly monarch exploiting sympathy at a personal yet very public event to walk back into polite society a reviled man forced to give up even honorary membership of a posh golf club over the scandals spewing from a close friendship with a convicted paedophile and his jailed fixer. What Virginia Giuffre makes of it one can only imagine but much of the watching world, particularly women victims of abuse, will have been revolted. The removal of his military titles and royal patronages, including the use of a His Royal Highness title, look a ersion.  The Duke of York, her favourite son, remains promoted despite stomach-churning behaviour that shouldaposve seen tainted Andrew seated out of sight at the back behind a pillar. Perhaps age and frailty are distorting her judgement because this was a colossal mistake by a declining monarch. She put her son and family before decency, trying to sell a leper to the country at a service commemorating her husband. Knee-bending courtiers will struggle from now on to argue sheaposs principled and does what is right in the service of the country.  She held on to Andrewaposs arm but it was her parading him. He continues to deny the claim but embracing the humiliated sex case settler damaged her own reputation. After the disastrous royal colonial relic tour of the Caribbean, the head of the creaking institution also undermined a family business suddenly feeling very out of date.

Kelly Legg, from RSPCA Birmingham where Eric has been living, said: “Eric has spent almost his entire le in our care and all he knows is le here with us. He was part of an investigation and case, but was eventually signed over for rehoming in January . to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. “Because he’s been with us for so long, he has missed out on a lot of ‘real le’ and because of that we’ve really struggled to find the right match for him. He needs a very specic home with owners who are experienced with his breed type and the sort of lestyle he needs, and can also help him really carefully and slowly navigate the world. “He really is the most loving, affectionate and loyal lad once he gets to know you. He’s extremely clever and needs to have his brain challenged, but he needs time to adjust to new people and build up a bond with them too.”His adopters will need to make the time to make multiple visits and build a bond with him slowly. In unpredictable situations, such as moving vehicles, unfamiliar people or noisy machinery, he can react intensely and become very anxious. “Everything about le in a new home will be new and overwhelming to Eric and we really need to find people who understand this and can hold his paw and guide him very slowly and positively through all of these new and scary experiences,” Kelly said. He’s looking for an adult-only home without any other pets, with someone who will be around most of the time.He can be unsure around other dogs so ideally he needs to go to a quiet, rural home where his owners have private land that Eric can enjoy and explore.The RSPCA would love for him to have his own room somewhere quiet where he can go to rest and relax. Eric is muzzle trained and his new adopters have been advised to keep him muzzled when walking him in public or introducing him to new people. Kelly added: “We’ve seen Eric grow in front of us and we all absolutely adore him. He’s a cheeky, excitable, energetic youngster who loves to be tucked into his bed at the end of the day. He’s very bright and busy so he’d love a home where he can take on training and keep his brain occupied.Find out more about Eric online or contact the team by emailing birmac@rspca.org.uk.Do you have a dog story to share  Email paige.freshwater@reachplc.

Maya Gibbon, who was a science teacher, has been left mostly unable to get out of bed after catching the virusMaya Gibbon has been struggling to adjust to le with a chronic health conditionByRos Wynne JonesReal Britain columnistClaire Donnelly:,  Mar |comments Maya Gibbon was a busy science teacher at a Brighton secondary school two years ago. Since ­contracting Covid in the classroom, she has been mostly unable to get out of bed, struggling to adjust to le with a chronic health condition.Unable to work, and with her husband now acting as her full-time carer, the couple were forced to live in a van for five months last year and are now facing homelessness again. “This week is my two-year Covid ­anniversary and I honestly feel like the person I was died two years ago,” Maya says. “I have stopped doing practically everything I did before.”Antony Loveless and his partner Claire caught the virus in January  and have never recovered. At times, it has affected the couple so badly that Antony has even contemplated taking his own le. “We had professional lives, we worked - hours a day, then came home, cooked dinner, did chores, we volunteered,” he says. “Now I struggle to make toast. Our le is in these four walls. We can’t even use our car because we can’t walk the few feet to get to it.” Saskia Mulder, , a deputy ward sister, living in Derry, Northern Ireland, caught Covid after caring for positive patients in March . She also says she has felt suicidal at times. “I thought I’d be better after a few weeks,” she says. “Two years on I’m still off work, using a stick and have cognitive problems. I’m nowhere near the person I was, my mental health has suffered so much. I’m a strong person, but it’s taken everything.” We are now told we must “live with” Covid. Yet for . million people with Long Covid, le over the last two years has changed unrecognisably – with very little support. Many of these people were key workers who had to work while the rest of Britain kept safe. Many in the public sector were betrayed by the Government’s failure on PPE. Yet, like the Covid bereaved, these people are now in danger of being forgotten by a government in whose interests it is to move on as quickly as possible from the virus.Today, in a moving debate called in Parliament, Layla Moran MP, Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus, told those with Long Covid: “We hear you. You have not been forgotten. And we continue to fight for you.” As well as a public health emergency, Moran warned of a “looming crisis ahead” for the economy with .% of the population affected. “Public sector workers gave their lives,” she said. “When we were all allowed to be at home, they went in, and, according to the Office for National Statistics, are the ones who have the highest prevalence of Long Covid. I do believe we owe them so much more.”Labour MP Debbie Abrahams spoke about her own experience of Long Covid, including “prolonged fatigue and nasty bouts of nausea,” as well as “worsened arthritis, pain that is sometimes completely debilitating”.She raised the plight of , children with Long Covid as well as that of frontline workers and people in deprived communities more associated with the condition. “This Covid pandemic is far from over,” she told the House.The APPG reports that the UK government has “continuously failed” to take Long Covid into account and has not “adequately funded” research into treatment. Antony Loveless goes further. “They have blood on their hands,” he says. “They are wilfully ignoring it. I had to sit and listen to Rishi Sunak talking about writing off £.billion of fraudulent business loans when there’s only £million put forward to Long Covid support. It’s loose change to them, isn’t it ”While Downing Street partied, Maya Gibbon has been living a new le of chronic illness and hospital appointments. She has had four hospital admissions, two operations, more than  blood tests, eight MRIs,  CT scans, two lumbar punctures,  ultrasounds, one colonoscopy, and multiple ECGs. She’s had thunderclap headaches that make her black out, and kidney stones caused by her medication. She can count the number of walks she has taken on the fingers of her hands.“I miss work so much,” she says. “And I am absolutely filled with dread about all the cost of living increases coming.” Saskia Mulder says her experience has opened her eyes “to the way people with health conditions are treated. I always saw it as the nurse, now it’s as a patient. At one point I was suicidal… I do want to go back to work becauseyou don’t have hope, what have you got  But a lot of nurses are being told to retire on grounds of ill health.”Antony’s partner Claire, , is too exhausted to speak to us. She is about to have her contract with the NHS terminated, after being off sick for the last  months.Antony, , an author and a former investigator at the London Gateway Port lost his own job last year. “We had savings, but they went,” he says. “Now we’re surviving on benefits. I’ve lost four stone and Claire has lost six-and-a-half stone. We’re disabled now and it’s been a struggle to accept that.” Last year, Antony planned to take his own le. “I hit rock bottom last summer,” he says. “I said to Claire, ‘I’ve got nothing left. I want to end my le’.” He says support from community groups and counselling saved him. Maya looks back over the last two years. “I wish I would have known that it would have been so isive,” she says. “That people would have denied it existed, denied it was bad and laughed at the thing that had changed your le. “I wish that I would have known that the country would have listened to politicians as opposed to scientists and doctors of infectious diseases.” Saskia Mulder has a question for the Government. “They clapped for us when we were on the front line, but now what ” she asks.

He successfully mated with -year-old female Charlie last November and the eggs she laid have now resulted in the arrival of two tiny tortoises at Crocodiles of the World in Brize Norton, Oxon.It is the first time a British zoo has successfully bred a Giant Galapagos tortoise that is an endangered species.And despite their tiny size - they are about the size of a tennis ball and weigh about ozs each - they will grow to  stones each as adults. Giant Galapagos tortoises are famous for their long necks and are synonymous with Charles Darwin who discovered the theory of evolution by studying them.  The arrival of two baby tortoises is good news for the species whose numbers in the world now stand at about , compared to , in the th century. They are classed as vulnerable on the IUCNaposs Red List. Keepers at Crocodiles of the World are closely monitoring their progress and feeding them a diet of dried grasses, leafy greens, pear cactus and weeds. Shaun Foggett, founder of Crocodiles of the World, said: Weaposre incredibly proud to have successfully bred these tortoises, who have previously been very close to extinction. We have all been hoping for this day since the giant tortoises joined us in  and itaposs a signicant achievement towards helping the conservation of the species.

Parts of the country woke up to snow on Thursday, with cautious forecasts of a small amount of flakes surpassed for those in the east of the country where several inches had settled. The frosty turn, which is being powered by a blast of air from the Arctic, comes a week after the start of Spring and a run of unusually warm temperatures, blue sky and sunshine. While temperatures may not quite be getting back to the C that graced parts of the UK just days ago, forecasters say temperatures will be back in the double digits soon enough.Speaking to The Mirror, Met Office Meteorologist Annie Shuttleworth said the warm temperatures over recent days were something of a “ start” to the new season. “The temperatures we saw last week were well above the average temperature for late March across the UK,” she said. “So it may have felt like summer for some but in fact it is still early spring when the average temperature is around  or  C in the UK.” Cold arctic air has brought colder temperatures, which would stick around over the weekend, Ms Shuttleworth said. Temperatures overnight on Thursday were due to settle just a few degrees above zero for most areas, with Cpredicted for London and Edinburgh. Devon and Cornwall are set to see the warmest temperature of C, with the coolest of C forecast for Aberdeenshire and North Yorkshire. This follows last weekaposs sunshine when the mercury hit C in some places. Weekend temperatures are predicted to remain in the single figures too. The mercury is forecast to reach highs of C and C across the UK on Friday and Saturday, increasing to C and C on Sunday. Sunny spells with some cloud are predicted for the rest of England, Scotland and Wales, with a largely cloudy day all round on Sunday.  Meteorologist Matty Box said there is a cold air mass over the UK. There is an ice warning out at the moment, he said. If thereaposs any melting and refreezing overnight then thereaposs an ice risk. I suspect there will be a similar risk for Thursday night to Friday morning.Discussing Fridayaposs weather, he added: It will be concentrated and there will be snow showers.It will be eastern and northern areas of the UK that are more likely to see any showers of rain, sleet or snow.  The weather will then improve over the weekend, with some sunny spells. Showers will become less frequent, but still with the chance of some wintry showers in the east coast and the North Sea coast in particular through Saturday, Mr Box said. There should be a fair amount of sunshine as well. In Canterbury, Kent, snow saw a county cricket warm-up match between Lancashire and Kent suspended and then cancelled on Thursday. A wind change to more of a westerly direction next week would bring temperatures back to double figures for many - though many would see a healthy dousing of rain as well. And Ms Shuttleworth said it looks as though we will see temperatures at or above average throughout the month of April. However, Spring was often a changeable month temperature wise, Ms Shuttleworth noted, “as our seas are still cold after the winter but the sun is getting stronger and the days longer”. “The temperatures can y a lot depending on the wind direction,” she said.

Ivy Adelle was eventually diagnosed with a rare blood disorder after experiencing gruelling symptoms.The -year-old estate agent from San Francisco, US, first began feeling unwell as a teenager. At  she became very weak and noticed her stomach starting to swell. She ignored the signs of illness despite experiencing frequent nausea and seeing her urine change to the colour of cola. Ivy got her period at the beginning of that school year but two months later she realised she hadnapost had another. Have you been through a similar experience to Ivy  Let us know at webnews@mirrorEventually, she became so fatigued she would often fall asleep during lessons. She only began to panic when she had a period at the end of the school year and the blood was a blackish colour. “I was fearful, I thought I had cancer or something was really wrong with me,” she said. Ivy was scared to go to the doctors because it was expensive and she didnapost want to burden her parents, in case she was actually fine and just overreacting. She put her struggles to focus at school down to her own lack of care or that she wasnapost trying hard enough.Ivy knew that girls sometimes stop having periods due to amenorrhea and because she was a little underweight assumed that was the reason.“I felt like I had sandbags all over my body, as well as severe headaches and bouts of mood swings, loss of appetite and some minor pains, she explained.Her stomach also became somewhat large and felt stf and continued to get worse until she was hospitalised four weeks later. That summer - June  - Ivy fainted in front of her parents and she was rushed to hospital via ambulance.At first, she was told that she had an eating disorder as she was pale and her blood sugar was low. But doctors soon found that she was actually suffering from organ failure and was at risk of dying. Ivy said: “I was shocked to realise I was dying and this is what slow death felt like. She described herself as very much out of it due to her low blood levels and the news was pretty terrying. Doctors told Ivy to call her closest friends and family but she felt upset and angry as well as numb due to the severe pain.  She said: “I felt like I was being punished by le and I wanted to enjoy my friends and family - I was so young. Ivy was diagnosed with auto-immune haemolytic anaemia along with cold agglutinins disease and antiphospholipid syndrome.But at the time, they didnapost realise it was caused by systemic lupus, as testing can take several years.Finally, in June , Ivy was diagnosed with lupus - where the immune system attacks healthy tissues and organs.Auto-immune haemolytic disease is a rare red blood cell disorder that produces antibodies to destroy these cells and is coupled with cold agglutinins – the onset – as well as antiphospholipid syndrome, which causes the antibodies by mistake. It is believed that the blood disease was a result of Ivy’s undiagnosed lupus, coupled with severe amounts of stress. As she needed a blood transfusion immediately, she was flown to a hospital in Sacramento, Calornia, which has specialists in the disease. Ivy said it was a race against time to find a blood match.  Usually blood for a transfusion is heated up but there was such a rush they had to put it in cold. Her best friend brought Ivyaposs mum and sisters to visit her in the hospital - an act of kindness Iaposll never forget, she added. Constant testing and drugs continued, but Ivy said sometimes this didnapost even touch it. “I wouldn’t laugh or smile because my body was in an immense amount of pain, but my brain hurt far worse than my body, she said. Ivy went on to do a lot of deep digging and cognitive behavioural therapy to help her cope. She felt it was important to have mental clarity and seek forgiveness for the things that have affected me. Her blood disease has stayed in remission, though Ivy did fall ill again around four years ago and it has taken a long time to recover again. Her lupus flared up severely and she was treated with the wrong drug which caused her to go into anaphylaxis, she explained. She couldnapost breathe and was put on an intense treatment programme. Ivy still suffers from chronic pain and has since developed fibromyalgia – a long-term condition which causes pain all over the body – after a car accident. As this causes sensory issues for her skin, she has to be careful about the clothes she wears and as she also has many food allergies, she is very mindful about the food she eats. “My goal is to figure out all the factors that trigger this and share my journey with others, she said.

When we met, I was living in a rental following a orce and sale of the martial home. I’d planned to use my money from the sale to purchase a property for myself, but when I met my partner he already had two properties - one he lives in and another he rents out. My partner owns his rental outright and has a lot of equity in the other property, so he was keen for us to live in his place, resulting in me moving in. I’ve been living with my partner for some time now and we are very happy in his place, but I’m left with a chunk of money I don’t know what to do with and living in a house that isn’t mine. I don’t have a deposit big enough for a buy to let mortgage, so using my money on a rental property isn’t an option either.  There are plans to make numerous improvements to the place we are in now, such as a new kitchen and bathroom, but my partner is having to do this gradually as and when he can afford it. I can’t help but feel I have a pot of money that could easily cover all of this work and more, yet clearly, I can’t help out at the moment as I have no rights to the property. I also feel like I’m in a vulnerable position at present as whilst my partneraposs properties are appreciating in value, and I’m paying some rent to live here. I’d be left with nothingwe were to break up and with my own pot of money which has only lost value due to inflation etc. I’ve suggested renting this place out and buying somewhere together, but my partner feels this wouldn’t be a good option at the moment given high prices. The woman feels her best option is to marry her partner but has been called unreasonable by her friends for her motivation to tie the knot. She added: I feel like due to all of these reasons, it’d be far better for my securitywe were to marry. We have both agreed we see marriage in our future but have not discussed any timescales and at my age, I’m really keen to secure my future. Are my motivations for marriage unreasonable as my friend has implied  Commenters on the post were split, as while some said they understood her viewpoint, others said she could solve her problems without getting marriedshe was to buy a percentage of her partneraposs house or get him to put her name on the deed along with his. One person said: Why donapost you just buy a percentage of this house with the money  Or he puts your name on the house and you pay for renovations  Why do you need to get married  While another added: My immediate thought was you could buy a share in his property.

Sharing her story anonymously on Reddit, the woman explained she and her husband focused more on the honeymoon than the wedding when it came to planning their marriage, and after struggling through some financial problems caused by the Covid- pandemic, her in-laws offered to help contribute some funds to the event.And now that her honeymoon is just one week away, the womanaposs in-laws have demanded that they be allowed to come with the newlyweds because it was their money that helped pay for the holiday. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.In her post, she said: My fiancé proposed to me in a simple conversation. It was basically a spur-of-the-moment kind of thing, but I loved it regardless. We pondered on the wedding for a few weeks, but decided we didn’t want to spend most of our money on the wedding, but on a gorgeous ring and a fantastical honeymoon.What doesn’t work for us is that my then-fiance had just gotten laid off, which had left us in quite a financial problem. For the honeymoon option, we asked his parents who are pretty wealthythey could possibly lend us some money for it and the ring, and they said they’d be happy to. Next week is our honeymoon and we’ve been so excited, but five days ago my soon-to-be-in-laws came over for a visit. They basically brought us some wine, some flowers, some things to put into the new house that we had just moved into, and then they asked to talk to us separately.  My mother-in-law sat me down on my bed and told me that she was so happy for me and that she bet I was excited to go to the US. I laughed and agreed, and started talking about it but she cut me off and started saying things about how we’re so close, and we’re like a little family. Then she said, aposSince we’re so close, do you think me and my husband might tag along  It could be like a fun family trip!aposThe woman immediately told her mother-in-law no, but was branded selfish for not respecting that they had helped fund the honeymoon. She added: I told her, no, and she followed by saying how much sheaposs aposalways wanted to goapos, and that she aposnever got to have her own honeymoon.apos I told her I was sorry, but she couldn’t come as this was my honeymoon and was supposed to be a romantic trip between me and my new husband. She got very upset and met up with her husband who looked like he was about to rage. They basically teamed up on me and my fiancé and complained that they were the ones paying, they were the ones that raised him, and that they have done so much for us all these years. They said that it was my fault, and his dad said before I came along my fiance was smart, had his le together and respected his parents, and called me selfish. His parents have been sending me awful texts, and are now refusing to pay for the wedding. My parents have offered to help us pay, and we’re going less expensive now. Commenters were equally baffled by the post, with many saying a honeymoon is not the time for a family holiday. One person said: A honeymoon is not a family vacation. Why donapost they go by themselves  What do they think people do on their honeymoon  Postpone the wedding until you and your husband are on the same page. While another added: I get that they are paying, very generous but obviously the money comes with strings attached. Why can’t they go on a “honeymoon” by themselves instead of tagging along on someone ’s honeymoon  Just tell them to go on their own trip and let you go on yours.Do you have a story to sell  Get in touch with us at yourmirror@trinitymirror .Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON MarriageRelationshipsUmm what \" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

According to experts at language-learning app Babbel, there are nine names in particular that may sound perfectly pleasant to English ears, but may well have less than adorable, or even downright offensive, meanings outside of the UK. As previously reported byThe Sun,language experts have urged parents-to-be to make sure theyaposre aware of what meanings and connotations these names take when translated into dferent languages.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. The linguists continued: This can tell you more about where the name is from culturally and what it means in the context of this culture. Additionally, while this can often result in funny coincidences, occasionally the results can be a little awkward, so itaposs good to do your research beforehand. With this in mind, a list of nine names has been compiled which illustrates the sort of awkward scenarios parents may well find themselves inthey donapost conduct their all-important research.  First up is the name Mark, which will of course appeal to parents wishing to instill confidence and leadership attributes in their child. This is because it originates from the Latin name Marcus - as in Marcus Aurelius - meaning ‘warlike’.However, over in Norway, the name Mark may not exactly reflect such courageous qualities, given that it sounds rather like the Norwegian word ‘mark’, which quite literally means worm. Not exactly the sort of animal many parents would want to be associated with their baby.Next is Todd, a name derived from the Middle English word for fox, and which will naturally appeal to fans of Disney classic, The Fox and the Hound. However, over in Germany, the word ‘tod’ wonapost sound nearly as cute, given that it means death.Originating from Old Norse, Eric means ‘eternal ruler’, and for many would feel like a strong choice for a new son. However, to Turkish ears, the name will sound similar to the far less mighty aposerikapos, which means plum. Nick, a popular abbreviation of Nicholas, is a powerful Ancient Greek name that combines words meaning ‘victory’ and ‘people’. Sadly, it also sounds quite similar to the present tense of the French verb ‘niquer’, which translates as aposf**kapos. No doubt this has caused some embarrassment over the years for Brits holidaying in France.A commonly used shortened version of William, Bill is a name of Germanic origin that means ‘vehement protector’. Unfortunately, in the Dutch language, it also sounds much like the word for buttocks, ‘bil’. The Hebrew meaning of Kayla is ‘crown, laurel’, which evokes a majestic feel, but this name is also quite similar to the Urdu word for banana , which really isnapost anywhere near as regal. The name Camilla is another one that has Latin origins, coming from the word for an acolyte - or a person who assists a priest - during a religious ceremony. However, it also sounds noticeably similar to the Greek word for camel . Lola is originally a sweet shortened version of the Spanish name Dolores. However, in Filipino, ‘lola’ means grandma, meaning some might regard it as quite an unusual name for a newborn baby. Possibly the most awkward of the bunch has to be Cara, a name of Latin origin which the beautul meaning ‘beloved one’. However, in Arabic, the similar-sounding word ‘khara’ quite literally means s**t.Do you have a baby name-related story to share  We pay for stories.

One woman took this one step further by bringing her dog along because he makes her feel more comfortable and would be able to protect hernecessary.But her date wasnapost best pleased when the black labrador showed up to their park date, despite saying heaposd love to meet her dog.Speaking to Reddit, the -year-old woman explained how she met up with her -year-old date at a nature park with scenic spots, walking trails and a café to grab a bite to eat. to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.The pair, who live about  miles away from one another, had been speaking via a dating app and then WhatsApp for about six months before meeting in person.She said: Since we were going to a park, I brought my dog along with me because he had shown interest in him during our conversations. He said he would love to meet him. During the date, the pair walked four-year-old Milo all over the park before stopping for a drink and snack at an outdoor café. They said their goodbyes and got on their respective trains home, leaving in the opposite directions. But it was during the journey home when things took a turn as she received a message about how she disrespected him by bringing her dog to their meet up and showing more interest in her dog than in him. She added: I text him on the way home to thank him for a lovely day. He took about five hours to reply which was odd because he would usually reply within about  minutes.  When he eventually replied, he said something similar to aposyou paid more attention to your dog than me. You came to see me not play with your dog. I donapost get why you even brought himapos. I questioned him on this because he originally said he wanted to meet my dog, but he replied with aposI didnapost realise heaposd stop us from doing things. We could have done so much morehe wasnapost thereapos. The man said he would like to take her on a second date providing her dog doesnapost come along this time - but the woman is now asking Reddit users whether she should cut ties now because it feels like a red flag. I love my dog more than anything so this is a big deal for me, she added. I think itaposs stupid how he turned around and blamed me for a bad date because of my dog. We have been speaking again but havenapost made any solid plans to meet up. I really like him but Iaposm sureI want to see him again. I have a bad feeling that I canapost shake. While most users have been trying to talk her out of meeting up with him again, others agreed that bringing a dog on a date can limit what you can get up to. One user said: I can see where he might be coming from as having a dog with you could limit activities you can do such as going out for dinner or a drink, however, he is extremely immature for the way he is communicating and that is more of the red flag. I guaranteeher next text is how about we spend the next time at your place his attitude will go right back to attentiveness and response delays gone. That should tell you what he is looking for and why he got annoyed when he didn’t get what he wanted. If a guy is really into someone,  miles is not going to be an issue that takes six months and endless conversations to finally meet either.While another user added: Major, major red flag. I dated someone once who constantly told me I gave my dog more attention than him. He acted jealous and threw a tantrum when I showed my dog affection, when I walked him, when I played with him. I offered that he could come on walks with us and he would say aposno itaposs your dog, Iaposm not going to take care of itapos. Surprise, surprise he was incredibly insecure and low self-esteem in many other aspects of his le as well, and did many, many other small insidious things to make me doubt and feel bad about myself as well. A third said: Red flag, I don’t like it. If you want to be my lover, you got to get along with my dog. I wouldn’t meet up with him again, definitely not alone!

The adorable dog seemed delighted by his new little friend and was unfazed by the tiny animal clinging to his lionaposs mane.In the TikTok video that has been viewed by , people, Duke of Hawthorn had to part ways with his newfound best friend and set him free.His owner explained: So I just called my dog inside for the night and thereaposs something dark attached to his chest. And I was like: aposWhat have you put your chest in apos to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. Thereaposs just a possum hanging off his chest. She calls Duke over to capture the moment on camera, and he looks overjoyed at his secret find. The woman proceeds to try and gently pull the possum off Duke with a cloth, but the animal clings on for dear le. Eventually, she manages to pry him away and shows Duke his unusual find. Oh my God thataposs what was attached to you, she says to the chow chow, who leans in for a snf. Making sure the possum wouldnapost try to hitch another ride, she lets him climb onto her garden fence and into the night - though later admits she regrets not contacting the RSPCA.The footage is captioned: A chow and his baby possum friend hanging out and went down very well with viewers, who were amazed by Dukeaposs find. One person commented: When mum says no to a sleepover and you try to sneak them in, and another said: Heaposs like mom can we keep him. Fans have commented on Dukeaposs calm nature in the video and how well his owner handled the delicate situation in the moment. A TikToker wrote: Duke wants to be a daddy, followed by another person who added: My dog just comes back inside with slugs on it. Like Duke, lots of dogs are taking over the internet this week and dachshund Bosco is one of them.The five-year-old tiny pup has an obsession with extra-large sticks and insists on carrying them around the park. He will often obstruct walkways and trip people up, but nobody ever gets annoyed with him - heaposs far too adorable for that.His owner Luccia Rodriguez, , based in London, told The Mirror : Carrying big sticks is Boscoaposs favourite thing to do. He loves making people happy and thrives off the attention.

They work well in a sunny or partially shaded area in fertile well-drained soil.Climbing jasmine can be highly scented, with ieties that flower in summer and winter. All produce pretty flowers and are fairly easy to grow against walls or up trellis.There are some fun options for kids to plant such as sunflowers, snapdragons and the four o#clock flower.If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o#clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock # so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.You will need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot. Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types # bush and cordon. Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall, supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom. Expect the inevitable April showers but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn.It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors. Just watch out for frosts.Top three jobs this month:"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll boosts oban ahead of slockavullin final","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowA group of five young Mid Argyll rugby players were in action last weekend as part of Oban Lorne under-s in the semi final of the West Youth Shield.The result of the match on Sunday March  didn#t go their way, as opponents East Kilbride ran out  #  winners, but it was a good contest and close game until Oban players sustained a few injuries and East Kilbride scored a couple of breakaway tries.Oban Lorne and the Mid Argyll contingent # Rhys Coffield, Murray MacDonald, Vinnie Buckley, James Campbell and Sorley Self # have had a great season, winning their West under- development league, so there is plenty for the lads to be proud of.If anyone would like to enjoy some rugby this weekend, Mid Argyll under- boys will be playing on Saturday March  in the final of the West Youth Chairman#s Trophy against Kilmarnock RFC at Slockavullin.

Much of the chamber music that Mozart composed was music for friends to perform and this trio is just one of these.Originally composed for clarinet, viola and piano, the viola part can be performed on cello as Harriet ably demonstrated. Very typically Mozart # easy to listen to and thoroughly enjoyable.On to the Craftsbury Trio, written by the American Gwyneth Walker. This trio has four movements, each depicting the small town of Craftsbury, Vermont.Up Country Toccata, The Lark in the Morning, You Can Buy It at the General Store, to the final movement Craftsbury Common depicting the green with a white picket fence.The movements are as descriptive as their titles and show many dferent skills on all instruments # fluttering sounds, jazz harmonies, numerous glissandos, syncopation, decorations and finishing with gentle rhythmic tapping.There is even a hint of Rhapsody in Blue in the third movement. If you only listen to one piece again this is the one and should be seen live,possible, and not just listened to.Rachmaninov’s Prelude in B minor for solo piano was Claire’s choice for the programme.This prelude, The Bell was Rachmaninov’s own favourite and was the one that he would often perform. The audience was delighted to be introduced to it by Claire.Brahms composed four chamber works which featured the clarinet later in le after a period when he wasn’t writing anything at all.This was the third trio of the evening and was again very dferent in style allowing Jenner , Harrietand Claireto demonstrate their considerable skills as a trio to a very appreciative audience.An arrangement of Consolation No. by Liszt for Trio Ecossaise was their encore.This was the second visit by Trio, and it is only a matter of time before they are welcomed back.There are two MAAA concerts planned for April # The Willow Trioand the Ugly Bug Ragtime Three.

Also standing by was the steamer Brora, which was bund for Belfast.The conditions were so bad from the point of view of visibility that the leboat had to receive bearings from the Brora and other ships by means of the Aldis signal lamps while ships’ searchlights assisted them in getting into position. For a time the ships could only see each other on the radar screen.Coxswain Duncan Newlands, who knows this dreaded part of the estuary like the back of his hand, edged his leboat in astern of the coaster and proceeded to begin operations, but at .am came this dramatic message over the leboat’s radio: ‘Arrived alongside casualty at .hours got rope aboard and commenced towing at . hours.‘Rope now parted. Returning alongside St Kentigern for further instructions.’There was a lull in the activities while the leboat resumed its operations. They tried again- without success.Then came the news at . hours – ‘St Kentigern Refloated.’The leboat has succeeded in its third attempt, against odds.The St Kentigern then proceeded to Campbeltown under her own power, while the leboat escorted her, but first it took in tow the coaster’s own leboat, which it had earlier lowered over the port side in case of an emergency.The Ardchattern also accompanied the Saint Kentigern to Campbeltown.Meantime, the two remaining ships, Lairdsdale and Brora, seeing their attendance was no longer required, sent a parting signal of good-luck to the coaster and continued on their respective passages to towards the Irish Coast."},{"url":null,"title":"leader march 11 2022 2","story":"So the Scottish Government remains adamant in its decision to ban creelers from the Clyde for the next two months or so.We#re not talking North Sea trawlers here that can go where in the interim.

Baby young cod are not caught in prawn creels. The scientists at the Rural Affairs Committee meeting on March  said that there was zero evidence for creels to be included in the ban, and that the previous evidence cited on the Scottish Government website had now been removed.Our MSP represented to the creel fishermen in Campbeltown that she would:.    Seek a relaxation of the ban to enable the creel fishermen to continue to work as per the scientic evidence advice..    Seek compensation for the creel fishermen for almost three months loss of income.However, in the event she VOTED.    To keep the ban in place.    Against compensation.This is absolutely duplicitous.

We have an underlying enforcement caseload, as there are minor breaches of control which take an element of officers’ time, to take retrospective applications and serve notices.#We have a resource of two full-time officers and we are facilitating enforcement by drawing on planning officer time.#When we get signicant breaches of control, that will give rise to resources we don’t have on hand. We need to ert resources to deal with them because they are time-critical to deal with the parties involved.#The charter, circulated in advance of the meeting, states: #Planning permission is required for most development that takes place in Scotland, with the exception of some minor works.#However, developers or householders sometimes undertake work without planning permission or fail to comply with the terms of planning permissions.#The purpose of planning enforcement is to resolve a problem rather than to punish a mistake. Any action taken has to be appropriate to the scale of the breach.#Councils have discretionary powers to enforce planning controls in such cases,they consider it is in the public interest and expedient to do so having regard to a deemed assessment against the Local Development Plan and material planning considerations.#Councils also monitor certain developments to ensure planning controls are being followed.

retail, public transport, and other indoor settings  - such as hairdressers, gyms, and cinemas - for the first time since summer .The rules will be relaxed earlier, from Monday April , for some other settings such as places of worship and wedding or funeral ceremonies, however.Nicola Sturgeon said continuing to require facemasks by law for a further two weeks struck a \"sensible balance\" amid signs that the BA. Omicron wave in Scotland is beginning to peak or stabilise.The number of people in hospital with Covid fell from , to , in the past  hours The Covid threat level is expected to be reduced from medium to low during Spring, said the First Minister.Ms Sturgeon said: \"This phased approach strikes a sensible balance between our desire to remove this one remaining legal measure, and the common sense need for continued caution - not least for the sake of the NHS - while this wave of infection subsides.\"I recognize that face coverings are an inconvenience. However, given all the sacrice of the past two years, and in view of the current pressure on the NHS, I believe the vast majority of people will accept that for a further two weeks this is a proportionate precautionary measure while we pass the peak of this latest wave.\"It also provides some further protection to those who are most at risk from the virus.\"Compulsory face coverings have already come to an end in all other parts of the UK, with England - which briefly reintroduced them in December as part of its Plan B response to the Omicron wave - becoming the first to drop the requirement at the end of January.  #COVID infections continued to increase across England, Wales and Scotland in the most recent week, but decreased in Northern Ireland.These high infection levels are driven by the Omicron BA. iant https:t.co zjZZxROXBX pic CSjbiIxM In February, Northern Ireland switched facemasks from law to guidance, but still strongly advises the public to wear them in enclosed public spaces such as shops, bars, restaurants and public transport.Since Monday, people in Wales have no longer been required to wear facemasks in shops and on public transport, but they are still mandatory in health and care settings. The latest surveillance by the Office for National Statistics  indicates that the prevalence of Covid is highest in Scotland - with one in  people infected - despite the ongoing mask law. The next surveillance figures will be released on Friday.Surgical and cotton masks are known to be less effective against the highly transmissible BA. Omicron strain than previous iants, although FFP and FFP masks remain protective. Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish Governments decision to delay the lting of the mask law across the board from Monday was taken to protect the NHS. She said: \"We have taken account of the very high level of infection and the pressure on the NHS, and the fact that face coverings do provide an important layer of protection against transmission of the virus from one person to another.\"However, we are also mindful that the data may now be indicating a peaking of this wave of infection which should hopefully become more pronounced over the next couple of weeks.\"Source: Public Health ScotlandIt comes as weekly data showed a dip in Covid hospital admissions for the first time since the BA.

the requirement for ‘hot desking’ areas, whereas for others there may be a need to retain an identied space for either iniduals or teams.“The next stage is that those who will no longer require a set

As music fans lost their gigs at the height of the pandemic, avid readers also lost their author events and book festivals. And like musicians, authors lost that valuable connection with their audiences and the opportunity to promote new releases.When Case Study, the latest novel by Graeme Macrae Burnet was released last October, things were looking up – Omicron was yet to come.“Of course events are the leblood of getting a book in front of the public and I did get a chance to do a few,” says Graeme. “Some of them were very last minute, however, because people weren’t really committing – they didn’t know how many people could be invited. For events like Waterstones in Glasgow, the restriction in numbers meant we split the event over two nights.” Case Study is Graeme Macrae Burnet’s fourth novel. His first, The Disappearance of Adèle Bedeau in  is set in small-town France and introduced the detective Georges Gorski. It is far from the typical detective novel.His second, from , is the book that thrust Graeme into the public eye with its shortlisting for the Booker Prize. The backdrop to His Bloody Project is a brutal triple murder in a remote Scottish Highland community during the s. The third, in , saw theof Georges Gorski The Accident on the A in the same setting as Adèle Bedeau.Case Study, which is published in paperback on April , heads to London in the s and what could be described as the “anti-psychiatry” movement. A woman who believes a psychotherapist has driven her sister to suicide becomes a patient of his under a  name to seeher suspicions are true. The novel is told through notebooks and observations, drawing the reader deeper into this world and the relationship. It’s much more amusing, in places, than this makes it sound. What’s clear, however is Graeme Macrae Burnet isn’t an author who can be stuck in any genre’s pigeonhole.All of Graeme’s books have been published by Saraband , a company that formed in Connecticut in the s, relocated to Scotland in  and moved to Salford in .The attention that a book like His Bloody Project brings an author will inevitably be a large blip on the radar of much larger international publishers, but as Graeme explains there are many factors to take into consideration when choosing a publisher.“It was absolutely the right decision to stay with Saraband for this book,” he says. “In any author’s career there’s a time to test the waters with other publishers. This was my juncture, and I did get a really fantastic offer from one big London publisher and from another big indie. Saraband also made a great offer.“I tried to take the emotion out of making the decision, but with the long-standing relationship that we have and the amazing marketing plan they had for the book I knew we could work well together. They were collaborative about aspects like cover design, so in the end it was really a very easy decision to make. It’s so important to have a strong independent publishing sector and even though Saraband is now based in Manchester, I think that Sara Hunt, the publisher, still thinks of Saraband is essentially a Scottish publishing company.”Working with a successful smaller publisher also meant that there was no pressure to become a “genre” author. There has been no pressure to follow up any of the books with more of the same. From a sort-of detective novel set in a small town in France, to a th-century murder story in the Highlands, then back to that small town in France and now s London. “I’ve only acquired an agent relatively recently and I told them that all I really want to do is write books. I think it can make it dficult for publishersyou’re not a brand in some way. I think there are some similarities between all my books. There’s a familiarity of approach of how you express things and inevitably you bring your own sensibility to whatever the raw material is.”Graeme is currently back in small town Franceand working on the final book of in the Gorski trilogy, but there are also plans to venture deep into Central Europe.As an English teacher, Graeme spent time living in France, Spain and the Czech Republic and it’s his time in pre-stag heaven Prague that might well inform that journey further east.He agrees that location can be another crucial character in a book and as a writer there’s a tendency to be hyper-aware of surroundings.“As a writer that’s a gt isn’t it  I lived in Prague for a year and I learned some Czech, but not enough to have a serious conversation. This was back in , before the advent of cheap flights and at the time there weren’t many foreigners living there.“It was a really formative experience and so interesting to be in a place at the moment of genuine transition things were changing on a weekly basis. To get there I had to go to London to get a visa from the Czechoslovakian Embassy. The Iron Curtain had fallen of course, but a lot of the structures were still in place. It’s probably changed so much but in my mind are the winding medieval streets in winter. Dashing between bars, getting a little grog in each. Everything looks like an old sort of Sherlock Holmes film really.”What he will write he says isn’t even a half-formed idea and it might be a fictionalised central European destination but it’s clear his memories of the time are vivid. “It’s still in my imagination and I’ve just finished re-reading The Trial by Franz Kafka so it’s at the forefront of my mind.”For the moment, however, it’s planning to get out and share the paperback of Case Study at events, including ato the Highlands for the Ullapool Book Festival in May. He spent time as a child at his grandmother’s house in Wester Ross so it’s another area he knows well.“I think we’ve all been glad to get away from our own front doors recently.

It can no longer be ignored and the amendment that I am moving today asks us to do three things to acknowledge, apologise and to act. We have long known much of the source of the wealth of which Glasgow was built. We knew but up until recently didn’t think much about what it really meant and we brushed aside the voices trying to tell us.“In our recent era when other cities were sincerely grappling with their role in chattel slavery, our city was still glorying it naming the Merchant City barely a decade before Liverpool issued an apology for the type of things we are her discussing today.“Follow the Atlantic slavery money trail and its tentacles reach into every corner of Glasgow. The predecessor organisation of this very council borrowed and invested money to the equivalent of millions of pounds that directly came from and contributed to chattel slavery. It’s clear what this report tells is that the blood of trafficked and enslaved African people, their children and their children’s children is built into the very bones of this city. Glasgow’s history to the present day echoes to the crack of the plantation overseers lash. Chattel slavery stands as one of the most heinous crimes in human history and Glasgow was complicit and for that we apologise today, unreservedly, without excuses, justications or attempts at self-congratulation of the type we have too often employed in the past.”Read more:  Glasgow street names and areas with links to slave tradeShe said many will ask what good an apology will do, adding that it can’t change the past and no one alive today took part in chattel slavery.“Many who are alive today still live with the legacy of racism whose roots can be traced directly back to what was white supremacy codied in law and the country’s whose populations were stolen and enslaved suffer still. An apology tells them that finally we are trying to understand,” she added.The ammendment was seconded by Councillor Graham Campbell, chairman of the councils cross party working group on slavery, who said: \"This is a historically unprecedented statement and I am in the position of being both able to support this ammendment to make this offer of an apology on behalf of the city, but also to partyly accept the apology on behalf of African and Caribbean descedants as the first one present in this chamber.\"Perhaps the  Lord Provosts mentioned in the report who got their wealth from ill gotten gains would never have anticipated someone like me would be here. Why are we remembering and what is the purpose of doing this  We have had organised forgetting of the record of Glasgows involvement in chattel slavery. We have now got the historic evidence and it is now up to us as citizens to see what we can do with that information - how we teach the legacy of chattel slavery. \"Slavery and colonialism are the origins of the racism we face today - how people think, the stereotypes and prejudices are derived from that time.\"Councillor Campbell said the  Black Lives Matter protest shows that there is a racism problem in the city which is why measures have had to be taken. This apology is just a first step and is part of the journey not the end.\"Labour group leader, Councillor Malcolm Cunning said there had been decades of denial of the citys slave trade connections and that it was given little mention in the school books of the past.He said: \"It has taken far too long to realise that deep-seated, interwoven legacy of slavery in Glasgow. We now need to say how do we go foward, what do we do now and how do we make our apology and acknowledgement in the st century.\"Greens Councillor Kim Long said they welcomed and supported the report, adding: \"It is especially important for us to note the impact and the leadership of the first black councillors elected to this chamber. It is crucial for us as a city to move from the stance of we didnt know, to we do know.\"The city council commissioned report, led by Dr Stephen Mullen, an academic historian with the University of Glasgow, singled out eight Glasgow statues of iniduals with connections to the slave trade. It added that gts from those linked to the trade amounted to more than £ million in today’s money, with a bequest that would amount to £m for the Mitchell Library in .The monuments to Colin Campbell, William Gladstone, John Moore, David Livingstone, James Oswald, Robert Peel Jnr, James Watt and King William III are all highlighted in the reportThe report also highlights  Glasgow streets and locations with connections to Atlantic slavery.

It’s part of ambitious UK Government plans to turbo-charge our national recovery from COVID-. At the centre of this initiative is Jobcentre Plus.Jobcentre Plus has a long and successful track record of matching quality employers with quality candidates. Now, many highly-skilled people have found themselves unemployed for the first time, and are considering new roles in new sectors. Jobcentre Plus can quickly put companies in touch with candidates who can make a real dference to their businesses.We talk to employers and employees about how they have benefited from working with Jobcentre Plus. vw, px\"  ‘Working with Jobcentre Plus is a no brainer’: Jordan, Contracts Manager, Elite Scaffolding, YeovilElite Scaffolding – a family-owned business that is part of the Denholm Group, reached out to Jobcentre Plus in a bid to reach younger potential employees looking for an apprenticeship.#We initially approached the jobcentre, simply for advice and to askthey could place an ad on their system. We did not expect the extremely positive and proactive response we received from the jobcentre. The team was very helpful,# said Jordan.The support Elite got from the jobcentre was invaluable in streamlining and accelerating its recruitment process which would take up to five weeks.#Now, the jobcentre advertises our vacancies via a sector-based work academy.#Candidates attend a two-week course at Weston College, Yeovil, to gain their Scaffolding Operative Training Scheme and Health  Safety Certications, as well as to prepare for an interview. Now when we interview candidates, they already have a scaffold labourer trainee card and the basic knowledge and understanding of the scaffolding industry. What’s more, all this support via the jobcentre comes without the additional fees of private agencies.#Out of seven candidates, six were offered jobs and five have remained with Elite which has  qualied operatives.#The process was seamless and effective, providing quality candidates who were keen to learn.#Working with the jobcentre is a no brainer! As well as alleviating the burden of interviews that don’t progress into jobs, the savings in cost and time to get candidates suitably qualied are a bonus. It takes the pressure off our own resources and provides top quality candidates in the process.#‘Delighted’: Simon, Employer Adviser, Yeovil JobCentreOnce approached by Elite Scaffolding, also based in Yeovil, he set up a meeting with one of its office managers and worked out a bespoke recruitment package.As part of the programme, he contacted the local Weston College and together they “built” the course content.At the end of the two-week course, six candidates were offered a place on the apprenticeship scheme at a starting salary of £,.#Elite had exhausted all other channels to recruit and were delighted with the outcome#, he said.Moreover Elite referred other local employers to the jobcentre and Simon is running another sector-based work academy with a local roofing company.#The jobcentre has an incredible pool of talent.

Everything went through really quickly.#Continued the  year-old: “My team at JD were great from day one. They made me feel welcome and supported me. I spent six months on the placement and I got paid, too. It’s a proper job which was exactly what I needed. Day to day, I’d look after anything from HR queries and issuing contracts to payroll and pension questions. It gave me a whole picture of what it’s like to work in HR and I’ve been doing it ever since.“After six months, there was the option to stay on and I’m now doing an apprenticeship with JD. Once I’d finished with the placement I got started on a qualication – CIPD level three in HR support. It was another perfect step for me and I’ve now been there for a year. Now I’m learning about dferent parts of HR, building on what I was doing on the placement.

This increase will see the yearly gas bill of a typical household with a credit meter rise by about pound per year to pound,. Those customerswith a prepayment gas meterwill see costs increase by around pound per year to pound,. Raymond Gormley, Head of Energy Policy at the Consumer Council said: “It is important that consumers are made aware that their domestic gas bills will stay high for at least the next year because the wholesale price that the companies pay for the gas continues to be much more expensive than the norm. Unfortunately heating oil prices are also very high, so regardless of the fuel we use, many of us will experience extreme pressure on our household budgets. This will further increase the numbers of people in fuel poverty, as many families may struggle to find the extra money they will now need to pay for heating. “As the Winter   Emergency Fuel Payment Scheme ends today , we implore firmus energy, and the wider energy industry, to commit to financially supporting the continuation of a fuel hardship scheme in the coming financial year. For the longer term, it is clear that energy companies, policy makers, the Utility Regulator, charities and the Consumer Council must continue to work together to develop sustainable solutions to help support those in need as the problem of high energy prices will likely be with us for the foreseeable future.” Consumers who are struggling to pay their energy bills or struggling to pay to top-up their meter should contact their supplier directly for support. Consumers can also get in touch with the Consumer Council for free, independent advice by calling Freephone    or by emailingcontact@consumercouncil.org.uk.

Paper production expert, Poppy Cox, explained why this specic type of tree was used for the production of ballot papers. “It has a special waxy quality that prevents the mark you make on your ballot paper being rubbed out,” said Mrs Cox. “That obviously adds an added level of security to the elections and stops people claiming that their ballot has been changed.” Alternatives are now being sought and the two week delay in the vote will hopefully allow for the ballot to be printed on a dferent type of paper. “It is possible that we could see a special kind of foolscap being useda secure alternative can’t be found,” Mrs Cox added.

Additionally, we will continue to engage collectively with all of our trade unions on local issues impacting on pay terms and conditions.”Meanwhile, Unite general secretary Sharon Graham paid tribute to the continued efforts of union members.“Workers in local authorities, housing executive and education in Northern Ireland launched their campaign to win a decent pay deal with a powerful first week of strike action,” she said.“If they don’t want more of the same these employers will have to come to the table with a realistic offer. The workers can count on my union’s full support every step of the way.”Lead regional officer for Education, Kieran Ellison, confirmed the strike would include his union’s membership working in the Education Authority.“We have notied the employer that our members working in the Education Authority will be taking a further day of strike on Friday,” he said.“Given most of these workers are school bus drivers, it is likely that this strike action will result in considerable disruption to school transport. Full responsibility for this lies with the Education Authority who have failed to make any response even after the first week of strike action.“We are calling on them to come forward with a realistic pay offer to address our members’ pay expectations.”Related topicsDepartment of EducationMore On Department of Education PremiumRevealed: Just £m out of £m integrated education fund spentUnions unite in battle for fair teacher pay‘A good day for fairness and equality’ as Bill to end religious discrimination in recruitment of teachers is passedPlymouth Brethren Christian Church’s schools merger plan for Northern Ireland rejected by Education Minister McIlveenNew single transfer test for P pupils in Northern Ireland to begin in November Most ReadBomb hoax: North Belfast gym owner appears in court charged in connection with alert at peace eventSinn Fein slammed for election launch at Belfast’s Europa Hotel which was repeatedly bombed by IRA‘Blackmail’ row Belfast taxi boss vows to fight court ruling over name FonaValue   SeaterHow to spot the Northern Lights over Northern Ireland tonightEx-Irish badminton champ paid mums to let him abuse childrenTop Videos programme, which celebrates its th anniversary this year.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueThe Government is scrapping plans to ban gay conversion therapy.Christopher LeebodyTwitterEmailMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailConfirmation that the UK Government is scrapping plans to ban LGBT conversion therapy has been criticised by some politicians in Northern Ireland.The move was initially made public in a leaked briefing paper seen by ITV News, with a Government spokesperson later confirming they had decided to look at how existing law could be applied more effectively as well as other non-legislative measures.The Government announced it would be bringing forward legislation in last year#s Queen#s Speech after ministers originally promised a new law in .However, according to the leaked briefing document, it appears the move has been dropped with the Government referencing the cost of living crisis and the situation in Ukraine, adding “there is an urgent need to rationalise our legislative programme.A Government spokesman said: Having explored this sensitive issue in great depth the Government has decided to proceed by reviewing how existing law can be deployed more effectively to prevent this in the quickest way possible, and explore the use of other non-legislative measures.Ulster Unionist Party east Belfast candidate Lauren Kerr described the u-turn at Westminster as “shameful” and said it “breaks a promise” made to the LGBTQ community.“That they would seek to use Ukraine and the cost of living crisis as a means of shielding this u-turn is totally cowardly,” Ms Kerr said.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “If the UK Government is not proceeding with this ban it is because they have taken a decision that they no longer want to.“There will be many people - not just in the LGBTQ community - left askingthere is anything this Government will keep its word on ”Conversion therapy attempts to change or suppress someone#s sexuality or gender identity and is already outlawed in a number of other countries.The practice is still not banned in Northern Ireland almost a year after the assembly demanded the move.All Stormont parties – apart from the DUP and TUV – voted to outlaw the “extremely harmful” practice.Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey has already stressed the need to get legislation introduced as soon as possible.Those opposed to the ban argue it could restrict religious freedoms and ‘criminalise’ church leaders.Last year Minister Hargey confirmed officials had already begun drafting legislation.The SDLP’s Strangford representative Conor Houston described the move by the UK Government as a “devastating blow” for the community.“[It is] an indictment on the record of the British Government as they abandon their plan to take this long overdue step towards equality,” he added.“The British Government have once again let down LGBT+ young people who will continue to be put at risk by this dangerous and insidious practice perpetrated by people who exploit some of the most vulnerable people in our society.“For our young people who fall prey to this appalling practice, the banning of conversion therapy is quite simply a matter of le and death.”Most ReadBomb hoax: North Belfast gym owner appears in court charged in connection with alert at peace eventSinn Fein slammed for election launch at Belfast’s Europa Hotel which was repeatedly bombed by IRA‘Blackmail’ row Belfast taxi boss vows to fight court ruling over name FonaValue   SeaterHow to spot the Northern Lights over Northern Ireland tonightEx-Irish badminton champ paid mums to let him abuse childrenTop Videos programme, which celebrates its th anniversary this year.

Now is not the time for ision and uncertainty.That is why this election is so important.Sinn Fein has been contacted for comment.Speaking at an election launch, Ms O’Neill said that Sinn Fein will defend but not renegotiate the Good Friday Agreement.The former Deputy First Minister said those who hanker for the past need to realise that there is no going back, only forward.Sinn Fein#s Stormont leader also described the DUP#s collapse of the Executive as political vandalism, although her own party also brought Stormont down in the same Assembly mandate.She said: When the Assembly, Executive and North South Ministerial Council were restored in January  it was with a shared commitment to deliver the public services, societal reforms and future that our people need and deserve.It was ambitious to form a five-party coalition Executive, but it was achieved, getting us back to genuine power-sharing, and thankfully so, because while everyone knew there would be challenges ahead, no one could have predicted that in only a matter of weeks that our Executive would be dealing with a global pandemic that would have such devastating impacts on every part of society, community and people#s lives and livelihoods.It is to the credit of all ministers from across the five parties that they responded and have worked with a unity of purpose, and unity of leadership for the past two years.This is what the public want to see more of — co-operation and delivery.Ms O#Neill added: Sinn Fein will be defending, not renegotiating the Good Friday Agreement now, or in the time ahead.Ms O#Neill said the May  election was the most important in a generation.Related topicsSinn FéinMichelle O#NeillIRACost of LivingTraditional Unionist VoiceGordon LyonsThe Executive OfficeMore On Sinn FéinCriticism as Electric Ireland customers facing nearly £ rise in annual bills PremiumJust £k spent as multi-million pound Northern Ireland football stadiums scheme lies idle PremiumRepublic of Ireland should maintain its military neutrality, say three quarters of Sinn Fein voters PremiumSam McBrideOpinionDUP gains ground, but overall support drops for ided unionismBelfast man in court accused of threat to kill MP John FinucaneMost ReadBomb hoax: North Belfast gym owner appears in court charged in connection with alert at peace eventSinn Fein slammed for election launch at Belfast’s Europa Hotel which was repeatedly bombed by IRA‘Blackmail’ row Belfast taxi boss vows to fight court ruling over name FonaValue   SeaterHow to spot the Northern Lights over Northern Ireland tonightEx-Irish badminton champ paid mums to let him abuse childrenTop Videos programme, which celebrates its th anniversary this year.

Credit: Press Eye Darren Kidd“No, we did not get everything right,” she told the audience, adding that decisions made had an impact they did not foresee.She highlighted the impact on vulnerable children kept away from school and elderly people who spent the last weeks of their lives in isolation.More broadly,some political leaders pushed back against specic advice “that was somehow endangering health and more interested in wealth”.“It was really, really unhelpful,” Mrs Foster said. “In a one-party governmentwould have been struggling but we were in a five-party coalition.” She added that some in the Executive wanted everything shut down while she advocated what she claims was a more common sense approach.“But we had to find common ground,” Mrs Foster added.On the argument made by some in the business community the region will be in a unique position with a foot in both the EU and GB, Mrs Foster said in the interview with thethat she does not agree with that point of view.She said: “No, I do not. First of all because we are part of the United Kingdom, most of our supply chain is from the UK. If you look at people who rely on goods coming — whether it is manufacturing or retail — they have to get the goods from GB into Northern Ireland and sometimes go back to GB again.“The problem is from GB to Northern Ireland and, therefore, that has to be fixed.”Mrs Foster further argued: “Economics are very important and I have always been interested in the economy of Northern Ireland...but societally this is causing real problems in Northern Ireland because people feel that their identity as citizens is being eroded.“That goes way beyond economic issues. That is a problem and therefore needs to be sorted.“You cannot separate the economy from the societal issues.” Questioned on whether other issues facing both the UK government and the EU, including the Ukraine crisis, may hold up thrashing out a deal that would essentially remove those barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, Mrs Foster said: “I would have thought the Ukraine would have pointed to a need to actually sort out these issues more so than anything .” She added: “In the sense thatyou have a sovereign country that has been invaded as you have in the Ukraine, does that not say Boris Johnson as Prime Minister should look to his sovereign borders as well and deal with the issues that are there “Yes, to me he should be dealing with the issues within his own jurisdiction.”On the Protocol protests, Mrs Foster said she will leave those to the politicians but that she has not attended any rallies — and has not been invited.The former Fermanagh-South Tyrone MLA does not believe the Executive will be up and running in the immediate aftermath of the election but that should not impact business to any great extent.“Businesses are making their decisions not on what is happening at Stormont, quite frankly, they are making their decisions on does it make good business sense, what are the costs, have we got the people, have we got the skills that we need ”More generally, she supports the X strategy, stating: “That focus on innovation is very important, to get an edge on other parts of the world, to find out niches and I think we have been quite good at that, cyber security, financial technology, creative, film and television.”Following her forced resignation nearly a year ago, Mrs Foster said she made a “a decision that I still wanted to advocate for Northern Ireland because I love the place”.She added: “I will never talk down Northern Ireland.”Related topicsArlene FosterNI ProtocolUkraineThe Executive OfficeBoris JohnsonMore On Arlene Foster PremiumSuzanne BreenOpinionWith five weeks to go until Northern Ireland election, Sinn Fein remain in pole positionLove, laughter and tears... how NI’s famous faces celebrated ‘special mums’ PremiumLucidTalk boss defends election polling as a sign of Northern Ireland becoming ‘a normal society’DUP veteran who quit after ousting of Arlene Foster ‘delighted’ to run for party in Assembly election PremiumMartin McGuinness: ‘History will judge him kinder than Gerry Adams.

Irsquod just broken up with my first girlfriend and I think it was me subconsciously expressing stuff about that.Confirming the sci-fi influence, Tim mdash who recently became a dad for the first time mdash said Girl From Mars mostly revolves around the verse and chorus.ldquoI wrote them as a slow little strummy thing and then when we worked on it as a band we rocked it out quite a lot. My little brother Pat was always my first port of call of seeinga song was good and then Irsquod bring it to [bandmates] Mark [Hamilton] and Rick [McMurray].ldquoI used to love going and knocking on his bedroom door and playing him ideas and I remember that he flipped out about the song and loved it. He had the idea for the quiet verse after the guitar solo and it was great.Tim said as soon as the band started playing it they got a really good reaction from their friends.ldquoI used to play stuff before Irsquod even fully written the lyrics wersquod play stuff at shows and Irsquod mumble my way through it. I donrsquot think I wrote the second verse until we actually recorded it two years later.ldquoI wasnrsquot too worried about lyrics back then, maybe because I listened to Nirvana so much and could never really understand them. Our manager and the record label were sure it was going to be a hit, so we put it aside until wersquod be able to promote it. We put it out as a single two weeks after leaving school and it just blew up.Meanwhile, as part of the Church Street investment plan in Downpatrick, around pound, has been earmarked for a shop front improvement scheme with the emphasis on painting and repairing existing facades.Elsewhere, it is proposed to spend pound, on what is being described as a ldquoconcept design of Church Street with the work due to be carried out by a consultant, with pound, earmarked for improving shop fronts in Bridge Street.Fteen thousand pounds has been earmarked for De Courcey Place in English Street to replace a number of heritage-style lamps and signposts, alongside the provision of new litter bins and planting out existing granite water troughs.Just over pound, is to be spent on other planting and landscaping schemes in the Church Street area, while there are also proposals for a new bus stop and power washing the area outside the former telephone exchange, with new safety railings installed outside  Church Street.There are also plans to invest pound, on new interpretation material highlighting the Tower Bell at Down Parish Church and the grave of United Irishman Thomas Russell in the church grounds.Last Christmas, new festive lighting was provided on the side of the Down Arts Centre and on trees in De Courcey Place.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has praised everyone involved with the work in Church Street, in particular, the talented artists responsible for the murals.ldquoCongratulations to everyone involved in the project designed to breath new le into this part of the town. Given the fact that it has missed out on major funding over many years, the pound, investment initiative is particularly welcome, he said.ldquoThe money will help property owners revitalise their respective businesses at a key part of the town where there are a number of family-owned businesses..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Ballynagross make it past Castlewellan  ","story":"BALLYNAGROSS progressed to the final of the Harry Clarke Cup after defeating Castlewellan Forest by way of penalty shoot-out at Ballyhornan on Friday night.Ballynagross arrived at the match looking for a fourth Harry Clarke final in a row, but Castlewellan Forest had momentum following a close win against Ardglass in the quarter-final.Ballynagross got off to the best start they could have hoped for after a great attack from their defence through the field found Philip Doran, who easily finished to put his side one up in the first seven minutes.Castlewellan stepped it up a gear when a throw-in close to the box found Aidan Dornan, who headed just wide.Castlewellan had an appeal for hand ball ruled out closely after in the Ballynagross box, with the referee having none of it.Ballynagross responded to the pressure from Castlewellan with a pass from Philip Doran to Shea McComiskey out on the right wing. McComiskey saw team-mate Joseph Burns in the mouth of the goal and looped the ball in, but Burnsrsquo effort goes just wide.Castlewellan had their first real chance on the th minute when their corner-kick met the head of Donagh Steele. However, the ball went just over the bar.Ballynagross got their second goal on the th minute after a throw-in from Ryan Tumelty to John Shields allowed the attacker to spray a pass to the right wing to find team-mate Doran. The lively lsquoGross forward found Joseph Burns and the chance was duly converted into a goal.With half-time nearing, it looked like Ballynagross would be going into the interval with a comfortable lead, but an error when clearing the ball from the defence enabled Castlewellanrsquos David Gilmore to close the lead to just a goal as the referee blew his whistle.Castlewellan came out in the second-half with an all out attack approach and it paid off through a corner kick in the st minute.This time Donagh Steele ensured the ball was going into the back of the net and the game was level. It was not to stay this way for long as the Castlewellan goalkeeper clearly took Ballynagrossrsquo Shea McComiskey down inside the box and a penalty was awarded.Connor Marron stepped up to take the penalty and finished well into the top left corner of the net.Castlewellan continued to push forward, but Ballynagross defence of Corey Davis, Connor Marron, Ryan Tumelty and Tom McNeill were holding strong.For the next  minutes it was pretty even, Castlewellanrsquos Sean Dornan took a chance on the edge of the box but Cathail Arnold easily saved. Castlewellan were awarded a free-kick close to the Ballynagross net, but David Gilmorersquos effort was straight at the goalkeeper.Ballynagross had a chance from a corner but it was well cleared by Castlewellan.Forest striker Shane Mooney found himself booked for his comments to the referee in the rd minute.Castlewellan were very much seeking out a goal to level and it came in the th minute after a scrap for the ball in Ballynagrossrsquo box resulted in Shane Mooney scoring with the last kick of the game to send the tie to extra-time.There were a few chances during extra-time for Ballynagross, although neither team could find a break through to escape the need for penalties. Castlewellan swapped out Brian McVeigh in goal for Sean Dornan.Ballynagrossrsquo Connor Marron, who had already scored a penalty during the game, was first to step up and easily converted.Castlewellanrsquos Shane Mooney and Ballynagrossrsquo Declan Dowie followed and both scored.Forestrsquos new lsquokeeper Dornan came out of the net and rushed his penalty, sending the ball over the bar.John Mahoney made no mistake to give his lsquoGross side a further advantage before Ciaran Stratton kept Castlewellan in with a chance.Ballynagrossrsquo John Shields walked up to take his penalty but the lsquokeeper saved to bring it level again.Eoin Travers converted his penalty and now it was sudden death.Tom McNeill confidentially scored his penalty meaning all of the pressure fell on Castlewellanrsquos Ryan Morgan to keep the game going.However, his effort was saved resulting in Ballynagross progressing to the final.Ballynagross: C Arnold, T McNeill, R Tumelty, C Marron, C Davis, J Polley, J Shields, J Burns, L Shields, P Doran, S McComiskeySubs: D Craig, D Dowie, J Mahoney, K Taggart, A Beattie.Castlewellan Forest: B McVeigh, C McCabe, C Stratton, C Burns, J OrsquoNeill, N Travers, S Dornan, D Steele, S Mooney, A Dornan, D Gilmore Subs: S Kinley, G Kidd, E Travers, R Morgan, J Murnin..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Dismal end to league campaign  ","story":"DOWN senior footballersrsquo miserable campaign reached its conclusion as they lost out on home soil to Clare on Sunday.The Mourne side entered this fixture already relegated from Division  and were hoping to gain some,any, momentum ahead of their crucial upcoming Ulster campaign.The uphill task will include having to better Monaghan on May  and then the winner of Cavan and Antrim to make the concluding stage to feature in the All-Ireland series and avoid ato the second-tier championship.Down took to the field in Newry against a Clare side who had endured a mixed bag of results within their league fixtures having won their opening three before losing the next trio of matches.For Down, the loss concludes a point-starved run of fixtures having finished with just one draw and six losses.Clare fielded what appeared to be a physically stronger outfit than their counterparts at Paacuteirc Esler and Downrsquos efforts werenrsquot aided by their lack of discipline.Both Gerard Collins and Pat Havern picked up black cards towards the end of each half while team-mate Finn McElroy picked up a red card with  minutes played.By that stage, the Mourne side didnrsquot appear to be getting anything from the game but that will be little solace to Down boss James McCartan, who has endured a nightmare beginning to his second stint at the helm.Aaron Grfin scored the first goal of the match with nine minutes played, courtesy of a smart left-footed finish which bested Kilcoo-native Niall Kane at his near post.To their credit, Down showed some resilience and managed to notch the next four from five points available with Burren man Liam Kerr kicking over a well-taken score amongst these.However, Clare continued to attack the Down goal and found their second major of the match thanks to Cian OrsquoDearsquos effort.His lowly struck shot took the wind out of Downrsquos sails and the Mourne side entered the break six points adrt at -

ndash The Government is poised to unveil an astonishing pound million scheme to replace the Strangford ferry service with a road tunnel under the lough.The scheme has already been approved at ministerial level and it is believed that the pound million originally intended for the Downpatrick bypass road will be used as start-up capital, with phase top-up grants being sought from the European Community and the Ireland Fund as the scheme progresses.Plans for the mile-long road tunnel have been drawn up by senior consultants engaged by the government and it is believed that the entry points will be manned toll booth terminals in Strangford and Portaferry.The move to replace the ferry service with a tunnel received an extra impetus recently when it was revealed that the ferry service was running at a substantial loss and villagers in Strangford vetoed plans for a new jetty for the vessels.Sources within the government say that the tunnel plan, which has been gathering dust for a number of years, has now been reactivated and local roads bosses intend erting the money intended for Downpatrickrsquos ring road to the scheme before the end of the financial year.Publicly, however, officials are remaining tight-lipped about the project. ldquoThe tunnel plan was first put forward several years ago, but as far as I am aware there are no plans to revive it, said a press office spokesperson.Nevertheless, conservation organisations have been consulted about the possible environmental impact of a tunnel, and a study of its possible effects has been carried out by a university team under the guidance of Prof A Lilo.Prof Lilo told the Recorder: ldquoAs far as I can see, there would be little threat to the loughrsquos balanced ecosystem from a tunnel.There may, however, be an unsightly visual impact created by the large tunnel entrances needed in Strangford and Portaferry.CASTLEWELLAN ndash A new school is to be constructed on the site of the existing St Malachyrsquos High School in Castlewellan, it has been revealed this week.South Down MP Mr Eddie McGrady said he has been informed of the commitment of the Department of Education to a new school in the town.ldquoAn investment appraisal has recently been carried out by the Department of Education to consider how best to meet the long-term needs of the pupils at St Malachyrsquos and this has come out in favour of a new school on the existing site, he added.Mr McGrady said this week: ldquoI welcome this development as I have been making on-going representations on the matter to Lord Belstead and his predecessor as Education Minister, Dr Brian Mawhinney.ldquoThe school definitely requires additional accommodation and I am keen that is is provided on the existing site, he added.DOWNPATRICK ndash Teenagers, some as young as , are taking part in open-air drinking parties at secluded parts of Downpatrick it was revealed this week.The youth are paying adults to buy drink for them and then going to quiet parts of the town for their parties, a special meeting was told on Tuesday.The police have raided a number of these gatherings in recent months but the teenagers simply move to a dferent location and continue their drinking sprees.While the problem of underage drinking in Downpatrick has not risen in recent years it is nevertheless sufficiently worrying to prompt a group of local community representatives to get together to discuss ways of tackling the issue.Last week youth workers, headmasters, teachers, publicans and councillors met together under the auspices of the RUCrsquos Community Relations Branch and debated the causes and possible remedies of underage drinking.The end result of the discussion was that public awareness needs to be heightened, while teenagers, and their parents, should be appraised of the dangers of alcohol abuse in the young.Superintendent Ronnie Hawthorne, Downpatrick sub-isional commander explained that the problem is a province-wide concern and is not just confined to Downpatrick.He added that underage drinking is also taking place in other parts of Down District.ldquoThere is a problem throughout Northern Ireland and we cannot stop underage drinkers ourselves, we need the help of the whole community, said Superintendent Hawthorne.ldquoThere are a lot associated problems with underage drinking and we will talk to every interested body in a bid to cope with this matter, he added.The full extend of the problems were highlighted by the youth leader in charge of the Patrician Youth Centre, Siobhan Byrne, who has compiled a report on underway drinking which is to be presented to Down Council.KILLYLEAGH ndash The town of Killyleagh is set for a financial boost to help revive its economic, commercial and environmental appearance, it has been revealed.A preliminary application has been made to the International Fund for a core project to help trigger a revival in the townrsquos fortunes.And by the end of the year, plans to designate the town as a conservation area will be completed.The investment in Killyleaghrsquos future was revealed when the chairman of Down District Council, Mr Sean Quinn, officially launched proposals for the regeneration of the town.A special exhibition in the townrsquos library also features a display on the proposed conservation area for Killyleagh.Mr Quinn referred to community-led initiatives in Seeconnell and Strangford, and stressed the importance of a community coming together to take full advantage of the funding which is available to help themselves.The South Down MP, Mr Eddie McGrady, told the launch gathering that he has been delighted to assist the committee towards its goals of reviving the town.Mr McGrady said Killyleagh had recognised that it was very much an era of self-help.He looked forward to the day when Killyleagh is selected as the site for the Strangford Lough Liaison Office and is designated as the Gateway to Strangford Lough, fulfilling its tourist potential.LEITRIM ndash An  month battle to have a Leitrim footpath declared a right of way has found its way to Westminster.The Parliamentary Commissioner for Complaints has been asked to investigate Banbridge Councilrsquos handling of the matter after more than  people signed a petition asking for the adoption of the footpath as a right-of-way.The footpath, which is

claim that the path is very old and was once used to reach a Mass Rock on the Backaderry Mountain and in later times, to give a short-cut to the new church in Leitrim.It is also believed the footpath is part of the old highway system that existed before the road system was introduced, and links into a system of lanes that go to Ballynahinch.The Council first became involved in the matter in August

the matter until the council appointed a countryside officer in August . He prepared a report on the footpath, which came before the council earlier this month when it was decided not to adopt itAfterwards a statement from some of the local people seeking the right-of-way said the footpath passes over land belonging to  dferent families and only one has an objection to the council adopting it..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Good Morning Down co","story":"THE head of one of the districtrsquos leading charities is officially stepping down from her role next month.Linda Baker has been Good Morning Downrsquos co-ordinator for the past  years and has watched the organisation mdash which provides a telephone befriending service to elderly and vulnerable people across the district mdash increases its operation considerably.The charity provides a valuable leline service to many people across the district, with its hardworking volunteers in regular contact with those who feel vulnerable or at risk, making telephone calls to members at an agreed time each morning.Linda said the service was especially important during the height of the coronavirus pandemic with the deadly virus unfortunately curtailing get-togethers that were organised for clients.Working in partnership with the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership, the South Eastern Trust and the Housing Executive, the charity has also received invaluable support from the Allen Lane Foundation and and Halax Community Foundation.ldquoWhen I joined Good Morning Down there were four volunteers making calls to around  people. Since then, the organisation has grown and the level of support we provided has widened considerably, Linda revealed.ldquoWe now have a team of  volunteers who are in contact with  people across the district. Despite the global pandemic, we continued to deliver the service from our homes with the calls even more appreciated by clients who could not go out themselves.Linda said that during the pandemic, the volunteers made an additional  calls to people, such was the need of elderly and vulnerable people across the community.ldquoWe started off calling people for a little friendly chat but the service we provided started to evolve. While chatting with clients remains at the heart of what we do to support those who are isolated, we now find ourselves helping people with a range of complex needs.ldquoThe charityrsquos work has evolved and I suppose it will continue to in the future, but Good Morningrsquos Down core principle will always remain the same.Linda paid tribute to all the charityrsquos staff and those who have supported the organisation over many years.ldquoWe are like family and I will be sorry to leave, she said. ldquoI have spent a large part of my working le with Good Morning Down and have literally lived and breathed the organisation and have been assisted by great people.Linda said it was ldquotremendous to meet clients when the charity organised its get-togethers and while these were put on hold due to the pandemic, she hopes there may be an opportunity do something before the end of the year.ldquoThat of course will be guided by the public health situation at the time as we are mindful that our clients are elderly, with a number of them also vulnerable.Linda said the charityrsquos service has never been more important and while she is leaving the organisation, she knows it will continue to be a key part of peoplersquos lives.She added: ldquoI really enjoyed my time with Good Morning Down and worked alongside really great people. They were the friendly voice at the end of the telephone who helped make a dference to peoplersquos lives.ldquoFor many, their chat with our volunteers was the only interaction they would have with others during the day and we were always conscious of that. We worked to make a dference and you build a special relationship with clients which is why it was so wonderful to see them when we all did meet up.As Linda prepares to say her final goodbyes, Good Morning Down is looking for someone to replace her at the helm of the charity.Anyone keen to take on taking on her role or interested in getting involved in the work of Good Morning Down is asked to contact her on    or email lindabakergmd@yahoo..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"History project looks back at  Jewish family’s links to Shrigley  ","story":"THE remarkable contribution of Jewish families in saving Shrigley has been recalled in a unique history project.The story of how Jews, fleeing the Holocaust and Hitlers murderous purge in Europe, started arriving in the village just before the start of the Second World War and helped transform the fortunes of villagers after the Hungry Thirties is largely forgotten.But more than  years later, Shrigleys legacy is featuring in an on-line interactive map telling the stories of Jewish families who have left a lasting impact on Northern Ireland.Steven Jaffe has been researching the heritage of the Jewish community across Northern Ireland.ldquoThe goal of the Belfast Jewish Heritage project Shared History fund is to locate, preserve, document and make publicly available material relating to the Jewish community in Northern Ireland, said Mr Jaffe.ldquoIt shows  sites across Northern Ireland, including Shrigley, Saintfield and Downpatrick.

They also cause signicant damage to wildle and the environment.Mourne Heritage Trust staff helped with the response to last weekrsquos wildfires using strimmers to create fire breaks, also helping with a controlled back burn and using its argocat all-terrain vehicle and fogging unit to extinguish one branch of a fire that was threatening some field boundaries.In addition, one of the Trustrsquos teams, along with a firefighter, used this specialist equipment to extinguish the fire at Finlieve near Rostrevor.NI Water has also warned that wildfires can have impact on drinking water supplies.The organisation controls so-called water catchment areas in the Mournes which supply water to all of Northern Ireland. The organisation said while it is working hard to deal with the problem of wildfires, it wants to assure customers that tap water quality is unaffected and is of a very high quality.But NI Water has warned that wildfires within catchments not only pose a terrible risk to all le but can remove the primary layer of vegetation, leaving the burned bare soil exposed to erosion which then makes its way into the reservoirs, from where water is abstracted for treatment to provide drinking water.ldquoThe erosion caused by wildfire increases carbon and other polluting chemicals signicantly in untreated water, with sediment accumulating in streams, lakes and reservoirs, said NI Waterrsquos Rebecca Allen.ldquoThis makes raw water especially dficult and more expensive to treat at our facilities to the stringent standards required by the Drinking Water Regulations. A signicant amount of other work by our water supply colleagues also has to be undertaken at the treatment works to ensure excellent quality drinking water during these times.Rebecca added: ldquoExtra water samples have to be collected and analysed, streams from burned areas need isolated, and other remedial measures must be taken like blocking streams to protect reservoirs.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke has praised firefighters, other arms of the emergency services and the Mourne Heritage Trust for their efforts to bring the blaze at the Bloody Bridge under control.He said firefighters in particular were overwhelmed by the support from the community.ldquoI witnessed the devastation of the wildfire first hand which impacted a site that is a protected habitat renowned around the world, said Cllr Clarke.ldquoThe emergency services, particularly local fire crews, should be commended for the professionalism they displayed when dealing with these incidents. However, malicious fires place a massive strain on very limited resources and as we approach the summer I would urge people to be vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the PSNI.Cllr Clarke said the damage caused by gorse fires has a lasting impact and that areas of outstanding natural beauty can take years to recover, calling for a co-ordinated response from the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, NI Water, health and public safety departments and the Department of Justice.He continued: ldquoWe need to see a collective response with a sharing of resources and there needs to be additional funding provided to build upon the best practice Mourne Heritage Trust has undertaken to reduce the impact of these fires in the High Mournes. Controlled burns and better land-management needs to be re-established.ldquoMeasures should include the establishment of fire breaks to reduce the fuel load and a cross-departmental strategic response to ensure that the scale of these fires should never happen again.Cllr Clarke said it is important that police proactively investigate what are environmental crimes and those responsible need to be assured that these types of crime will not be tolerated in society.South Down MLA Sinead Ennis has also praised firefighters for their efforts in battling huge fires in the Mournes which started at Hen Mountain and Spelga Dam.She added: ldquoTragically, these fires will have caused widespread damage to the environment and our wildle. This is yet another stark reminder that everyone must behave responsibly while visiting the Mournes in order to protect the environment and the safety of the local community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Reality TV star Matthew visits ex primary school  ","story":"FRESH from Dancing With The Stars Ireland, TV star Matthew MacNabb and his new girlfriend took the chance to visit his former primary school last week.Matthew and his professional dance partner, Laura Nolan, visited St Patrickrsquos Primary School, Legamaddy, after making it to the semi-final of the top RTE show.The visit to the school, which the Downpatrickrsquos manrsquos brother and sisters also attended, coincided with the school celebrating news of receiving a sizeable grant.It has been awarded pound, which will go towards creating a pollinator garden in the school grounds.Pupils were delighted to show Matthew and Laura around the school, particularly its new outdoor learning hub which allows to have an outdoor classroom for eco projects.The schoolrsquos Eco teacher, Mrs Bronagh Reid, said the school was delighted to welcome Matthew back.ldquoHe was very friendly to all the pupils, who found him very inspiring, said Mrs Reid. ldquoIt was good that he called with us on a day off and it was down to his mother Margaret, who sits on our board of governors.ldquoWe were all hoping that Matthew would make into the final but very impressed that he cog to the semi-final.The schoolrsquos cash injection is part of the Rural Community Pollinator Grants Scheme, which is financed by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairsand managed by the civic-pride campaign, Live Here Love Here.It is designed to allow community groups and schools across rural Northern Ireland to benefit from funding between pound, to pound, to establish, enhance or develop a local community pollinator garden.A pollinator garden is a shared space with pollinating plants, habitats, wildflowers, flowers, shrubs and trees, and the grants support new initiatives aimed at protecting and providing for pollinators.Mrs Sarah McDowell, principal, said: ldquoWe plan to use the money to create an outdoor learning space which will enhance our school grounds and the local community.ldquoWe will build an outdoor classroom and plant fruit trees to attract more wildle to our school grounds.`We are delighted to receive the support of Live Here Love Here to help us create this space which will benefit the children in our school and will help to improve bioersity in the area.She added: ldquoWe look forward to starting to create this area after Christmas and have it ready for the spring term.The pilot scheme, which made pound. million available for  , aims to cover % of costs to community groups and schools wishing to embark on the community environmental project.Successful grant applicants were required to illustrate their plans to maximise pollinator-friendly land-management techniques to increase the bioersity value of an area by planting for pollinators, and to transform unused spaces into valued community spaces, adding habitats and greening-up formerly grey areas..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Students involved in All Island lights switch off climate event  ","story":"THE lights went out at Stormont at the weekend thanks to ecologically aware local high school studentsA group of pupils from St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and Down High School, who are involved in the All-Island Schools  Climate Action programme, asked for the lights at Stormont to be switched off for one hour on Saturday evening.Local MLAs Harry Harvey and Colin McGrath helped ensure that the request was fast-tracked, with Mr Harveyrsquos we, Sharon, doing a lot of the work behind the scenes.Mr Harvey met with staff and pupils from the two schools in the grounds of Parliament Buildings to observe the dimming of the lights.Stormont joined in solidarity with the  countries from around the world that participated in the th anniversary of the global Earth Hour.

It’s an institution.”Aileen Kendall wrote: “Portrush is my home town and it has died without Barry’s or whatever you choose to call it.“I couldn’t be more grateful to be able to take my children there when we visit their grandparents in summer.”With an Easter opening looking very likely there has been an appeal by Curry’s for staff for the Portrush venue.On Curry’s Facebook page they welcomed applications from those aged  and above.The Curry family, who are based in the Eglinton area of Londonderry, signed a long-term lease with joint agents Osborne King and McKibbin Commercial for the popular tourist attraction last Tuesday.They have already confirmed that the The Big Dipper will still dominate the seafront and remain a core attraction when the fun park reopens in a few weeks.It is also understood that new rides have arrived including Cornelius Gooch’s Sizzler and Curry’s Crazy Frogs as well as new dodgems, carousel horses and new tokens.Barry’s has been one of the north coast’s most popular tourist attractions for generations. It was owned by the Trufelli family since it opened in , and was sold last year.Last week it was announced that Curry’s were to resurrect the fun park.Owen Curry from Curry’s Fun Park said: “We are delighted to have secured such a prominent trading location that is very important to Portrush and the wider north coast area.“As a family that is synonymous with the leisure industry, we can appreciate what the Trufelli family brought to Portrush over the decades.“We look forward to building on that great foundation – Portrush is an iconic destination in Northern Ireland for locals and visitors alike. “We are very excited by the prospect of operating this legendary amusement park and we look forward to getting started.”l Morning View, page "},{"url":null,"title":"prince harry and meghan markle watch how the royal romance blossomed in a new documentary with expert analysis ","story":"Great news as busy Belfast route is reopened after ongoing incident   Detectives call for information to help crack notorious murder case which saw Protestant minister beaten with nail-studded bats  years agoNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisUkraineSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensHomes  Gardense-PaperFarmingRecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPuzzlesPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsNewsPeoplePrince Harry and Meghan Markle: watch how the Royal romance blossomed in a new documentary, with expert analysisPrince Harry and Meghan Markle’s story has been one of the most talked about romances of the st Century.By Bill Smith, Latest TVFriday, th March , : pmUpdated Friday, th March , : pm  \"       \"  How did it start  Where did their love bloom  Who were the original Duke and Duchess of Sussex  With exclusive footage, this is the full story of their love covering what happened on the night they met their engagement, the royal wedding, and the challenges they faced as they searched for a home.

The Rory Best celebration evening aims to raise money for Banbridge RFCs Club for All projectand Cancer Fund for Children.Banbridge RFC President Maynard Sinton said: “As Rory took up mini rugby at Banbridge at the age of six, we’ve considered him one of our own for over  years. Now that he has retired, it feels like the right time to celebrate his achievements and we’re thrilled that he’s given us his support to push forward with our redevelopment plans.”Rory’s chosen charity, Cancer Fund for Children, will also benefit from the event. In September , Rory took on a mammoth challenge to help children across Ireland cope with the impact of cancer diagnosis. He walked  miles from Daisy Lodge, Co Down to the site of Cancer Fund for Children’s new short break centre in Mayo raising over £,, in the process.Rory Best said: “I couldn’t be prouder to work with my home club on this event. “I have had unwavering support from club members and the local community in my rugby career which means so much to me and I am delighted that I can give something back and be involved in a project which will open up opportunities in rugby to many more people from all backgrounds.“It’s an exciting time for the club as it looks to the future and I’m delighted to be able to support such a great cause”.The black-tie event will feature a host of Rory’s former playing colleagues in a series of not-to-be missed QA sessions. They will discuss their time playing with and against him as well as the upcoming Ireland tour of New Zealand and the Rugby World Cup next year. Cancer Fund for Children CEO Phil Alexander commented: “Cancer Fund for Children is proud to call Rory Best our ambassador. “Not only has he waved the flag for childhood cancer he has also raised vital funds that will help ensure children and young people impacted by cancer receive the emotional and therapeutic support they need.” For more information and to purchase a table for the event email [email#protected]——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Dunluce Centre be reinvested in upgrading the Portrush facilities.And, the Portrush Youths management are calling on other councillors to back the proposal.DUP Cllr John McAuley, seconded by Portstewart DUP councillor Mark Fielding, has tabled a notice of motion with Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council which reads:“That Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council commits to reinvest a portion of the proceeds from the recent sale of the Dunluce Centre in order to upgrade the facilities at Parker Avenue in order to ensure that they are up to a safe and suitable standard for all weather training and match play.“These upgrades must include floodlighting, installation of an articial pitch surface and action to address long running safety concerns with traffic management including poor visibility at night.”The proposal will now go before the Leisure and Development Committee of Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council on April .Read More Read MoreSingles titles double

The milestone has been welcomed by Patricia Donnelly, head of Northern Ireland’s vaccination programme. She said: “GPs, community pharmacists and Trusts have all worked extremely hard to roll out the booster campaign, with the period in the run up to Christmas particularly busy. “They all deserve our heartfelt thanks. Because of the vaccines, we now have much greater protection against the virus. “All those involved in the vaccination programme are genuine history makers.” Booster doses have been provided from the latter stages of last year, supplementing the two primary doses already received. At the same time, a third primary dose was offered to people with a severely weakened immune system, which was then followed by a booster three months after their third primary dose. The latest tallies on Northern Ireland’s vaccination dashboard include , boosters and , third doses. Patriciacontinued: “While demand for vaccines is no longer at levels from the peak of the campaign, people are still coming forward on a daily basis for boosters and first and second doses. “It’s still not too late to get these jabs. Please do so - and benefit from the really important protection they bring.” The one million landmark has been reached with the Spring booster campaign imminent. In line with UK-wide guidance set by the JCVI, the Spring campaign will offer an additional booster dose to: anyone who is aged  or over care home residents and anyone aged  and over who has a severely weakened immune system.

This increase will see the yearly gas bill of a typical household with a credit meter rise by about pound per year to pound,. Those customerswith a prepayment gas meterwill see costs increase by around pound per year to pound,. Raymond Gormley, Head of Energy Policy at the Consumer Council said: “It is important that consumers are made aware that their domestic gas bills will stay high for at least the next year because the wholesale price that the companies pay for the gas continues to be much more expensive than the norm. Unfortunately heating oil prices are also very high, so regardless of the fuel we use, many of us will experience extreme pressure on our household budgets. This will further increase the numbers of people in fuel poverty, as many families may struggle to find the extra money they will now need to pay for heating. “As the Winter   Emergency Fuel Payment Scheme ends today , we implore firmus energy, and the wider energy industry, to commit to financially supporting the continuation of a fuel hardship scheme in the coming financial year. For the longer term, it is clear that energy companies, policy makers, the Utility Regulator, charities and the Consumer Council must continue to work together to develop sustainable solutions to help support those in need as the problem of high energy prices will likely be with us for the foreseeable future.” Consumers who are struggling to pay their energy bills or struggling to pay to top-up their meter should contact their supplier directly for support.

It is believed that the specic type of tree used to make the paper - Flora Plio – has been in short supply in recent months. Paper production expert, Poppy Cox, explained why this specic type of tree was used for the production of ballot papers. “It has a special waxy quality that prevents the mark you make on your ballot paper being rubbed out,” said Mrs Cox. “That obviously adds an added level of security to the elections and stops people claiming that their ballot has been changed.” Alternatives are now being sought and the two week delay in the vote will hopefully allow for the ballot to be printed on a dferent type of paper. “It is possible that we could see a special kind of foolscap being useda secure alternative can’t be found,” Mrs Cox added.
