If you ask somebody to leave you give them the required notice, which in this case was two months.\u0027 Asked about being reported to the police, Ken said: \u0027I was quite surprised about that.\u0027We were having discussions - if she wants to complain about it then that\u0027s up to her.\u0027\u0027I can\u0027t really say anything more.

I\u0027m sorry it\u0027s ended up like this as we\u0027ve had quite a good relationship.\u0027I got on very well with her. I have every sympathy for her - she has four young children.\u0027          Ms Beattie (pictured with her ex-partner and one of her children) claims that problems with her landlord Morley began when she complained to the council about the state of the property Both parties agree the situation has arisen over problems with Michelle\u0027s former partner whose name had to be taken off the lease.She admits he has had problems with alcohol and Ken insists the police have had to be called \u0027five times\u0027. In 2015 Ken was thrown out of the Celebrity Big Brother house in a storm of controversy after using the N-word and accused of sexist slurs.He repeatedly clashed with his housemates and was evicted after the use of the word in a conversation about former boxer Frank Bruno.

They will even take away our name: and if we want to keep it, we will have to find our strength to do so, to manage somehow so that behind the name something of us, of us as we were, still remains.”So Primo Levi describes the beginning of the process of “the demolition of a man”, the “offence” that Auschwitz inflicted on so many people. “Häftling,” he writes in If This Is a Man, using the German word for prisoner, “I have learned that I am a Häftling. My name is 174517.”Throughout If This Is a Man, Levi reiterates that survival was mainly a matter of random events, coincidences and fortune. But it also required stubborn resistance. As Levi explains an afterword, he remained “determined to recognise always, even in the darkest days, in my companions and in myself, men, not things.”Levi holds on to this humanity until the camp is liberated. But he has been hollowed out by hunger, toil and unremitting horror. His sense of self has been undermined by mental and bodily weakness and the moral compromises needed for survival. If This Is a Man finishes with Levi in a kind of perilous limbo. He hasn’t “drowned”, as he terms it, but nor does he show us much about salvation. The last pages are strange and abrupt. The Russians arrive as Levi and a companion – Charles – are carrying a corpse outside their hut. They tip over the stretcher. Charles takes off his beret Levi regrets he doesn’t have one too. We get a hint that Levi has resumed life, because he tells us he’s been writing letters to other survivors. And that’s it.It’s in the sequel The Truce that Levi tells us how he rebuilt his humanity after it was demolished in Auschwitz. It’s a long climb into the light and – remarkably – it’s frequently beautiful. More than that, it’s funny.The book tells of Levi’s final days in the camp in southern Poland before his eventual return home to Turin, via numerous extended detours and meanderings through Soviet Russia, Rumania, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Austria. It is a long, “ludicrous journey”, as Philip Toynbee described it in the Observer when the book first came out in English in 1965: “a poem in honour of human wit and endurance”.The Truce is full of wonder. Early on, for instance, Levi crashes down to sleep in a telegraph hut by a railway line. When he wakes, the telegraphist sees him raise his head and places “an enormous slice of bread and cheese” beside him. After Levi’s descriptions of the scarcity and brutality of Auschwitz, this abundant generosity feels special. But it’s what comes next that is most miraculous. “I was startled,” Levi writes, “and I fear I did not thank him.”That he should worry about such a small courtesy – and be in a position where it could even occur to him - feels like an early victory for his strengthening sense of humanity. And it keeps on getting better from there. Soon, Levi is providing comical descriptions of a “surly” Greek who berates him for having no shoes, who knows “how to work all the skives in the world” and who manages to charm a barracks full of Italian soldiers: “He possessed the right equipment he could speak Italian, and (what matters more and what is missing in many Italians themselves) he knew of what to speak in Italian.”It’s a delight to encounter such light-hearted jokes in The Truce after the miseries of If This Is a Man. In the latter, there was the numbing, frightening sense that Levi had no choice but to scour his surroundings for every detail that could change his ability to survive. In The Truce, we see a new curiosity awakening as Levi delights in his surroundings.The Truce even takes on a picaresque quality, with its hero providing a rich variety of wry character sketches and fascinated depictions of lands and peoples. But there are also harsh jolts of reality: many nights spent in stalled railway carriages, forced break-ins to ramshackle refugee camps, numerous uncertainties and dangers.And there’s the shadow of Auschwitz. Sometimes Levi reminds us of the camp to show us how its cruel systems have disappeared. Barbed wire fences have holes. The soldiers he encounters are drunk, asleep or cheerily helpful. The ruthless efficiency of the kapos and SS has been replaced by local bureaucracies that are confused, slapdash, unpredictable. Crucially, this time, the train takes him away and out of danger. Levi is no longer a häftling. There is plenty of himself that remains and plenty that he has regained. He has clothes, shoes, a name.But a profound darkness hangs over the book. Levi reminds us at the end that he is one of only three making this journey away from Auschwitz when he was sent there, he was one among 650. In the last pages he recounts a terrifying recurring dream within a dream, in which his new, light-filled life is a dream he is having in the camp. The final word in the book is chilling. It is the “dawn command” to get up: “Wstawàch.” For all the joy in The Truce, Auschwitz is never far away."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1be28d9b0c0aee4bff672b6e3d54e230a25f10de/0_812_4277_2567/master/4277.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c5ce2fdc52252488fab8efdc18d0749","title":"markets uk unemployment wages ryanair boeing 737 max mark carney business live","story":"Sterling is sliding as UK and Brussels head for fresh clash over the Irish BackstopWith Brexit pressure building, the pound has just tumbled through the $1.24 mark for the first time in 27 months.Sterling has dropped as low as $1.2396 for the first time since early April 2017, as investors fret that a no-deal Brexit is more likely.The selloff comes as EU officials continue to resist UK pressure to remove the Irish backstop from the Brexit deal.“If the Brits really think we are so scared of a no-deal Brexit, they are being naive.”Neil Wilson of Markets suspects that the tough talk about no-deal Brexit’s could fade as the 31st October deadline approaches - possibly giving the pound some support.Both Conservative leadership candidates are taking the hard line on Brexit to appeal to the Tory membership.As previously stated, we have to remember that once faced with the granite reality of Number 10, recalcitrant MPs and the EU, there may be a softening.How much lower could the pound go?Capital Economics have calculated that sterling could slump as low as $1.15 against the US dollar after a no-deal Brexit, down from $1.24 today.That would send inflation surging higher (as imported goods would become pricier, especially if new tariffs were also imposed).But if the UK was to leave the EU with a deal, the pound could rally back to $1.40 within a couple of years, they suggest, in a report published today.Here’s their forecasts:Capital Economics also warn that economic growth would also suffer after a disruptive no-deal Brexit:In a no deal scenario, both exports and imports would plunge as delays at the ports would prevent goods from entering and leaving the country for a few weeks. Weak domestic demand in the aftermath may mean imports take longer to recover.As a result, the external sector might provide some support to the economy, but only enough to offset a fraction of the overall slowdown in GDP growthMany ministers opposed to a hard Brexit expect to lose their jobs once Boris Johnson becomes prime minister.My colleague Andy Sparrow reports that some farewell presents have already been dished out in the House of Commons:There is a real end-of-term feeling in the Commons at the moment. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, gave Philip Hammond, the chancellor, what was effectively a leaving present in Treasury questions recently - a book of radical walks. Today Greg Clark, the business secretary, gave a model car to his Labour counterpart, Rebecca Long-Bailey. Clark handed over the gift after speaking about changes to the UK automotive industry and new electric vehicle projects.Hammond and Clark are both expected to be sacked next week, largely because they are both firmly opposed to a no-deal Brexit. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, the two candidates left in the Tory leadership contest, insist no-deal must remain an option, and their comments about the backstop last night have made it even more probable.More details in Andy’s Politics Liveblog:Nick Macpherson was formerly the top civil servant in the UK Treasury, helping to steer Britain’s economy through the financial crisis a decade ago.He’s alarmed that both Johnson and Hunt seem quite happy to “debauch” the pound, in their search for the support of Conservative Party members.City brokerage BP Prime also blame Boris Johnson for today’s selloff.The pound could slide further, as the next Brexit deadline (31 October) approaches, warns analyst Stephen Innes of Vanguard Markets:Sterling has been under intense selling pressure after both candidates for UK Prime Minister’s position toughened their stances on the Withdrawal Agreement and the Irish backstop at the final debate which suggests the Pound will remain extremely vulnerable if the no-deal Brexit continues gaining momentum.Jordan Rochester, FX strategist at Nomura, says investors aren’t convinced that Johnson will convince EU leaders to drop the backstop, if he becomes prime minister.  It will take a big charm offensive by Boris Johnson to move them. Hence why folks are saying this increases the risks of a no deal Brexit.” Rochester also fears that the pound could become more volatile, given the political upheaval on the horizon:“Over the next few weeks and months, the UK will have a new prime minister, chancellor, cabinet, Bank of England governor, budget and Brexit plan. Despite all the above, foreign exchange volumes are near historical lows once again. This is unlikely to last.”Thu Lan Nguyen, a currency strategist at Commerzbank, says the chance of Britain leaving the EU with a deal are falling (just like the pound!)The pound weakness is a reaction to the two prime minister contenders opposing the Irish backstop, which dramatically reduces the chance for a Brexit with a deal.“So this leaves only two options, no-deal Brexit, or no Brexit. As both Johnson and Hunt have made clear they want Brexit, chances of a no-deal Brexit are rising.”More here on Bloomberg.Johnson and Hunt’s hardline pitches on Brexit have worried the City, says Vasileios Gkionakis, global head of forex strategy at Lombard Odier, the Swiss banking group.Gkionakis says the Conservative leadership race has “has transformed into an arms race of who is a bigger Brexiter,” Reuters reports.“The market is pricing in a higher probability of a no-deal Brexit and an increase of economic pressure.”You have the perfect storm for sterling,.The People’s Vote campaign, who are calling for a second EU referendum, say holidaymakers will suffer from Johnson and Hunt’s hardline views on the Backstop.They point out that the pound has weakened during the Conservative leadership campaign, in which most candidates took a hard line on Brexit.Here’s the data:Wes Streeting MP, leading supporter of the People’s Vote campaign, points out that a weaker pound hurts tourists heading abroad, as well as making imports more expensive.“Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt want to impose a hard Brexit, or even a destructive No Deal on us, without giving us the final say. That won’t just threaten jobs in the car industry, steel or financial services, it will hit ordinary families hard by trashing the value of the pound and sending the price of everything from petrol at the pumps to two weeks at Disneyland soaring.Streeting argues that the economic costs of a hard Brexit justify a second vote:This Brexit crisis has come down to a simple question about whether we live in a democracy: no one has the right to force a destructive No Deal on the country without all of us having our voice heard in a People’s Vote.”City traders are selling the pound in droves, after hearing Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt both put the boot into the Irish backstop in their debate last night.The backstop is a key part of Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement, and would keep the UK locked in a customs union after Brexit if a free trade deal isn’t agreed.Johnson argued last night that it can’t be fixed simply though being made ‘time-limited’: “The problem is really fundamental. It needs to come out.”I think the problem is very fundamental. It has been devised by this country as an instrument of our own incarceration in the single market and customs union. It needs to come out.”The backstop, as it is, is dead.I don’t think tweaking it with a time limit will do the trick.But as Brussels is committed to avoiding a hard border in Ireland, they may not accept that the backstop has expired - and without a solution, getting a deal by 31 October looks less likely. Today’s selloff is driving the pound down to the 27-year lows suffered in early 2017, in the months after the EU referendum.NEWSFLASH: The pound has just hit its lowest level against the US dollar in over two years, as fears of a no-deal Brexit grip the financial markets.Sterling has fallen to just $1.2420, shedding a whole cent today, to its weakest point since April 2017 (shortly before Theresa May called her ill-fated general election).The pound has also sunk to a fresh six-month low against the euro, at €1.107.This is a blow to any families planning foreign holidays in Europe or America this summer.The slump comes after the two men vying to be Britain’s prime minister, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, both declared that the Northern Ireland backstop is “dead”.Hunt and Johnson both insisted last night that they would remove the backstop from a new Brexit deal, or leave the European Union without a deal.But Brussels insiders insist that the backstop will not be ditched -- raising fears that Britain will crash out of the EU this autumn.My colleague Lisa O’Carroll explains that the UK has already been told the plan is a non-starter:Brussels had already rebuffed such a plan when the Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, who is now part of Johnson’s campaign, met the EU’s chief Brexitnegotiator, Michel Barnier, last week.In what was seen as “spinning for a Boris plan”, Barclay told Barnier that the backstop was dead five times during the meeting. Sources say he told Barner that they wanted a series of mini deals and alternative arrangements for the Irish border.He was told that was Brexit fantasy and a non-starter, and that the “mini deals” outlined in EU contingency plans were temporary and only covered the “bare bones” such as aviation, mobile phone roaming and haulier driver licences. They did not include the major issues such as trade or the Irish border.TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady is urging the government not to be complacent about the labour market: “Wage growth is still below pre-crisis levels. Today’s figures are little consolation for workers still feeling the effects of the longest pay squeeze for 200 years.“Working people are facing huge uncertainty. With the Bank of England expecting growth to flatline, the government must act to support the economy.“Ministers should raise the minimum wage to £10 as quickly as possible, and increase public investment, including on public services. And unions must have the freedom to enter every workplace to negotiate fair pay rises.”Andy Bruce of Reuters has also spotted that rising self-employment is making up for a drop in the number of employed workers.The Resolution Foundation have produced some neat charts showing how wages are growing across the UK economy... but still not fast enough to reach their levels before the financial crisis (once you adjust for inflation).Geraint Johnes, professor of economics at Lancaster University Management School, has spotted a significant trend -- a big jump in part-term self-employed workers.There are now 4.96 million self-employed people, an increase of 167,000 over the last year.Professor Johnes fears that some people are being driven into insecure and unreliable gig-economy work:Following the pattern of recent months, the labour market statistics exhibit a shift towards less secure forms of employment. While the overall employment level continued to rise in the three months to May of this year, the composition of this increase is a source of some concern. The number of full-time employees fell by some 77000, and the number of part-time employees also fell slightly. There was a modest increase in the number of full-time self-employed workers, but the main source of employment growth has been part-time self-employment.This grew by a massive 104,000 over the quarter. While many jobs of this kind offer workers the flexibility that they might want, this may come at a cost in terms of insecurity. As parts of the traditional engine room struggle in the current economic climate, workers may increasingly be turning to the gig economy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/155ac7edd135d7be4adb158a3be11de09b14ad43/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de35c51b39ee1d7b532d565dd3378c15","title":"easy or bland outdated or ordered whats it like to live in a planned city","story":"This week  Cities has been exploring cities built from scratch around the world. Here’s a roundup of readers’ experiences – from Harlow to Perth, Shannon to IslamabadPerth really is about as bland a built environment as you could imagine, luckily set on amazing natural beauty. But its planning is still rooted firmly in 1950s style suburbia and auto dependence. Car ownership is one of the highest in Australia, which nationally is one of the highest in the world. Vibrancy is lacking, community occurs despite, not encouraged by, the built environment. Walking is hardly done, and the streets of suburbia are deserted as everyone drives.Milton Keynes is comfortably the easiest town or city I’ve lived in – not the prettiest, or the most interesting, but certainly the most pleasant to live compared with other traditional British urban landscapes. You quickly realise why visitors will struggle to warm to it while residents love living here. On first appearances it’s all fast roads, roundabouts (yes, yes) and housing estates. Very easy to dismiss, just another post-war new town. Spend some time among those odd highway intersections and you’ll discover the hidden pockets of preserved villages, rivers, canals, woodlands that were very carefully integrated into the modern network. And let’s stop describing it as a sea of concrete – there’s more grass, shrubbery and vast swathes of trees wherever you look. On a mundane level, it has most of what young families, young professionals and retired people could want – a strong local economy, fast travel connections, good amenities and numerous leisure facilities. But these are what makes it work as a place to live. Everything is so easy to access that you could forgive it its faults. For a town so meticulously planned there still exist the usual issues of crumbling housing, over development and a poor provision of local public transport in a town that is so enamoured with car ownership. Nevertheless, after having lived here for a decade, I’m a full convert to the cult of MK. Jules Rye, 37While the city itself is old, the vast majority has been built over the past 20 years. It certainly comes with a lot of conveniences and wonders, but people living here often find things to complain about. You never have to ask how far someplace is, though unless you’re going downtown, pretty much everywhere is 20 minutes away, wherever you are. Arad, 18Shannon is the only planned town in Ireland. Because of the presence of the airport it was far more cosmopolitan than any other town or even city in Ireland at the time. I had Danish and Swedish classmates and Aeroflot had a base here which meant signs in Cyrillic in the local bank. Everything was in walking distance and to this day Shannon has the highest rate of children walking to school in Ireland. On the negative side there was no high street at all in the town, just a dispiriting shopping centre in the middle of town. Restrictive planning meant two pubs in the whole place. AnonymousIslamabad is now over 60 years old. Even though it is a planned city, much has now been growing without any vision or direction. Due to the rapid growth of population, demand for housing skyrocketed which led to the development of urban sprawl and of private housing societies. To this day, the authorities have failed to address housing and commercial needs. Businesses and schools are forced to operate within residential areas illegally due to a lack of zoned areas for their activities. I find it perplexing that I live in a premium gated housing society and can enjoy a lifestyle comparable to living in Dubai located right next to the mud huts of rural migrants. Ammaz, 23I was brought up in Harlow from birth. It was great until adolescence, with lots of open space, we had a great council house with a huge garden and purpose-built primary and secondary schools. There were also lots of jobs in the 1960s and 70s. But in adolescence it was rubbish because of the huge distances between neighbourhoods at a time when you wanted to be out roaming around. Public transport was poor and pricey. You could cycle but the bike paths became badly maintained and threatening over time. I left at 19 and never returned. Michael, 60I moved from Sydney when I got tired of my three-hour commute and the prospect of choosing between living with my parents or paying a third of my salary in rent (at a minimum). Here, I’m considered to live “far” from my workplace, which still only translates to a 20-minute drive in peak hour.I love the orderliness and ease that makes things comfortable, not boring. In Canberra, my biggest problem is deciding between multiple arts events in a night. Our relatively high rate of public housing peppered evenly throughout (although diminishing) also makes the city feel safer.

Walking along the highway would take nearly three hours. A taxi is faster but expensive.So he takes the town’s public transit: Uber.“It’s great for young people, especially if you don’t have a licence,” he said after arriving at the branch of Tommy Hilfiger where he works. In 2017, the town in Ontario, Canada, embarked on an ambitious – and, to its critics, fraught – experiment. It handed responsibility for public transit to the ride-sharing app Uber.Instead of buses or trains plying regular routes, it is Uber’s roving cars that function as the transit fleet. When a rider opens the app, Innisfil Transit pops up as the cheapest option to travel between a network of popular areas called “hubs”, such as libraries, the recreation centre or municipal buildings.The costs per ride vary, but on average passengers pay an average of CAD$5 (£3), with the city subsiding the rest. Trips outside subsidised areas receive a flat $6 discount.Two years later, the Innisfil authorities argue that the project has been a success. Ridership is high – in 2018 there were 85,943 trips – and many residents have embraced the service.“We just absolutely love Uber. I take it, my son takes it, my dad takes it. I take it,” said Shannon Kelly-Robb, who works at one of the libraries.But beyond the excitement of essentially having subsidised taxi service, experts paint a more troubling picture of questionable economic and environmental sustainability. The city has now spent more on Uber than the traditional transit option it was considering, and has dramatically increased the number of cars on its roads, with worrying implications for air quality and the climate crisis.What’s more, Innisfil Transit has now attracted attention as the latest step in a growing assault on public transit systems by ride-sharing companies. Urban planners fear Uber isn’t just taking riders away from public transit but that it is hoping to replace public transit altogether.In London and Denver, Uber has integrated public transit options into its app to become a “one-stop shop for transportation”. In regulatory filings, published in advance of its May IPO, Uber said it wants to “replace personal vehicle ownership and usage and public transportation one use case at a time”.Innisfil’s deal with Uber is nothing “other than a more expedited and abundant taxi system. That’s all it is,” said Jarrett Walker, a transit consultant based in Portland, Oregon, and author of Human Transit. “The notion that Uber has anything useful to offer public transit is just preposterous.”Innisfil saw it differently. A community of 40,000 north of Toronto, it is a typical small North American town, with widely spaced houses on large lots that makes efficient public transit a logistical challenge.The town desperately needed transit, said Paul Pentikainen, Innisfil’s senior planner. But the option on the table – three bus routes – would cost the council nearly $1m. So they tried to think creatively.The contract also meant more work for Uber drivers, whose number in Innisfil increased to 2,203 in 2018. “I just needed a sustainable income after I retired,” said Dennis West, who started driving for Uber in December 2017. “This is a nice gig. You can do it when you want to do it – and you can do it as much as you want to do it. It works well.”But success has come at an ironic cost to the town. Because Innisfil subsidises each ride, the more successful it is, the more the town pays to Uber. That figure is now projected to reach $1.2m for 2019 – more than the bus programme would have cost, and well above the $900,000 the city allocated. With ridership increasing each year, costs will only rise.In fact, the town has taken the extraordinary step of deterring people from using Uber too much, capping the number of rides a resident can take per month. For mall worker Arrega, who has been “working like crazy”, that often means exceeding the limit midway through the month, although the town allows riders to apply for an exemption. It has also increased the cost of a ride by $1.Still, he understands why Innisfil made the decision, saying it might be the right thing to do for a sprawling town with low population density where bus stops would be far from destinations.Nevertheless, Uber’s messaging is working: planners from other cities have contacted Innisfil for advice on how to create a similar system, said Pentikainen.But Spieler warns that what might work for more rural areas would be a disaster in denser cities.Pentikainen also brushed off concerns with Uber’s controversial labour practices, which have received intense scrutiny in many cities, saying drivers “absolutely love the job” and the town has received no complaints over compensation.As for the environmental impact, there is even less doubt about the negative impact. Compared to fixed routes, said Walker, a system like Innisfil Transit “usually means carrying few people at higher costs, therefore achieving lower climate benefits”.Both Walker and Spieler still argue that there is a role for private companies to deliver transit services, but say apps masquerading as novel innovations can obscure more important components of a transit system – namely, serving a public need beyond of any short-term costs savings by developing infrastructure to allow for environmentally sustainable and financially accessible services for the future.What’s more, with the precarious finances of larger ride-sharing companies now well known, municipalities have yet another reason to worry.“We know that Lyft and Uber are both losing massive amounts of money. We know they are both underpaying their drivers,” said Spieler. “If you’re doing this to save money, what insurance do you have that five years from now, it will still save you money?In the meantime, Innisfil officials have openly mused about fixing some of the problems of Uber – by turning to Uber. The latest suggestion to the cost overruns? UberBus: a bus that runs a fixed route, just like a normal city bus.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e157ad3d09d9adf5631780e427bf085877ce7c25/0_148_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f21acca40de480bc45f9d5ea73bee448","title":"which is the worlds most vertical city","story":"You might think of Hong Kong, given its famous skyscraper skyline, but by different measures of verticality other cities come out on topLooking out from sky100, Hong Kong’s highest observation deck on the 100th floor of the city’s tallest building, the 494-metre-high International Commerce Centre, you get a 360-degree view of one of the world’s most famous skylines – an urban jungle framed by mountains and the gleaming Victoria harbour, with endless clusters of high-rise buildings packed so closely together they resemble a game of Tetris.It’s little wonder a city of such visible density has more skyscrapers than anywhere else in the world. According to the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH), Hong Kong has 355 buildings over 150m in height.But having that accolade does not necessarily make Hong Kong the most vertical city. By different measures, other cities come out on top.According to building data research company Emporis, Seoul in South Korea has more high-rise buildings, with 16,359. Emporis defines a high-rise as a building at least 35m, or 12 storeys tall. In second place is Moscow, Russia, with 12,317 high-rises, followed by Hong Kong in third place, with 7,913.When it comes to the world’s tallest buildings, Hong Kong doesn’t even make the top 10. Dubai’s Burj Khalifa takes top spot, at 828m. Dubai has 50 skyscrapers under construction, more than any other city. These include the 1,300m-tall Dubai Creek Tower, expected to be completed in 2020 and will be the tallest structure ever built.Is there a height we shouldn’t go beyond? “From a practical standpoint, today’s structural engineering can facilitate a 2,000m building, though it would be enormously expensive to construct,” says Daniel Safarik of CTBUH. “But even if we have buildings that are unfathomably tall by today’s standards, the key will be breaking them down into scales that allow humans to relate to each other. Of course it’s great to have commanding views, but it’s also essential to have equalising interactions.”Some architects and urban designers – in particular a group called Vertical City – want to take vertical living to new heights. They foresee a future where we live in interconnected mega-towers that each contain all the components of a city in one building so that, in theory, you never have to leave if you don’t want to.Kenneth King and Kellogg Wong, the architects behind Vertical City, claim it as a solution for sustainable living. “High capacity, high efficiency ultra-tall buildings occupying a relatively small, car-free, pedestrian-friendly parcel of land,” they say. “Within this footprint are all the self-sustaining features of infrastructure, buildings, facilities, and services necessary for improving the living, working, cultural, entertainment, sports, recreation, and leisure qualities of life for residents.”Maybe these interconnected mega-towers – or something like them – are not so far-fetched. “I definitely think some people will live in such interconnected complexes, especially in high-density cities,” says Safarik. “Already in Chongqing, China, a building complex, Raffles City, that is the size of a small city is almost finished. It will have one of the longest and highest skybridges in the world.”Hong Kong-born architect Lap-chi Kwong, with his American partner Alison Von Glinow, believe that their Tower within a Tower design may have hit upon a solution to help combat the lack of community and social interaction that high-rise living often breeds, by helping people meet their neighbours. Tower within a Tower consists of apartment buildings where inidual units are built vertically – with rooms stacked on top of each other – instead of the usual horizontal “pancake stack” apartments that hinder neighbourly interaction.“In Hong Kong we thought this could be especially interesting because it is such a vertical city that the people, through Tower within a Tower, can actually live vertically and get to experience what it’s like to be on multiple levels rather than just a single level within their building,” says Von Glinow. “The way that we addressed creating more liveable communities within a tower typology is by erasing the corridor. Instead we create circulation spaces that can be more flexible and create what we think are more community-friendly spaces within the tower.”This idea of bringing verticality into the apartment in order to create more spaces for neighbourly interaction has yet to be taken up by a developer, but Von Glinow and her partner remain hopeful. “Tower within a Tower is looking at unique spaces that aren’t standardised on each level but standardised every four levels, so it will take some time for a developer to want to participate in a project like this, but we’re hopeful.”Whether Hong Kong with the most skyscrapers, or Seoul with the most high-rises, is currently the world’s most vertical city is open to debate. Meanwhile, Dubai and a clutch of Chinese cities are building multiple skyscrapers every year – but that could stop any day. One thing is certain, with urban populations increasing and available land more or less finite, vertical cities will continue their rise.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb114a45c2156dcca30590b2c3111b14da376987/275_190_1695_1017/master/1695.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6c5187f9de01adbb50798a42398240d","title":"theres a real scene happening here how dig brew co put birmingham craft beer on the map","story":" Oliver Webb started brewing while at university. Now he runs Dig Brew Co, which produces the tipples of choice for Birmingham’s cultural sceneOn the edge of Birmingham’s city centre lies Digbeth, a partially deserted industrial landscape of former Victorian factories, warehouses and tall railway arches. For the past few decades, it has been a handy place for artists and independent businesses to set up shop and take advantage of large spaces with low rents. Dig Brew Co, founded by 27-year-old Oliver Webb, recently joined this artistic hub, its craft brewery and taproom sitting proudly in a former gun factory on River Street.Webb studied at the Slade School of Fine Art, part of University College London, and says sky-high prices in the capital gave him the idea to start running bars. “We’d be working until 10pm but couldn’t afford to go anywhere, as all the bars and clubs in London are so expensive. So I set up a bar in my studio space and started serving cocktails and cheap beer we bought from the supermarket,” he says.Webb used his artist’s woodworking and sculpture skills to create a collapsible “tiki bar” in his parents’ back garden in Wolverhampton. He shipped it to London and also started to brew his own beer. “We made our own beer from home-brew kits, as it was cheaper than buying from supermarkets. The bar was really popular and we just put out a donation box for people. But, eventually, the police shut us down for not having a licence.”From that point on, the idea of running a pub was in Webb’s mind, and he began learning the art of brewing. Meanwhile, his lecturers were recommending that students visit the growing number of galleries and exhibitions happening in Digbeth. Webb left university and worked briefly for a log cabin company, while also selling tiki bars on the side. His father introduced him to Peter Towler, the owner of Mad O’Rourke’s World Famous Pie Factory. Towler decided to back the young entrepreneur, and Dig Brew Co took possession of its brewery space in March 2017.“I painted it all myself,” recalls Webb. “I rented a sprayer and covered the walls with £1,000 worth of white paint. I built the bar myself, too. We got mash tun, kettles and fermenters on hire purchase – I could never have done that without Peter.”To make it easy for customers to pay, Webb brought in iZettle’s payment systems to enable card payments. “They are easy to use and so training staff is no problem. The machine connects to an app and that makes sense to our staff and customers,” he says.The brewery, opened in October 2017, now employs 20 staff and brews a selection of lagers, stouts and bitters, including its double IPA Dagger Dagger and popular Hell lager. Webb hired a head brewer who now looks after the beer, while he focuses on running the business. However, Webb says it took a while to catch on. “When we opened, nothing much happened. We knew nothing about PR or promotions, so there weren’t many people coming in,” he says.But sometimes, when you’re struggling, helping others can be the answer. James Connolly, owner of Gorilla Coffee Cafe, became a customer and taproom regular when Webb helped him out of a tight spot. “Oli was in my cafe and he saw I was having trouble with a broken beer dispenser,” Connolly recounts. “He lent me one and so I ended up buying some beer from him. A lot of our customers are his target market. They want a sense of community, an experience, and they want it to be fun,” he says.Other local businesses and arts venues liked the idea of buying beer brewed in Brum and Webb also started selling kegs to businesses such as the burger restaurant Original Patty Men. Webb’s arts background helped him make connections and see opportunities that other breweries would likely miss. One example was the decision to host the Infinite Opera company, which performed Besse, a production about beer, feminism and witchcraft. “It was a fitting venue as the early brewsters were all women,” says Kim McAleese, programme director at Grand Union, which houses the Infinite Opera. “There were over a hundred people here to see the Infinite Opera perform between the steel tanks in the brewery.”Local festivals and event spaces have also been big buyers, with the Home of Metal Black Sabbath rock exhibition and gallery space Eastside Projects among its client list. But the big breakthrough for Dig Brew Co came when it beat Guinness to become sponsor for Birmingham’s St Patrick’s Day event and its Mayo stout was on offer to the thousands that attended.“There were smiles all around the room when we made that decision,” says Peter Connolly, chairman of the St Patrick’s Day festival. “Most of the pubs in Digbeth are independently owned by Irish families and Dig Brew Co is all about community,” he adds.Webb says he wants his business to be about far more than just making beer. The city of Birmingham has been through hard times, but he and others in the arts and creative sector seem determined for it to have brighter days. “There’s a real scene happening here and we are providing beer for a lot of those involved in it.”To find out how iZettle helps small businesses like Dig Brew Co, visit izettle"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f26bd299e1cf021eea9216490310a7197fd1b5df/0_0_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0ef8584e31715a2fbaf57647a2c9cb7","title":"going cashless has been huge for us the coffee shop thats stopped using cash","story":"For young entrepreneur Ed Barry, running a business has had its ups and downs. But embracing the cashless economy has paid offIt’s no secret that the great British high street is warming to the idea of going, if not cashless, then certainly less cash. In the past 15 years, we’ve seen the introduction of contactless cards and mobile phone payments (or digital wallets).That’s exactly what Ed Barry, 28, owner of west London coffee shop and cocktail bar Over Under Coffee, has done. Barry’s Earl’s Court shop is only a stone’s throw away from the tube station, where relaxed customers work on their laptops or discuss things over plates of food from the simple “toast and toppings” menu, made in the shop’s flatpack kitchen.The space is small but comfy, and the furnishings simple but effective, much like the business as a whole. For two years, Over Under Coffee has been a cashless business – a practice more common now, but not so when he first adopted it after a successful trial month at the start of 2018.Barry recalls some teething issues – the odd customer who’d prefer cash, for example – but Over Under Coffee was already taking the vast majority of its payments using card and, reflecting back on it, Barry feels his business has reached the level it’s at today because of the decision.“Going cashless has been huge for us,” Barry says. “It’s been a big talking point, and everyone knows about it. I think generally Londoners are warming to it, because of things such as Oyster cards, for example.“We’ve had a few hiccups along the way, but generally it’s been quicker for us – quicker for the customer.”His two shops in Earl’s Court and West Brompton have been operating completely cashless for more than two years, powered solely by iZettle and Barry and his team’s enthusiasm.For the uninitiated, iZettle is a mobile point-of-sale device and integrated app that takes card payments, both contactless and chip and pin. It’s affordable – with an iZettle Reader only costing £29 (for your first reader, £59 for subsequent readers) without having to sign up to a contract or pay high fees – and its accompanying app can be used for accounting, inventory and business analytics, which has helped Barry every step of the way.“iZettle has always been super supportive of us: we always get a really good rate, and we’re not tied into a contract,” Barry says. “The devices look cool on the counter and they’re portable, too – we do a lot of events and we just use our phone hotspot to make payments, so it’s really easy to use. It’s basically plug and pay for payments, so it’s great for small businesses like us.”“Supporting independent businesses such as Over Under Coffee is iZettle’s whole reason for existing. We want to ensure that they have the tools they need to start, run and grow their businesses,” says Ed Hallett, managing director at iZettle UK.At 6pm at Over Under Coffee, the counters, seating and walls all flip around to reveal their evening cocktail bar alter egos.“I wanted to create a really welcoming environment, and have that throughout the day and then throughout the night,” Barry says. “My whole ethos is: there’s no point in working in hospitality if you’re not going to have a positive impact on somebody’s day. A positive mental attitude is something I try to filter through our entire company and culture.“Just because there’s a counter between us doesn’t mean we can’t talk like we’re mates. It’s not going to please everyone, but I’d rather verge on too friendly than the opposite.”But it’s not always been easy for him to create and run a business as a millennial entrepreneur in London.“There have definitely been tough periods. Some months I couldn’t pay myself any money. I had never run my own shop, I’d never been a boss, I’d never written employment contracts, or taken accounts,” Barry explains. “We opened our second shop too quickly and had to close it within four months. We picked the wrong location, we got the layout of the bar wrong, we hired the wrong people.“But now we’ve got another shop in West Brompton, west London, and are opening another place in Manchester next month. So each year you have to take stock of what you’ve learned and realise that the things you thought were problems at first are actually very easy to do, but only if you’re willing to learn on the job.”To find out how iZettle can help your business, visit izettle"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a1b0dc6ee8f4dec5af258c787b953c417af5049/0_66_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=818739c85203c89addfad8b8c84dce54","title":"learn what people want 10 tips on how to create a successful vintage fashion business","story":"Flea markets are a favourite weekend pastime for many. Here’s how to turn your passion for fashion into a bustling market stallIf your ideal weekend is spent hitting up car boot sales, browsing charity shops and scouring Etsy for the perfect vintage find, then having your own stall may seem like the dream job – or at least the dream side hustle. But what are the tips and tricks to make your vintage fashion business a success? We asked successful stall owners how they went from vintage fan to thriving market trader – and how you can do the same.1. Start small“Don’t get carried away and invest a lot of money at the start,” says Amanda Barnes, whose shop Ooh La La Vintage in Dorset began as a stall at events and vintage festivals. “Keep expectations realistic and reassess every few months before you buy more stock. Even if you’re just doing it as a hobby, it’s a good idea to write a loose business plan. Decide how much you’ll spend on stock, and think about other expenses, such as travel and the cost of the pitch. Then work out how much you need to sell to recoup costs and turn a profit.”2. Follow your passion“Think about your current vintage collection and whether there’s a theme that stands out, because that’s what you should focus on,” says Sarah Horrillo, who started her Portobello Road stall London Vintage six years ago. “When I first started out, I did a lot of vintage table linens and homeware now I just focus on women’s clothes. But your passion might be accessories or childrenswear or denim or ’50s clothes. As you build up your business, people will come to associate you with a particular theme.”3. Build a brand“From the outset, think about who you’re trying to reach and what you’re offering,” says Kerry Norton, a part-time nurse who also runs Sisters of the Moon, a vintage stall in London and Brighton. “Get a logo and business cards, so that if a customer doesn’t buy anything that day, they can go away and find you. Get an Instagram account – it’s a really important way to build up a following – and pay attention to analytics. If a particular item is getting lots of likes, you’ll know to look out for similar pieces.”4. Go contactless“I set myself up with iZettle straight away,” says Norton. “Loads of people don’t carry cash and people want contactless payments, which makes things so much easier and quicker and less hassle than rummaging around for change. It’s also a good idea to have a separate bank account for your stall, so you can keep track of incomings and outgoings.”5. Always be on the hunt“The hardest part of the job is finding the right pieces – and no one wants to reveal their sources,” says Norton. “Some traders use wholesalers, but my stock is all inidually sourced. Always keep your eye out wherever you go, and be willing to do repairs.” Horrillo takes an empty suitcase when she goes on holiday, as she says she never knows where she might find a gem. “The best advice I can give is to only buy things you love. Don’t be swayed by a designer label, or overthink it and buy something because you think it will sell – that never works.”6. It’s good to talk“Chatting to your customers is a great way to learn what people want,” says Barnes. “That’s your market, so it’s a great way to get instant feedback on what you’re doing. Do they want things in bigger sizes? Are they looking for better quality? Are they finding items too expensive? Take it all on board and adapt your strategy accordingly.”7. Get friendlyTeaming up with a friend who also loves vintage fashion can be a good way to split pitch costs and make selling more fun. “It’s also a good idea to make friends with fellow stall owners,” says Jean Thompson of Love Vintage, based in Leeds. “They can watch the stall for you when you’re having a break, and will often have loads of great advice if they’ve been doing it for years. There’s a really nice community of vintage traders and we all help each other out.”8. Presentation is key“Take the time to make sure your items are nicely presented, ironed, clean and clearly priced,” says Barnes. “Make sure all of a garment’s seams, buttons and fastenings are intact, too. People want to immediately incorporate an item into their wardrobe – they don’t want to take it home and spend time repairing it.”9. Get organised“Try to lay out your stock in an orderly way,” says Thompson. “That also makes it easier to keep track of your current inventory, and pull out similar pieces when they do sell.” Norton suggests thinking about how you’ll transport your stock and where you’ll put it when you’re not on the stall. “I had a year of keeping all my stock in my tiny flat, but now I use a storage facility,” she says. “It’s a hidden cost that I didn’t think about at the start, but for me it’s well worth it.”10. Accept the ups and downs“You can have long quiet periods, and that’s scary,” says Norton. “But you have to think on a monthly basis rather than having a bad day and then feeling despondent. If you do have an unsuccessful selling day, try to think about what you can learn from it – maybe it wasn’t the right location for you, for example. Ultimately, I’m doing something I enjoy and, for me, that’s much more rewarding than a regular paycheck.”To find out how iZettle can help your business, visit izettle"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0044f89cf068a9758fc4254f3aa347b2785088d/0_161_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=140bf11c8b2607e5777085bdc130a4d4","title":"hong kong china democracy europe taiwan beijing eu","story":"Hong Kong’s administration has backed down over the controversial extradition bill, but the canary in the coalmine of China’s tacit acceptance of democracy is already dead.Under China’s “one country, two systems” model, Hong Kong was given the guarantee that the freedoms of its citizens would be preserved and respected. Meanwhile, for a long time in the west, the consensus was that, as its economy grew, China would start to look more like Hong Kong. Regrettably, in recent years the opposite has happened and Hong Kong looks more like China by the year. Perhaps we were naive to believe that this erosion of Hong Kong’s democracy was not inevitable. Beijing makes no secret of its view that democracy and Chinese civilisation are incompatible. The protesters in the streets of Hong Kong would beg to differ, and I hope they succeed through peaceful means.For democracy activists in Hong Kong and beyond, there is a shining city on the hill: Taiwan. It is the one clear example of a Chinese liberal democratic project that has thrived in recent years. It should come as no surprise that it has faced intense pressure from Beijing.In the South China Sea, China is strengthening its military presence. Its violations of Taiwanese air and sea space have escalated to dangerous levels. Beijing’s hostility towards Taipei has intensified since 2016, when Taiwan elected a president who defends Taipei’s sovereignty. It has stepped up its aerial missions violating Taiwanese airspace, sailing warships near or in Taiwanese waters, with the most recent example in June when China’s aircraft carrier passed through the Taiwan Strait. Taipei is also seriously concerned about Chinese interference in Taiwan’s presidential election next January.To date, Europe has been erratic in its dealings with China. Several states have been eager to jump into bed with Beijing and auction off our democratic values for the promise of a boost in investment. They have turned a blind eye to Beijing’s human rights abuses at home and bellicosity in its neighbourhood. Meanwhile, other states see China’s continued authoritarian drift but shrink in the face of its global bullying.The European Union regularly argues that its foreign policy is based on values, not just short-term interests. If this is the case, we should stand up for these values and defend the largest Chinese democracy from authoritarian pressure. The United States is leading by example, including the recent decision to sell military equipment worth more than $2bn to Taipei.In Europe, however, China bullies capitals into accepting its warped viewpoint that Taiwan is just a rebel province. It forces us to deny Taiwan’s access to international forums and feigns outrage if any European politicians meet democratically elected representatives of the Taiwanese people – a country with a population almost equal to that of Australia.The new EU leadership should change this approach, and make a stand for democratic self-determination. It should start by meeting Taiwan’s leaders, and moving forward with an investment partnership and it should no longer be silent when China takes an aggressive posture. Until we do, the EU’s claims to be basing foreign policy on values is a statement that rings hollow.Our defence of democracy abroad matters for our security at home. Europe’s current debates around China relate to potential security threats – from questions about Huawei and its role in building 5G, through to Chinese one-way investment in Europe’s strategic crown jewels. We want China to offer opportunity and be a partner, but its nationalistic shift gives us cause to worry about its real motives, underpinned by a totally different set of values.This is why Europe’s stand for our values matters. It is not some abstract discussion about what happens halfway around the world, but the maintenance of a rules-based global order which has kept relative peace, spread prosperity and built free societies.The people of Hong Kong want more democracy. They will have to win it for themselves. But Europe cannot continue turning the other cheek for the sake of stability and Chinese cash, while people seek the rights that we insist on for ourselves. Yes, China is rich and powerful, but it will only rewrite the world’s rulebook if we allow it to – starting by dismantling democracy on its own doorstep.We should stand up for Taiwan’s self-determination and treat it as a fully-fledged member of the alliance of democracies. In a globally interdependent world, failure to defend our values in east Asia and beyond will eventually lead to the erosion of those same values at home.• Anders Fogh Rasmussen was Nato secretary general from 2009-2014 and prime minister of Denmark from 2001-2009."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09ea79a2717b5b0ca89772bfab143b78f1663d46/0_392_2686_1611/master/2686.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f11d9a4960dac253c24ffc727f11fce","title":"liam fox children global trade brexiters facts brexit","story":"International trade secretary Liam Fox has shown us what happens when one of the leaders of the revolution spends three subsequent years looking at paperwork. The fantasy lives – just – but must now inhabit a lever-arch file outlining everything the UK still doesn’t understand about global trade.In recent weeks, dyed-in-the-wool Brexiter Fox has warned against no deal, explained why Boris Johnson cannot use Gatt article 24 to unilaterally implement a deal with the EU, and pointed out that we cannot negotiate a new package with the US before Brexit has taken place. The reason for his newfound pragmatism was perhaps revealed by Monday’s announcement that the government is seeking to train 12 new professional trade negotiators, and Fox’s declaration that trade should be taught on the national curriculum. So there we have it: the government has discovered that trade depends on rules, and almost nobody in Britain knows what they are.The UK’s ongoing lack of preparedness for Brexit is not news. The revelation that we are only now training new negotiators merely highlights the slapdash incompetence the government has been showcasing since the Brexit vote. But the demand for better trade education was revealing, because it illuminates one of the key problems with Brexit: it depends not on dreams but facts.What, then, should we add to this new curriculum? The first lesson is that trade is not about taking back control. Indeed, the opposite is true. Unless you wish to force your goods and services on others, modern trade arrangements revolve around common laws and conventions. That champion of free-trade Brexiters, the World Trade Organization, is (unlike the EU) an unelected body that sets the basic rules of everyday commerce. Countries must, for example, set limits on tariffs and share quotas. Because discrimination is forbidden, the UK will have to apply its tariffs to all countries equally. These rules may be described as pooling sovereignty. Certainly, countries are free to organise trade deals in which they can eliminate tariffs altogether. These also require a legal agreement to prevent one country flouting shared rules or acting uncompetitively or unfairly, and this also limits sovereignty. If one member later “reasserts” it, by pulling out of the agreement, it must face negative economic consequences.The third lesson is that trade is about power, but the power you have now, not the one you remember. The EU as a bloc negotiates successful trade deals because it has the clout of more than 500 million consumers behind it and can afford to walk away from a deal rather than make overly painful compromises. Within the EU, power and resources also matter. Germany exports more to India, South Africa and Australia than we do, despite our Commonwealth and language ties, because it is larger, richer and produces more things that people want to buy – not because it imagines itself to be great or focuses on a mythologised history.The fourth lesson is that trade is about reciprocity, and listening to the concerns of your partners. If you show a willingness to compromise on things you want, engage in good faith and allow others to assert their interests, you may be able to agree deals more quickly. If, however, you simply arrive with a checklist (a single market in goods, for instance) without taking into account the other partner’s wishes (upholding the basic principles of the EU and the Good Friday agreement, say), you may get stuck.Perhaps the most important lesson about trade is that there is more to life than trade. The UK’s most basic error was to assume that its status and statistics would speak for themselves. But in the end it didn’t matter that Britain was an important country, or that the EU had a trade surplus it wanted to preserve: Brussels still wasn’t going to give us the benefits of EU membership without any of its obligations. The fabled German car manufacturers didn’t, in the end, bail us out, because the EU is about more than mercantilism, commerce or a balance sheet. It is about the political cohesion of a group of nations which depends on shared rules, solidarity and trust. The British government thought it could trump the EU’s laws and values with the promise of 65 million customers, and it was wrong.Fox’s idea about education illuminates the truth: the Brexiters were never interested in trade, but the idea of trade. Our future will not depend on the imagination, but on the cold, unforgiving realities of power, leverage and skill. It is right that schoolchildren should learn about it – so should our next prime minister. We may ultimately conclude that if our politicians had paid more attention to trade in the years before the referendum, we would never have conceived of Brexit in the first place.• Jonathan Lis is deputy director of the thinktank British Influence"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a27f6350f5d9f8fbb59a8b56f6992e2f74032c5/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ccd65de943cdac89232635c1848eb6c","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of round","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘round’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘round’.Share your photos of what round means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 17 July at 10am.

Rather “it was a cumulative response to the museum’s immovability on issues of critical concern to the people who should be its core constituency: the young and the less privileged”.The issues include sponsorship, worker relations and her belief that the museum “hardly speaks” in the debate over repatriation.In a blogpost for the London Review of Books, Soueif accused the museum of collaborating “with those who are unmaking the world before our eyes”.The museum’s chair of trustees, Richard Lambert, said the resignation “of a valued and very supportive trustee for seven years” was a “sad moment” and “unexpected”.He defended the museum’s acceptance of BP sponsorship – a deal which runs until 2023 – and said it had been discussed and endorsed at the board’s most recent meeting, about two weeks ago.“BP has made it possible for us to put on exhibitions which 4 million people have seen … We couldn’t have done without that support.”Lambert, speaking personally, said BP was a major British employer which paid taxes and was committed to the Paris climate agreement. It had “provided us with strong support and we are grateful for that.”The museum, along with the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Portrait Gallery, are the regular targets of protests against oil company sponsorship of the arts. The actor Mark Rylance last month said he was resigning as an associate artist at the RSC because of it.The other big and hotly debated issue for the museum is about the repatriation of looted cultural objects. Lambert said the museum was “playing a very important part in the debate” and pointed to visits by its director, Hartwig Fischer, to Benin City, Ghana and Sudan as well as regular engagement with museum directors in Berlin and Paris.A high priority, he said, was helping other countries build knowledge and physical infrastructure where objects could go.Soueif, whose books include the Man Booker shortlisted The Map of Love, also criticised the museum for not rehiring cleaners employed by Carillion after the company went into liquidation in 2018.A new trustee to replace Soueif will be chosen from open application by a three person panel, including Lambert. The choice must then be endorsed by the prime minister.Lambert denied he wanted board members who sang from the same hymn sheet. “Let me tell you, as the luckless chairman, trustees like to express their views forcefully.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9c6a93e0c869839ebb614fa988ff381a24b21da/0_38_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=904c2dcdf39cd92e16658c072a95a8eb","title":"state school kids rose top universities vice chancellors","story":"Steve Smith’s parents were devastated to be told at school parents’ evening that the best their working‑class son could hope for was a job sweeping floors in the local shoe factory. He is now vice-chancellor of the University of Exeter, part of the elite Russell Group.Nick Petford left school at 16 and worked in a tool-packing factory before training to install air-conditioning. He is now vice-chancellor of the University of Northampton.The study demonstrates that higher education – alongside football – is one of the few British professions in which working-class people have been able to reach the top. Smith’s theory is that this is because studying at university is much more of a “leveller” than any other process you go through the point from which your outcome is no longer determined by your background. And, crucially, he says those who stay on to do research are judged on how good their intellectual work is – in his case, in international relations.“My first articles weren’t rejected because I was Steve Smith, born in a house with an outside loo – they were blind to my origins,” he says. “And when I became president of the world academic body in my field, it wasn’t because of my class, it was all about my academic record.”Nonetheless, given that no one in his family had gone on to higher education before, Smith says he wouldn’t have made it to the University of Southampton if someone hadn’t spotted his potential.His dad came home in tears from that parents’ evening at Norwich City comprehensive school in 1969, because his teacher thought boys like him shouldn’t have ideas above their station. But a second teacher, Mr Shearing, later told Smith that if he stopped mucking around in class he could really go somewhere. “Christ, that made all the difference,” he says. “Someone, somewhere, has to put faith in you to go forward.”Petford says his life would have taken a very different path if he hadn’t made it to university. A member of Southampton’s first punk band in his teens, he left his comprehensive school at 16 with a handful of CSEs. He got a factory job, because that was what all his mates were doing. Petford doesn’t remember either his school or his parents ever mentioning university to him.“I was unemployed and on the dole when I saw a poster for a university access course at the age of 23. Seven years later I was a Cambridge don. I guess that’s social mobility in action,” he says. He did his access course at Southwark College and went to Goldsmiths.Petford is now a top volcanologist, and, like Smith, argues that vice-chancellors are different from leaders in other professions because they typically have to have a proven academic record that is based on peer review. “Esteem in this sense can be a great leveller, allowing you to build a career based on what you’ve done, not where you come from.”But he warns that snobbery can still triumph in universities if the appointment board is not open-minded. “If a university’s board of governors is dominated by alumni from Oxbridge colleges and is intent on hiring a vice-chancellor from the Russell Group, because that’s where they assume managerial quality resides, then ersity becomes restricted.”Paul O’Prey, who has recently retired after running the University of Roehampton for 15 years, won a place at Oxford to study English, despite his council house burning down when he was in the sixth form.O’Prey is concerned for the future, however. He worries that lack of funding for PhDs is making it harder for people from poorer backgrounds to get a foot on the academic career ladder. “There was greater access to grants when I was young, so entry was more possible regardless of background,” he says. “A lot of PhD students have to support themselves now and there is a risk it could become a middle-class profession.”Peter Mathieson, the new head of the University of Edinburgh, did his PhD at Cambridge, but insists it wasn’t a leg-up. He grew up on a poor street in Penzance, Cornwall, and went to an underperforming state school. When Mathieson told his teachers he wanted to study medicine, they said he “would only be disappointed” if he tried. It was “like a red rag to a bull”, he recalls, and at 15 he made an appointment to see his family doctor alone, to ask for advice on where to study.“The key step for me was getting to university, which I did partly through sheer bloody-mindedness.”Mathieson has recently caused controversy by publishing contextual requirements for all courses at Edinburgh, showing explicitly that those from less-privileged backgrounds can get in with lower grades than their fee-paying counterparts. “It arouses strong feelings, as inevitably some well-qualified students won’t get in,” he says. “But I don’t believe we are lowering standards: we are levelling the playing field.”Anne Carlisle, vice-chancellor of Falmouth University, grew up on a farm with seven siblings outside Belfast, in an area where no one went to university.She admits that rising through the ranks in academia, she has encountered snobbery based on both her gender and the fact that she studied fine art. But she argues that the top jobs in higher education are opening up more as people see that university chiefs are basically running a company – and the key thing is demonstrating you have the skills to do that.“At some universities researchers think they are a breed apart and they very much operate on networks. There are a few of that type running universities still – but they are in the minority.

It said the UK’s food and farming system must be radically transformed and become sustainable within 10 years.The commission’s report, which was welcomed by the environment secretary, Michael Gove, concluded that farmers must be enabled to shift from intensive farming to more organic and wildlife friendly production, raising livestock on grass and growing more nuts and pulses. It also said a National Nature Service should be created to give opportunities for young people to work in the countryside and, for example, tackle the climate crisis by planting trees or restoring peatlands.“Time is now running out. The actions that we take in the next 10 years are critical: to recover and regenerate nature and to restore health and wellbeing to both people and planet,” said the commission, which was convened by the RSA, a group focused on pressing social challenges.The commission said most farmers thought they could make big changes in five to 10 years if they got the right backing.“Farmers are extraordinarily adaptable,” said Sue Pritchard, director of the RSA commission and an organic farmer in Wales. “We have to live with change every single day of our lives.“We are really keen that farmers feel they are in the driving seat and that they can be a force of change. At the moment, a lot of farmers feel beleaguered and that they have become the bad guys. But without sustainable, secure and safe farming in the UK, we will not survive.”The commission criticised decades of government policy aimed at making food cheaper, fuelling rising obesity and other health problems. “The true cost of that is simply passed off elsewhere in society – in a degraded environment, spiralling ill health and impoverished high streets,” said the report.Pritchard said the UK had the third cheapest basket of food in the developed world, but also had the highest food poverty in Europe in terms of people being able to afford a healthy diet. Type 2 diabetes, a diet-related illness, costs the UK £27bn a year, she said.To solve these crises, the commission said “agroecology” practices must be supported – such as organic farming and agroforestry, where trees are combined with crops and livestock such as pigs or egg-laying hens.The so-called planetary health diet calls for more nuts and pulses in diets and Pritchard said these and more vegetables could be grown in the UK. Hazelnuts and walnuts are native to the UK, she pointed out, and some farmers are now starting to grow crops like lentils and quinoa, as well as beans and peas.The commission said the government must develop a plan to put the countryside and the communities living there at the centre of the green economy.Gove said: “This report raises issues that are hugely important. We know that it is in the interests of farmers and landowners to move to a more sustainable model.” He added that the government’s agriculture bill would reward farmers with public money for public goods and a new “farm to fork” food review would look to ensure everyone had access to healthy British food.The report was backed by Labour and the Liberal Democrats. The Green MP Caroline Lucas said: “This monumental report is a powerful and profound account of the ecological transformation of our food and farming system that we urgently need – and where we can start.”The commission said a new non-profit bank should be set up to provide finance to farmers investing in new practices.With Brexit uncertainty worrying farmers, the commission urged minister to stop delays on policy and trade decisions and commit to a future-proof ambition by January 2020. It also said schools, hospitals and prisons should buy more sustainably produced British food.Prof Joanna Price, the vice-chancellor of the Royal Agricultural University, said: “The report paints an honest picture of the challenges and sets out some bold ideas to address them. We strongly agree that farming can be a force for positive change and that rural communities can thrive as a powerhouse for a green economy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14707c7a7426523843280cf5dc1f918c062c8dfa/0_498_1333_799/master/1333.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1fcb3b9a055e1ab97ddfc7cbdd7f8320","title":"lets go meet the artist helping to make the flintstones high fashion","story":"For his SS20 collection, emerging London menswear designer Liam Hodges called upon the talents of artist Alfie Kungu to help him capture the primitive futurism of his menswear designsFrom the menswear designer who brought us prints of Mr Blobby and a British interpretation of Las Vegas Americana came a much lauded take on The Flintstones at London fashion week men’s last month. It was the latest chapter in London-based designer Liam Hodge’s phenomenal success tale that has seen him work his way up the ranks for the last six years to become a key player on the LFWM schedule. Yet the takeaway print this time was born out of a collaboration with a fellow creative.The brains behind the artwork was British artist Alfie Kungu, a rising star in his own right since he graduated with a degree in Fine Art at the UWE Bristol in 2016, later becoming part of Saatchi’s Best of the Year collection in 2017.The pair first crossed paths when Kungu modelled for Hodges’ SS19 runway show last June. After expressing adoration for one another’s creations via Instagram, they linked up at the artist’s studio to discuss what a potential collaboration might look like.After the first few paintings were complete, Hodges was enthusiastic about the work and together they went back and forth presenting new ideas and looking for fresh sources of inspiration. The peak of their creative process was when Kungu introduced the designer to David Cronenberg’s 1990s sci-fi horror, eXistenZ. Both realised it perfectly summed up what they wanted to convey in the collection. “It was from here that we started building together the idea of clashing techno references and graphics with primitive, free-spirited and fun graphics,” says Kungu.Despite initially thinking that the extent of the collaboration would be just a T-shirt graphic, Kungu’s work was also used across embroidered motifs, jacquard knitted pieces, printed and tie-dyed cotton, as well as the inidually hand-painted denim pieces. “It was crazy good,” the painter says of the moment he first saw the finished samples. “We really trusted each others’ skill set and admired each others’ abilities. I knew what Liam can do and I was inspired to match that.”Growing up in the small West Yorkshire market town of Hebden Bridge, art was always at the centre of Kungu’s upbringing. Despite deciding to study dance instead of art at GCSE level, he decided to enrol at Leeds College of Art, where it didn’t take long for him to find his own unique style. “I’d describe my work as being unpretentious and always having a positive feeling. It expresses the little things that I have picked up along the way through films or adverts on the street. Every time I paint, I feel like the next one is going to be better so that motivates me to keep doing it.”Prior to working with Hodges, Kungu shared an exhibition in Paris with the Belgian 3D artist Frédéric Platéus and secured a residency at London’s House of Vans. His large-scale cartoonish and childlike visuals are also cropping up across the capital, most recently via his solo show Fast Luck at The Bomb Factory Art Foundation in London’s Archway.However, Kungu wants to ensure his work is not just London-centric. “I am doing a residency in Leeds with East Streets Art.” Split across a five-floor building and running until the end of the year, Kungu will team up with his old college friend and multimedia artist Jake Krushell. “It’s important to go back to Yorkshire, give it the limelight and make sure things are happening up there.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ff85c1697d49a38811677a4a8b351f6d1bb925f/1397_23_1437_862/master/1437.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c1dceec99eec30fa0dffe5d5bfebdaf","title":"lashana lynch new 007 james bond daniel craig","story":"Daniel Craig retains title role but 25th instalment in the franchise reveals codename has been reassigned to British actor Lashana LynchWhile Daniel Craig is set to reprise his role as James Bond in the next film, the franchise is set for a shake-up, with reports claiming that black British actor Lashana Lynch has been cast as 007 – taking over Bond’s secret agent number after his character leaves MI6.The Mail has quoted from an anonymous “movie insider”, who says that the 25th film opens with Bond (Craig), retired in Jamaica, being called back to action to fight a new villain.“There is a pivotal scene at the start of the film where M says, “Come in 007”, and in walks Lashana who is black, beautiful and a woman,” the source said. “It’s a popcorn-dropping moment. Bond is still Bond but he’s been replaced as 007.”Originally from West London, Lynch, 31, made her film debut in 2011’s Fast Girls, but her breakthrough role came earlier this year, as fighter pilot Maria Rambeau in Captain Marvel.The news of her being given Bond’s famous code name has been widely praised on social media, coming weeks after US singer Halle Bailey was cast as Ariel in Disney’s live action remake of the Little Mermaid.The 25th Bond film – which is being shot in Italy and the UK – has been plagued by difficulties, beginning in October 2015 when Craig said he would “rather slash my wrists” than play Bond again.Despite once saying he would rather take his own life than reprise his role as 007, Daniel Craig confirms he will return as James Bond for the franchise\u0027s 25th movie.Danny Boyle confirms he is working on a script for the next Bond film alongside his Trainspotting collaborator John Hodge.EON Productions’ Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, the custodians of the Bond movies, confirm production will begin at the start of December 2018, with the film released in the UK on 25 October 2019 and in the US a fortnight later.Boyle quits the movie over \u0027creative differences\u0027.

Slice cautiously, making sure not to cut right through to the board. Though sliced, the courgettes should remain intact. Some find it easiest to place a chopstick either side of the courgette as you slice down, the wood preventing the knife cutting all the way through.You can use any crumbly cheese for this, changing the herbs as you think fit. Oregano with halloumi for instance, or goat’s cheese and rosemary. If going for the former, grill the halloumi first, singeing its edges and tossing with a little crumbled chilli.

It was the first ever fluorescent outfield shirt (according to Umbro, at least) and kicked off a trend that has never really gone away (no surprise given it was said at the time that it was the best selling shirt, other than England kits, that Umbro had ever produced). But more importantly, to me at least, it was a) the first away shirt I ever owned and b) the shirt Sheffield United wore as they stormed to promotion to the old First Division in 1990, which was achieved via a 5-2 win against Leicester City at Filbert Street on the final day of that season. They also wore it the following season, their first campaign in the top flight since the mid-70s. A truly iconic shirt among Blades. JAYour first World Cup never really leaves you, especially when you have an increasingly tight-fitting reminder at the back of your wardrobe. I wasn’t exactly the fashionista of Borden Grammar School – my photo albums of those years should have ‘proceed with caution’ on the cover – but I do think this Italy shirt stands the test of time. It has an elegant simplicity that would work in any era and was the antidote to the wacky kits that were becoming the norm. There are three things I really love about it – the circular badge the sheen (for reasons I don’t quite understand) and the smell, which is the closest I’ll get to time travel. RSPicture a player in a 1990s Fiorentina kit and chances are it’ll be Gabriel Batistuta. Batigol bagged 16 goals in 1992-93, sporting either the snazzy home shirt or the infamous away kit. On the home shirt at least, Lotto’s design choices only added to an iconic sense of swagger. The giant badge, bold print pattern (three shades of purple!), fussy collar and incongruous fizzy-pop logo ought to be too much – but just look at it in action. Batistuta, Francesco Baiano and Brian Laudrup helped themselves to goals in this strip, winning my support as a kid watching on a fuzzy portable TV. So imagine my despair when, despite scoring more than third-placed Parma, La Viola went down. This outrageously good shirt deserved better. NMcThe anticipation of a new away kit is always far more exciting than waiting for the home version, which will forever be the same colour unless your club’s owner is a megalomaniac. Clubs were just starting to experiment with new colours at the start of the Premier League era and Manchester City’s was the first time a club had worn purple in the top flight, meaning it drew the eye – aided by white pinstripes and sponsors, Brother, being emblazoned in yellow on the front. Sadly the kit was rarely worn as it was unwearable at Chelsea and Everton due to a clash of colours, but that only added to its mystique and made travelling to Queens Park Rangers, as City did for a fourth-round FA Cup tie in 1993, a more exciting prospect. WUI was eight when the letter arrived, stating Arsenal needed my services as a mascot for the game away to Newcastle in February 1999. Cue wild celebrations in the Searles household. The kit also arrived in the post and just trying it on was incredible. Then came the day itself, as did tears prior to stepping into the dressing room, where Tony Adams and Lee Dixon took the time to calm me down (Patrick Vieira, less so). Adams and I eventually strolled on to the pitch and took it in turns to shake hands with Alan Shearer, and there and then my love for Arsenal, and that kit in particular, was locked. Two decades on, I’m happy to report the socks still fit. GSThe Rossoneri have had more aesthetically pleasing shirts, namely the ones they wore during their era of dominance in the late 1980s and early 1990s, but this was still a beauty and one I have an affinity with given it was what I spent my birthday money on after turning 18 in March 1999. It’s all there – the classic red and black stripes, the classic badge, Opel across the front and material so thick and luxurious you could sleep in it forever. Pure Adidas gold. Paolo Maldini, Leonardo, Oliver Bierhoff and the rest of Alberto Zaccheroni’s squad, who went on to win the 1999 Serie A title, must have loved playing in this shirt. I certainly loved wearing it … up until I let my cousin borrow it and forgot to ever ask for it back.

We miss his refusing to look our way immensely. And his not wanting to be stroked there, there or there. But it wasn’t Dustin’s fault he was like this. Unknown trauma in kittenhood (he was left in a shoebox at the front door of a vet’s surgery) meant that he lived his entire 11 years in terror of being mauled to death by some unseen enemy. Understandably, this constant fear made Dustin very, very nervous.Through many years of care and affection, we almost managed to rescue him from this anxiety until – almost as if to prove a point – Dustin was mauled to death by two pet dogs off the lead. When we pulled his frozen body out of the freezer before his funeral, Dustin had a withering expression – “I told you so” it seemed to say. This was the only time we really got to stroke him properly. Frozen solid.I often find myself wondering whether Dustin loved us. The shamefully needy part of me wants reassurance that we made his 11 years as pleasurable as possible. But can we ever really understand what pets feel for us? After a year of this topic swirling around in my head, I thought I would share where I’ve got to.First, some definitions. There is something very British about the fact we have many, many words to describe types of falling moisture (mist, drizzle, hail, sleet, etc) and yet the most dramatic and powerful of emotions – motivating billions of humans to do extraordinary things for one another each day – is chucked into a single bucket labelled, rather blandly, “love”. One can’t help but feel that the ancient Greeks had it right, by pulling love apart into various strands. Storge (“store-gae”) is the love between family members, for instance eros is erotic love philia is something like the loyalty that friendship brings philautia is love for the self. And so, in this piece, I would like to break the concept of pet love into these neat and easily digestible Greek chunks.To storge, familial love. It won’t surprise you to learn that dogs, more than any other pet, exhibit oodles of this form of love for us. And, unlike most other pets, these attachments have been the subject of many scientific studies. The science confirms what we knew all along, that most dogs actively choose proximity to humans and, within a few months of being born, a puppy’s attraction is clearly toward people rather than other dogs. Dogs exhibit varying degrees of separation anxiety when their humans temporarily leave them. Blood pressure rates in dogs lower when they are being stroked by us. It is a form of storge that we share with one another. No question.Studies of brain chemicals add further weight to this relationship. In dogs and humans (in fact all mammals) the behaviours that bond iniduals are maintained through a cocktail of molecules that are absorbed in different ways by the brain. Many of these are regulated by brain hormones that include vasopressin and oxytocin, the (dramatically over-hyped) “love” molecule. In all mammals (including humans) production of this hormone spikes when iniduals are sexually aroused, while giving birth and while nursing offspring. It also rises when we see those that we love, particularly close family members. Interestingly, dogs respond with an oxytocin surge not only when interacting with one another, but also (unlike nearly all other mammals) when interacting with humans.A similar phenomenon occurs with cats. One small-scale study suggests that cats do receive an oxytocin boost upon being petted by their owners, so there may be love there, but it reflects one-fifth of the amount seen in dogs. If anything sums up cats, it’s this.But what of eros? Thankfully, most dogs or cats don’t view us in an erotic light. Even leg-humping isn’t likely to be a sex thing. The intentions of a horny dog may not necessarily be to inseminate their owner’s leg, but instead to manage unresolved tensions within the human-canine household. Some argue it could be about dominance others that it could be to let off steam. There is also a chance that, well, a bit of friendly leg-humping just feels really nice to a dog, but not necessarily in a knowing, sexual way. The behaviour is seen in male and female dogs, and, occasionally, in cats.Birds, however, are another story. Birds are far more likely to feel a warmth for their owners that you could term eros. A parrot that is tenderly stroked in the wrong places by its minder, for instance, will often misread friendship signals as foreplay and begin producing sex hormones. Should you wish not to sexually excite a parrot, try not to stroke down its back or on, or under, its wings. These are the areas that males and females preen in the early stages of their courtship in the wild. A stroke like this is like the kiss and a cuddle that readies them for sex. Upon discovering this fact, I realised I had more than once inadvertently sexed up a parrot.Ancient Greeks had no word for cupboard love, but, undoubtedly, this is a love the vast majority of animal pets may feel for us. The pet frog or snake that readies itself from its slumber when the humans appear with food. The fish that swarm to the top of a tank at feeding time. Even invertebrates such as stick insects and hissing cockroaches might approach something like this form of love. And you really could argue that it’s a kind of love – something close to philia, a loyalty or a dependable friendship, with the emphasis on food dependability. Sure, it’s not a love that inspires sonnets, but it’s something.A desperately depressed part of me wonders if Dustin loved only himself – that he exhibited philautia. That his each and every day was consumed with where best to hide, how best to be fed and how best to maintain the status quo of survival. This is the ultimate slap in the face for self-obsessed human carers like me, and so considering Dustin in this way naturally saddens me. But then I remember something wonderful. Rare moments of … something else.Every few months, when he thought we were fast asleep, a very different Dustin would show himself to us – but he would only emerge in the darkest of night. Dustin would sit on the end of the bed and he would watch me sleep. As I lay on my front, he would wait a few minutes before making a stealthy approach and he would begin to pummel his paws against my ribs. A deep purr would emanate from his broad body. This choking purr moved my bones as I held my eyes closed. Minute after minute, he would go on like this, purring and pummelling, and then he would change position. He would lie down and rest his chin in the cleft between my shoulder blades and stretch his paws over my shoulders as if cuddling me.I would lie there motionless, eager not to ruin these rare and magical moments, breathing in the rhythmic vibrations of his deep purrs. Sometimes, a long, sinuous blob of gelatinous pleasure-drool would roll down my neck. I didn’t care. I wore it as a badge of honour. But then it would end. After about 20 minutes, the spell would lift. Dustin would run out of the door, apparently disgusted with himself for exposing his emotion so wantonly. I don’t think the ancient Greeks had a word for a love like that. A love like that is hard to pin down, hard to put into words. You know it when it happens, that is as close as I can get to putting it into a sentence.And so, you loved like you lived, dearest Dustin. Cautiously. Yours was a careful love, but a real and vivid love, nonetheless – a love on a spectrum of incredible ways in which humans engage with other animals on planet Earth and, in fleeting moments or in lifelong infatuation, they engage back."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b573ae413101877df56421851378ea1d4fe37072/0_343_5148_3089/master/5148.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a06c06b65aeeadfff6221fb217ad4ff8","title":"luxury bottled water is absurd so why is it so popular","story":"People pay top dollar for ‘premium’ brands indistinguishable in blind taste tests from tap water – is it about status, wellness or something more fundamental?Last year, judges at the 28th International Berkeley Springs Water Tasting competition deemed the best bottled water in the world to be an Australian brand “infused with the sound frequencies of love, the moon, and light spectrums of the rainbow”.Called Frequency H2O and sold for A$3.30 a liter (US$2.30), the water is, according to its creator Sturt Hinton, an “ultimate elixir of life”. Also recognized by the judges was Svalbarði, a company that sells $90 bottles of water freshly squeezed from – wait for it – melting Norwegian glaciers.The extravagant taglines and price tag make luxury bottled water a sort of liquid climate change for the rich. Despite an abundance of logical reasons to avoid it, the bottled water industry has never been stronger. And “premium” bottled water, the extra-fancy sort touted for “health benefits” like alkalinity, is the fastest-growing sector of the US bottled water industry, itself valued at $18.5bn.Whether such elite products are pumped from 3,000 feet beneath Hawaii or extracted from Fijian springs and sprinkled with gold dust, most justify their inherent excess with a similar refrain: the more obscure the origin, or elaborate the preparation, the healthier, higher quality, and more delicious the water.This, of course, is happening in a context where water scarcity is an accelerating global crisis, predicted to affect two-thirds of the world’s population by 2025. And plastic pollution, to which discarded water bottles contribute immensely, has become an issue so dire experts anticipate that by 2050 the ocean will be filled with more plastic than fish.Also to consider: nothing about bottled water makes it inherently superior to tap. The majority of American tap water is safe, as is essentially all UK tap water, and more closely regulated for contaminants than bottled. In blind taste tests, subjects cannot distinguish between bottled and tap water. And tap water, of course, is nearly free.So why do we buy it? For one, access to rarified waters has been a status symbol for centuries (think the 19th-century leisure-class craze for vacationing in “spa towns” or the devotion of historic European royals to the supposedly salubrious effects of thermal springs).Then there’s the wellness movement, responsible for a collective spurning of alcohol and soda, and promoting a more fervent interest in “luxury” water than ever. Indeed, luxe “water bars” and even vibrational frequency-charged bottled water brands have been making a go of it since at least 2006. Yet the American mainstream has probably never been as receptive of pricey, esoteric health products as during the current late-capitalistic peak wellness moment.And then there might be another reason, according researchers at Ontario’s University of Waterloo. The reason why society is so devoted to bottled water, they say, may be our fear of death.In a recent social-psychological study on water consumption choices, researchers Stephanie Cote and Sarah Wolfe claim, “iniduals’ unacknowledged death anxiety may be an unrecognized barrier to environmentally sustainable behavior change”.“Death reminders reliably increase humans’ selfish exploitation of natural resources,” writes Wolfe in her related work explaining that when humans consider our impending demise, our instinctive denial and need for distraction leads us to make irrational decisions. Such as, perhaps unconsciously, thinking: “How could the planet be dying when I hold in my hand a bottle of such unfathomably pristine water? How could I be dying when I’m making such healthy decisions?”Cote and Wolfe argue that the way that bottled water is marketed – its associations with wellbeing – happen to make it a particularly appealing antidote for existential despair.Take, for instance, Evian’s slogan – “Evian, drink young” – and its advertising’s use of babies to convey youth, or Fiji Water’s claim to be “bottled at the source, untouched by man”, and lush, tropical island imagery. The bottled water industry works hard to make its products look and feel like the opposite of death.But we can change our habits. On a personal level, it’s wise to carry a reusable water bottle – a status symbol in its own right. In their research, Cotes and Wolfe conclude that government pro-tap water campaigns would be more effective by embracing positive messaging about how wellness-enhancing tap water is, rather than harsh truths reminding consumers that plastic equals death. Governments can also enact bans on single-use plastic products, as Canada and the EU have pledged to do.Beyond the sheer extravagance of “premium” water, the central dilemma is that these products ultimately run counter to their own supposed precept: health – of the planet and all its inhabitants. The future may be scary, but it’s high time we wean ourselves from the bottle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a8df0242258c97ca7d5e88e7d866f8e7cc0c7d0/0_0_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa91c0361cc3f6650f73e77f93b4a27e","title":"tangram smart rope why mess with the zen like emptiness of skipping","story":"After 15 seconds, my legs are aching and my stomach is complaining. Does this flashy update really improve a six-year-old’s toy?There exists no purer evocation of childhood than the skipping rope. A rope, two handles, hours of fun. Of course, adults have a way of taking the same ingredients and making them far less innocent. Which possibly explains the Tangram Smart Rope (£79.95, appleuk): an “LED-embedded jump rope that displays your fitness data in mid-air”. Why? Does anyone really need an electronic skipping rope that has its own app? Surely this is the definition of flashiness for the sake of it?I put on my special shorts and get swinging, to see if such monstrosity can be defended. There is a good chance it can. While totally unnecessary, the image of a virtual counter racking up rope turns in mid-air is striking. And, as we know, coolness is infuriatingly self-justifying.But it is important not to fall into a nostalgia trap – exalting our childhood games and the way we played them. Remember how Father would smuggle a piece of coal home? We would pretend it was a mighty horse, taking turns to ride its dusty back! Ahhhh. But, no. Nostalgia is merely sandpaper that rubs jagged memories smooth. Things aren’t necessarily better for belonging to our past.Jump ropes don’t belong to my past, in any case. When I was young, skipping was for six-year-old girls in school playgrounds and 26-year-old men in boxing clubs, and I couldn’t relate to either. Now absent of such hangups, I’m interested, but inexperienced. Perhaps the Tangram Smart Rope can show me the ropes, 2019-style.The model I am testing is certainly a semi-handsome thing. Brushed metal handles in cherry red are topped with low-friction bearings, allowing free rotation of the matte-black rubber cable. The look is thrillingly reminiscent of a child’s first nunchaku. I feel like a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle, albeit one who didn’t make the final cut. (Velázquez, the Pete Best of hero amphibians! Swinging his light-up rope with frictionless bearings!) None of this is bad. Trying to get into the groove, however, I’m frustrated.The central section of the rope is reinforced and inflexible, to protect the row of LEDs inside, and, as a result, it has a different density and feel. Moreover, the join between the cable and LED strip segments the rope, which impacts on the swinging of it. The thicker section is burdensome, and thuds when it slaps against the floor. It also increases resistance, making it hard to get a good rhythm going. Arguably, the heavier rope increases its fitness potential, requiring greater exertion to rotate. But it’s a drag, dude.The linked Tangram app is fine, and reliably counts the swings and also has a stab at estimating the number of calories burned. But the chief selling point of this model – the mid-air running counter – severely disappoints. The CGI on the box pictures a fitness model with a high number (2016 and rising) hovering before her at chest level, like the projection of a digital alarm clock.When I try it, the lights stay largely dark, erratically bursting into life for a few rotations before disappearing again. My pathetic figure (“0006”) is barely legible, like a fugitive firefly flashing on the ground, around my knees, above my head. It is strangely beautiful, this breathless grasping at phantasms. In fact, the rope could be a metaphor for life itself. But it would be more useful if it worked.This whole business of trying to spot and then interpret the flashes of light is unnecessarily stressful. It may sound odd to wish for exercise that was more relaxing, but the joy of skipping is a zen-like emptiness of repetition. When you are not in the zone, you are forced to remember that skipping is insanely, brutally hard work on the calves, glutes and lats. Maximum respect to six-year-old girls. After 15 seconds, my legs are aching, my stomach is complaining – and I have to skip to my loo, my darling.I try a few more times over several days and my stamina improves, but the LED functionality never does. An analogue rope wouldn’t let you down like this. Turns out this update on a classic is not flashy enough. Smart Rope thinks it’s too cool for school really it needs to work smarter, not harder.I eventually reached 0007, which is the closest I’ll get to Daniel Craig levels of fitness.I’d rather pay money for old rope. 15"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab91bd2558f894d2d4188fcd8cd1410bc4384f03/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c29a29a2ca771a650f53b83ed592de24","title":"stop and search is ineffective so why is it on the rise podcast","story":"The first stop and search Jamal ever experienced was when he was 11 years old.

Indeed, later in his career Turing wrote a seminal paper explaining how patterns such as spots and stripes can appear during chemical reactions.While the importance of Turing’s work and the foundations he laid have become increasingly apparent with time, so too have his personal struggles. These have been highlighted in a biography and a number of plays in the 1980s, as well as the 2014 film The Imitation Game, in which Turing was played by Benedict Cumberbatch.Born in London in 1912, Turing joined Sherborne school at 13. His reports suggest his abilities were mixed, but hint at his imagination and originality. “He must remember that Cambridge will want sound knowledge rather than vague ideas,” his physics teacher wrote.Turing joined King’s College, Cambridge, in 1931 and became a fellow there in 1935. What followed were a number of seminal ideas, including his vision of a universal computing machine, which can be fed an algorithm for a particular computation and then apply it. It was an idea that was to be pivotal in the development of the computers we use today.After a stint at Princeton University in America, Turing returned to the UK, where he worked in code-breaking. With the outbreak of war, he joined Bletchley Park.As a gay man in the early 1950s, at a time when homosexual acts were illegal, Turing faced a demeaning choice when a burglary at his home brought Turing’s relationship with a man to police attention.He was found guilty of gross indecency and had to decide between going to prison or undergoing chemical castration. He chose the latter, a horrifying treatment that involved hormonal injections.Turing died in June 1954, aged 41, at his home in Wilmslow, near Manchester, in an apparent suicide. On Christmas Eve in 2013, the Queen signed a posthumous pardon for him.Turing’s legacy lives on in the machines we take for granted every day, with his name also linked to burgeoning advances. The best known of these is the benchmark Turing test for whether a machine that can think like a human, which hinges on whether human judges can distinguish a computer’s text answers from those given by a person."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fec7b07a7575c33e2bc28cd1fb6d913695c4ad44/0_0_2419_1451/master/2419.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5c8ae63d3b252ce40203edec4d1474b","title":"cricket world cup 10 fans countries review action","story":"Readers from around the world reflect on seven weeks of cricket and one astounding finalEngland’s run to the semi-finals, and indeed final, could not have been more quintessentially English. The team came into the tournament on a great run and hope was lifted to even greater heights with a few high-quality performances, only to be met with a crash back to traditional English cynicism when we almost inevitably lost to two tournament underdogs. From this point on though, they were exceptional, rising to the challenge of what essentially became four consecutive knockout games.What else can be said about the final? It was the best game of cricket I’ve witnessed and quite possibly the best of all time. The match had it all and England finally proved that they can stand up in those pressure moments in a knockout tournament. They had no small degree of luck and there was plenty of tension, but how else would you want to win your first Cricket World Cup?Let’s hope this group stays together for one more World Cup under the cool head of Eoin Morgan and a coach who will further develop this exciting brand of cricket. It would be easy to see this as the pinnacle, but how incredible would it be to push for an Australia-esque World Cup dynasty? Matt LeechWe delivered the greatest of World Cup finals. No other countries would have produced such a game. New Zealand always get stuck into games and regularly deliver some of the greatest cricketing spectacles. It’s such a shame we remain financially uninteresting for cricketing schedulers. Winning the World Cup might have changed that, but we are worthy runners-up.Jimmy Neesham was my player of the tournament. He plays hard and fearless, keeps going and has a mental toughness and mature outlook on life. He will have plenty of big moments in his career. Malcolm EddingtonIndia were like a critically acclaimed television show. After power-packed leading performances from neo-noir legend Rohit Sharma and the experimental yet highly engaging directorship from Jasprit Bumrah, most expected that pair, along with a strong supporting cast, to help India execute a stunning finale. But, despite bringing in the biggest viewing figures, the show was cancelled at the last moment by the executives at the World Cup – the notorious Kiwis.MS Dhoni was a fan favourite, but his personal style did not suit the overall tone of the crew. Rishabh Pant, a cult hero on the local soap opera, Indian Premier League, wasn’t ready for the biggest stage just yet. Surely, by the time the next big show comes around, he will be in the spotlight. Scriptwriter Virat Kohli was excellent but still did not meet his lofty standards and fluffed the ending. Cameos from Sir Ravindra Jadeja grabbed bits and pieces of the public imagination and an unexpected starring role during India’s final moments justified calls for his regular introduction to the set-up in the future. Abhijato SensarmaDespite the horrible thrashing in the semi-final, we performed above expectations. Six months ago I didn’t think we’d make it to the last four in some respects we got through because other sides failed to deliver.Mitchell Starc was our best performer. It was a shame he went AWOL in the last two matches. Alex Carey looked a class above most in his ball-striking and attitude. He was a real find. To play a great knock after being cleaned up by Jofra Archer really showed he has what it takes. The performances of Glenn Maxwell and Marcus Stoinis were really disappointing. The one innings where Maxwell looked really like to kick into gear was the one where Usman Khawaja ran him out horribly.The semi-final revealed all our weaknesses at once, which was a shame. Unfortunately our domestic one-day competition is now contained in a short period at the start of our season. It’s not enough for players to improve their skills in this format on the biggest international stage. Scott MeehanPakistan did well. Our performance would be viewed much more positively had we reached the semi-finals, but that’s how fine the margins are. The game against West Indies was very costly and some fans think the Sri Lanka washout was a missed opportunity. Although we have no one to blame but ourselves for not reaching the last four.After beating both the finalists in the group stage, it’s a shame we weren’t consistent enough elsewhere. We have a few special players coming through and they will surely help. Although fielding remains a problem. Awais AhmedWe were hot favourites to finish in the bottom two, yet finished sixth and may have qualified for the semis had we won our two washed-out matches. We have a bright talent in Avishka Fernando. In fact, we could have a fearsome batting unit in 2023. The bowling will be the real concern. We have to search hard for the next Malingas and Muralis. Malinga still has a role to play in four years’ time. We need his personality and experience in the team. And our former cricketers need to take part in building cricket from scratch. The current administration is useless. Akesh SamudithaIt took us four games to get a point on the board and we had to thank the English summer weather for that. South Africa paid the price for a terribly slow start, and highlights were few and far between. The AB De Villiers debate before the tournament obviously didn’t help.I’m hugely disappointed that we were so poor early on. The late wins against Sri Lanka and and Australia, were spoiled by the fact that there was so very little to play for. Wasting a successful 300+ run chase against Australia in a dead rubber hurts. Nils LouwAfter a great start to the tournament – beating South Africa and almost forcing a win against the Kiwis – the Tigers threatened to be the story of the World Cup, but it never quite happened. Instead the campaign ended in a whimper with damaging losses against both south Asian neighbours. The defeat to Pakistan was particularly disappointing given the historical context and the fact they were playing in front of a packed house at Lord’s. It was easily their worst performance of the tournament.In contrast, the stunning run chase against the Windies on the postage stamp-sized Taunton ground was the tournament highlight, reaching the target of 322 with such ease and with so many overs to spare. It gave fans genuine hope for a top-four finish. Had fine margins gone their way, a semi-final place would have been a reality.The team didn’t quite live up to its billing for the emotional Tiger fans. A feeling of the wheels coming off was compounded by the swift dismissal of coach Steve Rhodes long before England lifted the trophy.Giving player of the tournament to Kane Williamson was obviously a sympathy vote. Shakib Al Hasan was the true star of the World Cup. After spending a decade being the most underrated international cricketer in the most underrated international team, Shakib finally became a household name – for those households with Sky TV anyway. His consistency batting at No 3, often arriving at the crease early in the innings, and scoring at nearly a run a ball was staggering. Add to that tidy reliable off-spin and you have the complete package. Tawhid QureshiWe were terrible for most of it. Bowling Pakistan out for 105 in the first game got our hopes up, but there wasn’t enough thought into anything after that and we played out the tournament as a Chris Gayle testimonial tour. At least we beat a plucky Afghanistan side.The authorities must begin planning for the next World Cup immediately by investing in players who will be available solely for the longer version of the game. We have become champions of the T20 game, but the same players struggle in longer formats. T20 is hurting the quality of players in the longer versions. The problem remains that we have a very small pool of players. Glen DucreayIt was always going to be tough. Always. I’m disappointed we didn’t take any points but there were some competitive performances. Falling 11 runs short of beating India, and two balls from shocking Pakistan, were the best memories.Captain Mohammad Nabi had plenty to say before the tournament, but his inexperience showed in the field. I’ll be happy if we can progress tactically and learn from the experience of playing against the very best.

However, he added that sharing the trophy when teams cannot be separated should be considered.England beat New Zealand on boundaries scored after a tied super over, but the former Australian umpire Simon Taufel suggested the umpires had incorrectly awarded an extra overthrow run to Ben Stokes in the 50th over when the ball deflected off his bat and sped to the boundary.While Taufel said it was an “error of judgment” by the umpires, he added that it was “unfair” to say the extra run had decided the outcome.Stead was also sympathetic with the officials and said he had accepted his team’s heartbreaking defeat at Lord’s. “At the end of the day the umpires are there to rule and they’re human as well and, like players, sometimes errors are made,” he told New Zealand media. “That’s just the human aspect of sport and probably why we care so much as well.”Stead said he expected the International Cricket Council to review the way future finals were decided but added there was nothing New Zealand could do now.“I’m sure there’s going to be many things they will look at over the whole tournament,” he said. I’m sure when they’re writing the rules they never expect the World Cup final to happen like that so I’m sure it’ll be reviewed, absolutely.“It’s a very, very hollow feeling that you can play 100 overs and score the same amount of runs and still lose the game. But that’s the technicalities of sport sometimes.”On sharing the trophy, he added: “Perhaps when you play over a seven-week period and you can’t be separated on the final day then that is something that should be considered.”The manner of England’s win has sparked fierce debate around the world and some level of angst in New Zealand. The extra run aside, the former New Zealand coach Mike Hesson was unhappy that the super over was used as a tiebreaker, followed by total boundaries scored.“Using a super over to decide it was farcical and the International Cricket Council needs to give itself an uppercut for even entertaining it as a tiebreaker,” he wrote in a column for Fairfax media."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/660413c31df043477daad1a67c0969ae70228a21/0_299_4490_2694/master/4490.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=098eaae55539d2a6ba69bfc5214e7de5","title":"talking horses it seems astonishing that arc weekend runs at a loss","story":"The size of the loss has not been revealed, but Arc weekend was in the red in 2018, despite an eye-watering admission price hikeFrench racing’s senior executives are clearly hard at work before October’s Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe and briefed reporters at Longchamp for Sunday’s Grand Prix de Paris on their plans to avoid a repeat of the PR disaster when the track hosted its first Arc since 2015 last autumn. But while they were doing their best to woo the British and Irish fans who were bitterly disappointed by their experience in 2018, they also revealed what seems to be – to me, at least – an astonishing fact about the showpiece event of European racing. Arc weekend, which includes the only day of the entire season when Longchamp is full to the rafters, runs at a loss.You read that correctly. A loss. If Edward Gillespie, the man who turned the Cheltenham Festival into one of sport’s biggest events, happens to be reading this piece, his eyebrows have just hit the ceiling.“It’s the biggest event that we organise,” Olivier Delloye, the chief executive of France Galop, said, “and it should be profitable and should generate the margins that we struggle to have on normal days when the attendance is too low. But because of the huge cost of all the temporary facilities that we have to implement, and traditionally the pricing was always a little bit too low, we are trying to break even on this event but it’s not so easy.” Delloye did not reveal the size of the loss, but did confirm that Arc weekend was in the red in 2018, despite an eye-watering hike in the price of admission to €75 (£68), from €20 (£17) for the last Arc at the old Longchamp and €30 (£26) when it sojourned in Chantilly in 2016 and 2017. A price cut to €65 (£57) for the main enclosure and €20 (£18) in the “Jardin de l’Arc” enclosure is part of the package to persuade last year’s disillusioned racegoers to give the new Longchamp a second chance. It is a welcome gesture, but only a gesture all the same, as €10 is unlikely to make much difference to anyone when they are weighing up the cost of travel, accommodation and enjoying one of the world’s most beautiful cities as it deserves to be enjoyed. It also leaves Delloye in an even deeper hole as he tries to get the weekend somewhere close to break-even point, never mind into the black.But the mere fact that the grandest occasion in European racing has been allowed to run at a loss for so many years also hints at the complacency that can result when money simply falls into your lap. British racing’s funding model has its flaws, as everyone knows, but it does at least enjoy a variety of income streams, one of which is the money generated by shifting nearly 6m tickets every year and the revenue from food, drinks, hospitality, betting and so on that goes with it. French racing has lots of money from its PMU monopoly but none of the emotional capital that comes from the shared experience of a big day at the races. As a result, it is highly vulnerable to any decline in betting turnover, either because punters lose interest in racing or through competition from other forms of gambling. France is one of the great European racing nations and the home of the continent’s most glamorous Flat race, so we should all wish it well. But if Arc weekend has been running at a loss for all these years, it suggests that French racing’s problems date back a good deal further, and run a lot deeper.Firm – or firmish – ground means field sizes are a little thin at Bath and Beverley and there has been a steady stream of non-runners at both tracks in the morning already. The loss of two opponents from the 10 originally declared for the seven-furlong handicap at the Yorkshire track could be good news for Ollivander (3.45), though, as he attempts to add to his course-and-distance win last month. David O’Meara’s gelding likes to race up with the pace and is drawn in the outside stall, which will make life difficult for Danny Tudhope as the field head towards Beverley’s sharp right-handed turns. The absence of Make On Madam in particular, though, will ease his task as he attempts to get into position and in every other respect, Ollivander looks like a solid bet at around 100-30. Three fancied runners have come out of the stayers’ handicap earlier on the card leaving Rochester House (2.45) as the obvious winner but at a very thin price. Golden Guest (3.15) and How Bizarre (4.15) should both start at more backable prices, however, while Tinto (4.00) and Arctic Nel (7.40) make most appeal on the cards at Bath and Nottingham, respectively."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b9c325bca391dabf883dc499de85b76c8fb7b2e/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db761387a702f179ac06bc367f1dc78f","title":"cricket world cup special highs lows and an otherworldly final","story":"We celebrate the moments that made the 2019 tournament, from Cottrell’s salute to New Zealand’s fielding and that dramaRoughly, life is a search for joy, and most of us plough through it experiencing nothing remotely comparable to the taking of a World Cup wicket. So when we watch others enjoy the moment, our sense of wonder encompasses not only cricketing skill but emotional fortitude: how do they not collapse in a heap of weeping, cringing emotion? Sheldon Cottrell’s work in this field is especially mind-blowing: snort in at speed knock over another patsy calmly salute the accomplishment. Happily, the rest of us can now incorporate it into our daily routines so, coming to a home near you: grown adults snapping to attention after successfully loading dishwashers, changing lightbulbs and wiping bottoms. Very good, sergeant.It feels fairly strange to cite the progenitors of our species as an innovation, but such has been the patriarchy until now. Finally, after 44 years, women joined the official commentary teams on the men’s World Cup and – amazingly! – it transpired that Mel Jones, Isa Guha, Ebony Rainford-Brent and Alison Mitchell grasp the impenetrable intricacies of the game they love, describing them with clarity and elan. Of course, this can never be as enlightening as tales of golf, wine, and who pays for dinner, but you can’t have everything.Once upon a time and not so long ago, the ability of professional athletes to run fast and jump high was little more than a nice thing to have. No longer. Throughout the tournament, Jonny Bairstow’s outfielding was astonishing, but when things got real the tingles and expletives came on account of the s’perb New Zealanders. In the semi-final, with things getting tenser, Martin Guptill’s phenomenal throw removed MS Dhoni then, in the final, with things getting tensest, Lockie Ferguson hurled 15 stone of fast bowler into the ground to catch Eoin Morgan, before Tim Southee did similar to remove Jos Buttler. It was as predictable as it was shocking.In all sports, it’s helpful to know the state of play, and even more helpful if, to access this valuable information, one does not require a PhD in applied mathematics. Because we are all extremely bored of the words “net run-rate”, suffice it to say that head-to-head is a more definitive calculation than one that requires an actual calculator. And, though England did their bit as hosts, sacrificing their security to sustain a flagging round-robin, the problems with the format and schedule remained evident: we need more teams, more knockouts and more momentum, which is to say that the brilliant climax should not obscure what can be improved. Oh, and boundaries scored is no way to settle a tie.It is generally held that inclement weather caused a succession of slow and sticky wickets, which is why teams batting first generally scored fewer than expected and teams batting second generally failed to chase them down. And these were indeed important factors – but to cite them as sole factors is to ignore the perennially influential brothers, SB Pressure and WC Pressure. England would back themselves to chase 233, 286 and 242 playing on cobbles India would have fancied 240 to make the World Cup final in their sleep. But they fell short, because also in the mix was responsibility, personality and immortality. Sport is simple, but people are complicated.It’s been a rough few years for the name Colin, falling out of favour along with other upstanding staples such as Gary and Brian. But in nominative determinism’s Colin de Grandhomme we have a worthy partisan. Throughout the competition his muscly medium bothered everyone, and he finished it with a lower economy rate than anyone, reminding us that, if you perform your skills with confidence, composure and love then they can be enough – however simple they may be.Human beings are fond of both laziness and notoriety, which is why nicknames are a thing. In the first instance they save effort and, over time, construct an alter ego allowing their subjects to feel special, powerful and changed. Andre Russell’s “Dre Russ” encapsulates this perfectly, its brash unfussiness part of a persona that must assault cricket balls in order to survive. But these forces cannot always be harnessed. When West Indies played Australia, Russell came in with Jason Holder ensconced at the other end and their team requiring a comfortably manageable 99 runs from 90 balls. So he promptly dre russed a four and a six from his first five balls, then missed with four huge dre russes, before dre russing another four and getting out, dre russed, for 15 off 11 balls. West Indies lost narrowly and went out of the World Cup early.When talking about cricket we waste a lot of time talking about nonsense such as batting, bowling and fielding, when really we should just be talking about Pakistan. They were as wondrous as ever during this World Cup, whether in abject collapse to West Indies or in dropping five catches while beating South Africa, and only they could defeat both finalists yet fail to reach the knockouts. Whether in victory or defeat, no other team channels the shining, flowing, spitting force of humanity with such alacrity represents their people so completely ravages hearts with base impunity. Within them resides everything that is brilliant about everything.The UK is a frightening place nowadays, with so much in the hands of so little. So the England and Wales one-day team are a lesson and a balm, radiating warmth, substance and zest thanks to a leader who reminds us what leaders are meant to be. Taking pride in the achievements of others can feel odd, but not here: England’s world champions represent the best of our collective body, a group of different ethnicities and personalities helping each other be the best that they can with a love that is moving to behold. If we cannot take pride in them, we cannot take pride in anything.Ben Stokes ing for home and the ball clipping his bat before racing to the fence was not simply an incredible cricketing coincidence, but as staggering an event we will ever see, a moment of pure, uncut drama that was particularly, peculiarly cricket, whole countries and communities united in its thrall. While Stokes apologised to Kane Williamson for the ridiculousness of his redemption narrative, our only clue as to what would happen next was whatever we imagined could not happen next. And sure enough, when England’s two batsmen came out for the super over, something celestial seemed to be at work: Benjamin and Joseph in fraternal partnership, brandishing their sacs for golden cup and greater good. And something celestial was indeed at work: sport itself, a transformative, transcendental explosion of all that we are and all that we are not, taking us outside of ourselves while forcing us to consider ourselves. So before we wonder how the hell we carry on from here, let’s remember this: though such moments are rare, they need not be fleeting, because they have something for every day of our lives and we must savour them for every day of our lives.

It could also be his biggest liability.Reflecting on the ethics of a billionaire candidate at a time when growing inequality is a key election issue, the former hedge fund manager and Democratic party mega-donor offered up an unusual defense: Queen Bey.“Should we put a limit on what Beyoncé makes? I don’t see why,” Steyer told the  by phone. “I don’t think in the United States of America, we should put a ceiling on how far people can go.”Steyer transitioned to a critique of communism and the argument that “at the heart of every great fortune is a crime”: “What Karl Marx failed to take into consideration was software – that if you are Michael Jackson or Rihanna or Beyoncé or anyone producing an idea, with software you aren’t just the best singer in your village … you have an ability to reproduce that song infinitely at very low cost around the world.”Steyer announced his surprise campaign last week, six months after he publicly declared he would not be running. The 62-year-old Californian is now tasked with distinguishing himself from the other white men with no widespread name recognition in the 2020 field, convincing voters that he has long been using his money for good – and that the best way for him to help save the planet is from the Oval Office.A longtime San Francisco resident and father of four, Steyer founded the hedge fund Farallon Capital Management in 1986 and left in 2012. Worth an estimated $1.6bn, he’s spent his money advocating for clean-air and clean energy laws, opposing corporate tax loopholes, taking on tobacco companies, registering youth voters and other liberal causes.Over the past year, he got attention traveling the country with his group Need to Impeach, which garnered more than 8 million supporters who want to oust Trump from office. The impeachment advocacy has earned him a Twitter insult from the president (“Wacky \u0026amp totally unhinged”) as well as shade from some fellow Democrats. Steyer’s other not-for-profit group, NextGen America, has spent millions rallying people around the climate crisis and registering voters.Steyer has pledged to spend $100m on his 2020 bid – more than the combined fundraising of the five highest-polling Democrats in the last three months. The billionaire almost immediately faced backlash and skepticism from progressive activists, some begging him to spend the money on something else, such as down-ballot races and voter registration.“Democrats are expressing frustration that he is going this route rather than putting $100m dollars into trying to flip the Senate,” said RL Miller, the chair of the California Democratic party’s environmental caucus, adding that her immediate reaction to Steyer 2020 was “eye-roll emoji”.“Part of it was watching that failure of government and just being so frustrated,” he said. “Literally, watching the debates and watching this campaign evolve, I thought, ‘Wow, I can’t sleep.’”On impeachment, he said, “We’ve won the argument but we haven’t won the fight.”Steyer’s bid has drawn comparisons to billionaire ex-Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, whose flirtation with a White House run was derided as a wasteful vanity project.Asked if anyone close to him had discouraged him from running, Steyer responded, “No.” After a pause, he said, “I’m not teasing!” He also said he knew that running wasn’t necessarily a “smart move”, adding, “I’m not trying to do a smart thing, I’m trying to do the right thing.”Asked why voters should support him instead of Warren, who shares his views but has actual elected experience, he said, “I’ve been doing this from the outside for ten years. She is a US senator in her second term.”On the complaints that his money could have greater impact elsewhere, Steyer’s answer was simple: he’s got a lot of money. “We’re going to do everything we otherwise would’ve done,” he said, explaining that he was continue to fund NextGen and his impeachment group.Entering so late in the race, Steyer already missed the first debates and is starting at a disadvantage. He may also struggle to convince voters that he would defeat the president – the question, polls show, that is most important to many Democrats, said Jessica Levinson, a Loyola law school professor. “That feels riskier when a person has no track record and is running as a business person who has made money in areas that I think go somewhat against his campaign narrative.”Levinson was referring to his hedge fund’s past investments in private prisons and coalmining, a legacy ripe for attacks. On prisons, he said, “That was 17 years ago when there was no talk about any political stuff … It was wrong, and I ordered them sold.”In terms of profiting off of fossil fuels, he said, “We invested in every part of the economy.”Outside of impeachment and climate, Steyer’s policy views are less known. On reparations, a subject of intense debate in DC this year as some Democrats have pushed for legislation, Steyer said he supported a bill to study it, but did not say whether he supported financial compensation for the descendants of slaves: “It’s not a question of whether this discrimination took place … and whether we should address it. The question is how best to do it.”While some of the more left-leaning candidates support Medicare for All or a single-payer government system, Steyer noted that 150 million Americans currently have “employment-based” plans, adding, “They should be allowed to make that choice. We should not make it illegal for them to have that healthcare.”Pressed on the ethics of billionaires in society, Steyer was quick to note that he and his wife have pledged to give away a bulk of their fortune in their lifetimes, and praised Sanders and congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for pushing the notion that “inequality is absolutely a shame on America”.“The idea of generational wealth is not one that I subscribe to or believe in,” he continued. “Should we have a different tax system? Absolutely. Should resources be shared differently? Absolutely.”Steyer said his personal journey is one he would like to see America take, in terms of the move away from fossil fuels: “I realized that climate was a problem, I ested myself personally. I quit my job. I worked on climate hard for more than a decade.”He added, “Do I wish that I figured it out sooner? Of course I do. But we all have to make that transition, and not to be a snot, but I think I was way ahead of almost everybody.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26d73562f82ad677262afa65258f45c87415daa6/0_275_4650_2790/master/4650.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9dbd2b61831b0827d8599315225bfe3","title":"berlin buys 670 flats on karl marx allee from private owner","story":"Move to renationalise buildings follows protests over rising property prices in the cityThe state of Berlin has bought back 670 apartments on the historic Karl-Marx-Allee from a private owner after decades of property privatisation in the German capital.A 1950s prestige project for socialist East Germany, the grand boulevard that stretches from the city centre to Friedrichshain in the east has been the frontline of a months-long fight over gentrification and rising property prices.The struggle erupted last November when the property management firm Predac announced its intention to offload 700 apartments on the road to Berlin’s largest property company, Deutsche Wohnen.Fearing rent increases, tenants organised protest marches and hung banners from their apartments, eventually pushing the city senate to block the sale.After months of legal wrangling, the senate confirmed on Monday that three blocs containing more than 670 apartments would instead be purchased by the state-owned housing provider Gewobag.While the price of the sale was not confirmed by either side, the move to renationalise the buildings on Karl-Marx-Allee is likely to come at a steep cost, with estimates ranging between €90m-€100m (£80m-£90m).Berlin’s mayor said the move was indicative of a wider strategy to reacquire housing stock sold to private investors in the 1990s, following rapid rises in rental costs in the city in recent years.“Berliners should be able to continue to afford living in the city,” said Michael Müller. “That is why it was and continues to be our intention to buy up apartments wherever we can, so that Berlin can regain control of its property market.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60557549aec3cb8c65c97d419aec341633f17f97/416_447_3692_2216/master/3692.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e68a5ab86da8decc950958d2ed867d3f","title":"first time applications irish passports up sharply since 2015 brexit","story":"Number of new applicants from Great Britain alone rose from 6,000 to 31,000 in year to JuneThe number of first-time applications for Irish passports from Great Britain has risen sharply since the EU referendum with five times as many people interesting in acquiring one.In Northern Ireland, where all citizens are entitled to an Irish passport, the number of first-time applications has more than doubled. In the year to 30 June, the number of applications from Great Britain was 31,099 and 47,645 from Northern Ireland, according to figures issued in Ireland in response to a parliamentary question to the deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney.This compares with 6,011 applications made from Great Britain in 2015, the year before the referendum, and 20,325 from Northern Ireland.Historical links between the UK and Ireland have meant that Britain has an enduring place in Irish emigration annals, with children and grandchildren of Irish-born citizens entitled to an Irish passport.Interest in acquiring Irish passports has surged since the referendum amid fears of queues at airports and the loss of a host of other rights that come with citizenship, including access to the European health insurance card (EHIC) for health cover while on holiday and the Erasmus university scheme.The Irish government has said it will cover the EHIC and Erasmus costs for Irish citizens in Northern Ireland as part of its commitment to north-south cooperation, as outlined in the Good Friday agreement.In March, the number of overall applications for Irish passports had risen to record levels with almost a quarter of a million requests since January, putting extra strain on passport offices.A record 860,000 Irish passports were issued last year, with about 200,000 coming from the UK, but the number is on course to rise even higher this year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5df646010cfc14917caef6f396802592ca88bd00/0_356_5439_3263/master/5439.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=794e283186eeb5276413a99d6ba0e887","title":"i want my countrys image to be good has romanias ruling party moved on","story":"After huge public protests, Viorica Dăncilă must prove she is not just a proxy for the former PSD leader who was jailed for corruptionIn less than 48 hours in May, Romania’s ruling party was given a triple dose of reality when it was badly beaten in European parliamentary elections, rebuked in a referendum on its attempt to reverse tough anti-corruption laws and had its powerful party leader, Liviu Dragnea, jailed for three-and-a-half years for abuse of office.It was a stinging reproach for the Social Democratic party (PSD), after two and a half years of what many considered government-led attacks on the rule of law that caused the largest protests in the country since the fall of communism and led to the president, Klaus Iohannis, calling the public vote on what critics said were ruling party efforts to make it more difficult to combat rampant state corruption.Sitting in a plush meeting room in the main government building in Bucharest, Viorica Dăncilă, the Romanian prime minister, is blunt about the beating her party took. “I consider these elections not as a victory of the opposition parties but as a defeat for the PSD,” she said. However, she believes her party can turn things around.In the aftermath of the May votes, Dăncilă vowed to abandon the controversial judicial proposals, a pledge she reiterated this week. “We have understood the message from 26 May. We have not spoken about the justice system, we have not let anybody get involved on that topic … I would like to go back to the agenda that is focused on the citizen, less on the justice system,” she said.The 55-year-old former MEP has fronted the government for the last 18 months, which included the six months from January 2019 when Romania held the rotating EU presidency, and moving on won’t be easy.As with Brexit in Britain, the fight against corruption and changes to the judiciary in Romania have dominated political discourse in recent years. The country ranks among the EU’s most corrupt states, according to Transparency International, with Brussels having kept its judicial system, along with that of neighbouring Bulgaria, under special monitoring since the countries joined the bloc in 2007.Another source of tension between Bucharest and Brussels is the negotiations over the head of the new European public prosecutor’s office. Laura Codruţa Kövesi, the former head of Romania’s anti-corruption agency, is strongly opposed by her own government but favoured by the European parliament.Kövesi, who made a name for herself as an anti-corruption crusader going after top politicians, was fired last year in a move that many believe was politically motivated. After being shortlisted for the new pan-European role this year, criminal proceedings were launched against Kövesi back home and she was temporarily banned from leaving the country or talking to the press.Dăncilă would not be drawn on whether her government would continue to oppose Kövesi’s appointment, but said that she personally believed Kövesi must “solve her issues with the justice system” before taking this kind of role. “What do we do if those accusations are real? I don’t know if they are real or not, it’s a hypothesis, but I believe that the Romanian image will be affected and I want my country’s image to be very good,” she added.Dăncilă must deal with her own image problems, having been plagued throughout her time in office by accusations that she was appointed simply to serve as a proxy for Dragnea, who was unable to become prime minister due to a previous conviction for electoral fraud. She was installed as his successor as the leader of the PSD last month.“We cannot debate her performance as a prime minister,” said Dan Barna, the leader of the opposition Save Romania Union party. “Nobody in Romania really believes she is the credible prime minister and the one who’s deciding the direction of the party.”Dăncilă pushed back against this perception. “These accusations came mostly from the opposition,” she said, adding: “The prime minister runs the government … Mr Dragnea wasn’t coming here to the government, or providing indications to the government.”Andrei Ţăranu, the deputy dean of the National University of Political Studies and Public Administration in Bucharest, believes that Dăncilă and her government will struggle to turn around public perception in the short term. “The people still don’t like her they still have some doubts about her proficiency,” he said.Dăncilă, for her part, points to strong economic growth and says her government is focusing on areas such as education, health and infrastructure.Improving relations with Brussels will be another priority, though Dăncilă believes there are double standards at work within the EU that need to be addressed.For most Romanians, however, these are of little concern when compared to the last few years of political and judicial uncertainty. After the damaging results in May, this is a message that Dăncilă suggests she has understood. “We don’t want to repeat the mistakes of the past,” she said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3944509.1562106072!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ursula von der leyen profile who is proposed new eu commission president","story":"German defence minister Ursula von der Leyen was attending an away day for the Bundeswehr armed forces on Tuesday, 45 minutes south of Berlin, when her name began circulating as a possible new president of the European Commission.As a woman and a member of Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU), part of the European People’s Party (EPP), the 60-year-old already ticked two important boxes to head the sprawling EU executive.In addition, she is trilingual, speaking French and English alongside her native German. Though at home near Hanover, Lower Saxony, she was born in Ixelles in the southern suburbs of Brussels and grew up as the daughter of an influential Lower Saxon politician and later state premier, Ernst Albrecht.In addition, the so-called Visegrád states – Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic – were reportedly not opposed to the idea of her appointment.The appointment would solve one problem for Merkel but caused complications elsewhere. It would end Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann’s ambitions of heading the European Central Bank (ECB) and block EPP spitzenkandidat (lead candidate) Manfred Weber from any top job. That would be seen as a betrayal by Weber’s colleagues in Bavaria’s ruling Christian Social Union (CSU) – Merkel’s conservative allies.“After years of anonymous EU leaders we agreed on the lead candidate system to increase European election legitimacy,” said a CSU source to The . “Ignoring the candidates people voted for at the first opportunity would be very difficult to communicate.”Asked if ditching Weber for Von der Leyen would cause a crisis in Berlin’s ruling grand coalition, the CSU source added: “By no means.”Medical doctorVon der Leyen is Lutheran and a medical doctor by training. She married in 1986 and has seven children, the youngest now 20.Seen as a liberal and reliable pair of hands, she has held three posts at the Merkel cabinet table. As family minister (2005-2009) she boosted funding for childcare, generating controversy in the more conservative wing of her own political camp. As labour and welfare minister (2009-2013) she oversaw a toughening up of the Schröder era reform programme.Her greatest challenge has been as defence minister since 2013. Her task: to retool and rebuild the Bundeswehr after years of underinvestment and ongoing confusion over its role at home and abroad. It has proven a complex, perplexing and often thankless task – in particular amid growing US pressure on Germany to boost its military spending in line with Nato commitments.She made several decisions that earned respect within the ranks: agreeing to buy unmanned drones backing weapons deliveries to Iraqi militias battling Islamic State forces and adding a new cyber warfare pillar alongside the army, navy and Luftwaffe.But, now in her sixth year in defence, she is increasingly unpopular over a series of cost overruns on military aircraft, as well as a surge in spending on outside consultants.Never a close political ally of Merkel, Von der Leyen was once considered a potential reserve chancellor. However, the minister eventually took herself out of the succession stakes, pointing to the four-year age difference between the two women.It remains to be seen whether the European Parliament will back Von der Leyen as successor to Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3958020.1563268743!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"von der leyen says eu is ready for brexit extension","story":"EU Commission presidential candidate Ursula Von der Leyen says that one of her priorities in the Brexit negotiations is maintaining peace on the island of Ireland.

Photograph: Frederick FlorinAFPGetty Images.The EU Commission’s president-designate has sent a strong conciliatory message to the UK in declaring that she is ready for another extension beyond October of the date of Brexit “should more time be required”.Speaking to the European Parliament debate on her ratification Ursula von der Leyen said of the Brexit decision, to jeers from Brexiteers, that “we regret it but respect it” and reiterated the EU position that the Withdrawal Agreement as it stands “provides certainty where Brexit provides uncertainty” on citizens rights and peace and security on the island of Ireland.“In any case,” she said, “the UK will remain an ally, partner, and a friend.”The decision to allow a further extension will be one for EU leaders in the Council, but Ms von der Leyen’s words, certainly spoken after consultation with Council president Donald Tusk, will be seen as important in giving London more space to negotiate.MEPs will vote on Tuesday evening on her nomination - she needs some 374 votes and although there is some dissent in the ranks of the parliament’s second largest party, the S\u0026ampD, she is expected to be elected with a clear majority.At that stage she will liaise with leaders about their nominees for commissionerships and put down a strong marker that she will insist on a 50-50 malefemale commission.She warned where member states refuse to supply her with female potential commissioners she will not hesitate to turn nominees down.Sources suggest, however, she is unlikely to resist the renomination of male commissioners like Ireland’s Phil Hogan.Ms von der Leyen will also be in the market for a new secretary general for the commission after incumbent Martyn Selmayr, also a German, last night told colleagues he would be standing down.Climate changeIn her speech Ms von der Leyen put a heavy emphasis on action on climate change. She said EU targets of reductions of 40 per cent in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 are insufficient and that she would argue for cuts of 50 to 55 per cent by that date.She promised legislation and a “Green deal for Europe” programme within 100 days of her election.“Emissions must have a price that changes our behaviour,” she insisted, promising a transition fund to support those countries left behind.The commissioner designate also spoke strongly of the social dimension of the social market economy, a classic reiteration of the values of her Christian Democratic party and EPP.“It is not people that serve our economy but the economy which serves our people,” she said.She insisted that the giant digital companies must be required to pay their fair share of taxes for the many services they enjoy.“In the single market economy,” Ms von der Leyen said “everyone deserves a minimum wage that pays for a decent living.”Pointedly addressing the Polish and Hungarian delegations she said there could be no compromise on the rule of law."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed really goes recycling rubbish behind scenes","story":"The chaos of Britain’s recycling system is exposed today with hundreds of thousands of tons of waste being redirected to landfill or incinerators.Despite residents sorting their household waste into separate bins, up to half of “recyclable” material is not being recycled in some areas of England, government data shows.It comes as an undercover investigation by The  and Unearthed reveals staff at a recycling centre in London are sending recyclable plastic and paper to be incinerated.Today, The  launches a Zero Waste campaign calling on the Government, local councils and private companies to do more to boost the country’s lacklustre recycling rates.It is backed by Boris Johnson...To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Tory leadership latest: Michael Gove says arch rival Boris Johnson will be \u0026#39great\u0026#39 as Prime Minister London Bridge officers who shot dead terrorists \u0026#39acted with courage\u0026#39, judge says as jury rule they were lawfully killedDonald Trump says he does not have a \u0026#39racist bone\u0026#39 in his body amid Democrat rowMatteo Salvini demands report on Roma settlements so \u0026#39eviction plan\u0026#39 can be drawn upSix Extinction Rebellion protesters arrested for \u0026#39disrupting London businesses\u0026#39Paedophile spared jail after police and prosecutor blunders Comment: Boris Johnson is no Donald Trump -

Many of them have regular residents permits or acquired the Italian citizenship. A 2017 report from the anti-discrimination group Association of 21 July noted, however, that Italy has been dubbed “the country of camps,” because in the last two decades it has been the most active in planning and creating outdoor camps where the Roma communities have been “segregated on ethnic grounds.”Mr Salvini’s letter to prefects comes a day after hundreds of policemen in riot gear cleared an abandoned school in the outskirts of Rome occupied mainly by migrants, including women and children who lived there for years. Migrants and squatters set fire to tires, mattresses and garbage to try to resist the eviction, but police eventually forced them out.That was just the latest of a list of evictions that Mr Salvini has planned across Italy, pledging he will have “zero tolerance” for anyone who illegally occupies abandoned buildings. His call for a census of the nomadic Roma and Sinti people to drive out those lacking valid residence permits has been widely criticised as reminiscent of race-based laws introduced under Italy’s fascist regime.But Mr Salvini, who insists that Italy will no longer be “Europe’s refugee camp,” still enjoys high approval ratings, amid growing hostility toward migrants in Europe and Italy.His“closed ports” policy - which prevents humanitarian ships rescuing migrants in the Mediterranean from entering Italian harbors - has put him on a collision course with Italy’s European partners.London Bridge officers who shot dead terrorists \u0026#39acted with courage\u0026#39, judge says as jury rule they were lawfully killedDonald Trump says he does not have a \u0026#39racist bone\u0026#39 in his body amid Democrat rowTory leadership latest: Michael Gove says arch rival Boris Johnson will be \u0026#39great\u0026#39 as Prime Minister Six Extinction Rebellion protesters arrested for \u0026#39disrupting London businesses\u0026#39Paedophile spared jail after police and prosecutor blunders Comment: Boris Johnson is no Donald Trump -

Despite his enormous achievements, he faced persecution during his life because he was gay. Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts after it was revealed\u0026nbsphe was in a same-sex relationship.Faced with the prospect of imprisonment, he accepted the alternative of “chemical castration” – hormone treatment supposed to suppress his sexual desire. He died of cyanide poisoning in 1954 at the age of 41. The mathematician’s housekeeper found him in his bed with a half-eaten apple on a table. His death was recorded as suicide but experts have since questioned the evidence presented during the inquest at the time.In 2009, then prime minister Gordon Brown made an official apology\u0026nbspfor\u0026nbspthe “appalling way” Turing was treated, and in 2013 he was granted a posthumous pardon by the Queen. In 2016 the government unveiled an “Alan Turing law” that posthumously pardoned thousands of gay and bisexual men convicted under outdated gross indecency laws.Alan Turing: Why was the codebreaker convicted and pardoned?The law effectively acted as an apology to those convicted for consensual same-sex relationships before homosexuality was decriminalised in England and Wales in 1967. It came after decades of campaigning from the LGBT+\u0026nbspcommunity and after the family of the Enigma codebreaker delivered a petition to Downing Street before the 2015 general election.The new note will feature a 1951 photo of Turing, a table and mathematical formulae from one of his most influential scientific papers.\u0026nbspIt will also feature a picture of the British Bombe code-breaking machine built at Bletchley Park, as well as a quote Turing gave\u0026nbspin an interview on 11 June 1949: “This is only a foretaste of what is to come\u0026nbspand only the shadow of what is going to be.”The full note design, including all the security features, will be unveiled closer to it entering circulation. The shortlisted characters, or pairs of characters, considered for the new note were Mary\u0026nbspAnning, Paul Dirac, Rosalind Franklin, William Herschel and Caroline Herschel, Dorothy Hodgkin, Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage, Stephen Hawking, James Clerk Maxwell,\u0026nbspSrinivasa\u0026nbspRamanujan, Ernest Rutherford, Frederick Sanger and Alan Turing.Sarah John, the BoE’s chief cashier, said: “The strength of the shortlist is testament to the UK’s incredible scientific contribution. The breadth of iniduals and achievements reflects the huge range of nominations we received for this note and I\u0026nbspthank the public for all their suggestions of scientists we could celebrate.”RBS £10 note with pioneering female figure to be released in OctoberNew £10 with tactile features hailed as ‘fantastic’ for blind peopleI helped judge the BBC’s Icons vote – so where were all the women?Icons review: Alan Turing crowned greatest figure of 20th centuryThis is why Alan Turing’s work could help improve tests for cancerThe new note will be printed on plastic rather than paper as is the current version.At the outbreak of the Second World War, Turing moved to the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park where he designed the British Bombe cryptographic machine. Turing’s team played a pivotal role in cracking the German Enigma code, previously seen as unbreakable. They decoded naval and U-boat messages, which revealed information about German positions and helped to shift advantage to the allies during the battle for the Atlantic. Turing was awarded an OBE for his code-breaking work.After the war\u0026nbspTuring worked on designs for pioneering early computers including the Automatic Computing Engine, one of the first electronic stored-programme computers, which was built in 1950 at the National Physical Laboratory in London. At Manchester University’s computing laboratory\u0026nbsphe developed programming for the Ferranti Mark 1 computer, the world’s first commercially available electronic computer.While at Manchester\u0026nbsphe explored artificial intelligence, proposing an experiment which became known as the Turing Test. A machine could be considered able to “think”\u0026nbspif a human interrogator was unable to distinguish a machine’s response from that of another human being. He also worked on morphogenetic theory, looking at the mysteries of patterns in nature, for example trying to explain the existence of Fibonacci numbers in plant structures. His paper, “The chemical basis of morphogenesis”, has since been recognised as pioneering work.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

No human has ventured there – or even outside of low-Earth orbit – since.With great difficulty. Which in turn was overcome by hard work and ingenuity, as part of\u0026nbspthe culmination of thousands of years of human curiosity.Why some people still believe that we never went to the MoonThe Moon is, obviously, a long way away: about 250,000 miles. And getting there also means leaving Earth\u0027s powerful gravity, which is just as difficult, pulling anything down and requiring vast power.That power came in the form of the Saturn V rocket, the biggest and most powerful rocket ever made, and arguably the most mighty piece of machinery that humanity has ever put together.On top sat the three astronauts, in a much smaller capsule. The rocket carried the astronauts up into space, but it was this capsule that would carry them to the Moon and back, once they had managed to escape Earth.That capsule, known as the command service module, was actually made up of three parts: the command module, that served as the astronauts\u0027\u0026nbsphome through the mission, the service module that contained the bits that powered them through space and kept them alive, and the lunar module.It was only that latter part that ever made its way to the Moon\u0027s surface, after detaching from the rest and touching down on the ground. After Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong had explored the Moon, they climbed back into the ascent stage part of that lunar module and used it to fly back up and attach to the main craft, which was being piloted by their colleague Michael Collins.They would then gradually float back to Earth, crashing down to land and completing their mission successfully.There was never any one justification for heading to the Moon. And many people thought we should head there for no reason at all – just because we can, and therefore should.But there was another pressing reason: because other people could. The Moon landing was the crescendo of the Space Race, which had seen the US battle with the Soviet space programme to get to a range of different milestones.That didn\u0027t start with the Moon. Both countries – embroiled at the same time in the Cold War – flung rockets, satellites, animals and people into space to demonstrate their power, and putting a man on the Moon became the inevitable conclusion of that work.All of those various aims and desires came wrapped together in a speech given by John F Kennedy in 1961, which helped launch the race for the Moon and set down the reasons for doing so.I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to earth, he said.\u0026nbspNo single space project in this period will be more exciting, or more impressive, or more important for the long-range exploration of space and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish.Getting there helped improve science in myriad ways. A variety of breakthroughs came as a result of the work done to get humanity to the Moon, and when the astronauts touched down they also helped with scientific work in unprecedented ways – they gathered up Moon rocks, left behind sensors, and even the ways that their bodies responded to the stress and strangeness of space was studied to give information that is still being studied to this day.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Eighty years later, and the effect is still breathtaking. MGM’s legendary musical adaptation of L Frank Baum’s children’s book, nominated for six Academy Awards, not only cemented Garland’s early stardom, but continues to transport those both young and old to a world where imagination is the only limit.Most memorable track: “Somewhere Over the Rainbow”Madonna, The Beatles, Nirvana, and The Police found themselves transported to the streets of 1900s Montmartre for Baz Luhrmann’s jukebox musical. Yet, as giddy and eclectic as Luhrmann’s directorial approach may be – making him one of Hollywood’s most unique creative forces – Moulin Rouge!’s doomed love story of a penniless writer (Ewan McGregor) and a courtesan (Nicole Kidman) is still grounded in the same sweeping romanticism that fuels the classic operas from which Luhrmann took his inspiration, including La traviata and La bohème.320 Singin\u0027 in the Rain (1952)Hollywood has (and will forever remain) in love with itself, but no other single film has ever quite shared that joy with audiences in the way Singin’ in the Rain does. A light-hearted parody of the industry’s transition from silent film to sound, MGM struck gold with its stars Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, and Donald O’Connor. All three play off each other with both spirit and wit, while demonstrating unmatched technical ability: from the delightful tap routine of “Good Morning”, O’Connor’s pratfalls in “Make ‘Em Laugh”, to Kelly’s now iconic umbrella dance.Most memorable track: “Singin’ in the Rain”It’s a tough decision to determine which of the 10 musicals Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers co-starred in represents the very best of their work. The dance team are responsible for some of the most graceful, accomplished routines ever captured on film – and there’s no denying they made a perfect pair. As Katharine Hepburn is said to have noted: “He gives her class and she gives him sex appeal.” Yet, it’s Top Hat that remains their most fondly remembered collaboration, as a screwball romance of mistaken identities plays out across a series of glamorous locales in London and Venice.Most memorable track:  “Cheek to Cheek”520 Cabin in the Sky (1943)Cabin in the Sky has a complex legacy, and it’s difficult to judge how exactly it should be remembered. On the one hand, it’s a radical work, as a rare example of a musical with an all-black cast produced during Hollywood’s Golden Age. Although it was released by MGM and even nominated for an Oscar, the film was banned in several US cities on its release. However, as the product of a major Hollywood studio in the 1940s, the film is guilty of troubling racial stereotyping in its depiction of folksy, childlike black characters. Although this must be taken into account, the film remains a major part of film history, especially as it provides an opportunity to see some of the greatest black performers of the era – including Ethel Waters, Lena Horne and Louis Armstrong – in one place. It was also the debut film of Vincente Minnelli, who went on to direct the likes of Gigi (1958) and An American in Paris (1951).620 An American in Paris (1951)The height of class and elegance, An American in Paris rises to the top of MGM’s crop of musicals thanks to its George Gershwin score and its unforgettable 17-minute ballet sequence, which cost almost half a million dollars to film. Imagined as a fevered daydream of the film’s main character, Jerry (Gene Kelly), the sequence is a riot of colour and twirling skirts, as Jerry and his love (Leslie Caron’s Lise) traverse across a series of theatrical sets, each stylised to evoke a famous French painter. La La Land’s epilogue sequence is a direct reference to the film.720 The Sound of Music (1965)The third highest-grossing film of all time (when adjusted for inflation), Robert Wise’s adaptation of the stage musical has remained a source of great comfort over the decades. Drawing from the true story of the von Trapp family, who escaped Nazi-invaded Europe to continue their musical career in the United States, the film allows us to believe, even momentarily, in a world where kindness, joy and optimism is all that’s needed to shield us from the evils of the world, as exemplified by Maria (Julie Andrews) herself.Most memorable track:  “The Sound of Music”This wasn’t simply William Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet reheated for a new generation. West Side Story injected new blood into one of our greatest tragedies, exposing how relevant the story remained in a decade as ided as the 1960s, when America faced conflicts both on a global scale, in the Cold War, and at home, with continuing racial tensions within the US. As the Jets, the white American gang, and the Sharks, the Puerto Rican gang, fight for control of their New York neighbourhood, two lovers cross the battle lines to offer the hopeful message that love will save us all.The inarguable peak of Bob Fosse’s career as a director and choreographer, Cabaret exemplifies exactly what’s possible within the musical genre. Utilising the Weimar Republic’s booming nightlife scene as a backdrop for the rise of the Nazi Party, Cabaret could be sexy, glamorous, dark, and sinister in equal measure, exploring topics that were largely taboo at the time (including abortion) while still delivering the musical’s traditional exuberance, anchored in Liza Minnelli\u0027s magnetic lead performance.The ultimate cult musical, once described by critic Roger Ebert as more of “long-running social phenomenon” than a film, The Rocky Horror Picture Show now comes with its own rules and traditions – you can either be enlisted to dress up and perform alongside the film, or join in with one of the many callbacks that fans all know by heart. It’s a testament to the film’s glorious, schlocky embrace of B-movie history and its message of feel-good sexual liberation and gender fluidity.Bugsy Malone is an idea that never should have worked on film: would we really sit and indulge in a cast of children playing pretend cops and gangsters? Yet, under Alan Parker’s direction, and thanks to Paul Williams’s riotous lineup of songs, the film is not only a delight, but feels oddly subversive in the way its cast so gamely fill the roles of wisecracking ne\u0027er-do-wells – a smart way to parody the cultural obsession with the machismo of the gangster genre.While the film may have earned its place in the history books thanks to Marilyn Monroe’s now iconic performance of “Diamonds Are a Girl’s Best Friend” – frequently revisited, whether by Madonna or Moulin Rouge!’s Satine – Gentlemen Prefer Blondes also deserves to be heralded for including one of cinema’s greatest double acts. Monroe and Jane Russell are formidable as two best friends on the hunt for the ideal husband, with Russell’s witty cynicist providing the perfect counterbalance to Monroe’s goofy bombshell.1320 Dancer in the Dark (2000)The film’s production history has been mired in controversy after its star, Björk, alleged that she had been sexually harassed by a Danish film director she worked with, with the Los Angeles Times later identifying the accused as Dancer in the Dark’s Lars von Trier. He has denied the allegations. However, it’s hard to deny the film’s cultural significance, as one of the most startling and groundbreaking musicals of the 21st century. Björk’s score adds incredible compassion to the story of an immigrant factory worker who finds herself betrayed by the world and its cruel machinations.Most memorable track:  “I’ve Seen it All”Rob Marshall, whose last film was Disney’s Mary Poppins Returns, has become the go-to director for the modern Hollywood musical. Having also directed Nine (2009) and Into the Woods (2014), his best work is easily Chicago, which became the first musical to win Best Picture since Oliver! in 1968. It’s a film that dutifully pays homage to its stage origins, including Bob Fosse’s original choreography, while still feeling slick and modern in its invocation of the 1920s and its lurid culture of celebrity criminals.Most memorable track:  “All that Jazz”Director George Cukor knew he had two key ingredients when it came to his take on the musical adaptation of George Bernard Shaw’s Pygmalion: Audrey Hepburn and the gorgeous stylings of Edwardian London. And so, My Fair Lady’s most delightful image remains Hepburn’s Eliza Doolittle, engulfed by an enormous black and white hat, hollering at a race horse to “move your bloomin’ arse!” Doolittle’s resilience and fierce sense of independence endures today, 50 years after the film was first released.1620 The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964)Arguably, the film could could be described more as an opera than a musical, since every line of dialogue is sung, accompanied by Michel Legrand’s score – but it’s also a work that feels purely cinematic, in love with how much life and colour can be conjured in every frame. The film remains one of the most purely romantic entries in cinematic history, as Geneviève (Catherine Deneuve), a teenage girl working in her mother’s umbrella’s shop, pines after her lover (Nino Castelnuovo) after he’s drafted to fight in Algeria.The Disney animated musical is almost a genre unto its own, considering how much it has to offer, but if one film must tower above the rest, it’s almost certainly The Lion King. Released at the height of the studio’s renaissance in the 1990s, the film recasts Shakespeare’s Hamlet in the African savannah, offering an epic story that deals with themes of destiny and responsibility, without skimping on the humour. If an entire generation is now scarred by the infamous stampede scene, it’s a price worth paying.Most memorable track: “Circle of Life”Much more than the screen debut of Julie Andrews, Mary Poppins has endured in the hearts of so many because of how it spoke to children: directly, but with a wit that never dared to patronise them. Knowing Mary was to be in on the great secrets lost to world-weary adulthood, and to be welcomed into the bountiful world of imagination and play – as beautifully represented in the Sherman brothers’ musical score and the film’s combination of live-action and traditional animation.Most memorable track: “A Spoonful of Sugar”Although Grease will largely be remembered for its karaoke-primed tunes, what’s often forgotten is how subversive the film actually proved to be at the time of its release. Grease helped break barriers when it came to the teen film, featuring characters (especially female characters) who speak frankly and openly about sex. As much as Sandy (Olivia Newton-John)’s “bad-girl” transformation can elicit eyerolls today, the scene isn’t as simple as a woman changing herself in order to impress a man – it’s also a kickback against the stifling sexual norms of American society.Most memorable track: You\u0027re the One That I WantLa La Land’s legacy is now forever tied to the great snafu of 2017’s Academy Awards, but there’s more to Damien Chazelle’s modern musical than a besuited Ryan Gosling trying to suppress an embarrassed giggle on the Oscars stage. A love letter to the genre’s history, it’s a film that both pushes forward while looking back, much like the ill-fated lovers at the centre of its story.Memorable track: “City of Stars” 120 The Wizard of Oz (1939)All the tricks and gimmicks of today’s filmmakers could never upstage The Wizard of Oz’s grand reveal, as Dorothy (Judy Garland) takes her first step into cinema’s bold, technicolour future. Eighty years later, and the effect is still breathtaking. MGM’s legendary musical adaptation of L Frank Baum’s children’s book, nominated for six Academy Awards, not only cemented Garland’s early stardom, but continues to transport those both young and old to a world where imagination is the only limit.Most memorable track: “Somewhere Over the Rainbow”Madonna, The Beatles, Nirvana, and The Police found themselves transported to the streets of 1900s Montmartre for Baz Luhrmann’s jukebox musical.

Yet, under Alan Parker’s direction, and thanks to Paul Williams’s riotous lineup of songs, the film is not only a delight, but feels oddly subversive in the way its cast so gamely fill the roles of wisecracking ne\u0027er-do-wells – a smart way to parody the cultural obsession with the machismo of the gangster genre.While the film may have earned its place in the history books thanks to Marilyn Monroe’s now iconic performance of “Diamonds Are a Girl’s Best Friend” – frequently revisited, whether by Madonna or Moulin Rouge!’s Satine – Gentlemen Prefer Blondes also deserves to be heralded for including one of cinema’s greatest double acts. Monroe and Jane Russell are formidable as two best friends on the hunt for the ideal husband, with Russell’s witty cynicist providing the perfect counterbalance to Monroe’s goofy bombshell.1320 Dancer in the Dark (2000)The film’s production history has been mired in controversy after its star, Björk, alleged that she had been sexually harassed by a Danish film director she worked with, with the Los Angeles Times later identifying the accused as Dancer in the Dark’s Lars von Trier. He has denied the allegations. However, it’s hard to deny the film’s cultural significance, as one of the most startling and groundbreaking musicals of the 21st century. Björk’s score adds incredible compassion to the story of an immigrant factory worker who finds herself betrayed by the world and its cruel machinations.Most memorable track:  “I’ve Seen it All”Rob Marshall, whose last film was Disney’s Mary Poppins Returns, has become the go-to director for the modern Hollywood musical. Having also directed Nine (2009) and Into the Woods (2014), his best work is easily Chicago, which became the first musical to win Best Picture since Oliver! in 1968. It’s a film that dutifully pays homage to its stage origins, including Bob Fosse’s original choreography, while still feeling slick and modern in its invocation of the 1920s and its lurid culture of celebrity criminals.Most memorable track:  “All that Jazz”Director George Cukor knew he had two key ingredients when it came to his take on the musical adaptation of George Bernard Shaw’s Pygmalion: Audrey Hepburn and the gorgeous stylings of Edwardian London. And so, My Fair Lady’s most delightful image remains Hepburn’s Eliza Doolittle, engulfed by an enormous black and white hat, hollering at a race horse to “move your bloomin’ arse!” Doolittle’s resilience and fierce sense of independence endures today, 50 years after the film was first released.1620 The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964)Arguably, the film could could be described more as an opera than a musical, since every line of dialogue is sung, accompanied by Michel Legrand’s score – but it’s also a work that feels purely cinematic, in love with how much life and colour can be conjured in every frame. The film remains one of the most purely romantic entries in cinematic history, as Geneviève (Catherine Deneuve), a teenage girl working in her mother’s umbrella’s shop, pines after her lover (Nino Castelnuovo) after he’s drafted to fight in Algeria.The Disney animated musical is almost a genre unto its own, considering how much it has to offer, but if one film must tower above the rest, it’s almost certainly The Lion King. Released at the height of the studio’s renaissance in the 1990s, the film recasts Shakespeare’s Hamlet in the African savannah, offering an epic story that deals with themes of destiny and responsibility, without skimping on the humour. If an entire generation is now scarred by the infamous stampede scene, it’s a price worth paying.Most memorable track: “Circle of Life”Much more than the screen debut of Julie Andrews, Mary Poppins has endured in the hearts of so many because of how it spoke to children: directly, but with a wit that never dared to patronise them. Knowing Mary was to be in on the great secrets lost to world-weary adulthood, and to be welcomed into the bountiful world of imagination and play – as beautifully represented in the Sherman brothers’ musical score and the film’s combination of live-action and traditional animation.Most memorable track: “A Spoonful of Sugar”Although Grease will largely be remembered for its karaoke-primed tunes, what’s often forgotten is how subversive the film actually proved to be at the time of its release. Grease helped break barriers when it came to the teen film, featuring characters (especially female characters) who speak frankly and openly about sex. As much as Sandy (Olivia Newton-John)’s “bad-girl” transformation can elicit eyerolls today, the scene isn’t as simple as a woman changing herself in order to impress a man – it’s also a kickback against the stifling sexual norms of American society.Most memorable track: You\u0027re the One That I WantLa La Land’s legacy is now forever tied to the great snafu of 2017’s Academy Awards, but there’s more to Damien Chazelle’s modern musical than a besuited Ryan Gosling trying to suppress an embarrassed giggle on the Oscars stage. A love letter to the genre’s history, it’s a film that both pushes forward while looking back, much like the ill-fated lovers at the centre of its story.Memorable track: “City of Stars” Stone won an Oscar, along with Chazelle, for her role in\u0026nbspLa La Land. If Stone and Pitt sign up to star in Babylon, it will\u0026nbspbe the duo’s first collaboration.In October, Stone will return as Wichita for Zombieland: Double Tap and Pitt can next be seen opposite Leonardo DiCaprio and Margot Robbie in Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, which hits cinemas in August.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

With Brexit bringing an end to reciprocal medical cover, this mattersClick to followThe IndependentThanks to the Conservative Party some 14m people may find travel to Europe much more difficult if not impossible after October 31.\u0026nbspThose people are those of use with pre existing medical conditions.Even with the reciprocal health coverage we currently enjoy thanks to the UK\u0027s memberhip of the EU, it’s still wise for us to take out travel insurance. A no deal Brexit would make it essential. And that can prove very expensive.\u0026nbspHow can we get a fair deal on our travel insurance?How to buy the right travel insuranceThe Financial Conduct Authority waking up to the issue is therefore timely.\u0026nbspIt is proposing a series of reforms to a market in which it currently is legal to discriminate against those with disabilities in a way that it is not against, say, male drivers. The statistics show that those of us with a Y chromosome pose more risk of an accident, which used to be reflected in our premiums. However, the EU put paid to that and you won’t hear many complaints about its decision from the usual suspects.\u0026nbspIf you have a pre-existing medical condition the same protection does not apply. You’re likely to pay more, and potentially so much more that it makes travel impossible, or get hit with exclusions, which can severely limited the effectiveness of travel insurance policies. \u0026nbspThe watchdog is proposing to address this by mandating that insurers point customers to a directory of alternatives who might be prepared to do better when they load their premiums or demand exclusions.\u0026nbspThere are specialists out there which can offer improved deals and policies for we who have pre existing conditions. They still charge more - I pay more than the rest of my family put together - but they can be an improvement on what mainstream insurers offer. \u0026nbspA good innovation? I have to admit to being in two minds about this.\u0026nbspIt may help people get cover who might otherwise be stuck. A couple of years ago Scope, the disability charity, highlighted the case of Samantha Renke, an a 31-year-old actress and disability campaigner, who was quoted £500 for a two-week trip to Mexico.\u0026nbspShe has osteogenesis imperfecta, or brittle bones, but had had her spine straightened with rods, which would have significantly reduced the risk of her having to claim as a result of her disability. The insurers she tried appeared unwilling to take this into account.\u0026nbspAt a time when underwriting is becoming increasingly automated, with artificial intelligence playing a progressively greater role, I expect this to happen more and more often.\u0026nbspThe FCA’s plan might have helped address the issues she faced. She would have\u0026nbspbeen referred to the\u0026nbspdirectory. I imagine the same thing would happen to me.\u0026nbspBut I worry that what the watchdog is doing is pushing\u0026nbsp14m Britons into an insurance ghetto, allowing what you might call mainstream insurers to wash their hands of us, rather than making them treat us fairly.\u0026nbspSo the plan is not without thorns. Here’s another: It is suggesting providing information to “help consumers understand the implications of travelling with exclusions, and how factors such as country of travel can impact medical costs and therefore travel insurance premiums”.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

But those with a more adventurous disposition really ought not to be put off because of insurers’ knuckle headedness.\u0026nbspThe watchdog is due to publish an update on pricing later this week, which will look at the way vulnerable consumers are treated.

Yet another one was announced alongside the delay: the group said it had formally taken control of Game Digital. So something like this was always on the cards.\u0026nbspThat was the view of the City and investors duly ran for cover. Sports Direct’s shares lost more than ten per cent within minutes of the stock market opening.\u0026nbspMike Ashley’s Sports Direct weighs up £61m Debenhams dealEvans Cycles to close more stores after sale to Sports DirectBut that’s not the most troubling thing about the company’s announcement.\u0026nbspInvestors not named or in the employ of Mike Ashley haven’t had an update on how their company is doing since December. In the interim, it has been as busy as a sports coach in the days leading up to the start of a new season, butting heads, gobbling up businesses, buying back shares.\u0026nbspSports Direct said the reasons for the delay were that integrating HoF into the sprawling retail empire had created “complexities” at a time when auditors overseeing the preparation of company\u0026nbspresults are facing additional scrutiny from the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), particularly Grant Thornton, Sports Direct’s auditor.\u0026nbspIt had a rocket fired at it by the watchdog last week. The FRC said only half the firm’s audits were rated as good or requiring limited improvement during its most recent review. One in four had failed to pass muster over the last five years. This landed the firm on the accountancy naughty step.\u0026nbspThose excuses are ostensibly plausible. The problem came with final part of the explanation for the delay, the reference in the stock exchange announcement to “uncertainty as to the current trading performance” of HoF. \u0026nbspUsually the word “uncertain” is code for “bad”. You never see it used when a company’s business is going like the clappers but it isn’t quite sure whether where the best description for its permanence should fall in a range between “better than expected” and “yowza”.But how bad? There’s a big difference between trading being at, say, the bottom end of the company’s or the market’s expectations and the roof falling in.\u0026nbspAnd what’s going on at the rest of the business?\u0026nbspApparently a number of areas are being looked at which could “materially affect guidance”. But which areas? Nobody outside of Sports Direct knows, so the City was left with no option but to assume the worst.\u0026nbspIt was a busy morning for Sports Direct announcements. Another concerned the share buyback programme it announced in April. The company said it spent just shy of £150,000 buying 56,368 shares on 12 July.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Despite his enormous achievements, he faced persecution during his life because he was gay. Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts after it was revealed\u0026nbsphe was in a same-sex relationship.Faced with the prospect of imprisonment, he accepted the alternative of “chemical castration” – hormone treatment supposed to suppress his sexual desire. He died of cyanide poisoning in 1954 at the age of 41. The mathematician’s housekeeper found him in his bed with a half-eaten apple on a table. His death was recorded as suicide but experts have since questioned the evidence presented during the inquest at the time.In 2009, then prime minister Gordon Brown made an official apology\u0026nbspfor\u0026nbspthe “appalling way” Turing was treated, and in 2013 he was granted a posthumous pardon by the Queen. In 2016 the government unveiled an “Alan Turing law” that posthumously pardoned thousands of gay and bisexual men convicted under outdated gross indecency laws.Alan Turing: Why was the codebreaker convicted and pardoned?The law effectively acted as an apology to those convicted for consensual same-sex relationships before homosexuality was decriminalised in England and Wales in 1967. It came after decades of campaigning from the LGBT+\u0026nbspcommunity and after the family of the Enigma codebreaker delivered a petition to Downing Street before the 2015 general election.The new note will feature a 1951 photo of Turing, a table and mathematical formulae from one of his most influential scientific papers.\u0026nbspIt will also feature a picture of the British Bombe code-breaking machine built at Bletchley Park, as well as a quote Turing gave\u0026nbspin an interview on 11 June 1949: “This is only a foretaste of what is to come\u0026nbspand only the shadow of what is going to be.”The full note design, including all the security features, will be unveiled closer to it entering circulation. The shortlisted characters, or pairs of characters, considered for the new note were Mary\u0026nbspAnning, Paul Dirac, Rosalind Franklin, William Herschel and Caroline Herschel, Dorothy Hodgkin, Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage, Stephen Hawking, James Clerk Maxwell,\u0026nbspSrinivasa\u0026nbspRamanujan, Ernest Rutherford, Frederick Sanger and Alan Turing.Sarah John, the BoE’s chief cashier, said: “The strength of the shortlist is testament to the UK’s incredible scientific contribution. The breadth of iniduals and achievements reflects the huge range of nominations we received for this note and I\u0026nbspthank the public for all their suggestions of scientists we could celebrate.”RBS £10 note with pioneering female figure to be released in OctoberNew £10 with tactile features hailed as ‘fantastic’ for blind peopleI helped judge the BBC’s Icons vote – so where were all the women?Icons review: Alan Turing crowned greatest figure of 20th centuryThis is why Alan Turing’s work could help improve tests for cancerThe new note will be printed on plastic rather than paper as is the current version.At the outbreak of the Second World War, Turing moved to the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park where he designed the British Bombe cryptographic machine. Turing’s team played a pivotal role in cracking the German Enigma code, previously seen as unbreakable. They decoded naval and U-boat messages, which revealed information about German positions and helped to shift advantage to the allies during the battle for the Atlantic. Turing was awarded an OBE for his code-breaking work.After the war\u0026nbspTuring worked on designs for pioneering early computers including the Automatic Computing Engine, one of the first electronic stored-programme computers, which was built in 1950 at the National Physical Laboratory in London. At Manchester University’s computing laboratory\u0026nbsphe developed programming for the Ferranti Mark 1 computer, the world’s first commercially available electronic computer.While at Manchester\u0026nbsphe explored artificial intelligence, proposing an experiment which became known as the Turing Test. A machine could be considered able to “think”\u0026nbspif a human interrogator was unable to distinguish a machine’s response from that of another human being. He also worked on morphogenetic theory, looking at the mysteries of patterns in nature, for example trying to explain the existence of Fibonacci numbers in plant structures. His paper, “The chemical basis of morphogenesis”, has since been recognised as pioneering work.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The governor of the Bank of England said businesses expect they will have to cut jobs if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, as their sales go down and costs go up.There are signs the UK’s looming departure is already having an impact on hiring. Large recruitment company Hays said earlier on Tuesday that its net fees in the UK and Ireland were down 2 per cent between April and June, pulled down by a 6 per cent fall in fees for private sector placements.Evidence of a reduction in hiring and fewer vacancies\u0026nbspunderpin a less rosy outlook for wages from the National Institute of\u0026nbspEconomic\u0026nbspand Social Research (NIESR). After the official data came out, NIESR\u0026nbspforecast that growth in regular pay will stabilise at around 3.5 per cent in the third quarter.Arno Hantzsche, senior economist at NIESR, said: “Economic and political uncertainty pose a considerable risk to hiring activity and, according to our new estimates, prevent a further acceleration of earnings growth in the months ahead.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 443 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.543 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1343 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1443 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1743 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2143 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2743 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2943 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3143 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3643 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singerssongwritersgenres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4343 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 443 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate.

Ed Sheeran’s new album is bland, sincere and hygienically preparedWhy do celebrities find it so hard to play themselves?Intriguingly, the Moscow statue is not the first time Sheeran has served as inspiration for a statue. In 2016, a Sheeran-inspired pig statue wearing a plaid shirt and sporting messy red hair was planted in Ipswich, near Sheeran’s hometown of Framlingham.

The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 220 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special.

Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.Moss went on to explain that she decided to take the role in the end because she couldn’t bear the thought of another actor playing June.“But I was thinking about whether to do the show one evening,” she continued, “and I remember having an almost nightmarish experience of waking up in the middle of the night imagining not taking it and someone else doing it.\u0026nbsp“I pictured that in my mind and then I thought to myself, ‘No, no, no, no, no, someone else is not getting their hands on this.’ So I said, ‘Yes.’ That’s why I did it – pure jealousy and competitiveness.”Moss added that the role of June is the “most connected” she’s felt to a part out of all of her work.The Handmaid’s Tale airs on Sundays at 9pm on Channel 4.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The meth maker believes his days of cooking are long over. Having lunch with his family, everything seems perfect. And then everything goes wrong. So, so wrong. Hank (Dean Norris) goes to use the toilet and picks up a copy of Walt Whitman\u0027s Leaves of Grass – a gift from Gale to Walter White. “To my other favorited WW. It\u0027s an honour working with you. Fondly, GB.” And with that, as Hank realises Walt’s true identity, the end of Heisenberg’s empire begins.The debate over whether certain final scenes of television shows are actually good will rage on and on. The Sopranos remains front and centre of the conversation. It\u0027s a seemingly banal occasion – a restaurant dinner scene. We watch on as Tony sits there, observing other customers. Carmela arrives, then AJ and Meadow, who the last we see, is parking her car outside. A bell rings, Tony looks up and the screen cuts to black. It’s an ending that’s inspired essays offering varied interpretations but ultimately, it remains a beautifully-executed few minutes of television – and a cliffhanger that’ll never have a resolution.337 EastEnders – The Kat and Zoe revelation (2001)“You can’t tell me what to do ‘cause you ain’t my muvva”  “YES I AM!” - not the work of Shakespeare, granted, but surely one of the biggest moments in soap history. The nation’s jaws collectively dropped as they learned that Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) wasn’t Zoe’s sister at all, but her mum.  437 Game of Thrones – The Rains of Castamere (2013)Game of Thrones knew George RR Martin was willing to kill off leading characters, but nothing prepared non-book readers for The Red Wedding. Robb Stark (Richard Madden), Talisa Stark (Oona Chaplin) and Catelyn Stark (Michelle Fairley) are attending the wedding of Roslin Frey (Alexandra Dowling) and Edmure Tully (Tobias Menzies) when things go terribly, terribly wrong for the Starks. The Freys turn on them, killing Robb, Talisa and their unborn child. Then, as the blood spills everywhere, Catelyn’s throat is slit. Cut to black. Devastating.The cliffhanger that kickstarted the end of season cliffhanger trend. Larry Hagman’s oil baron JR Ewing had made plenty of enemies in Dallas. By the end of season three, one of them took justice into their own hands, shooting JR in the back twice. However, rather than reveal the culprit, the team behind Dallas left the case unsolved. And over the next eight months – the time between seasons – the whole world was asking “Who shot JR?” Unsurprisingly, considering the hysteria around the mystery, 350 million people tuned in to watch the revelatory episode “Who Done It”.Showrunner Matt Groening had long wanted to do an episode where Mr Burns was shot, and the culprit was not revealed until the next episode. Taking inspiration from Dallas, the animation concluded Part One with the nuclear power plant owner being shot by an unknown assailant. Then, after a Summer of waiting, fans were finally treated to the answer. The two-part episode has gone down as a classic and is often heralded as the series’ best.737 Doctor Who – The Parting of the Ways (2005)Choosing one standout Doctor Who cliffhanger is almost impossible – especially when you consider that all 37 (and counting) seasons have frequently used the plot device. While the introduction of John Hurt’s Doctor certainly ranks among them, one of best came at the end of the rebooted first series. Having absorbed a bunch of vortexes, the Doctor is struggling and on the verge of regenerating. Turning to Rose (Billie Piper), Christopher Eccleston’s incarnation of the iconic character utters the timeless lines: “Before I go, I just want to tell you, you were fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. And you know what – so was I.” Queue shoddy CGI and the introduction of the soon-to-be nation’s favourite Doctor, David Tennant. “So, where was I? That’s it – Barcelona.”Gale (David Costabile) is one of the nicest characters on Breaking Bad. He is not interested in wealth or fame, but in science. However, niceties and a good cup of coffee are not enough to stop him getting in Walter White’s (Bryan Cranston) way. When the choice between their lives has to be made, Walter chooses his own and sends Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to do the dirty work. Season three ends with Jesse killing Gale – an incident that eventually brings down the drug kingpin Gus Fring.937 The West Wing – “What Kind of Day Has it Been” (2000)The West Wing’s biggest cliffhanger came in the season one finale. The episode works its way back from the beginning as we see a Secret Service Agent sense danger from a nearby window at a town hall meeting with the president in attendance. When the episode catches up, gunfire rings out and each member of his senior staff is thrown to the floor. Cut to black as we hear an agent ask over the radio: “Who’s been hit?”It wasn’t until the third season finale of Smallville that Superman fans’ patience was rewarded as viewers saw Clark (Tom Welling) appear naked in the middle of a Kryptonian symbol burned into the field of his family’s farm. “You shall be reborn,” Jor-El can be heard saying to Clark Kent, but he wasn’t the alone one the ending marked a radical turning point for the series.Twin Peaks’ season two finale – the mystery drama’s last episode for 27 years – may have featured the most chilling cliffhanger, but the biggest gasp of the series came at the end of season one as the seemingly untouchable Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) responds to a knock on his hotel room door, only to be gunned down by an unseen assailant.1237 Buffy the Vampire Slayer – The Gift (2001)The 100th episode of Buffy ended with one of the show’s most shocking moments (and no, we’re not talking about the musical episode). Season five concluded with the eponymous ass-kicker sacrificing herself to save the world by jumping into a demonic portal. The episode ends with a slow zoom onto Buffy’s tombstone, which reads: “Beloved sister. Devoted friend. She saved the world. A lot.“It\u0027s easy to forget that True Blood began life as an acclaimed Emmy-nominated drama, and it was a cliffhanger such as this that made it so: Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin) falls asleep with the friendly neighbour dog Dean for company. Upon waking up, Dean is gone and in his place is local barman Sam Merlotte ( Sam Trammell). Turns out he\u0027s a shapeshifter.1437 The Walking Dead – Last Day on Earth (2016)After eight episodes of build-up, the comic book’s deadliest villain, Negan, reared his head in a scene fans were dreading. With the majority of the main cast lined up at his mercy, Negan – in retaliation for the death of one of his gang – decides which one to kill by using “Eeny Meeny Mino Moe”. After selecting his victim, the camera switches POV and Negan bludgeons the unseen character to death leaving fans with a six-month wait before finding out who had met their maker.Lost co-creator Damon Lindelof\u0027s HBO drama was set in a world that saw two per cent of the world’s population disappear into thin air during a tragic event known as the Sudden Departure. Season two presented an intriguing mystery: the disappearance of three teenage girls from a Texan town that nobody had vanished from. It was the season\u0027s penultimate episode that cleared up this plot line as Matt Garvey (Chris Zylka) breaks into a heavily-guarded trailer – only to be met with the three teenage girls staring back at him. What’s more is they’re dressed all in white, a callback to the disbanded cult from the first season.In episode 11, the writers had introduced a hatch buried underground and, week in week out, the fans waited patiently for any detail about the mysterious structure the writers were willing to give them. The end of episode 19 saw a desperate John Locke (Terry O’Quinn) banging on the door, just as desperate to get inside as the viewers were... only for a light to come on from within. This ending remains an unforgettable moment for those who watched it at the time of broadcast.1737 Lost – “Two for the Road” (2006)“I’m sorry.” “For what?” BANG. On paper, not so effective but on screen, it equated to one of Lost’s most gasp-inducing cliffhangers. Viewers watched behind their eyes as Michael (Harold Perrineau), desperate to save his son from the mysterious Others, shoots Ana-Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez) and, in a cruel twist, Libby (Cynthia Watros), who has accidentally stumbled upon the whole thing while looking for some blankets.1837 Lost - \u0027Through the Looking Glass – Part 2Whether you love or hate Lost, there’s no denying that the season three finale deployed one of the most breathtaking rug pulls in television history as writers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse revealed a shake-up long in the running: flashbacks featuring a suicidal Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) were, in fact, flashforwards to the future. The Oceanic Flight 815 plane crash survivor made it off the island he’d been so desperate to get off for three whole seasons, but was, disturbingly, desperate to get back. The ending set the benchmark for all future finale and was so huge it made newspaper headlines.1937 Line of Duty – Series four premiere (2018)The fourth series of Line of Duty didn’t hold back on the shocks. In fact, its first episode featured a cliffhanger ending to rival the best of them. With DCI Roz Huntley (Thandie Newton) dead on his floor, her murderer – Forensic Coordinator Tim Ifield (Jason Watkins) – sets about dispatching her body, but as his chainsaw nears her face, Roz’s eyes suddenly open.After season one, Heroes became pretty dreadful television. But this cliffhanger looms in the memory for being so left-field it warrants applaud: having captured serial killer Sylar, Angela Petrelli – parent to superheroes Nathan and Peter – tells him she can provide him with the love and guidance he needs. Angry, Sylar tells her she’s not his mother to which Angela drops the bombshell: “But I am dear, I am.” A head-scratching mid-season reveal that had fans chomping at the bit for the next episode.After spending an entire season watching the blossoming romance between medical intern Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and Dr Derek Shephard (Patrick Dempsey), the world of viewers was rocked upon discovering the shock revelation that Derek was married all along.Channel 4 sitcom Green Wing took the term “cliffhanger” quite literally for each finale of its two series. While it became a tad gimmicky the second time around, the first remained a genuinely surprising way for a comedy series to end: having discovered that the colleague he’d just slept with was his mother, drug-addled anaesthetist Guy Secretan (Stephen Mangan) steals an ambulance, drives it to the country and loses control. After crashing, the episode ends with Guy and several other characters dangling – you guessed it – off a cliff.A particularly nail-biting fourth season was shaping up to end well: after weeks of playing cat-and-mouse with the Trinity Killer (John Lithgow on Emmy-winning form), Dexter finally put an end to his murderous ways and returned home ready to pack up and join his wife Rita on their vacation. Only Rita’s still at home... dead in the bathtub. Trinity killed her before Dexter got to him. A heartbreaking end to a standout season.When things are going supremely well towards the end of a season finale, you know something big is about to go down. Battlestar Galactica proved no different. After destroying the Cylon Basestar – a warship belonging to the enemy – crew member Boomer, who viewers had learnt was a Cylon in the mini-series that aired the year before, fires a round into the chest of Commander Adama (Edward James Olmos), the show’s main character.Having been warned for two seasons that Z’ha’dum means death, fans expected big things from an episode called “Z’ha’dum”. They weren’t wrong. It ended with the show’s lead character jumping to his death. The episode was so big the episodes leading up to it teased “Z minus 14 days” and “Z minus 7 days.”24 was filled to the brim with huge cliffhangers, but this one – arriving at the 16 episode mark – stands out for sparking what would be the show’s best run of episodes. President Charles Logan (Gregory Itzin) is revealed to be the mastermind behind the shocking assassinations of David Palmer and Michelle Dessler, which kickstarted the season. And thus the show’s most memorable villain was born.2737 Friends – The One with Ross’s Wedding (1998)While Ross (David Schwimmer) and Rachel’s (Jennifer Aniston) “will they, won’t they” courtship arguably went on far too long, there was one moment during the season four finale that left fans with their jaws on the floor. Just after Rachel had accepted Ross was happy with fiancé Emily (Helen Baxendale), everything goes catastrophically wrong. Instead of saying Emily’s name during the wedding vows, Ross says the iconic line: “Take thee Rachel”. After the wedding, as the season finished, everyone was left wondering whether the pair would finally rekindle their romance for good.“I’m in a boxcar, buried inside a quarry, and there are bodies everywhere,” says Mulder to Scully during the season two finale. And just as Mulder solves the riddle of how those people died, the roof of the boxcar slams shut, trapping him inside. Worse still, the Smoking Man then arrives with a unit of soldiers. When they open the boxcar, Mulder’s somehow nowhere to be seen and they decide to blow the freight to smithereens. Did Mulder survive? Did he get away?2937 Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life – Fall (2016)“It certainly wasn\u0027t the ending I expected,” Rory Gilmore actor Alexis Bledel said of the finale. “Fitting but frustrating”, was how Vanity Fair referred to the episode. The Gilmore Girls sequel, A Year in the Life, concluded with a four-word exchange between Rory and her mother, Lorelai (Lauren Graham). “Mum”, the daughter says, sitting in a park’s bandstand. “Yeah”, she replies. “I’m pregnant,” Rory says. Queue hundreds of fans wanting more from the story, which had, ultimately, come full circle.3037 Star Trek: The Next Generation – Best of Both Worlds (1990)Another science fiction show filled to the brim with cliffhangers. Star Trek: The Next Generation had many, but few can measure up to Picard (Patrick Stewart) becoming a Borg. The season three finale sees the Enterprise’s crew having no choice but to turn on their former captain, with Riker (Jonathan Frakes) ordering Worf (Michael Dorn) to open fire on Picard’s Borg ship. Fans had to wait three months to discover whether Picard could be saved – and the fandom almost imploded in the meantime.Marissa Cooper (Mischa Barton) and Ryan Atwood (Benjamin McKenzie) would have done anything for each other. When Ryan’s brother Trey (Logan Marshall-Green) gets in the way, attacking Marissa, Ryan has no other course of action but to settle things “once and for all” between them. As the brawl ensues, Marissa somehow ends up shooting Trey. And as the bullet goes through him, Imogen Heap’s song “Hide and Seek” – AKA the “Mmmmh, what you say?” song – suddenly starts playing. It’s hard not to laugh. The pop song cuts through the scene, completely at odds with what’s happening on screen. No wonder, then, that Saturday Night Live famously parodied the scene in one of their most-beloved skits of all time.Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer) were the ultimate “will they, won’t they” couple, their chemistry electrifying the early seasons of The Office. Things peaked for the first time during the season two finale. Following Casino Night at Dunder Mifflin, Jim finally takes Pam aside to reveal his true feelings, telling her: “I’m in love with you.” She is, at the time, engaged to Roy (David Denman), and decides to reply to Jim: “What are you doing?” While all hope for the pair seems lost, Jim finds Pam (calling her mother) before the episode’s end and kisses her. Cruelly, the showrunners decided to cut to black after the moment, leaving fans wondering for months whether the couple would return to screens happily together (spoiler: they do not).JJ Abrams loves ending things on a twist. Before creating the mystery-box filled Lost, the filmmaker created Alias, and the season two finale marks one the show’s greatest endings. The episode sees Sydney (Jennifer Garner) discover that Francie (Merrin Dungey) is not Francie at all, but a duplicate. The two then brawl, ending with Sydney shooting Francie and then collapsing due to exhaustion. We immediately jump to Sydney waking up in Hong Kong. After reuniting with her lover Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan), Sydney realises things are amiss as Michael is wearing a wedding ring. Turns out, she has been missing for almost two years. Cut to black, and the world asking “What just happened?”3437 Spooks – Smoke and Mirrors (2003)The season two finale of Spooks shocked the nation. While the episode begins with the CIA taking on a seemingly straightforward mission – to prevent a member of the Cabinet being assassinated – we soon discover that everything’s not as it seems. The formerly-presumed dead Herman Joyce (Tomas Arana) is still alive and masquerading as Herb Zeigler. Not only that, but the villain has masterminded an elaborate plan to make it seem as if Tom (Matthew Macfadyen) has assassinated the Chief of the Defence Staff. With everything working against Tom, the agent finds himself backed into a corner. And when Harry (Peter Firth) loses faith, Tom decides to shoot Harry with his shotgun. Does Harry die? Will Tom ever be found innocent? The questions were many.3537 Dragon Ball Z – Next time on Dragon Ball ZThere’s really no definitive Dragon Ball Z cliffhanger, as almost every single episode in the series finishes with one. From Vegeta staring menacingly at the camera to the villainous Cell launching a deadline attack on Goku, the series leaves you anywhere and everywhere. When that voice-over comes in with “Next time on Dragon Ball Z”, you can guarantee any child watching will be hooked and instantly wanting to watch the next episode.Pushing Up Daisies was unceremoniously brought to an end after just two seasons, with showrunner Bryan Fuller having to quickly conclude the whimsical series with very little notice. The epilogue was added late into the writing process and sees the narrator offer some closure to each characters’ story. Yet, with Ned (Lee Pace) and Chuck (Anna Friel) standing on her aunts’ doorstep, waiting to finally reveal that she’s alive, fans could see that there were originally supposed to be many more seasons to come – and they still want them desperately.Following a war of words with Jim Moriarty (Andrew Scott) on the roof of a building (in which Moriarty shoots himself in the head), Sherlock (Benedict Cumberbatch) decides to seemingly commit suicide by jumping off the building. However, not all is at it seems, as Sherlock is seen alive before the episode end. Fans of the series – plus Martin Freeman’s Watson – were left questioning what exactly happened to Sherlock, with all being revealed in the following special.Karma for killing Gale comes for Walter White in season five. The meth maker believes his days of cooking are long over. Having lunch with his family, everything seems perfect. And then everything goes wrong. So, so wrong. Hank (Dean Norris) goes to use the toilet and picks up a copy of Walt Whitman\u0027s Leaves of Grass – a gift from Gale to Walter White. “To my other favorited WW. It\u0027s an honour working with you. Fondly, GB.” And with that, as Hank realises Walt’s true identity, the end of Heisenberg’s empire begins.The debate over whether certain final scenes of television shows are actually good will rage on and on. The Sopranos remains front and centre of the conversation. It\u0027s a seemingly banal occasion – a restaurant dinner scene. We watch on as Tony sits there, observing other customers. Carmela arrives, then AJ and Meadow, who the last we see, is parking her car outside. A bell rings, Tony looks up and the screen cuts to black. It’s an ending that’s inspired essays offering varied interpretations but ultimately, it remains a beautifully-executed few minutes of television – and a cliffhanger that’ll never have a resolution.337 EastEnders – The Kat and Zoe revelation (2001)“You can’t tell me what to do ‘cause you ain’t my muvva”  “YES I AM!” - not the work of Shakespeare, granted, but surely one of the biggest moments in soap history. The nation’s jaws collectively dropped as they learned that Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) wasn’t Zoe’s sister at all, but her mum.  437 Game of Thrones – The Rains of Castamere (2013)Game of Thrones knew George RR Martin was willing to kill off leading characters, but nothing prepared non-book readers for The Red Wedding. Robb Stark (Richard Madden), Talisa Stark (Oona Chaplin) and Catelyn Stark (Michelle Fairley) are attending the wedding of Roslin Frey (Alexandra Dowling) and Edmure Tully (Tobias Menzies) when things go terribly, terribly wrong for the Starks. The Freys turn on them, killing Robb, Talisa and their unborn child. Then, as the blood spills everywhere, Catelyn’s throat is slit. Cut to black. Devastating.The cliffhanger that kickstarted the end of season cliffhanger trend. Larry Hagman’s oil baron JR Ewing had made plenty of enemies in Dallas. By the end of season three, one of them took justice into their own hands, shooting JR in the back twice. However, rather than reveal the culprit, the team behind Dallas left the case unsolved. And over the next eight months – the time between seasons – the whole world was asking “Who shot JR?” Unsurprisingly, considering the hysteria around the mystery, 350 million people tuned in to watch the revelatory episode “Who Done It”.Showrunner Matt Groening had long wanted to do an episode where Mr Burns was shot, and the culprit was not revealed until the next episode. Taking inspiration from Dallas, the animation concluded Part One with the nuclear power plant owner being shot by an unknown assailant. Then, after a Summer of waiting, fans were finally treated to the answer. The two-part episode has gone down as a classic and is often heralded as the series’ best.737 Doctor Who – The Parting of the Ways (2005)Choosing one standout Doctor Who cliffhanger is almost impossible – especially when you consider that all 37 (and counting) seasons have frequently used the plot device. While the introduction of John Hurt’s Doctor certainly ranks among them, one of best came at the end of the rebooted first series. Having absorbed a bunch of vortexes, the Doctor is struggling and on the verge of regenerating. Turning to Rose (Billie Piper), Christopher Eccleston’s incarnation of the iconic character utters the timeless lines: “Before I go, I just want to tell you, you were fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. And you know what – so was I.” Queue shoddy CGI and the introduction of the soon-to-be nation’s favourite Doctor, David Tennant. “So, where was I? That’s it – Barcelona.”Gale (David Costabile) is one of the nicest characters on Breaking Bad. He is not interested in wealth or fame, but in science. However, niceties and a good cup of coffee are not enough to stop him getting in Walter White’s (Bryan Cranston) way. When the choice between their lives has to be made, Walter chooses his own and sends Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to do the dirty work. Season three ends with Jesse killing Gale – an incident that eventually brings down the drug kingpin Gus Fring.937 The West Wing – “What Kind of Day Has it Been” (2000)The West Wing’s biggest cliffhanger came in the season one finale. The episode works its way back from the beginning as we see a Secret Service Agent sense danger from a nearby window at a town hall meeting with the president in attendance. When the episode catches up, gunfire rings out and each member of his senior staff is thrown to the floor. Cut to black as we hear an agent ask over the radio: “Who’s been hit?”It wasn’t until the third season finale of Smallville that Superman fans’ patience was rewarded as viewers saw Clark (Tom Welling) appear naked in the middle of a Kryptonian symbol burned into the field of his family’s farm. “You shall be reborn,” Jor-El can be heard saying to Clark Kent, but he wasn’t the alone one the ending marked a radical turning point for the series.Twin Peaks’ season two finale – the mystery drama’s last episode for 27 years – may have featured the most chilling cliffhanger, but the biggest gasp of the series came at the end of season one as the seemingly untouchable Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) responds to a knock on his hotel room door, only to be gunned down by an unseen assailant.1237 Buffy the Vampire Slayer – The Gift (2001)The 100th episode of Buffy ended with one of the show’s most shocking moments (and no, we’re not talking about the musical episode). Season five concluded with the eponymous ass-kicker sacrificing herself to save the world by jumping into a demonic portal. The episode ends with a slow zoom onto Buffy’s tombstone, which reads: “Beloved sister. Devoted friend. She saved the world. A lot.“It\u0027s easy to forget that True Blood began life as an acclaimed Emmy-nominated drama, and it was a cliffhanger such as this that made it so: Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin) falls asleep with the friendly neighbour dog Dean for company. Upon waking up, Dean is gone and in his place is local barman Sam Merlotte ( Sam Trammell). Turns out he\u0027s a shapeshifter.1437 The Walking Dead – Last Day on Earth (2016)After eight episodes of build-up, the comic book’s deadliest villain, Negan, reared his head in a scene fans were dreading. With the majority of the main cast lined up at his mercy, Negan – in retaliation for the death of one of his gang – decides which one to kill by using “Eeny Meeny Mino Moe”. After selecting his victim, the camera switches POV and Negan bludgeons the unseen character to death leaving fans with a six-month wait before finding out who had met their maker.Lost co-creator Damon Lindelof\u0027s HBO drama was set in a world that saw two per cent of the world’s population disappear into thin air during a tragic event known as the Sudden Departure.

On paper, not so effective but on screen, it equated to one of Lost’s most gasp-inducing cliffhangers. Viewers watched behind their eyes as Michael (Harold Perrineau), desperate to save his son from the mysterious Others, shoots Ana-Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez) and, in a cruel twist, Libby (Cynthia Watros), who has accidentally stumbled upon the whole thing while looking for some blankets.1837 Lost - \u0027Through the Looking Glass – Part 2Whether you love or hate Lost, there’s no denying that the season three finale deployed one of the most breathtaking rug pulls in television history as writers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse revealed a shake-up long in the running: flashbacks featuring a suicidal Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) were, in fact, flashforwards to the future.

In fact, its first episode featured a cliffhanger ending to rival the best of them. With DCI Roz Huntley (Thandie Newton) dead on his floor, her murderer – Forensic Coordinator Tim Ifield (Jason Watkins) – sets about dispatching her body, but as his chainsaw nears her face, Roz’s eyes suddenly open.After season one, Heroes became pretty dreadful television.

Of course many are expecting Game of Thrones to be the frontrunner – and indeed it probably will be – but let’s not forget the eighth and final season had many critics. Its closest competitors in the Drama category include Better Call Saul, This Is Us,\u0026nbspKilling Eve and Pose.Many are also hoping HBO breakout Succession will get a nomination, although it could be it’ll have to settle for recognition in the acting categories (here’s looking at you, Kieran Culkin).It’s worth\u0026nbspnoting that The Handmaid’s Tale, The Crown and Westworld – normally surefire guarantees – are exempt from this year’s round while House of Cards is expected to be shunned due to the fact it botcherd its final season.In the Comedy category, it’s all about Veep, which will no doubt score Julia Louis-Dreyfus a nomination and win in the Leading Actress category.Created with Sketch.The best TV shows of 2019 (so far) Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.As the series develops, it’s clearer than ever that Eve and Villanelle are more similar than they are different. Villanelle’s new vulnerability invites us to question what it is exactly she wants from Polastri. First time around she was toying with a more worthy adversary, but why now? Polastri, by contrast, is frayed around the edges, a terrible wife to her husband Nico (Owen McDonnell) and an even worse intelligence agent to her boss Carolyn Martens (Fiona Shaw). The script is still tight and the jokes are still there, as are Villanelle’s accents, outfits and abrupt killings, but without the will-theywon’t-they energy of the initial plot, it is harder to care.226 Years and YearsYears and Years, then, is favoured by some wit, a cornucopia of fab talent and promising characters. The dominant one as we continue our quest into the 2030s and beyond, will be Vivienne, or Viv, Rook, played brilliantly by Emma Thompson. As a bit of a long-term Emma-sceptic I was actually startled by how good she is in the role of the epitome of everything she has spent her life hating and campaigning against, for Viv is a horrifically nasty businessperson turned populist politician with the most terrifying of views. Viv Rook makes Ann Widdecombe look like, well, Emma Thompson at an Extinction Rebellion sit-in.Joseph is almost never out of shot, whether seen from afar, contemplating a bottle of strong cider in a playground, or in visceral close-up, clutching his doner to his face. There are few actors you could trust with so much screen time, especially with such a pared back and naturalistic script. The fact any of it is remotely watchable is testament to Stephen Graham’s abilities. No man working in Britain today can drink a pint with more pathos.\u0027Good Omens is a hugely enjoyable, imaginative premiere, as close to Pratchett’s vision as anyone could have dared dream. And while the melancholy tone may not be for everyone, fans of the book will surely be sated.\u0027526 Line of Duty (BBC)Plausibility is a spectrum Bodyguard became ridiculous but Line of Duty stays just the right side, and as usual there is more plot in an hour than in whole series of other programmes. As well as being gripping entertainment, Line of Duty has become an effective examination of the relationship between the state and the inidual. The shadowy government forces are elected the organised crime gangs are fuelled by the drug trade. The police are there to save us from ourselves but can only do it if they are subjected to constant scrutiny. It’s exhausting work, policing the police.The footage is glorious, especially the side-on tracking shots of the birds and the hunting, where it is as if the cameramen were able to set up a rail along the ocean. Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough’s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families. Our Planet is more of a greatest-hits parade, with overblown orchestral soundtrack and ponderous intonation. You can’t buy love, even if you pay for David Attenborough.726 Road to Brexit (BBC)The Road to Brexit is easily the best thing to emerge from the whole brexit imbroglio. OK, not much competition, but still... Despite the po-faced title, you realise very quickly that it’s not yet another drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch or yet another attempt by Laura Kuenssberg to explain the inexplicable, or yet another show with the public arguing about stuff they don’t understand. Rather, it’s a very clever, very funny, very \u0027different\u0027 parcel of bollocks to Brexit.While there are plenty of well-turned one-liners, the deeper attraction of Fleabag is schadenfreude. The character is as old as Daisy Buchanan or Lydia Bennett or Scarlett O’Hara. The best compliment to Waller-Bridge and her cast is that they find fresh clothes in which to dress these ancient monsters.It is sometimes remarked that the Troubles in Northern Ireland make for an unpromising backdrop for a sitcom about adolescent kids. Well, yer man’s wrong, as they might say. Derry Girls, returning for a triumphant and exuberant second run, proves that humour, dark or otherwise, can be quarried from even the most unlikely of locations.1026 The Murder of Jill Dando (BBC)A tremendously sad, strange story then, and just as unfathomable today. Dando’s friends, family and the producer and director of the film have made a fitting and balanced tribute to her, something she deserves. I can’t really add anything to that.Home is a rather gentle, unobtrusive variation on the sitcom theme – but one that is built on a quite a bizarre premise. The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV. Not only that, but, after a few moments of blind terrified panic about a suicide bombing, they eventually adopt him like he’s stray cat that’s just wandered in.Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard. There were the allegations, the out-of-court settlements, the arrest, the trial and not-guilty verdict. But there has been nothing like Leaving Neverland” 1326 This Time with Alan Partridge* (BBC1)This Time with Alan Partridge is such a consistently strong creative achievement that fears for the future of Alan Gordon Partridge, may, once again, be allayed. Or Alayned, perhaps.” “Like all the best detective dramas, Shetland engages the audience in the very process of detection. That way we grow intrigued, and we care. And so we find ourselves sitting next to Henshall in his (prominently featured) Volvo V70 estate, sharing his thoughts, intercepting suspects and being driven off the road by unidentified enemies.” “It is both a revisionist – and frequently batty – take on the caped milieu and a winningly knotty mystery. And it surely is the first big-budget superhero tale more indebted to Wes Anderson than to Stan Lee.” “Yet again the Williams have woven a brilliantly tangled web, helped in no small part by Karyo’s quietly arresting central turn” “There’s really been nothing quite like Catastrophe on our screens before, and it deserves its cult status for the quality of everything the production team do, not least the stunning cinematography in this finale. Thanks, all. I’m glad Catastrophe died happy. 1826 Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil (BBC2)“For anyone who’s not altogether sure how British politics turned so suddenly into a rolling dumpster fire from which all exits are blocked then Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil is a necessary public service to explain exactly, and exactly how needlessly, we all came to be here.”“West believes Valjean to be “the greatest hero in all literature”, and he plays the part with all the care and intricacy such a character deserves.” “You see, saint or sinner, prince or pauper, we are all part of one race, the brotherhood of man. And the saintly and regal Danny Dyer stands as its finest ambassador.” 2126 The Secret Life of the Zoo (Channel 4)“This documentary goes behind the shrubbery to show off these animals and their s. The humans are a pretty exotic bunch too, judging by some of the lines they come out with.”2226 A Year of British Murder (Channel 4)“The programme-makers must have done much to win the confidence of so many friends and families, as they went through unspeakable personal pain but they repay that confidence with an understated and powerful film.” “Despite what some feared, the casting of Cumberbatch doesn’t simply flatter Cummings – the A-lister is too good a chameleon for that. But, inevitably, as he scrawls out his campaigning brainwaves on a whiteboard, there is a touch of that deductive maverick Sherlock in his portrayal of this scruffy, balding political saboteur.” 2426 The Paras: Men of War (ITV)“From the outset the production is elevated by its sensitive handling of the men – and the Paratroopers remain exclusively male – involved. These kinds of programmes have a tendency to fetishise toughness, lingering on assault courses and weaponry.”2526 Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland (BBC2)“Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland is a meandering look back over his life, career, and national identity – a “Proustian wander through Scotland”. There’s a lot of mordant chat about the weather, illustrated with shots of dark grey clouds above even darker grey lochs.” “As a slightly cheesy reminder of what we love about Doctor Who – i.e. the fact it gives us an intergalactic eccentric in a big flappy overcoat shouting at Daleks  – this is a New Year treat that more than delivers” As the series develops, it’s clearer than ever that Eve and Villanelle are more similar than they are different. Villanelle’s new vulnerability invites us to question what it is exactly she wants from Polastri. First time around she was toying with a more worthy adversary, but why now? Polastri, by contrast, is frayed around the edges, a terrible wife to her husband Nico (Owen McDonnell) and an even worse intelligence agent to her boss Carolyn Martens (Fiona Shaw). The script is still tight and the jokes are still there, as are Villanelle’s accents, outfits and abrupt killings, but without the will-theywon’t-they energy of the initial plot, it is harder to care.226 Years and YearsYears and Years, then, is favoured by some wit, a cornucopia of fab talent and promising characters. The dominant one as we continue our quest into the 2030s and beyond, will be Vivienne, or Viv, Rook, played brilliantly by Emma Thompson. As a bit of a long-term Emma-sceptic I was actually startled by how good she is in the role of the epitome of everything she has spent her life hating and campaigning against, for Viv is a horrifically nasty businessperson turned populist politician with the most terrifying of views. Viv Rook makes Ann Widdecombe look like, well, Emma Thompson at an Extinction Rebellion sit-in.Joseph is almost never out of shot, whether seen from afar, contemplating a bottle of strong cider in a playground, or in visceral close-up, clutching his doner to his face. There are few actors you could trust with so much screen time, especially with such a pared back and naturalistic script. The fact any of it is remotely watchable is testament to Stephen Graham’s abilities.

Jake went down again and again and she just remained still for him.”Created with Sketch.Underwater Photographer of the Year Show all 45Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Winner: Behaviour and overall winner. I worry that this image will refuel the public\u0027s imbalanced perception of sharks but as an image capturing behaviour it has drama, adrenaline, grace, beauty and finality. That\u0027s a very rare combination in one image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Winner: Wide Angle. The first moment I viewed this image I knew it would be a strong contender. For me it\u0027s the symmetry of the Humpback and the balance between the er and calf. Everything about it is in perfect alignment. The shape of the tail in relation to the four corners of the frame, not to mention the position of the free er and calf. Superb imagery at its very best.  Many congratulations Francois. - Martin Edge (Judge)    Winner: Macro. Fabio’s use of long exposure and panning has turned a classic portrait of a Sepiola into an unforgettable one. The sharp and ghosted images of the bobtail squid balance pleasingly in the frame and combined with the outstretched tentacles give the feeling of the cephalopod lunging for its prey. An innovative and most deserving category winner. - Alex Mustard (Judge) It is hard to imagine what it must have been like to have experienced such a large scale natural spectacle as this but this image, perfectly composed and timed, gets close. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Winner: British Waters Macro. A mantra of mine is \u0027It\u0027s not what it is. It\u0027s where it is\u0027 and this long clawed Squat lobster is in a perfect position to make a memorable image. The author, instead of \u0027blasting\u0027 it with light, has gone in the opposite direction by restricting the strobe into a snooted spotlight in order to illuminate just the features of the lobster and the dainty sea loch anemones. It\u0027s an example of \u0027Isolation lighting\u0027 at its very best. A great deal of uw photographers invest their time in what they want to illuminate. This is an example which in my opinion illustrates features that they do not want to illuminate, hence the punchy black background and the soft delicate hues of dark sand, facial features topped off by the sea loch anemones. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Marine Conservation. The problems of plastic pollution and ghost fishing are both illustrated by this struggling loggerhead turtle. I am happy to learn this inidual was lucky enough to survive this deathtrap thanks to the photographer - Alex Mustard (Judge)What a chin, what a forehead, what a character. This picture has portrait written all over it, and such a fascinating species ideally suited to this close focus wide angle approach. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Portrait. Superb impact from the very first moment it was presented. Perfect composition within the image frame and the understated colours. To top it off the authors comments above say it all... a Smiling Happy Angel\u0027s Face. One of my favourites from the entire competition. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Winner: Up \u0026amp Coming. Beautiful split shot with both a perfect under and over split. A very strong favourite with all the judges and one of the best examples I have seen of this type of image for some time. Just Superb! - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Black \u0026amp White. It must be 11 out of 10 for this groundbreaking image. Conception, interpretation and perseverance coupled with black and white’s ability to concentrate on the key elements. It gets better with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Grey seals are a perennial favourite in UPY as one of the UK\u0027s star wildlife attractions. This upside-down portrait is quirky and cute and easily won the affections of the judging panel. Great to see an overseas photographer coming to the UK to show us how it\u0027s done! - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: Compact. This image was a very popular choice between the panel. Ideal for a split rendition. What makes this a winner for me, not withstanding the double exposure is the sympathetic balance of light \u0026amp colour connected  between the top half and bottom of the image frame. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: British Waters Compact. Does British ing get any better than a fun encounter with a grey seal pup? This youngster’s relaxed and curious face is captured perfectly by Martin, making us all want to be there too. - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: British Waters Living Together. Images tell stories but well thought out and executed ones speak volumes. This is such an example which feeds the eye with tales of the seaside on summer days, lively marine spectacles and excited human interaction. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)1545 Isles of Scilly, UKWinner: British Waters Wide Angle. Photographers often feel competition shots must be packed with new tricks to win. At UPY we always appreciate classic technique when it raises the bar of what has been done before. Rob\u0027s full technicolour wide angle scenic reveals the richness of UK seas with an elegant simplicity that is incredibly challenging to pull off in British conditions. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Wrecks. So simple yet so powerful the additional lighting of the turret and the main er perfectly positioned. This was a very strong category this year with a deserved winner and it\u0027s refreshing to read the acknowledgement to Leigh Bishop\u0027s pioneering work. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) The iconic silhouette of a seahorse is a graphically powerful picture. Here Zarina has raised that to another level with the addition of a red filter to her snooted strobe, reminiscent of a rim-lit animal at sunset. - Alex Mustard (Judge) All the judges found this to be probably the most distressing image to view but its uncompromising message must be seen by as many people as possible. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)As a subject we have seen our fair share of these colourful characters but this one shone through and the eggs almost look as if they have been inidually lit! - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Superb image with a perfect line across the split. Good exposure both above and below the water line and such an ideal subject to cap it all off. Excellent work. - Martin Edge (Judge)This is an excellent example for this category. It takes a tried and trusted angle but completely lifts it by using the fabric. It becomes more than an image a concept, a transition, a rebirth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)2245 Isles of Scilly, UKThis image stood out on many levels. Composition, colour vibrancy and contrast combined with an unusual angle kept us coming back to it and helped it rise in the rankings with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Perfect control of angle, light and focus. This was always up there with all of the judges. A clear favourite just like Nick Park’s genius creations. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I\u0027ve seen many images of eel and shrimp around Indonesia, however you have taken this two steps forward. 1) With your excellent idea to snoot the eye and 2) with your backlight on the shrimp. You can expect many photographers to practice your technique in the months to come. Congratulations for your vision. Very well thought out and executed. - Martin Edge (Judge)    It’s not what you’ve got, it’s what you do with it. The split may have been elusive but well worth the effort. This is a deceptively subtle excellent delivery. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)I have witnessed this behaviour from the surface with its high velocity \u0027testosterone and tonnage\u0027 and I remember thinking how happy I was to be in the boat. To have the presence of mind to time this shot whilst one\u0027s senses are being bombarded is heroic in my view. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) What an amazing moment. From the expression on the face of the unicornfish fleeing for its life, to the hunting pack of sharks, especially the leader with its mouth snapping open that fan out diagonally across this composition. And that is without considering what a great challenge it is to shoot these images of split second action, in the dead of night, underwater. - Alex Mustard (Judge)  There is so much energy in this image. If you look at it long enough you can begin to see just a hint of movement of all the fish around the coral. The colours are realistic and this top down shot works well.  - Martin Edge (Judge)A jaw-dropping wide angle scene with sharks, rays and mountains. A winning combination in the Up \u0026amp Coming category. - Alex Mustard (Judge)3045 Loch Long, Argyll and ButeThis is a subtle image with light and detail that are a delight to explore. The sunset, trees and underwater scene combine to create a wonderful feeling of the place. We particularly like how the composition allows the line of the shore to be continued underwater by the seaweeds.  - Alex Mustard (Judge)Photographing pike underwater is one thing but finding your own underwater artistic stamp is quite another matter. With this particular image the author has done just that! By using a slow shutter speed of 18th sec and a panning technique from right to left gives the impression of movement whilst the pike is pin sharp. - Martin Edge (Judge)Arthur’s image scores with both its foreground and background. The deadman’s fingers soft coral make an attractive foreground, enhanced by the crab sheltering within, and the striking sunbeams create beauty and atmosphere in the background. I also love the feeling of depth created by the legs of the jetty reaching up for the surface. - Alex Mustard (Judge)In recent UPY competitions UK macro images have lacked their overseas counterpart\u0027s flair and imagination but this magnificent shot raises the bar for everyone else to follow. World class from the UK at last. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Memorable photographs of people underwater are deceptively difficult and require both the photographer and model to be at the top of their game. The simplicity of the composition works to highlight the delicious details in the girl\u0027s pose. - Alex Mustard (Judge) This is a timeless scene that communicates a detailed story. The cavern, the silversides sheltering, the tarpon hunting and the er kneeling reverentially, taking it all in. It is a fabulous use of black and white to tell this story of shadows and light. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Sometimes it is the small detail which contributes so much. The white of the eye and the row of teeth in what could be construed as a smile convey mischief and menace in equal measures. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Once again Tobias you have succeeded in capturing one of the most photographed wrecks in the Red Sea and photographing it in a completely different way. You push the boundaries of wreck photography and I congratulate you for your vision and forward thinking of new ideas. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Perfect composition and framed against the stark black background. However it\u0027s the contrast of white on black which attracts the eye again and again every time this particular image popped up to greet us. The colour of the nudibranch was sufficiently bright enough to raise our senses again and again as it proceeded through the competition.  The soft delicate treatment of the snooted flash is also very well managed. - Martin Edge (Judge)    This shot puts you right in the picture and records a special encounter in a very special place. Every element contributes and the lucky or intended curve of the split creates great spatial depth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Symmetry, graphic simplicity and for once in UK waters a black background which contributes to a positive outer worldly delivery. A mould breaker. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I see and judge many images of the sockeye salmon but this is one of the best. The alignment of the two salmon not to mention the composition within the frame.  The surgy peak of the action is in perfect symmetry with the window which provides the viewer with topside influences of the trees against a vivid blue sky. There is so much image depth in this example. - Martin Edge (Judge)    Such a delicate image yet so full of emotion. There are times when there are no more words needed. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)UPY loves seahorse photos! Especially when they capture a fleeting behaviour, such as this. But we hadn\u0027t realised during judging that this was a new species of seahorse, nor did with know the incredible backstory behind this picture, we just loved the moment. - Alex Mustard (Judge)  Whether or not you like fashion photography underwater you would be hard pressed to see a more beautiful combination of complimentary colours and a very elegant pose. A very well executed image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)A portrait must leave you in no doubt. Simple lighting, illuminating all that is needed, captures this character. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Winner: Behaviour and overall winner. I worry that this image will refuel the public\u0027s imbalanced perception of sharks but as an image capturing behaviour it has drama, adrenaline, grace, beauty and finality. That\u0027s a very rare combination in one image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Winner: Wide Angle. The first moment I viewed this image I knew it would be a strong contender. For me it\u0027s the symmetry of the Humpback and the balance between the er and calf. Everything about it is in perfect alignment. The shape of the tail in relation to the four corners of the frame, not to mention the position of the free er and calf. Superb imagery at its very best.  Many congratulations Francois. - Martin Edge (Judge)    Winner: Macro. Fabio’s use of long exposure and panning has turned a classic portrait of a Sepiola into an unforgettable one. The sharp and ghosted images of the bobtail squid balance pleasingly in the frame and combined with the outstretched tentacles give the feeling of the cephalopod lunging for its prey. An innovative and most deserving category winner. - Alex Mustard (Judge) It is hard to imagine what it must have been like to have experienced such a large scale natural spectacle as this but this image, perfectly composed and timed, gets close. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Winner: British Waters Macro. A mantra of mine is \u0027It\u0027s not what it is. It\u0027s where it is\u0027 and this long clawed Squat lobster is in a perfect position to make a memorable image. The author, instead of \u0027blasting\u0027 it with light, has gone in the opposite direction by restricting the strobe into a snooted spotlight in order to illuminate just the features of the lobster and the dainty sea loch anemones. It\u0027s an example of \u0027Isolation lighting\u0027 at its very best. A great deal of uw photographers invest their time in what they want to illuminate. This is an example which in my opinion illustrates features that they do not want to illuminate, hence the punchy black background and the soft delicate hues of dark sand, facial features topped off by the sea loch anemones. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Marine Conservation. The problems of plastic pollution and ghost fishing are both illustrated by this struggling loggerhead turtle. I am happy to learn this inidual was lucky enough to survive this deathtrap thanks to the photographer - Alex Mustard (Judge)What a chin, what a forehead, what a character. This picture has portrait written all over it, and such a fascinating species ideally suited to this close focus wide angle approach. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Portrait. Superb impact from the very first moment it was presented. Perfect composition within the image frame and the understated colours. To top it off the authors comments above say it all... a Smiling Happy Angel\u0027s Face. One of my favourites from the entire competition. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Winner: Up \u0026amp Coming. Beautiful split shot with both a perfect under and over split. A very strong favourite with all the judges and one of the best examples I have seen of this type of image for some time. Just Superb! - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Black \u0026amp White. It must be 11 out of 10 for this groundbreaking image. Conception, interpretation and perseverance coupled with black and white’s ability to concentrate on the key elements. It gets better with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Grey seals are a perennial favourite in UPY as one of the UK\u0027s star wildlife attractions. This upside-down portrait is quirky and cute and easily won the affections of the judging panel. Great to see an overseas photographer coming to the UK to show us how it\u0027s done! - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: Compact. This image was a very popular choice between the panel. Ideal for a split rendition. What makes this a winner for me, not withstanding the double exposure is the sympathetic balance of light \u0026amp colour connected  between the top half and bottom of the image frame. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: British Waters Compact. Does British ing get any better than a fun encounter with a grey seal pup? This youngster’s relaxed and curious face is captured perfectly by Martin, making us all want to be there too. - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: British Waters Living Together. Images tell stories but well thought out and executed ones speak volumes. This is such an example which feeds the eye with tales of the seaside on summer days, lively marine spectacles and excited human interaction. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)1545 Isles of Scilly, UKWinner: British Waters Wide Angle. Photographers often feel competition shots must be packed with new tricks to win. At UPY we always appreciate classic technique when it raises the bar of what has been done before. Rob\u0027s full technicolour wide angle scenic reveals the richness of UK seas with an elegant simplicity that is incredibly challenging to pull off in British conditions. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Wrecks. So simple yet so powerful the additional lighting of the turret and the main er perfectly positioned. This was a very strong category this year with a deserved winner and it\u0027s refreshing to read the acknowledgement to Leigh Bishop\u0027s pioneering work. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) The iconic silhouette of a seahorse is a graphically powerful picture.

Simple lighting, illuminating all that is needed, captures this character. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)The footage was released on Thursday by Ningaloo Marine Interactions, the tour company which Mr Wilton works for.The hero himself suggested it was all in a day’s work.First known nursery for giant manta rays discovered in Gulf of Mexico“I’m often guiding snorkellers in the area and it’s as if she recognised me and was trusting me to help her,” he said.“She got closer and closer and then started unfurling to present the eye to me. I knew we had to get the hooks out or she would have been in big trouble. I went for a few es down to see how she’d react to me being close to her.”When the animal stayed calm, he approached and took out the hooks.The manta stayed completely still in the water,” he said.“It’s pretty incredible behaviour if this is what happened,” said David Boyle, lecturer in marine biology at the University of Plymouth. “It’s not uncommon for animals – generally mammals – to interact with ers but for one in distress to seek out assistance would be novel indeed.”Manta rays are believed to be some of the most intelligent creatures in the ocean. Unlike stingrays, they don’t have an external spike and are generally harmless to humans.Experts believe the injured eye would have become infected, leading to blindness and possible death.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In the past, reconnaissance planes such as the U-2 and\u0026nbspF-117 have been developed and flown from there.It is likely that it does much the same now, though anything giving any details on current operations is entirely secret.US military ‘ready’ to stop alien-hunters raiding Area 51That secretiveness has led to suggestions that Area 51 is actually focused on alien operations, either instead of or in addition to what has been more officially revealed.Those conspiracy theories encompass a wide variety of possible uses: some say the base is storage for crashed UFOs, others suggest it might serve as a home for aliens that have made it to Earth. Others still suggest it is being used for technology that is secret though not necessarily alien, such as time travel or teleportation technology.The base sits in a remote part of Nevada. The nearest large city is Nevada, but it’s not very near – nothing much is, since it is located deep in the desert.Around Area 51 are a series of alien-themed attractions. It’s one of those where the people supposedly participating in the event are told to meet, at the “Alien Center” that’s just one of the tourist attractions accessible from the nearby highway.As you’d expect from a top-secret government facility, nobody really knows what’s going on. And as you’d also expect, trying to find out is a difficult and dangerous endeavour.If you don’t “storm” Area 51, but instead try and walk in, you won’t get very far.The area is rigged up with a variety of motion sensors and CCTV cameras, which immediately trigger a response from very real armed guards. As numerous signs around the base make clear, those guards are allowed to use deadly force to repel people.Flying over the base is impossible, too, since it and the area around it is completely off-limits to civilian and even military aircraft.In short, it stressed that those same deadly measures will be used against anyone trying to enter.“The US Air Force always stands ready to protect America and its assets.”Most likely not. The event was created satirically, as can be seen in all of the discussion surrounding it, including the event’s description, which makes reference to a manga series.“We will all meet up at the Area 51 Alien Center tourist attraction and coordinate our entry,” it reads.\u0026nbsp”If we naruto run, we can move faster than their bullets. Lets see them aliens.”But there is of course no way of knowing what will actually happen when 20 September comes around. Plenty of things, especially in recent years, have been created as jokes and then come true, and with a million people committing to head to the base it would only take a tiny proportion of those people to form a fairly significant protest.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At least they have the Rugby World Cup... for the moment.”The Welsh town’s arduous, winding hill street runs past the medieval Harlech Castle, a Unesco World Heritage site, and is lined with a caravan park, a laundry service, a shop and a restaurant, as well as several houses.Glyn Roberts, who owns the Castle Cottage restaurant, said: “We didn’t realise it was the steepest street in the world, but it is very steep and it’s a good heart-starter walking up and down the hill.“It’s a lovely part of the world, and to have this extra accolade can do nothing but good for the town and bring more people in.”For a street to qualify for the title of the world’s steepest it must be a public thoroughfare, fully paved and contain buildings running alongside it. The record measurement is based on the highest gradient over a 10m section of road.Craig Glenday, Guinness World Records, editor-in-chief said: “The local community in Harlech has shown sheer willpower in their quest to earn Ffordd Pen Llech the title.“We know the anticipation has been building for quite some time now, and I’m pleased to see the outcome has brought such joy to the residents.“I hope Harlech enjoys the celebrations and that the new title brings lots of people to the beautiful town\u0026nbspto experience the world’s steepest street for themselves.”Additional reporting by PAOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We already have all the evidence we need. To gamble you should be an adult, so the minimum age for all gambling products should be 18 - it\u0027s as simple as that.And former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said: There is no need for a consultation about the age limit. Frankly, I think we should just get on with it. There\u0027s enough evidence out there.Ms Davies told the Commons said that the current minimum age of 16 for taking part in lotteries was one of very few limits to be set below the widely recognised threshold of 18 for taking on adult rights and responsibilities.National Lottery games (PA)She said the consultation would consider the options of keeping the age limit at 16, imposing an outright ban on playing any National Lottery game below 18 or a differentiated approach that would increase the minimum age only for instant-win scratchcards and online games.My initial view based on the evidence reviewed so far, is that such a split could be the best approach, she told MPs. This takes into account that the risk of harm associated with playing the National Lottery is at the lowest of any form of gambling.But we do know the risk of harm is slightly higher for instant-win games than it is for draw-based games such as Lotto.Therefore, I am keen to seek further evidence in this area and hear what others think, given that the National Lottery matters so much to so many people.Mr Watson said:  There are 450,000 children gambling every week in our country. It is a number that has quadrupled in recent years.For many young people, scratchcards are a gateway to gambling from the age of 16. We don\u0027t think that\u0027s right, particularly when we are struggling with an epidemic of gambling addiction across the country.Ms Davies also announced plans to increase from £400,000 to £500,000 the maximum prize in draws run by society lotteries for good causes like sports clubs, hospitals and charities.The good-cause lotteries’ annual sales limit will also be increased\u0026nbspto £50 million.Ms Davies said she expected legislation on the lottery age-limit\u0026nbspin the autumn, in order to have a clear position in place before the bidding process for the next National Lottery licence gets under way in 2020.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The governor of the Bank of England said businesses expect they will have to cut jobs if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, as their sales go down and costs go up.There are signs the UK’s looming departure is already having an impact on hiring. Large recruitment company Hays said earlier on Tuesday that its net fees in the UK and Ireland were down 2 per cent between April and June, pulled down by a 6 per cent fall in fees for private sector placements.Evidence of a reduction in hiring and fewer vacancies\u0026nbspunderpin a less rosy outlook for wages from the National Institute of\u0026nbspEconomic\u0026nbspand Social Research (NIESR). After the official data came out, NIESR\u0026nbspforecast that growth in regular pay will stabilise at around 3.5 per cent in the third quarter.Arno Hantzsche, senior economist at NIESR, said: “Economic and political uncertainty pose a considerable risk to hiring activity and, according to our new estimates, prevent a further acceleration of earnings growth in the months ahead.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The world needs more Europe. I believe Europe should have a stronger and more united voice in the world and it needs to act fast.New EU commission cabinet will be half women, says Juncker replacementUrsula von der Leyen: the German minister set to run the EUThat is why we must have the courage to take foreign policy decisions by qualified majority and to stand united behind them.The change would ensure that a single member state or small group of states could not block decisions on the world stage.The new Commission president might struggle to get the change through, however, because it has long been opposed by smaller member states who worry the they would be outvoted on issues they disagree with the majority.Qualified majority voting requires 55 per cent of member states to agree to a policy, and also stipulates that\u0026nbspthey represent 65 per cent of the EU\u0027s population.Ms Von der Leyen faces a confirmation vote by MEPs on Tuesday evening, where they will decide whether or not to approve leaders\u0027 pick as the new Commission president.The European Commission is the EU\u0027s executive branch, and has the sole power to bring forward legislation. Ms Von der Leyen would be its political leadership, replacing Jean-Claude Juncker.In her speech the German defence minister proposed giving the European Parliament the power of legislative initiative - effectively the ability to propose laws.\u0026nbspShe also ran through a series of other policies designed to win over MEPs in tonight\u0027s vote.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A motorist drives past a destroyed house after a large earthquake that hit Surigao City, in the southern island of Mindanao, Philippines French Gendarmes remove fences next to a burning portable toilet during clashes with protesters on the Champs Elysees avenue after the traditional Bastille Day military parade in Paris, FranceA recortador jumps over a bull during a contest in a bullring at the San Fermin festival in Pamplona, SpainJapan\u0027s Megumu Yoshida and Yukiko Inui compete in the duet technical artistic swimming event during the 2019 World Championships at Yeomju Gymnasium in GwangjuHot air balloons fly over the city of Igualada during an early flight as part of the European Balloon Festival in Igualada, Spain.

There’s no shame for me. There’s no shame for any of us,\u0027 says Mounir BaatourClick to followThe IndependentMounir Baatour’s office is cool, the steady thrum of the air conditioner offering a welcome break from the blistering summer heat that has descended upon Tunis. Past noon, little moves outside. The streets are empty and even the city’s ubiquitous cat population has slinked off to the shadows.Despite the temperature, Baatour, the first openly gay man to run for president in a Muslim country, remains focused upon the task ahead.The road leading to the November poll is unlikely to offer a smooth ride. Homosexuality itself isn’t illegal in Tunisia. However, practising it is. This distinction has allowed Baatour, a lawyer, to register the pressure group\u0026nbspShams. Along with others, the group campaigns for a repeal of the colonial French\u0026nbsplaw\u0026nbspproscribing sodomy.Likewise, legal\u0026nbsprestrictions criminalising\u0026nbsp”outrages against public decency” are often used to persecute the country’s LGBT+ population – these\u0026nbspremain firmly with the sights of Baatour and other rights campaigners. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOn top of this, the police force appears eager to exploit existing edicts allowing, for instance,\u0026nbspenforced anal examinations to be used as evidence of sexuality. This is buttressed by a judiciary and political establishment long practised in the art of looking the other way.Created with Sketch.Best photos from Pride 2019 around the world Show all 45Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In February, a young man from the coastal city of Sfax received an eight month\u0026nbspsentence for engaging in homosexual acts after reporting being raped by two other men. Other stories of official abuse are legion. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“I am openly gay,”\u0026nbspBaatour\u0026nbspsays. “I came out 20 years ago. I was jailed for three months for sodomy in 2013. There’s no shame for me. There’s no shame for any of us.”Baatour, his association and his relatively fringe Liberal party are children of Tunisia’s revolution. In the years immediately following 2011, a number of gay rights groups emerged, led by Baatour’s own Shams, calling for a repeal of\u0026nbspanti-homosexual laws.However, even here, Shams’ tactics have given rise to ision, with the Tunisian Coalition for LGBT Rights issuing a statement\u0026nbsplast year distancing themselves from Shams and its president, a schism Baatour attributes to his openness to potentially normalising relations with Israel, a suggestion considered anathema to many on Tunisia’s left.Perhaps ironically, the same period during which many of these groups arose also witnessed an explosion in Islamism across Tunisia, with the moderate Islamist Ennahda party vying with the radical\u0026nbspAnsar al-Sharia\u0026nbspfor the political souls of Tunisia’s religious majority.When you put gay people in jail for three years, what, do they come out straight? No\u0026nbspAnsar\u0026nbspal-Sharia was outlawed in 2013, and support for Ennahda appears to have ebbed since the groundswell of popular support that saw them achieve a plurality vote in the country’s first free elections in 2011.But across many sections of Tunisian society, values typically bend towards the traditional. In August, conservative demonstrators of both genders took to the street to protest a\u0026nbsppresidentially mandated report\u0026nbspurging greater inidual freedoms and equality across the genders. \u0026nbspAs far as homosexuality is concerned, those conservative sentiments cut deeper. A June 2019 survey by the polling institute Arab Barometer reported that just 7 per cent of Tunisians condoned homosexuality. It’s a sentiment reflected within the rhetoric of some of Baatour’s populist rivals for the presidency. Law professor Kais Saied\u0026nbspis\u0026nbspa close second in the polls – he has\u0026nbspsuggested\u0026nbspthat encouraging the spread of homosexuality within the country is a foreign plot. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspAlleged rape victim imprisoned for homosexual acts by Tunisian court“I think we need to have a debate about homosexuality in Tunisia,” says Baatour, who identifies as Muslim but doesn’t practise.“I’m not talking about promoting homosexuality, just about decriminalising it. Gay people don’t do anyone any harm. They should be free to do what they want with their bodies. If, as Kais Saied has said, homosexuality is a sickness, then – even if I accept that – I have to ask, why are you putting sick people in jail?“When you put gay people in jail for three years, what, do they come out straight? No. So they must return to jail for a further three years and then for the rest of their lives.”Though what Baatour is proposing might seem radical, it is not without precedent. In arguing his case, Baatour points to the country’s first post-independence president, Habib Bourguiba, who in 1956 introduced landmark laws outlawing polygamy and introducing a code of women’s rights that stands to this day.LGBT activists arrested at unauthorised pride march in Cuba“All of that at the time was controversial, a lot of people said it was against Islam. However, Bourguiba had the political will to impose it. In 1956, Tunisia was more conservative than it is now, but people came to accept it and still do.” \u0026nbspHowever, while accepting that much of the attention on him focuses upon his stance on LGBT+ rights, Baatour is keen to stress that his candidacy is about more.He wants to address many of Tunisia’s underlying ills, from the state enterprises that continue to haemorrhage money, to the vast scale of the country’s informal economy, to the environment, which remains a priority.But above all, he says, is his commitment to promoting civil liberties and the rights of the inidual.Whether or not he is successful remains to be seen. However, for Baatour, the fight alone is worthwhile. If anything, he says, his campaign forces the other candidates to address the lack of progress on civil liberties and inidual rights within Tunisia.Baatour leans forward, “I will place this at the very heart of my campaign.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Most of them answered the question honestly but had a decent dig at each other as they went.All in all, a very entertaining debate filled with fun # and some news too.In just a week’s time we will know which of these two men will be your next Prime Minister.Thanks to everyone for watching, and our fantastic readers for sending in their questions.We’ll have all the reaction from outside Sun Towers to the debate coming up.And on talkRADIO Ross Kempsell will have all the analysis of the last hour’s debate.And now it’s time for our quick-fire round of questions, to finish off the debate.# climate change target of net zero emissions by  keep it  Boris: YesHunt:Yes# continue to freeze fuel duty, like the last  years Boris: Not making any more spending commitments. I would love to. Not a no! I want to. Hunt: I agree with Boris# Is Jeremy Corbyn personally anti-semitic Hunt: Unfortunately, he may be .Boris: I think by condoning anti-Antisemitism in the way he does, he is effectively culpable of that vice.# when was the last time you cried Hunt: That’s a trick question!Boris: When I came out of Parliament to find my bike had been nicked. I had for all of my mayoral career, a beautul bike. It was never nicked during all my time, I used to ride it everywhere.

One Lord was described as a “notorious bullying pervert” by a Westminster worker.The verdict was that the prevailing culture and behaviour in the House of Lords “has not been conducive to an open and supportive culture to ensure all those working there are treated with dignity and respect”.Worse, the report concluded those staff on the receiving end of bullying and harassment generally did not complain because they thought nothing would change, or feared reprisal.Clearly, the House of Lords has issues. But it’s nowhere near as bad as the House of Commons. The second report, by Gemma White QC into inappropriate conduct in Westminster, concluded MPs’ staff face “unacceptable risk of bullying and harassment”.It found sexual harassment in Parliament is seen by young staff as a “necessary evil”they want to progress. Witnesses describe speaking out against any abuse as “career suicide”.Even though both reports state only a small minority of MPs or Lords behave in unacceptable ways, this has been tolerated for too long and shining a light on it will bring about change.What’s clear to me, both from reading the report and working at the House of Lords, is that this is a generational issue. The House of Lords is full of older people stuck in a time warp.Many of them live in a world where it’s still acceptable for women — often females of a lower status to them — to be patted on the bottom or on the head.The House of Lords can feel a bit like a boys’ boarding school, or Hogwarts. It’s populated predominantly by old white men, many of whom lead a le insulated from the real world.That said, the worst behaviour I witness is usually in the library, where Lords often retire after lunch and which rings with the sound of ear-deafening snoring and, I am sorry to say, farting.The only time I’ve ever seen anyone being actively rude was when one Lord commanded a member of canteen staff to get him a bag of crisps. He was so close he could have reached out and got it himself.I’ve also been on the receiving end of the odd condescending comment, such as when a Lord looked me up and down and said: “You’re dressed rather casually.” I was wearing Stella McCartney trousers at the time, so not exactly jeans.Crucially, though, I wasn’t wearing a dress. So I looked him up and down and said: “Dressing casually is better than dressing badly” — and that was the end of that.It must be horrible to work in an organisation where you feel inferior and can’t speak your mind — and,you do, people either shrug or shut you down. The report about the House of Lords suggested it should be mandatory for all employees to go on a “how to value people” course. Some people might see it as unnecessary — but we send West Ham staff on them and they are good.But that’s not the only change required. There’s neither enough women, nor cultural ersity. The only way that will change is by electing a more erse chamber.In the meantime, I hope this report does not diminish, in people’s minds, the important legislation work the House of Lords does and the role it plays in holding the Commons to account. I hope these reports don’t stop people from remembering what an important institution it is.As Spider-Man said: “With great power comes great responsibility” — and as one who sits in the House of Lords, I know I am not the only one who feels it is a great responsibility.BIG news. MPs have voted to make same-sex marriage legal in Northern Ireland.By a massive margin of  to , the House of Commons backed an amendment demanding the province be brought into line with the rest of the country by October  . . . unless Stormont s and decides otherwise.

Those results came after MPs hijacked a Government Bill in a bid to force through the changes.The DUP has accused them of abusing the impasse at Stormont to impose Westminster’s will. So not everyone is happy with the news.But it’s a big “Hooray!” from me that this kind of right-minded thinking now applies to the whole UK.

Leaving your bride-to-be for the wedding planner is NOT a good look.The only consolation – though Donna might not see it quite yet – is that she is almost certainly better off without him.WHEN I heard a Hull mum had called two of her children Jackdaniel and Tiamarie, all I could think was, “poor kids”.But mum Sarah Mennell insists they aren’t named after booze, as she prefers tea.

Pundits give him an agonising  days from next Tuesday to honour that promise.In fact, we will know in an instantBrexit — and Boris — will live or die.The moment will come, perhaps on his first day, as he names the man or woman to prise the Treasury from the cold, dead hands of Chancellor Philip Hammond.If Boris picks Sajid Javid, Matt Hancock or Liz Truss — or anyone  who voted Remain — .million Brits can kiss goodbye to their dream of leaving the European Union.We will end up with a just another bodged version of Theresa May’s BRINO sell-out — Brexit in Name Only. It will be the beginning and the end of King BoJo the First.There will be no second chances. The next Chancellor of the Exchequer must be a proven Brexiteer in word and deedBoris has a chance of surviving his  days.The Treasury is the most powerful and implacable enemy of Brexit. “The new Chancellor needs three key qualities,” says a source close to Boris.“They must have a Brexit pedigree, absolute loyalty to Boris and the intellectual self-confidence to take on Whitehall and the Treasury.”Qualities such as these are scarce in the present Cabinet. The final choice is likely to surprise everyone, especially Remainers.Some names mentioned to me would, to say the least, offer a bracing challenge to pro-EU establishment fanatics who spent the past three years sabotaging the  referendum.Unless the new Chancellor takes them head-on, those forces will crush both Boris and Brexit. Observers have identied the tank traps and sniper nests facing the new PM.He is up against a Remain-dominated Parliament aided by slippery Speaker Bercow, an army of civil service mandarins skilled in the machinery of government and covering fire from BBC propagandists.In the face of such overwhelming odds, a pro-Leave PM is surely doomed to fail. Not so. Despite appearances, Boris has a plan.He will fly immediately to Brussels with a genuine bid to reopen Theresa May’s botched withdrawal agreement.He would seek a clear path out of the EU customs union, single market and European Court jurisdiction, plus a sensible solution to the Northern Ireland border issue.The alternative will be for Britain to leave the EU on October  with No Deal. Unless much has changed, Brussels will say: “Non!” Boris will announce he has no option but to call a snap “No Deal” election.Remainers are appalled at the idea, and for good reason. Poll after poll suggests No Deal Boris would win with an outright majority — at their expense.The public is sick to the back teeth with Theresa May’s dreary defeatism and Brussels’ bullying. Remain voters want this sorted, too.Elections are always risky. But a Tory Party still dithering and paralysed on the biggest issue of the age is the greatest risk of all. Right now, the omens are promising. Labour is committing ritual suicide, shedding voters in droves.Millions of Tory defectors would flock back to a party committed to a final, irreversible Brexit taking us past the October  dead-line and sucking support from Nigel Farage and his Brexit Party.In the intervening weeks, a Boris regime could recruit voters abandoned by both major parties over crime, low pay, high taxes and housing.According to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, blue- collar voters on less than £, a year, are “up for grabs like never before”.If Boris Johnson has one proven gt, it is for winning against the odds.

I told Neil to look around and not to step outit didnt look good. He said he wouldnt.In the end, Armstrong didnt have to heed his grans warning.He stepped on to the lunar surface, remarking: Thats one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind, before ing safely to Earth days later.He died in August , aged .The Apollo Guidance Computerplayed a key role in the success of the Moon landing, providing interfaces for guidance, navigation and spacecraft control.Back in the late s, it was a state-of-the-art device. But despite weighing more than kg, the computer was actually less powerful than a calculator.Two popular calculators, used by maths and science students in their exams, were found to be  and  times faster than the AGC in terms of processing speed.They also had far more RAM , the Independent reports.But despite the AGCs simplicity, it didnt mal once during the mission.Armstrong and Aldrin left a range of items on the Moon before heading back to our planet.These included a tiny silicon disk, about the size of a -cent piece, containing messages of peace from  leaders across the world - including the Queen.Her Majestys message read: On behalf of the British people I salute the skill and courage which have brought man to the Moon. May this endeavour increase the knowledge and wellbeing of mankind.Other souvenirs left behind on the lunar surface included the American flag, a small replica of an olive branch, and a plaque proclaiming Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon. July , A.D. We came in peace for all mankind.The astronauts ed to Earth with some Moon souvenirs - including rocks, dust and other lunar samples, which have since been studied by scientists across the globe.They also brought back their bags of faeces.After landing back on Earth, Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins - who flew the command module in lunar orbit during the mission - were placed in quarantine.They were examined by scientists until it was sure they wouldnt contaminate the planet.The astronauts were actually seconds away from never making it home after one of the ships most important switches broke - until a felt-tip pen saved the day.The circuit breaker that activated the ascent engine, getting the group off the Moon, broke during the mission, according to Jonathan Mayos book Titanic: Minute By Minute.Facing seemingly certain death, Aldrin thought outside the box and decided to use the pen to flick the switch instead. Fortunately for him and the rest of the crew, it worked.There were plans to abandon the astronauts on the Moonthings didnt go as planned.A speech, titled In the Event of Moon Disaster, was prepared for then-US President Richard Nixon to read on TV in case Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins became stranded.If this had happened, Mission Control would have stopped communicating with the trio and Nixon would have rang each of their partners to break the news, Sky reports.He would have then made his speech, including the words: These brave men, Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin, know that there is no hope for their recovery.But they also know that there is hope for mankind in their sacrice.The speech, which was reportedly penned by White House speechwriter Bill Safire on July , , never had to be read out after the mission succeeded.The Moons smell would have likely been the last thing on Armstrongs mind as he stepped out on to it - but astronauts have since compared the powerful scent to gunpowder.Harrison Jack Schmitt, who walked on the lunar surface during the Apollo  mission, claimed that everyones instant impression of the smell was that of spent gunpowder.He continued: Not that it was metallic or acrid. Spent gunpowder smell probably was much more implanted in our memories than other comparable odours.It has been claimed that the mysterious smell may be the result of the astronauts nasal membranes reacting to the electrically-charged dust on the Moon.Despite all the evidence to the contrary, some people still think the Moon landing was fake.In , seven years after the historic spaceflight, an American man called Bill Kaysing published a pamphlet claiming that the landing had been staged by NASA in a studio.The document, called We Never Went to the Moon: America’s Thirty Billion Dollar Swindle, sparked a range of conspiracy theories that are still very much alive today.Kaysing, who died in  aged , cited the lack of stars in photos, the flag waving and shadows at dferent angles as evidence for his conspiracy.Although the theories have been debunked by many experts, a shocking one in six Brits recently agreed with the statement: The Moon landings were staged.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We think there is still a closing, but small, window to keep the deal alive.In a joint statement issued ahead of the meeting, Britain, France and Germany reiterated their support, but added that all stakeholders should pause and consider the possible consequences of their actions.Speaking ahead of Mondays meeting, Mr Hunt said: The Middle East is already one of the most unstable regions in the world, butthe dferent parties were armed with nuclear weapons it would represent an existential threat to mankind.Neighbouring Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Egypt would likely want to arm themselves with nuclear weapons, with the potential to obliterate entire cities, experts have warned.Recent statements from Saudi Arabia has made it clear the country would not accept a nuclear-armed Iran.Iran, meanwhile, has begun exceeding limits on uranium enrichment agreed in the  deal amid frustration in Tehran at theof crippling US economic sanctions.While the Europeans say they still support the agreement - which lted sanctions infor Iran curbing its nuclear programme - in practice they have found it dficult to get round the US measures.The nuclear agreement, agreed upon in , involved a pledge from Iran to reduce its uranium enrichment programme infor a loosening of economic sanctions.The  deal caps Iran’s levels of uranium enriched to . per cent purity—called “low-enriched uranium”.This type of uranium is only suitable for producing fuel for nuclear power reactors—at  kilograms.Highly enriched uranium is needed to produce a nuclear weapon.Obtaining fissile material - such as uranium and plutonium - is widely regarded as the most dficult task in building nuclear weapons.Iran would need , kilograms of low-enriched uranium to make the core of one bomb.This would need to be further enriched, to  per cent purity, using centruges until it had about  kilograms of what is called “highly enriched uranium.”Experts estimate that it would take about a year for Tehran to enrich enough weapons-grade uranium for a nuclear bomb.This time frame has been backed up by a May  US Congressional Research Report.However other weapons experts have been more hesitant to say Iran is building a nuclear weapon geared to attack.Ky Davenport, the director of nonproleration policy at the Arms Control Association, told Foreign Policy in July: “This is not a dash to a nuclear bomb ... It is a calculated move designed to gain leverage in negotiations with the Europeans, Russia, and China on sanctions relief.”President Trump last year pulled the US out of the agreement - claiming Tehran was violating its obligations and suggesting the deal was too soft.He also threatened to impose the highest level of economic sanction against Iran.The other parties criticised Mr Trumps decision and said they remained committed to the deal.The United States has assessed that Tehran possesses the technological and industrial capacity toBut Iran has not yet mastered all of the necessary technologies for building such weapons.Whether Iran has a viable design for a nuclear weapon is unclear.Although Iran claims that its nuclear program is exclusively for peaceful purposes, the programLast week, a Royal Navy warship intervened to drive off Iranian patrol boats after they approached a British tanker as it sailed through the Strait of Hormuz.It prompted fears the Iranians were trying to seize a UK ship in retaliation for the detention of the Grace .It was the latest in a series of incidents in the region prompting fears of a slide into all out conflict.In recent weeks, the US has sent thousands of troops, an aircraft carrier, nuclear-capable B- bombers and advanced fighter jets to the Middle East.Iran has also pledged to breach the agreement until it receives the sanctions relief it says it is owed.The deal was an agreement between the Islamic Republic and a group of world powers aimed at scrapping the Middle Eastern countrys nuclear weapons programme.It saw Iran agree to eliminate its stockpile of medium-enriched uranium by  per cent.Enriched uranium is a critical component for making nuclear weapons and in nuclear power stations and by curbing the amount Iran produce is a way to curb the number of weapons produced.As part of the agreement, Iran also agreed to only enrich their uranium up to . per cent over the next  years and they agreed to reduce their gas centruges for  years.Gas centruges are used to separate dferent types of uranium which allows specic types to then be used to manufacture nuclear weapons or generators.Iranian nuclear facilities were limited to a single facility with only first-generation centruges for  years and other nuclear facilities had to be converted into other use.In addition, they were barred from building any more heavy-water faculties - a type of nuclear reactor which uses heavy wateras a coolant to maintain temperatures in the reactor.Also under the agreement, the International Atomic Energy Agency was granted regular access to all Iranian nuclear facilities to ensure Iran maintains the deal.If Iran abided by the deal it was promised relief from the US, European Union, and the United Nations Security Council on all nuclear-related economic sanctions.The agreement was reached on July , , and the world powers signed it in Vienna.The Iran nuclear deal was an agreement between the Islamic Republic and a group of world powers aimed at scrapping the Middle Eastern countrys nuclear weapons programme.The deal saw Iran agree to eliminate its stockpile of medium-enriched uranium by  per cent.Enriched uranium is a critical component for making nuclear weapons and in nuclear power stations and by curbing the amount Iran produce is a way to curb the number of weapons produced.As part of the agreement, Iran also agreed to only enrich their uranium up to . per cent over the next  years and they agreed to reduce their gas centruges for  years.Gas centruges are used to separate dferent types of uranium which allows specic types to then be used to manufacture nuclear weapons or generators.Iranian nuclear facilities were limited to a single facility with only first-generation centruges for  years and other nuclear facilities had to be converted into other use.In addition, they were barred from building any more heavy-water faculties -

What must the person on the mat behind me be seeing of my nether regions  This is the stuff of nightmares for many, but for naturists, the ultimate summer getaway.Welcome to the th annual NudeFest, the “Glastonbury of the naturist calendar”, where  naturists descend on Somerset for a week-long celebration of nakedness.And this year I’ve somehow ended up being a punter. No age limit, families welcome — clothes optional.First rule of Nudefest, don’t say “nudist”, the correct term is “naturist”. Second rule, keep your gaze at eye level.Third, don’t get any funny ideas — this £-a-night experience is a family show.Being naked doesn’t sit easy with me. I didn’t grow up in a “naked household” and the last adult human to see me in the altogether was my waxer, before that my ­gynaecologist.When I arrive it has just started to rain, so rather anti-climatically there are a lot more clothes than I had prepared myself for.I meet my mentor, Pam, a -year-old heading up the youth contingent of British Naturism, and she says I can undress in her tent. She doesn’t even buy me a drink first.I slip off everything and cover myself with a towel. I meet two boys about my age and am starkly aware I will later see their genitals.This is weird, but slightly thrilling . . . I think how much I don’t want them to see my bum. Pants off, we head over to the main area and straight to the bar for Dutch courage.I know it’s time to drop the towel, I didn’t drive three hours to Somerset to bottle it now. And so, in front of a class of naked adults learning how to make balloon animals, I bare all.Suddenly, I am Keith Chegwin in Naked Jungle. In a bid to distract myself, I join in the balloon session — and resist the searing urge to make a quip about the sausage-shaped balloons.A few hours in and, despite ­fearing it may be against naturist etiquette, I question the obvious trend for a fuzz-free look down below. One man deadpans: “I’ve got a smaller penis so trim the hairs so they don’t get stuck”.I meet Graham, , at the bar. After losing his we five years ago he has immersed himself in the scene. He even drives naked — pay-at-the-pump has been a blessing.Graham likes to walk outdoors naked. If I was walking my dog and saw a very naked Graham walking towards me, I would probably call the police.When I tell him this, he reveals he has started to carry a dog lead, despite not owning a dog, to show he comes in peace and to avoid any confusion.But this is the crux of where naturism is misunderstood — your bits might be out, but there is nothing overwhelmingly sexual about it. I have had smear tests that were more arousing, I think, during Pilates.Mark, a university lecturer by day who took the pictures for this article, sums it up perfectly when he tells me: “Naturism is about the freedom to choose, and whether you choose clothes or a burqa, it’s about being true to you.”The Pilates instructor later says she thought I was a seasoned naturist. I feel a swell of pride, before flashbacks to the downward dog when I almost concussed myself with my own boobs. Downwards dog ears, perhaps a more accurate description.The staff on site are not naturists, so does the clay pigeon instructor feel left out  It’s a strong no. But a ­twinkle in his eye hints he is curious — though maybe it was because I was resting my bosom on his gun.At the rock-climbing, I slip into the harness. It serves as a sort of spreading vice and I almost certainly give an involuntary gynaecological showcase to those queuing at the bottom.I question a health and safety system that says no bare feet but gusset optional. Things reach critical levels of surreal when we spy a chap wearing nothing but a Robin Hood cap teaching archery. Along with Pam, I join in.When I ask some younger naturistsanything ever happens after nightfall, a -year-old man, who is yet to tell his family about his hobby, says: “Most people take their clothes off when they’re drunk, I put them on.”Then I drop my first clanger, telling Sian, a NudeFest volunteer: “I don’t know why people have a problem with it. It’s not like you’re all a bunch of swingers.”I suddenly feel naked in the middle of a party . . . and realise I am. I ask a man called Paul, who has an impressive body painting of a lion on his belly, why he didn’t go a bit lower and get an elephant.My joke falls flat . Could it be that naturists are discretely quite prudish  I feel a little flutter when a good-looking, strawberry blond man walks by with the most gorgeous bum.Yes, I do fancy him. And yes, more because I can see everything. Is all this nakedness truly totally devoid of sexuality — andnaturism is not about objectying certain body parts, how do you explain a TV show like Naked Attraction Pam tells me: “There is an inverse insecurity of watching a show like that — it just shows how obsessed we are with bodies and comparison.” I spot a unormed police officer doing the rounds and can’t help but think how overdressed he looks.It becomes clear that naturists don’t care two hoots what anyone  thinks of them. For this, I start to appreciate them even more.A volunteer in his s tells me: “People who ridicule us don’t have the guts. All my friends and family admire me for being able to do this.”But that’s the point that mentor Pam makes so brilliantly — we aren’t a sum of our body parts. And that’s what true naturism is all about.She says: “If you’ve got a s**t personality you’ll stand out — because here you have nothing to hide behind.”I begin to envy her true-self acceptance and body confidence. I definitely hate my bum more as the day wobbles on, instead of feeling less self-conscious about it. At the end of the day, I put on my knickers, thank Pam and say I’ll message her when I get home.It’s like the end of a one-night stand. I hope she messages me. For the patrons of Nudefest, it is good, clean, wholesome fun celebrating people for who they are not what they look like.I want to say I felt liberated. But I didn’t, just wobbly. However I did feel totally respected.Pam’s openness and frankness is refreshing, and while I’m still scratching to get beneath the surface of my own body issues, I would love nothing more than a drink in the pub with this lot.I go home with no washing and no tan lines and wonder, could I get used to this Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I would say that I came in as a Boris fan but having listened to both I think they both gave good performances, but Jeremy just filled me with a bit more confidence.Both would do a good job, and Id be happy to see either of them in the role.I think Boris will get it done quicker, but Jeremy will get it done better.Insiders believe Johnson is “home and dry” with a week to go until the deadline for Tory voters to have their say in the election.But addressing the audience of Sun readers in the heart of London, Hunt insisted he was not far apart from his rival when it came to delivering Brexit by the new deadline of October .He added: “Both of us want to leave by October . Both of us hope Parliament won’t block a No Deal Brexit.”And both men committed to handing at least one of the top four jobs in their Cabinet to women days after Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd said she had now “accepted” No Deal had to remain on the table.Asked to guarantee he would award the job of either Chancellor, Home Secretary, Foreign Secretary or Defence Secretary to a woman, Johnson dithered before saying: “I think I’m going to say yes, depending on what you mean by top four.”"},{"url":null,"title":"miracle conjoined twins separated at great ormond 50 hrs surgery 100 staff","story":"Safa and Marwa Ullah were born by C-section with their skulls and blood vessels fused together.But the two-year-olds can now move independently after three major ops at Great Ormond Street.The first took place in October , when the girls, from Charsadda, Pakistan, were  months old. And the last operation, which saw them finally separated, was carried out on February  this year.In order to ensure the operations went smoothly, experts used virtual reality to create an exact replica of the girls’ anatomy.This enabled surgeons to visualise the complex structure of their skulls as well as the positioning of their brains and blood vessels.A team also used D printing to create plastic models of the structures that could be used for practice. Cutting guides were created so that surgeons could work more precisely.During the surgery, doctors first worked to separate the girls’ blood vessels and then inserted a piece of plastic into their heads to keep the brains and blood vessels apart.The final major operation involved medics building new skulls using the girls’ own bone. They also used tissue expanders to ensure the girls’ own skin would stretch over the top of each of their heads.The surgery, which was paid for by a private donor, has been followed by several smaller procedures to enable the girls to live independent lives.The operations added up to more than  hours of surgery time and involved  members of staff from Great Ormond Street.The girls’ mum, Zainab Bibi, , said: “We are indebted to the hospital and to the staff and we would like to thank them for everything they have done. We are extremely excited about the future.”The girls, whose father has died, were discharged from Gosh on July  and moved to a London address with their mum, grandad Mohammad Sadat, , and an uncle.The twins are now undergoing daily physiotherapy as part of their ongoing rehabilitation.Neurosurgeon Noor ul Owase Jeelani and craniofacial surgeon Prof David Dunaway led the team that operated on the girls.They said in a statement: “We are delighted we have been able to help Safa and Marwa and their family. It has been a long and complex journey for them, and for the clinical team looking after them.“From our personal point of view, it has been great to get to know the girls and their family.Their faith and determination have been so important in getting them through the challenges they have faced.We are incredibly proud of them. We are also incredibly proud of the Gosh team responsible for their treatment and care over the past  months.“From the surgical teams, scientists and engineers who helped us plan and perform the operations to the paediatricians, nursing staff, physiotherapists and occupational therapistsIt has been a huge team effort and every single person has played a key part in helping Safa and Marwa.“Gosh really is one of the few hospitals in the world with the infrastructure and expertise to carry out a separation like this successfully.”Conjoined twins are very rare, affecting only about one in every .million births. Just  per cent of conjoined twins are craniopagus, which means they are joined at the head.Gosh has successfully separated craniopagus twins in  and .

It has threatened journalists, too, that they face prosecutionthey dare to publish the content of the cables.Trying to justy his threats, the Met’s Assistant Commissioner, Neil Basu, said he was sure the leaks had “damaged UK international relations” and on that basis no one publishing the leaks could plead a public interest defence.What a ludicrous over-reaction to what is really no more than a diplomatic spat over the Ferrero Rochers.Sure, it doesn’t exactly help UK US relations when our Ambassador calls the President of the United States “inept” and his administration “uniquely dysal”.But I would say it is mildly less damaging than some of the things that the Leader of Opposition, the Mayor of London and Scotland’s First Minister have said about Donald Trump. I can’t see Mr Basu dangling his handcuffs in front of them — and neither should he.Obviously, Sir Kim has reason to feel aggrieved that someone — presumably in the diplomatic service or the Foreign Office, because there is no evidence of computers being hacked — has leaked information he intended to be private. But it is a matter for the Government to investigate, not the police.How ridiculous Basu has said of the leaker: “You are now also responsible for erting busy detectives from under-taking their core mission.”No, Mr Basu — it is only thanks to your decision that officers have been taken off front-line duties to undertake this investigation.You could have told officials what police officers are forever telling the rest of us when we report our houses broken into or our bikes stolen: Sorry, but we’ve got too much  to do.It would be a dferent mattersomeone had leaked material that really did harm national security.The sort of information leaked by Kim Philby and his Soviet-sympathising accomplices in the s put British lives at risk.But leaking and publishing a diplomat’s private thoughts hardly comes into that category. Mr Basu’s attack on the principles of the free Press echoes Operation Elveden, the failed attempt by the Met to criminalise journalists who had obtained information from police officers, in some cases for money.The Met switched more than  police officers from other duties and arrested  people. The police probe cost taxpayers £.million and yet of  journalists charged, only one was convicted at trial — and that was quashed on appeal. Just one journalist, Dan Evans, pleaded guilty to an Elveden offence and was given a suspended sentence.The prosecutions relied on an ancient offence, Misconduct in Public Office, which was only ever supposed to apply to public servants, not journalists.As many lawyers, including the Lord Chief Justice, pointed out, it simply isn’t a criminal offence for someone to receive or to publish most forms of state information — only for a public official to sell it.There is a very good reason for this. Leaks, and the freedom to put their contents into the public domain, are an essential ingredient of our democracy. It is what helps the Press to keep in check corrupt or over-bearing politicians and public officials.Without the freedom to publish leaked information, for example, we would never have known the extent to which MPs and Lords were abusing their expenses regime.That required a newspaper to publish information gleaned from a computer disk which had been stolen — but thankfully in that case the Met decided that the public interest over-rode a possible offence of handling stolen goods.Without the Panama Papers we would never have known the extent to which wealthy iniduals and corporations have gone into keeping their wealth out of the taxman’s grasp. Without the “climategate” leaks we would not have known how some climate scientists were prepared to manipulate past temperature records to support their theories.It took a leak, too, to establish that the Blair government knew it was unlikely that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, but that George W Bush had resolved to overthrow Saddam regardless.Then there was “Plebgate”, when a leaked police log revealed a bust-up between government chief whip Andrew Mitchell and police manning the gates at Downing Street — and led an officer to be jailed when it was revealed he had invented his witness statement.There are, of course, plenty of other countries in the world where journalists would be locked up for publishing information that has leaked from the government, but they are not countries in which most of us would want to live.By over-reacting to what is an embarrassment to the Foreign Office, the Met has taken a leaf out of the book of President Erdogan of Turkey, who has locked up dozens of journalists as he attempts to suppress all opposition to his regime.Neil Basu and other senior Met Police officers should back off and accept that the Press is quite within its rights to publish leaked information that does not threaten national security.We are, after all, one of the world’s oldest ing democracies — not a tinpot state where people get led off in chains for daring to reveal the truth. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

almost like youve been scalded.As time goes on, the spots may increase in size, or disappear and reappear later.Not all rashes from being outdoors will be caused by hay fever - you may have unintentionally come into contact with a poisonous plant.Or, and particularly at this time of year, you may be suffering from a heat rash.It could of course be an allergic reaction to something  entirely, such as a laundry detergent, soap or perfume.Just keep in mind that hay fever can cause itchiness in general, so while it may look like you have a rash, it could actually be some redness from scratching.Antihistamines that contain diphenhydramine can help to reduce that itchy feeling and reduce skin irritation.Another lesser-known symptom is allergic shiners - or dark circles that appear under the eyes and usually resemble bruises.They tend to be caused by nasal congestion which can cause blood to pool in the tiny vessels under the eyes.These swollen veins dilate and darken, creating dark circles and puffiness.Allergic shiners are usually accompanied by other symptoms like watery, red, itchy eyes, a blocked or runny nose, sinus pressure and sneezing.And its not just hay fever that can cause them to flare - indoor allergens like dust mites, mould and pets or other irritants including cigarette smoke, pollution and perfumes can lead to allergic shiners.Other conditions can lead to dark circles under the eyes so its important to see a GP to get an accurate diagnosis.Experts say the medication taken to ease hay fever might actually make sex excruciatingly painful for women.Histamine is a chemical released when the body detects something harmful, such as an infection, and causes the blood vessels to expand to protect the body.To counter that, antihistamines can be taken to block the receptors that cause this reaction by drying out the mucous membrane lining the ear, nose and throat.But a side-effect can sometimes lead to them also causing dryness in the vagina mucosa.Dr Anne Henderson, consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist on behalf of Canesten, said: Antihistamine medication works on cells in the mucous membrane throughout the body to reduce secretions.Whilst they are targeted at the mucous production in the upper respiratory tract - the nose, throat and eyes - the impact is non-selective and other similar mucous-producing tissues, such as those in the vagina and cervix in women, are also affected to a ying degree.Scientists claim that some hay fever sufferers might actually experience memory problems.One study examining how allergic reactions affect cognitiveshowed that the brain compensates in the short term, but over time it signicantly decreases.Basically, the experts say allergies can strain the brain - and key s from attention to memory can diminish the longer you battle with reactions.Another study, published in in the journal Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience, examined the brains of mice who were exposed to grass pollen.The researchers found heightened activity in the memory part of the brain - the allergens had triggered growth of new neurons.But, to their surprise, at the same time there had been the opposite effect on the immune cells in the brain, called microglia, which had been deactivated.While these results werent exactly conclusive, what they do tell us is that the way the brain responds to allergens isnt straightforward.Further studies have also pointed out a connection between allergies and mood, including depression.Some evidence suggests heightened inflammation triggers neurochemical changes leading to depressive episodes."},{"url":null,"title":"boy claims he is princess diana","story":"Billy Campbell, son of Australian TV personality David Campbell, was born  years after the princesss death in .Writing in a column for Stellar Magazine, the bemused dad wrote: “Billypointed and said, ‘Look!

but tonightaposs Tory leadership debate was the last one of the contest. Next week Britain will have new PM - probably Boris Johnson - and the loser - probably Jeremy Hunt - will be fighting for his place in the Cabinet. But the pair clashed one more time - this time in a head-to-head debate hosted by The Sun and TalkRadio. It was a wide ranging conversation - covering tax, immigration andthe US President is a racist. This is what we learned    Neither Boris or Jeremy will say Trump is a racist Both refused to brand comments from Donald Trump that non-white lawmakers who have criticised him should go home as racist.  The President said four non-white congresswomen should “go back and help fix” their “broken and crime-infested” countries. Only one of the quartet was born outside America. Mr Huntaposs said the comments were unacceptable.    He added that as the father of three half Chinese children that he was totally appalled before adding that he hoped it would never happen in this country. But asked to condemn it as racist he said: It is not going to help the situation to use that type of language about the president of the United States. Mr Johnson said the relationship between the US and UK was incredibly important But he added: If you are the leader of a great multiracial multicultural society you simply cannot use that kind of language about sending people back to where they come from. Challenged to as to why he wouldnapost call the comments racist Mr Johnson said: Iaposve said what Iaposve said. You can take from what I have said what I think about that remark.    They ruled out a snap election Asked by he’d rule out a snap election, Mr Johnson replied: “Absolutely.” He added: I think it would be the height of folly. I think the people of this country are utterly fed up with politicians coming back to them offering referendums or elections.” Mr Hunt basically agreed - with both warning the Tories could face serious electoral consequencesthey went to the country before delivering Brexit And both think that Jeremy Corbyn is anti-Semitic Both candidates were askedLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn is personally anti-Semitic in the wake of the Panorama Documentary. To applause, Mr Hunt replied: Unfortunately, he may be. Mr Johnson said: I think by condoning anti-Semitism in the way he does, I am afraid he is effectively culpable of that vice. The programme - shown on Wednesday - included claims that senior figures including Mr Corbynaposs communications chief Seumas Milne and general secretary Jennie Formby had interfered in anti-Semitism investigations.    In its response, Labour said the allegations came from disaffected former officials opposed to Mr Corbynaposs leadership who had personal and political axes to grind casting doubt on their credibility as sources. Boris Johnson defended his tax cuts for the wealthiest Mr Johnson said it was odd that people had criticised his plan to cut taxes for high earners. I do think it is a bit odd that thereaposs been so much controversy, he said, when you consider that there are police inspectors, there are senior nurses, there are heads of maths departments who are now being captured paying the higher rate of tax.    He continued: Iaposm one of those that people basically should wherever possible be able to spend their own money as much as they can. He was unclear over whether it remained a policy or a subject for debate. Mr Hunt warned of the public viewing the Tories as a party for the privileged when it came to taxes. He said: I think itaposs very important that we donapost inadvertently play into the message that Jeremy Corbyn so wants to project about our party. BoJo also refused to talk about his girlfriend Mr Johnson refused to speak about his private le, including who he would live with in Downing Streethe became PM. It is widely expected that his girlfriend Carrie Symondaposs would join him in Downing Sthe wins the race.  Iaposve had a pretty ruthless rule on not commenting on that side of things and I donapost intend,I may, to break it after  years, he said. But Mr Newton Dunn pressed on it being a trust issue with the public and that voters do not know who he would be living with in No . I donapost want to get into any kind of presumptuous theorising about living in Downing Street at all, he said. Both candidates refused to say theyaposd end the benefits freeze It comes despite Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd warning that it was “essential” that the next Prime Minister ends the freeze. The current four-year cap on working-age benefits is up for review next year. Ms Rudd said she had already held conversations with Chancellor Philip Hammond over raising benefits in line with inflation once again. The government had said that the freze was due to end in . But neither candidate last night would pledge to end the freeze.

After coming out at , Dominic Hilton, now , believed “ per cent” that he was gay – until his New Year’s Resolution to spend  sex-free after a nasty break up made him question everything. Finding himself attracted to women for the first time, the support worker, who lives in Bournemouth, began to believe he was in fact straight. However he says his decision has resulted in lots of online abuse and people have even accused him of promoting conversion therapy, which he is completely against and finds very upsetting.  Rejoining the dating world in January , he vowed to lose his virginity to a woman – which he did in April. But now, he has decided that he does not identy as any one sexual orientation, and has found shedding himself of all labels to be very liberating.  He explained: “Growing up, I believed  per cent I was gay, and then telling everyone I thought I may be straight after my year of celibacy was like coming out all over again.   “But now, I regret labelling myself as anything at all. I am currently dating a man, but I wouldn’t rule women out in the future.    “I’ve had people ask whether that means I’m bisexual, or pansexual, which is where you are attracted to a person, romantically and emotionally, regardless of gender.   “I still say no, though. People like to label, and put one another in boxes, as a way of making sense of the world, but it feels so much better not to do that.   “I’m not claiming to be anything – other than happy.”   In his younger years, save for a couple of teenage flings with girls before he came out at , Dominic exclusively dated men.   Working for a spell as a male escort, he even racked up “between  and ” notches on his bedpost.   But then, everything changed when a two-year relationship with his ex-boyfriend came to an abrupt end over the Christmas dinner table in December .  Keen not to jump back into the world of dating before he was ready, Dominic took some time out for himself – during which he stumbled upon an article about celibacy on the internet.   He recalled: “To get over someone, a lot of people go and get under someone , but I didn’t want to do that.   “I started reading up on celibacy and saw people talk about how it had helped their self-esteem, lessened their anxieties, gave them more energy and generally taught them more about who they were.”   Figuring he had nothing to lose, Dominic made a New Year’s Resolution to spend  celibate – much to the surprise of his loved ones.   He added: “A lot of my friends found it funny. I remember one saying, ‘You’ll never do it.’ But the longer it went on, the more determined I was.”   And, as the year went on, Dominic found that, not only was he feeling more confident and energised than ever before, but he was also suddenly looking at women in a dferent way.    By the time  drew to a close, he became convinced that he was no longer attracted to men.   Then, in January , at that point identying as straight, he made an entirely dferent New Year’s Resolution – to lose his virginity to a woman.   Around the same time, he also decided to go public with his story in a bid to extol the virtues of celibacy to anybody  out there struggling with self-esteem, or feeling disillusioned by dating.   Sadly, though, he was met with a wave of vile comments from online trolls, who even went as far as sending him death threats.   He recalled: “I had all sorts of reaction. I was told to kill myself, told I was an embarrassment to the LGBT community and even sent death threats.   “One of the worst things was people sharing my story in a bid to promote conversion therapy, which was never my intention, and certainly not something I would ever agree with.   “I never set out trying to convince other people to change sexuality. All I wanted to do was share my own story, and that is how I thought I identied at the time.   “I tried not to pay attention to the trolls, though. If it had been all my family and friends saying it, it would have been dferent – but those people don’t know me.   “Plus I also got messages of support, and even heard from people who had been through something similar, spending years thinking they identied as one thing, only to start feeling dferent in later le.”    Dominic’s newfound notoriety did mean that he was often recognised by girls on dating apps – many of whom would block him, or tell him they were not interested.   But he also received positive messages, with people encouraging him to be who he was, and pay no attention to internet bullies.  Then, in March , he struck up a conversation with a girl he met on Facebook .  They went on to date for around six weeks or so,  and Dominic even introduced her to some of his family, after losing his virginity.   He recalled: “We’d been talking non-stop before we met, over the phone. We just clicked. We had our first date in London, and stayed in a hotel. Though we didn’t sleep together that night, we did share a bed.   “After that, we spoke all the time, and eventually, I lost my virginity. That was something I’d really wanted to do, so I was happy.   “It wasn’t some big romantic moment – more of a drunken fumble – but she said she was surprised I was a virgin which was a compliment.    “We parted ways soon after because we realised we werenapost right for each other, but I’m still glad it happened, and I enjoyed it at the time. Dating a woman, I found, was completely dferent to dating men, as I wasn’t used to it at all so it was all completely new to me.  There were certain things I did dferently. I felt like I fell into a standard gender role. I was inclined to be more of a gentleman and spoil her and treat her as a lady.   I also felt more inclined to pay for things, like contributing towards her train when she came to see me. And I felt more self-conscious about coming across as camp.   In the months that followed, Dominic was not especially thinking about ing to dating men – until he met his now-boyfriend in a bar about two months ago, and was completely swept off his feet.   "},{"url":null,"title":"familys dream 6800 tui holiday","story":"NewsFamilys dream £, TUI holiday RUINED by half-built hotel, sewage and raw foodJoanne, , and Kevin Humphreys, , say they were forced to go to reception everyday due to the sheer number of complaints at The Holiday Village in MontenegroShareCommentsByElliot HawkinsNeil Murphy:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsThe family spent more than £, on the holiday \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA British family say their £, TUI holiday turned into a aposnightmareapos after discovering they were staying at a half-finished hotel.The family of six were supposed to be staying at a dream holiday village in Montenegro, EssexLive reports .But they claim they were met with an unfinished hotel, where they say construction workers and the stench of sewerage were around every corner. Hospice volunteer Joanne Humphreys, , and her husband, Kevin, , spent nearly £, on a ten-night stay at The Holiday Village Montenegro.    They were accompanied on the trip by their children, Louis, , and Beth, , and the kids’ godparents. They say things went from bad to worse throughout the holiday - and the family were left in state of shock after seeing the state of their hotel room. Joanne and Kevin went into their local TUI store in Basildon, Essex, where they were recommended a brand new, all-inclusive -star hotel that boasted four restaurants and spa facilities. The couple parted with their money in exchange for a deluxe family suite at a complex which was being built as they booked.    “It looked amazing and the TUI store staff spoke so highly of the hotel, Joanne said. We were all really looking forward to it, especially our children. It had everything we’d want in a holiday bars, restaurants, a spa, gym and adult only pool areas. We thought TUI was a reputable company so we trusted everything would be as they described. To say it was a nightmare would be an understatement.” The hotel was due to open at the end of May this year and the family were arriving on June . Joanne said she became concerned that the hotel would not be finished in time for their arrival after doing research online. TUI customer care discussed her worries and assured her everything would be fine.    She said: “Our fears subsided until a couple of weeks before we were due to arrive, when I was informed that while the hotel would be completed, some of the facilities originally on offer were no longer going to be available such as the spa, hairdressers, the gym and the waterslides.This led me to look on social media. There was a Facebook page full of people complaining how bad it actually was and that the resort wasn’t anywhere near finished.People were cancelling their holidays left, right and centre. We made our way back to the TUI shop to bring this to their attention but they insisted everything was on schedule and it would be fine when we got there.” The couple knew that the children and their grandparents were really looking forward to the trip, so they hoped for the best. The family arrived in Montenegro, only to be met by their worst fears, they say.    Joanne said: “We stepped off the transfer bus to be greeted by the stench of sewage and building noise. The closer we got to the resort reception, the more we saw construction workers walking around with wheelbarrows. TUI reps met us at reception and we were taken to what was supposed to be a deluxe suite. On the way, we came across half complete stairs, loose paving slabs and dust everywhere. The first thing we saw when they opened the door was half eaten toast on the side and a bed that hadn’t been made. It was a sight for sore eyes. We went back to reception to explain the situation to the manager. We were tired from travelling all day and the whole thing was a mess. We were taken to ious other rooms which were not at all suitable for us or what we had paid for. In the end, we were told to wait while they cleaned the room we were first taken to.” And things continued to get worse, according to the family.  Joanne even claims that the shower head fell off while in the shower, supposedly hitting her foot and injuring her toe. “Everything kept falling apart, she said. The soap dispenser in the shower was not fully secured and kept coming off and the shower floor tiles were uneven. It was a disaster waiting to happen.” “We got to the point where there wasn’t a single day where something hadn’t gone wrong. The bedroom door didn’t close properly and on a few occasions, the safe would not open before we were due to go out. The key cards to our room were faulty and almost every night we had to go to reception to get this rectied”, she said. According to Joanna, the door handle to their room came off one evening and left her with bruising and cutting. The family claims the rest of the resort was full of hazardous conditions.  Joanne said: “It was very messy and noisy and not only ruined the ambiance of a relaxing holiday with lots of dust, but it was a health and safety hazard, especially for holiday makers walking around barefoot.  TUI told Joanne and Kevin that there would be a buffet restaurant and three a la carte restaurants available for unlimited visits, But they say they were told by their rep that only the buffet restaurant was available as the other restaurants weren’t fully ing. The Italian restaurant opened halfway through their holiday but the family was unable to ever get a table. “Again, it was not what was promised but we had no choice but to just put up with it, Joanne said. In actual fact, the buffet was extremely poor with very limited choice. There was raw food being served which made both myself and my daughter poorly.” After a number of complaints were made about the food hygiene, microwaves were put out for holiday makers to warm up their own foodit wasnapost fully cooked or had gone cold, claims Joanne. She added: In  years of going on adult holidays, I’ve never complained but we were at reception every single day complaining to the TUI reps. The maintenance worker must’ve been run off his feet with the amount of problems there were.

Emma Clark said it was fortunate her children were not in the room when the appliance detonated. The shards of glass were so hot they scorched the recently-installed £ flooring. An IKEA spokesman today admitted the tempered glass used in the £ Mattradition forced-air ovens, made by Whirlpool, has a tendency to explode. Emma, who lives near Cockermouth, Cumbria, said the appliance was less than a year old. She had set the oven to self-cleaning mode when she heard a loud bang.The -year-old took to Facebook to alert IKEA to the problem, writing: IKEA Mattradition Oven.   Less than a year old and the inner door just exploded sending hot glass out through the bottom and across the floor. I rang the number in the booklet only to be told aposit wasnapost one of their ovensapos and to call the same number tomorrow. Thankfully my kids werenapost in the room at the time. Emma has two children, aged three and six, and feared they could have been burned or cut had they been nearby. The oven was at a temperature of °C at the time of the explosion. She said: It was a huge shock, I was worried - nothing like this has happened before. I was just relieved that nobody was hurt. Itaposs damaged my new vinyl floor and weaposre going to have to go through the insurance to get that fixed, so itaposs a hassle.    An IKEA spokesman said he was keen to look into the incident as a product safety issue and added that the tempered glass used for the oven door, ironically known as safety glass, has previously been known to shatter. He said: The tempered glass has a tendency to explode, but we wouldnapost really know what has happened without being able to test it. We want to resolve this with the customer and they will not be out of pocket. He added that reports of exploding oven doors were not uncommon, but that this was not just limited to IKEA products. In  the consumer watchdog Which  produced an article highlighting the potential dangers of tempered glass doors. A Which  spokesman said: Tempered glass is thermally strengthened by heating it to more than  C, followed by rapid cooling. The outer layer of the glass cools more quickly, creating a compressed outer layer. This works to protect the inner part of the glass, which cools more slowly.

Dee Coldbeck, , insisted she was unwell and even kept a medical diary in which she spoke about her trips to the doctor and made early references to pain in the right side of her body. During her visits to the GP, Dee, who was suffering from bile duct cancer, was told she could have damaged a muscle before being diagnosed with stress. Despite this, the mum to a three-year-old boy, insisted: I know my own body. I know there is something wrong. Speaking at her inquest, her husband Mark said: Dee had the frustration of that. “It is the type of cancer rarely diagnosed and we didn’t get the result we wanted. We are not here seeking legal representation but we want to make sure there are lessons learnt and things will improve. The coroner read extracts from “Dee’s medical diary,” which covered hospital visits as well as trips to the Plains View Surgery, Mapperley, Nottingham.   An early entry refers to pain in the right side in April last year, reports Nottinghamshire Live .Dee, who died on March , was initially checked to seeshe had gallstones. When this was ruled out, it was thought she might have damaged a muscle. Dr Umar Amad, a partner in the medical practice, said that most of her appointments were with another doctor, who ordered blood tests and an ultra sound scan. These showed that Mrs Coldbeck was anaemic. Dr Amad told the inquest: “There are lots of causes of anaemia. Liver tests were all normal.” The mum-of-one was prescribed painkillers and iron tablets. Later she was diagnosed with stress, but she also had symptoms of breathlessness and feeling tired. When problems continued, the practice ordered a full liver screening in October. In the next month, it was decided to send Mrs Coldbeck to a specialist – but the paperwork was delayed. Asked by the coroner about improvements, Dr Amad replied: “I think she did receive appropriate care. I don’t think we would have changed that plan signicantly.” Specialist Dr Ankit Rao treated her in the Queenaposs Medical Centre and the City Hospital, where she died of bile duct cancer. She developed deep vein thrombosis which delayed taking samples from the liver.

Kasim Lewis, , was jailed for le with a minimum term of  years last May for the murder of -year-old Iuliana Tudos on Christmas Eve . He attacked Ms Tudos with a broken bottle in Finsbury Park, London, as she walked home after a sht at the Worldaposs End pub in Camden. Her naked body was found, with a suspected Batman logo carved into her chest, in a burned-out hut in the park three days after she disappeared.  Following his conviction for her murder, Lewisaposs DNA was linked to the death of Catherine Burke, who was stabbed to death in her own home in Haringey a month before. At a hearing at the Old Bailey on Monday, Lewis pleaded guilty to the murder of Ms Burke on November  . The -year-old mother of one and retired civil servant was found dead by police after concerned neighbours raised the alarm. Police found DNA linking the defendant to the scene and tracked Ms Burkeaposs mobile phone in the direction of where he was living.    Explicit pornographic material was also found on the defendantaposs mobile phone, the court had heard at an earlier hearing. Lewis, who was addicted to drugs and diagnosed as HIV positive in , had a number of convictions for sexual offences and was on a sex offenders register for le. Judge Richard Marks QC adjourned sentencing at the Old Bailey until Thursday. When he sentenced Lewis, from the Caribbean island of Montserrat, for Ms Tudosapos murder, Judge Marks described Lewis as aposwicked beyond beliefapos.    He added: This was a murder for gain. What is however, in dispute is whether this case should be categorised as a murder involving sexual or sadistic conduct. There must have been a sexual element, evenfor some reason that was not something that was persisted in. There is no doubt that this was a killing that involved the most appalling brutality as the photographs demonstrate. It is a killing that has been rightly described as horrendous and barbaric.    At the time of the attack, this slightly built young woman was alone in a park at night and as such, vulnerable in the extreme as you unquestionably realised. She must have died a terrible death and what you did to her was wicked beyond belief. The court had heard how Lewis carved either the Batman logo or the letter aposMapos into the middle of Ms Tudosaposs chest. The killer was a bisexual who was in a relationship with a man but prowled Finsbury Park to satisfy his cravings for casual sex.

Bianca Devins, , was found dead after social media users began sharing photos of her body. Her alleged killer - -year-old Brandon Andrew Clark - is accused of slitting her throat and posting an image of her body along with a message reading Iaposm sorry Bianca before stabbing himself in the neck. Police say they believe he was her boyfriend and there is no evidence to support online claims that he was an obsessed internet stalker. Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, is now facing criticism after a report claimed the gruesome image stayed up for nearly a day and was put behind a blurred-out sensitive content filter. Before the killing Clark had posted a photo of a darkened motorway with the message: “Here comes Hell. It’s redemption, right ” He allegedly wrote on Facebook: I’m ending it today. I’m sorry to all the family and friends who wanted me to achieve. I love you all.”    Clark, who has been charged with murder by police in Utica, New York, changed his Instagram bio to read “   –   , and also posted the Fight Club quote: This is your le, and itaposs ending one minute at a time. The couple met on Instagram about two months ago, and their relationship had developed into a personally intimate one, the force added. Police believe Clark and Bianca “were boyfriend girlfriend, whatever kids these days call it, Lt Brian Coromato told Rolling Stone, but a friend claimed they were just friends. They argued after attending a concert in New York City on Saturday night, and Clark then used a large kne to kill the teen on Sunday morning after driving her back to Utica, it is claimed. Shortly before she was killed, Bianca had sent messages to a friend on the Discord gaming app claiming Clark was so mad that she had held hands with and kissed a male who had joined them at the concert, Rolling Stone reported.  The three had reportedly smoked cannabis in Clarkaposs car before he drove Bianca back to Utica. Clarkaposs social media followers raised the alarm after he allegedly wrote that he had killed someone and posted a photo of Biancaaposs corpse. Images were posted on Instagram, Discord and the imageboard chan, according to police. The Instagram photo remained on that  for almost  hours, BuzzFeed News reported. It had been blurred with a sensitive content filter after someone reported it as offensive, but users could still view it by tapping the screen. Clarkaposs Instagram account wasnapost disabled until Monday morning. A Facebook spokesperson said: Our thoughts go out to those affected by this tragic event. We are taking every measure to remove this content from our s.  Our goal is to take action as soon as possible - there is always room for improvement. We don’t want people seeing content that violates our policies. In the Discord post, Clark allegedly wrote “Sorry f***ers, you’re gonna have to find someone  to orbit”, and shared Biancaaposs real name and address. Orbiting is used to describe social media users who lurk on womenaposs pages in hopes of sleeping with them. Clark, of Bridgeport, New York, allegedly made a derogatory remark about Bianca and her followers, and the photos were reposted on misogynistic forums. Bianca had about , Instagram followers when she was killed, and she was known as an e-girl for posts about anime, video games, and emo-adjacent fashion on that  and others including TikTok. Her stepmother Kaleigh condemned those who shared the gruesome photos, writing on Facebook: It is absolutely disgusting that people are sharing, screenshoting the pictures of Bianca’s tragedic death!! Wtf is wrong with you people!!   I have seen the pictures. I will FORVER have those images in my mind when I think of her. When I close my eyes, those images haunt me.  How about we have some f***ing consideration for her Mother, Sister, Step sisters and brother, Step Mother and Step Father, her Grandparents, Aunts, Uncles, Nieces and Newphews and her friends. How about we have some f***ing consideration FOR HER!!! Police say they found Clark with Biancaaposs body, next to his vehicle, at about .am on Sunday after he called  himself to say what he had done and that he was going to harm himself. By then someone who had seen his social media posts had alerted police, reporting that Clark said he had killed his girlfriend and was threatening to harm himself, say police. Clark began stabbing himself in the neck with a kne as a lone officer approached him. He then began taking selfies as he lay on top of Biancaaposs covered body as blood poured from his wounds. A police spokesperson said: After attempting to injure himself, he laid down across a green in colour tarp that was on the ground some distance away. The officer immediately noticed brown hair protruding from beneath the tarp and inquired as to where the injured female was. The male advised him that the female was beneath the tarp, and proceeded to pull out a cellphone. It was at this time that is believed that the male took self-photographs of himself laying across the deceased female.  After he was disarmed and arrested, Clark was taken to hospital, where he underwent emergency surgery for severe injuries. He was expected to survive, said police. The force said Bianca died at the scene after suffering extensive injuries to her neck. Biancaaposs family have described her as a talented artist and wonderful young girl who was taken from us all too soon. She had graduated from high school just last month and was due to begin studying psychology at a community college this autumn. Her family said: We are very grateful for the outpouring of love and sympathy we have received from our friends, family, Biancaaposs friends and the whole community. Your prayers help to strengthen us through this dficult time. Her heartbroken sister Liv posted a tribute on Instagram with a photo of the siblings and their mother. Liv wrote: I hate that I have to write this. I hate knowing you’re not going to ever come back home. You were the best sister anyone could’ve ever asked for. Thank you for always being there for me. Thank you for being the best sister I could ever imagine.  Thank you for always protecting me and sticking up for me. I am going to do this for you. Every day I’m going to do my best and I’m going to get through this thing called le and do it all for you. Rest easy, I love you so much forever and always. Biancaaposs sister also wrote “it wasn’t just an ‘internet boyfriend’ this was a close family friend whom we’ve met and trusted so much. Family and friends held a candlelight vigil on Monday night. They lit candles and at one point repeatedly chanted “Love, not violence”, WKTV reported. Friend Derek Ward said of his former classmate: “She was very kind. She was very forgiving. She was one of the nicest people I’ve ever met. Nobody dislikes her. Nobody hated her, and I’ve never heard anything bad said about her.” Biancaaposs stepmother Kaleigh wrote: Bianca was a lot of things to so many people. She was young and beautul and so full of live. She had been through hell and back conquering her own mental illness and she won. She was getting better. Fighting everyday.

Grandmother Sue Hardy, , of Inkpen, Berkshire, who is on holiday at a villa owned by her niece and nephew, told how they were left nursing bruises on their arms and legs when the lumps of ice started hitting them. We were up late on Sunday night celebrating the Cricket World Cup like all the other Brits here and we were relaxing by the pool yesterday afternoon when the sky suddenly turned black.    Before we knew it, there was a howling wind, three terric claps of thunder and the lightning was terrible. Suddenly these lumps of ice began hitting us - most were golf ball size but some were like small cricket balls, which was ironic as we were cheering on England when we watched the World Cup on telly just a few hours earlier. Iaposve got bruises all over and my niece Anne and her husband Gordon,and my other niece Marilyn, were also hit before we could run for cover. It was like a war zone - the noise was deafening as the ice smashed down on rooftops and the patio around the pool. Lots of the sun loungers have been wrecked where the ice was so big...itaposs smashed holes through them. Iaposve never seen anything like it - we come from England so weaposre used to bad weather but this was something .Many holiday spots in Europe have been caught up in similarly terrying weather conditions. Last Wednesday night a British family narrowly escaped injury in a nightmare storm that killed six tourists and injured  other people near Greece.Andy Gilchrist, , we Katie, , and nine-year-old daughter Grace from Bangor in Nothern Ireland were dining on the terrace of their five-star hotel restaurant when terrying footage showed the killer storm picking up heavy glass windows .Trees were brought down, vehicles flipped over and buildings damaged in Halkidiki, a region of northern Greece. The Gilchrists were having a meal on the restaurant terrace at the five-star Ikos Oceania hotel when they saw lightning in the distance.    Within moments, Andy said the winds hit gale-force, sending staff and guests scrambling for safety as heavy glass window panes were apospicked up like napkinsapos. Iaposve never seen anything like it, not even close. You wouldnapost have stood a chanceyou were out in it. If youaposd been on the balcony youaposd have been  miles away by the time it finished. The winds must have been mph, at least said Andy. Panicked waiters jumped over tables to try and close two sets of heavy glass shutters, before giving up and retreating behind a second set of glass doors. Andy said his daughter Grace got aposreally, really frightenedapos and ran with five women to hide in the toilets. There were six of them in one cubicle, my daughter was upset and they were calming her down.    A Romanian woman and her eight-year-old child died when a taverna roof collapsed, and a Russian man and his son, thought to be two years old, were killed when they were struck by a falling tree. Two elderly Czech tourists were killed when strong winds and water swept away their travel trailer, police said. Andy said The storm lasted for more than half an hour, probably  minutes full-on. We were in the restaurant for an hour to an hour and a half before we could leave. The staff were really frightened too.

We matched another offer and there was no more money to be had.“It was based on a football decision.“Funso is very articulate, very single minded and knows what he wants.“From that point of view we feel that we are getting a good player at a good age in that position.”Should Aberdeen progress past RoPS on Thursday, Ojo will be available for the Europa League second qualying round.McInnes said: “We first made contact with Funso and his agent just after the last game of the season against Hibs.“We asked to be kept informed.“He had a few things to sort out at Scunthorpe. A bit of clarity was needed over his contract situation.“However, once we had engaged with Scunthorpe and put the offer across and once it was accepted we were keen to get Funso up here so we could have a word with him.”Meanwhile, Championship Dundee have moved into pole position to land Aberdeen striker Stevie May.Dundee hope to secure a deal to sign the -year-old on a permanent contract.A £, signing from Preston in summer , May still has two years left on his Dons deal.St Johnstone are also keen on securing the striker.Ross County and St Mirren are both interested in May but any move for them would have to be a loan deal."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 7 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsIt is disappointing that Michael Matheson was unable to attend his second A task force meeting in a row.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Peter O#Neil edged out Penrice in race one, but Penrice would take his revenge in race two and it was all to play for in the final encounter. Peter O#Neil was up to the task and would take the overall, with Penrice a deserved second and  Damian Carter would third.The four stroke class was enthralling, with Sam Sibbald thundering around the Kilmartin track, big Andy Malloch and his Armstrong chasing him all the way to the flag and winning the final race but not the overall. Sam would be the victor followed by Andy and a consistent Keith Stanford third.For the youth class it was a day of mixed fortunes and consistency would be the key, with Jordan Graham coming out on top ahead of James Forrest and picking up a superb third overall was Rhys Brown.Pre- action would see committee man and track builder Grant McClure and his Maico, with three decades of riding under his belt, become the overall winner ahead of Callum Wilson on the superbly prepared Honda.The Twinshock under cc event would be a three race win for the flying Calum Kilgour and his cc Yamaha ahead of Jim Grieve, who would have some bike issues but would bring home his Honda in second fighting off a very persistent David Lawson and Gordon Peterson but it would be Gordon that would hold the third place trophy with some consistent riding.The Twinshock open class event would be a spectacular sight as cc Hondas and Maicos battled their way around the bracken.In race one there was a very small gap between first and second place and a similarly small gap between third. Brian Alexander would take the win from Craig ‘Smitch’ Smith, and John Crawford would come home in third with a notable mention to the very unlucky Paul Chiappa who had his fair share of misfortunes throughout the day, as his seat was torn from his bike at the top of one of the steep climbs. The overall would end up the same as the first race with Brian, taking the win from Craig Smith and John Crawford bringing the big Honda home in third.In the over s class it was a triumphant day for John Lamont with three resounding victories. Johnny Rutherford was second, a great result for the club sponsor, with David Watson bringing home the Honda with some consistent rides.For the group three races Robert Bell took the honours from Allan Shields and Bryan Colligan, all of these riders deserving a notable mention and with some very similar lap times and some quick racing in trying conditions.The clubman class was great to watch, with some fast up-and-coming riders such as Peter Rennie, Callum Laird and Stuart Wilson all angling for the win. Rennie would take the overall from Laird in second and  Wilson in third.The evolution class was again the Paul and Tom show. In what must have been the fastest racing all day, it would be Paul #PJ# Johnston who would take overall honours with three wins and Tom Grant would take the runner-up slot followed home ably by a consistent Roy Potts taking the third place.In the final block of racing it would be a win apiece for Jordan McDonald, Shaun Robertson, and John Kenny, but it would be the ever improving Shaun Robertson, ing from injury, who would take overall honours from a rapidly improving John Kenny in second and #Mr Consistent# Karl Livingstone in third.Results:Group Pre- class:  Grant McClure  Callum Wilson.

Apart from the cones on the street, we never had any issues with bad parking or disturbance from people attending the event.ldquoI could hear some music on the evenings but I liked the atmosphere and it certainly wasnrsquot a nuisance. We did attend the family ride on the Sunday, and while there was plenty of mud, I thought theyrsquod done a great job creating such a big event in its first year in Innerleithen.With the proposed plans to redevelop the old mill to create the Mountain Bike Innovation Centre, Tom added: ldquoI think its exciting times to be a resident in Innerleithen and I hope events like these continue to grow and do well here.ldquoI remember when Innerleithen was a poor cousin to Peebles and Glentress as an MTB and tourist destination, and I think itrsquos the hard work of local people who have brought Innerleithen to the fore. Most people are excited about the prospects and possible future developments here, and Irsquod hate people to get the wrong impression of the overall community support based on the reported views of a few people who were disturbed in the eventrsquos first year.ldquoHaving said that, I hope the organisers take on board the negative feedback and incorporate improvements into any future events. I know they were in touch with the community council earlier this year before the event, hopefully theyrsquoll keep up this close relationshipthey come back.Meanwhile, Allan Graham who has lived in the town all of his le said without events such as Transcend, the Innerleithen community has nothing.He added: ldquoThe mills have all gone and what we have is biking, walkers etc. Letrsquos embrace whatrsquos coming to us and make the most of it.Jamie Birks echoed this sentiment adding: ldquoThe town has a real and deserved opportunity to be a national hub for outdoor events such as this. So much talent and experience from so many organisations, coupled with truly amazing natural resources that could make such a positive impact on the town ndashwe all want it.Innerleithen Community Council has promised to pass on the complaints raised at the meeting to event organisers, Scottish Borders Council and Police Scotland.But Chairman Marshall Douglas said the community council ldquostrongly supports the Transcend Bike Festival and will continue to work closely with event organisers to ensure the future success of the event."},{"url":null,"title":"cops-ask-help-catch-boy-racers-galashiels","story":"POLICE in Galashiels have called on a local supermarket to help them catch boy racers.For months there have been reports made about young drivers gathering at the Tesco car park.And now officers have asked the firm to take down registration details to help them track down the culprits.PC James Harrison said: ldquoWe are still receiving calls about boy racers in the car park at Tesco on a Saturday night.ldquoIt seemed to get better for a while, but the problem is still there.

The beds are trimmed neatly with green paths of grass and only the odd weed or two can be seen to peer through the burgeoning beetroot and beans.Often yoursquoll also come across one of the volunteers, the gardener oryoursquore very lucky, one or more of the children who help to tend the plants.The Edible Garden is a community garden nestled in the beautul Tweed Valley at Innerleithen and run by a steering group and volunteers.Its aim is to inspire, motivate and build confidence in adults and children of all ages and abilities to learn how to grow their own food to promote a healthy lestyle, to encourage the community to prevent food waste, reuse recycle to reduce landfill and to reduce their carbon footprint.The St Ronanites are horticulturists turned eco warriors, providing a range of workshops for the community in how to grow, harvest and recycle.Lessons include guidance on composting, propagating, soil preparation, solar power for growing, food preservation, seasonal planting, and bugs pests in the garden, carbon footprint and food waste recycling.The vibrant goings-on have recently stepped up a gear with the efforts of the steering group of Shirley Spence, Lisa Kurowski Leslie and Alex Smithson to win a share of the Tweeddale Localities Bid funding.This has secured the future of the garden for years to come and means that the sht of responsibility from the climate change group lsquoYou Can Cookrsquo to the independent body known as lsquoThe Edible Gardenrsquo is now complete.Shirley Spence said the support of the public and the staff and children of St Ronanrsquos Primary School have been crucial to this success.ldquoIt will allow the steering group to provide a part-time gardener, Alex Smithson, serve the schoolrsquos Eco Group with practical experience of environmental issues and fund the supply of equipment, compost and building materials for the foreseeable future.However, for those of you who have yet to find the garden, perhaps it would be helpful to whet your appetite with some details of what the project has accomplished so far.Firstly, as well as offering expert gardening advice to the supporters, Alex plans and prepares the crops and liaises with school staff to provide classes for the children to teach them about their environment and carbon footprint.The classes look at areas from recycling and horticulture to microbes and ecology. This educational programme and the informal weekly gardening clubs allow both adults and children to experience a connection to nature in a supported environment and take home some of the produce theyrsquove grown too.Shirley explained: ldquoAll of the children at the school benefit from the fruit and vegetables grown in the enclosed garden but also from the orchard and the fruit bushes at the schools entrance.

The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"letter open letter to dog owners","story":"While responsible dog owners take care to ensure their dogs are under control at all times, there are still a number who do not # and seem unaware of the potential consequences of their actions.There has been a disturbing rise in the number of sheep and other livestock attacks, and we are hoping to enlist your help in raising awareness of dog #worrying# which will, in turn, assist the authorities, farmers and land-users.If a dog worries livestock on any agricultural land the owner, or person in charge of the animal at the time, is guilty of a criminal offence.Section  of the DogsAct  defines #worrying# as:Such incidents cause distress to the animals and often lead to them being injured and or killed.

It is better than some human beings are treated ndash that is the sad truth.Mr Farnsworth was presenting an annual report on the racecoursersquos performance over the last financial year.The Beast from the East snow storm, an outbreak of equine influenza, and a long spell of dry weather all contributed to what he described as one of the worst years the course had been through in his memory.A number of key fixtures were cancelled and profits fell.In December, four horses died during one day of racing at the course but a subsequent review by the British Horseracing Authority ruled that the course and race organisers were not at fault.Councillor Gordon Mackett asked Mr Farnsworththe racecourse had been affected by animal welfare concerns.The course manager said: ldquoWe did have a horrible day when there were four fatalities however, these were all completely separate incidents.ldquoIn a sport like this you will get injuries and fatalities from time to time. It is horric for the people involved.Mr Farnsworth said that the public were becoming more aware of incidents like these through social media which, he said, ldquofuelled the debate around animal welfare.However, he said there had been no indication that it had had an impact on events at Musselburgh, which saw record crowds at its Easter Day racing this year and another sell-out Ladies Day.His report to the committee revealed that the racecourse had reported a loss over the last financial year after it paid over pound, of legal costs relating to the ongoing process by East Lothian Council to find new third-party operators to run the course.Councillor Kenny McLeod questioned why the costs were being met by the course and not the council itself.However, depute chief executive of the council Alex McCrorie told the councillor that the costs were charged to the racecourse because when the new operator was procured it would be the racecourse that benefitted.He conceded to Mr McLeod that, without the legal costs being taken from the coursersquos funds, it would have been in profit last year.East Lothian Council replaced the previous governance committee which oversaw the running of the course with a new committee last year after relations between members of the old committee badly deteriorated and the British Horseracing Authoritythreatening to suspend its racing licence.The new Musselburgh Racing Associated Committeendash which is made up of four elected councillors and two representatives of the racing industry, currently members of Lothians Racing Syndicate ndash has been overseeing the hunt for a new operator.However, the BHA has only granted temporary licences and extensions under the new committee as it continues to monitor its performance.Mr Farnsworth said that the introduction of the new interim committee had caused some problems too. He told the committee: ldquoIt has been dficult attracting sponsorship and corporate hospitality because of the uncertainty however, this seems to be improving."},{"url":null,"title":"mystery-of-hidden-signatures-from-1940-solved-from-new-zealand","story":"Mikey McKinnon, , who owns McKinnon Decorators, was asked by the owners of the property on Eskview Terrace to strip off old woodchip wallpaper and repaint the walls in the hallway.As he got to work, he found that previous decorators had signed and dated their work, as is tradition in the trade.But Mikey, from Edinburgh, was stunned to see that the signatures were almost  years old ndash and curious about the men behind them.The lettering was feint but legible and said: lsquoPapered by David M Steeples A.R.P,  June, , assisted by Robt N Bannerman, R.A.F, L.D.V.rsquoKeen to seehe could find out more as he had to paint over the signatures, he got in touch with the Courier and we appealed for readersrsquo help for information on the duo.And the mystery was solved by Margaret Paterson, , from the Levenhall area of Musselburgh ndash a friend of Mr Steeplesrsquo daughter Jenny Body, who now lives in New Zealand.She had just ed home from visiting Jenny and was told of the newspaper article by her friends George and Florence Wilson, who live in Musselburgh town centre.Margaret said: ldquoBefore I went, I told them about my trip and who I was visiting.ldquoIf I had not, George would not have known the Steeples name and would not have asked methere was a connection with the newspaper article and photograph of the paintersrsquo signatures.The Steeples family had a shop at the top of Links Street and lived above the shop in front of Musselburgh Congregational Church.Margaret lived across the road at  Links Street and she and Jenny, whom she knew as Janet then, were best friends, both attending Musselburgh Grammar School.ldquoI remember her dad as a man in white overalls who was always busy and then he went into the army, said Margaret.Jenny, , emigrated to New Zealand in .Margaret said: ldquoWe lost touch for a while but met up again when she came on one of her visits home.ldquoMy husband died last August and, when I let Jenny know, she immediately asked me out to New Zealand for a visit, which I did in February.Jenny added: ldquoOur first shop belonged to my grandfather and his brother and was on North High Street opposite where The Brunton is now.ldquoThe building is still there and belonged to my great aunt until the s.

I have heard many dferent versions of this tale, and most recently come across one version in a book by Taffy Thomas, who is a renowned storyteller. Here is my version of the story, which I have titled lsquoThe Riddle Rulersquo:IT WAS to be the final race of the tournament. The two knights had been equally matched, and now they would race each other for the prize of a gold cup filled with gold coins.There was an air of excitement as the crowds gathered for this race. Sir John and Sir Harry arrived together, each mounted on their stallions. Sir Johnrsquos horse was called Lightning, while Sir Harryrsquos horse was named Spear.They were equally matched, both knights had won an equal amount of races, and both had won against each other. There was no favourite, everyone knew this race would be very close.The atmosphere was electric with anticipation.Then the kingrsquos storyteller leaned over to whisper in the kingrsquos ear: ldquoYour majesty, this race is the last of the tournament. I feel it should be a race with an extra challenge, so that the crowd are better pleased.The king agreed, but asked the storyteller what he thought the extra challenge should be.ldquoThe race should be a test of the knightsrsquo wits as well as their riding ability, replied the storyteller. ldquoSet them a riddle rule and see how they solve it.ldquoAnd what is the riddle rule to be  asked the king.The storyteller smiled: ldquoDeclare the rules of this race to be thus: the horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and coins for its owner.And so the king declared the riddle rule just before the beginning of the race: ldquoThe horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and gold for its owner.There was a murmuring amongst the spectators. The knights looked at each other, thinking.When the starter flag was lowered and the king cried ldquogo, both knights stayed at the starting line. ldquoYou go first, said Sir John to Sir Harry. ldquoNo, after you, said Sir Harry to Sir John. But neither knight was willing to leave the start line lest they be deemed to be first.Soon there were boos and clapping from the crowd, but the prize was too great for either knight to risk going first.ldquoThis race is no fun, said the king to the storyteller, annoyed now that hersquod agreed to the change in rules.ldquoGive them until this afternoon to find a way to race, replied the storyteller, ldquothere is a way but they must discover it. It will challenge their wits and also their riding skills.And so the king stood: ldquoThe race is postponed until pm this afternoon. The knights must find a way to race to the riddle rule, otherwise the prize will be forfeited.For the rest of the day there was an excited buzz as people began to discuss possible solutions to the riddle rule with the knights.ldquoWhy donrsquot you agree to cross the finish line together  was one suggestionldquoBut then they would be equal first and the prize would be lost, commented another.ldquoBesides, said Sir John, ldquoI do not trust Sir Harry not to pull his horse back at the last moment. ldquoI do not trust you either, said Sir Harry.The deadline was fast approaching and no solution to the riddle rule had been found.ldquoPerhaps being first is more important than winning the gold, said an old woman.The knights looked at each other, thinking about this. Then they both said ldquonaw and shook their heads.It was  minutes before the race and a child came up to the knights and said: ldquoI have an idea. Everyone looked down at the child and laughed. How could a poor child know the answer when the knights themselves and all the spectators were scunnered But the storyteller was walking by and overheard the laughter. ldquoChildrenrsquos wisdom is not to be laughed at, he scolded them.And so the knights asked the child for the solution.The child said two words to the knights.In a flash, the knights got mounted and prepared to race. When the starter flag was lowered and the king shouted ldquogo, both Sir John and Sir Harry raced as fast as they could, each being desperate to be first across the finish line. Their riding skills were well challenged by this race.Who won does not matter in this story. What matters are the two words that were said by the child. They were the answer to the riddle rule, and so made the race possible.What were those two words If you havenrsquot already worked it out then re-read the story carefully. If you still donrsquot know, and want to know the answer, then I will give it next week.Or perhaps you could ask a child. I know some children from P in St Gabrielrsquos Primary School who know the answer to this."},{"url":null,"title":"plan-to-turn-prestonpans-town-hall-into-a-digital-paradise","story":"Prestonpans Community Council is bidding to take control of the High Street venue and turn it into an audio-visual and digital haven.A sub-committee of the community council that was formed when the option for a Community Asset Transferof the Town Hall to the group was first offered has come up with a lsquodigital destinationrsquo concept ndash and garnered positive feedback from the community council.The community council is the only group to have put in a note of interest for the Town Hall, and the sub-committee ndash featuring DJ Johnston Smith, Calum Miller and Professor Roger Bromley ndash has now made public its vision for the building.Their initial idea is to create an audio-visual centre within the Town Hall for gamers and competitions, as well as running educational classes on technology and creating a ldquodigital destination for all with k audio-visual displays, fibreoptic network, high-speed computers, floor space and a cafe.In the subcommittee strategy, the members state: ldquoThe activities which once occupied our Town Hall are not filling it today we need to think creatively to identy new audiences.ldquoAll of the traditional activities can now be accommodated where in our town.ldquoOur Town Hall needs to offer something unique to the community: our challenge is to use our assets to create richer social interactions for all.ldquoWe live in a world where the social networks that helped us advance are increasingly replaced by the digital iety.

History is the way we view and see things that happened in the past. That view is limited by a number of factors. The availability of surviving records and evidence is one.The vast majority of what happened in the past is inevitably lost to us. This is true even for our own personal memories. So history is the small tip of the iceberg of events and times gone by, brought to the surface by the survival of some accounts more than others.And these records are never unbiased. Often historical records and evidence are purposely partial, influenced by ideology and personal allegiances. But all are biased in some way, as the limited viewpoint and interests of those recording events is based on their experience or motives.As a result, we can only see historical events through a narrow keyhole, with most characters and goings on out of view. Itrsquos the common people who are most always invisible in history. Our own ideological preference and belief in what is important will then affect how we interpret the limited evidence we have.This is why history is often subject to furious debate, and rightly so. Irsquod say itrsquos almost impossible not to allow our own perspectives, interests and values to influence the way we interpret the broader meaning of historical events and their signicance for contemporary society.Such a debate is being had in East Lothian just now, as to the name of the new town to be built on the Blindwells site, between Prestonpans and Longniddry and just to the north of Gladsmuir and Tranent.The name can be romantically translated to mean lsquohidden springsrsquo and it was across this once-marshy ground that the Jacobites crept stealthily at night to mount a surprise attack on the Redcoats on September , . That famous battle lasted  minutes and was a victory for the Jacobites, and the launchpad of Bonnie Prince Charliersquos march into England.Consequently, the Scottish Battlefields Trust has submitted a petition, as reported in the Courier last week, to name the new community Charlestoun and build a statue of Charles.When I was at school, he seemed a dashing and heroic figure. The songs and stories about him are infectious and I totally understand how the stories told about him have created a romantic and thrilling image.But then I studied the topic in more depth, at both university and afterwards. The period has suffered from the romantic treatment but there are fascinating stories of loyalty and sacrice to a man who, in reality, saw the common people chiefly as cannon fodder for his personal and family ambitions.It is for this reason I feel there are enough name places and statues to aristocratic and powerful men whose main historical role was to make and wage war, evenhe has a famous and romantic reputation.This is not to say we shouldnrsquot remember the fascinating history of the area, including that fateful day of battle when the Jacobites crossed the land.But itrsquos how we commemorate it and who we include. What makes the Jacobite period truly fascinating is the tapestry of stories of the many people involved, on both sides. It was a brutal time, in which there was certainly deep loyalty on both sides, but there were many other reasons why people found themselves on one side or the other. It was a brutal civil war, brought on by the aspirations of the exiled Stuarts.Do we commemorate the memory of the man who caused that war or do we commemorate those who were caught up in it  Is it really the case thatwe do the former we do the latter  Irsquom not convinced.There are other stories to consider of course for the site. There was coal mining there for generations. The lives of mining families, men, women and children who toiled in horric conditions, still remains mostly unheralded by history. Maybe itrsquos not lsquoromanticrsquo enough. Likewise with farming, which was a constant economic activity in the area for generations.There was also another unusual underground activity on the site after the early mine closed. Smugglers made an illegal whisky still deep down in the mine shaft once it was disused. It took a while for the customs men to realise East Lothian had an illicit whisky-making enterprise deep below ground in the old mine workings. When they finally raided the mine, they found the still, but no sign of the makers of the whisky. It kind of gives new meaning to the name lsquohidden springsrsquo!It is suggested the children in schools should have the final say in the new name, which is a great idea. But let our children be introduced to all aspects of our local history and allow them to understand how the way history is taught influences what we believe is important in contemporary society as well, and that there is no lsquocorrectrsquo view on this.Irsquod love to be part of that discussion and debate."},{"url":null,"title":"parents-launch-petition-school-bus-operator-change","story":"Families whose children attend two secondary schools in East Lothian were stunned to discover that local firm PrenticeCoaches would no longer be used to transport the youngsters when schoolsafter the summer.The news was broken to them by Prentice, which is based in Haddington, last week, sparking a furious reaction from a number of parents.Now a petition has been launched calling for Prentice to have the contract, which has allegedly been awarded to a rival firm, given back.One mother whose children attend Knox Academy in Haddingtonand are bussed in from Gford said that she was shocked by the news.She said: ldquoPrentice have been looking after our children for  years and they are being replaced with no consultation or discussion.ldquoParents know the drivers and trust them to look after their children.ldquoIt is beyond belief that the council would simply put a dferent company in place without even consulting with the families affected.A petition calling for theof Prentice has collected more than  signatures since it was launched online.It says: ldquoPrentice provide a community service where parents feel reassured and comfortable putting their children on the buses.ldquoWe believe East Lothian [Council] has chosen to put cost over service and safety.ldquoThere is absolutely nothing wrong with the current service.ldquoThis is simply a cost-cutting exercise which could potentially put our children at risk.Prentice provided bus services for Knox Academy and North Berwick High School but has now lost the contract for those services.Ross Prentice, the company boss, admitted that he was ldquodisappointed by the councilrsquos decision.The company said: ldquoIt is a sad day.

already addressed any issues that were raised in the consultation and therefore problems raised by the CAR were no longer applicable.There was also a question over whether the premises planned for the new pharmacy at  Bridge Street would be large enough to support the planned two consultation rooms and dispensary area, which the committee felt raised the issue of whether appropriate confidentiality was possible.Letters of support for the pharmacy were submitted by Tranent and Elphinstone Community Council and ward councillor Kenny McLeod among others however, the committee felt that none of these letters ldquospecied needs which were currently not being met.Pharmacy applicant Niamh Morrison visited the community council to thank members for their support over the process and to assure them that she would be launching an appeal.She said: ldquoI am of course very disappointed.ldquoI really believe that this community needs this, and I have developed a real soft spot for the

Irsquom very disappointed.ldquoTranent surgery is not unique in its problems and the pharmacy could have added extra services within the community.David Forrest, chairman of the community council added with regards the letter that the group had drafted to support the application: ldquoThe letters that we wrote came from the heart, we really feel that this was what was best for our community.ldquoWe are incredibly disappointed with the decision, and fully support Niamh in her appeal.ldquoWe will be writing to our local MP and MSP to register our frustration at the situation.ldquoThe decision is very short-sighted.The decision comes as planning permission in principle has been approved for  houses at Windygoul South, though the committee determined that both Lloyds and Well Tranent were able to increase capacity should ldquoproposed housebuilding occur locally.Ward councillor Kenny McLeod said: ldquoWith the new houses on their way, the town will need extra pharmacies and more GPs.ldquoIrsquom so disappointed that the pharmacy has been rejected, I really think we need

underlying concerns of the offshore workforce and have raised specic issues with employers on their behalf.\"However, we do not believe a public inquiry into helicopter safety would, at this time, add to the signicant streams of work being undertaken by the Civil Aviation Authority, unions, operators and other stakeholders in developing and implementing a range of safety measures to address concerns that have been raised.ldquoWe also recognise that stakeholders, such as the Oil and Gas Authority, Step Change for Safety and Oil and Gas UK, continue to work to further encourage

This is down two per cent from the  research. To put this into perspective, there has been a remarkable change in attitudes regarding same-sex relationships that only received full support by  per cent of those asked in . If this research is accurate, we have moved, in the space of a generation, from around one in  people thinking same sex relationships are not wrong at all to today when two thirds of people think this. But the suggestion is that this trend may be coming to an end.On the matter of the liberalisation of attitudes regarding the transgender community, the researchers say there is still some way to go, with only  per cent of those asked saying that they viewed prejudice against transgender people as lsquoalways wrongrsquo.One of the dficulties and indeed confusions with this research is the use of the term liberalism. When the survey began in  it was both liberal and radical to support gay rights. Lesbian and gay people continued to face police harassment, political and media condemnation, and pressure to remain in the closet. Consequently, gay liberation embodied a sentiment and a politics of liberation and freedom ndash freedom from the authorities, the censors and the police.Today in comparison, LGBT issues are often experienced as a form of outrage and offence taking ndash less a form of freedom than an imposition of lsquocorrectrsquo attitudes, of the censoring of speakers and academics, of Twitter storms demanding sackings and resignations, indeed as a matter of policing of words and attitudes with the full support of the political establishment. If there is a slow down in support for same-sex relationships, it may be less to do with the re-emergence of traditional views than a reaction against the illiberalism of todayrsquos ersity campaigners and police.In this regard, the fact that only  per cent of those surveyed said prejudice against transgender people is always wrong is of note. One would think this means there is a high level of bigotry and intolerance towards trans people. But on the contrary, despite this figure,  per cent of people also said that they are not prejudiced at all towards transgender people.When being liberal not only means allowing people to live as they please but being forced to accept something you do not believe, like the idea that men can be women and women can be men, then liberalism loses its meaning and we find that those who call themselves liberal are experienced as the new oppressors. In this respect many of these reactions in this survey do not reflect a loss of liberalism but a more genuine and liberal reaction to the new authoritarians."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-general-embarrassment","story":"WE asked for your stories about France following Bastille Day, and a Livingston reader tells us: \"On July , , having spent a fortnights holiday in Nice, we made our way to the taxi rank for a taxi to the airport.

Shamefully, three per cent of women asked the same question re: Ms Williams and a quick tennis version of a kick about said they too would take a point.Still, it may not be zero but its a darn sight better than one in eight.We are in the grip of a highly visible spate of male self-aggrandisement. The President of the United States is an under-qualied, over-promoted balloon, telling congresswomen of colour that they should go back to where they came from. Dear God, lets hope they dontthe retort. If Trump arrives back to the Isle of Lewis well have to evacuate the islanders to safety.We look certain to have Trump Lite as our next prime minister, a Latin-spouting Boris Johnson, inappropriate at every turn. The two men, with their caricature hairstyles, the Tweedledum and Tweedledee of transatlantic cousins.When concerns are raised about closing the attainment gap or widening access in order to promote more young people from less well-off backgrounds and more women into senior positions, I often wonder why were not having a top down conversation.Why arent we asking how we thin out the numbers of mediocre men squatting in positions that could be more ably occupied by those who have merit, not over-confidence and connections.At the bottom of this masculine overachieving is a deep insecurity. An insecurity that comes from knowing men arent really necessary. They are merely a decorative addition to the planet, their only purpose their reproductive aid to the female. Dont email me: its science.Last month scientists revealed that men would be unnecessary should we come to colonise Mars. Sperm, it turns out, suffers no ill effects from microgravity.Researchers from Dexeus Womenrsquos Health in Barcelona showed that once sperm is collected and frozen, it will survive quite happily the trip into outer space.NASA has previously, according to Helen Sharman, the first Briton in space, looked into the optimum dynamics of crews in long-term space travel.Its research found it was best to have all male or all female teams.Women, it was found, would be the better option due to our superior cooperation skills.The boys, you see, would all be fussing over who was in charge. While men are found to be better at short, goal-oriented missions, for a task as time consuming as colonising space, you need women.We also take up fewer resources, given our typically smaller size so need less food, less oxygen and produce less waste. We suffer less from the worst physical side effects of spaceflight, such as sight loss.Most importantly, you cant populate another world without the female of the species while the males contribution can be stored for later use without the worst physical side effects of having to put up with men during the journey.The future of humanity lies in an intergalactic matriarchy, and isnt that enough to make the menfolk inclined to overstate their worth The YouGov poll demonstrates women have a far greater grip on reality than men, perhaps because of constantly having to justy ourselves. Say, the American footballer Megan Rapinoe. Male footballers engage in a iety of outrageous behaviours but lads will be lads.Ms Rapinoe fails to make eye contact with a fan as she signed a football and shes lambasted. In an attempt at charity, perhaps the men are demonstrating an impressive optimism.But... optimism needs its basis in reality. Reach for the stars, yes. Blindly rely on the notion of male meritocracy  No.There must be some part of the male psyche that realises that, while they try to undermine and belittle women, this is because they cant cope with the notion that women might be more than their equal.On balance, though, Id be perfectly happy for men to live in a fantasy world where they might beat a pre-eminent female sportswoman at her game based on nothing but self-delusion.It might distract them just enough from the delusion they could successfully run the country."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-brussels-far-preferable-westminster","story":"As for his suggestion that Scotlands laws will be controlled from Brussels, well, try telling that to the French or Germans or any of the other independent nations of Europe.

If he or anyone  thinks that abandoning our EU membership will give the UK more control of its future when negotiating with the US or China then they have another think coming. We currently have a voice in Brussels, we will have none in Washington, Beijing or even Brussels for that matter.As for an independent Scotland taking its orders from Brussels rather than Westminster, well thats OK by me. From where I sit Brussels looks like a beacon of good governance, compared to the basket case which is the UK governed by an English parliamentat Westminster.John Jamieson, Ayr.THE dficulty of Alan Fitzpatrickrsquos letter is summed up in one sentence, ldquoWhy can they not come clean and admit that by the former what they are seeking is separation from the UK, and by the latter they mean the substitution of control from Brussels to that at present from Westminster Westminster and Brussels are by no means identical. Westminster is an all-encompassing political union which can legislate on any matter it chooses, but the European Union is a treaty-based economic union with powers limited and controlled by member states. These include product standards and composition, product labelling, rights of movement and residence of EU citizens, company law, banking regulation, consumer protection, animal welfare, farm payments and managing the fish stocks in member statesrsquo fishing grounds. This sounds like a lot , however its main purpose is to ensure trade can be carried out fairly, and that for instance, no country attempts to achieve success by limiting employee rights or producing goods and services to a lower standard than others. It does not, however, include such as education, welfare, defence or foreign policies.Mr Fitzpatrickrsquos claim that the EU is on a ldquomarch hellip toward an ever-closer union is hypothetical at best, requiring the future agreement of the member states. In contrast Westminsterrsquos powers, within the UK, are to all intents infiniteLastly, he raises the issue that ldquoin the UK Scotland doesnrsquot get the government that they themselves voted for, how is that going to change in the EU  and there is no doubt that there would be times when the balance of members we elect to the European Parliament will not be reflected in its final majority. That though is not the most important point.The fact that one member of the UK ndash England ndash constitutes almost  per cent of the population meansthat there is clarity there about their aims then, pretty much no matter what the other member states think, they will achieve their aims. This could be clearly seen in the EU referendum, when evenwe deduct the Leave vote in Walesand in Northern Irelandthere would still be a majority for Leave in the UK! To repeat,there is a dference of opinion between the member states of the UK, England is well large enough to get its own way eventhere is only a slight majority there. Even Germany lacks that power in the EU. The UK is anything but a Union of equals.Mr Fitzpatrick claims that by ldquotake back control independence supporters mean ldquothe substitution of control from Brussels to that at present from Westminster, when the reality is we seek control ing to Scotland while sharing our sovereignty with the EU on its agreed range of issues, securing access to one of the worldrsquos largest markets, which the UK is minded to sacrice.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.ALAN Fitzpatrick is missing the point re dressing up spades. If Scotland were independent, we could decide to apply to join the EU or not - our choice. Whatever was decided, it would be Scotlands decision, no need to go cap in hand to Westminster to seek permission.That is taking back control: our decisions made by us and us alone.John McCallum, Glasgow.ALAN Fitzpatrick contends that Scotland would not be independenta member of the European Union by that reasoning, Mr Fitzpatrick must also believe that Denmark, Portugal, Finland, Estonia, Ireland and all the other EU member countries are not independent nations. I would remind Mr Fitzpatrick that during negotiations with the UK, every EU country had the right of veto, and all of them stood solidly behind Ireland in its particular set of circumstances, while Scotlands overwhelming vote to remain within the EU was pointedly ignored by the UK government at Westminster.And though membership of the EU is of vital importance to Scotland, there are other benefits of being an independent nation on the world stage Monaco, with a population of , actively participates in the United Nations, and is a member of many international organisations, including the World Health Organisation, and Unesco.

After which, all offshore casinos offering their services to players in the country but not holding a Dutch issued license would technically become illegal and subject to punitive measures, such as fines.Operators Interested in the MoveUnlike some nations, who have decided that only operators based inside the countries in question can apply for licenses the Dutch have decided that every operator in the worldshould have the right to apply for a license. That by no means assumes that every operator will be successful, and the fees associated with such permits could determine how many go all the way through the licensing process. To date, around about  companies have expressed an initial interest in a license. Of those, approximately about  are thought to be seriously in contention to acquire said permits when the process begins.Dutch Gambling Industry is Set to Debut in Thus far, the KSA has encouraged all operators to begin the licensing process early. That process has already started, with the potential future Dutch gambling authority eager to know how many interested parties there are and to allow themselves time to process license requests. Those licenses are expected to be handed out in , ahead of the official opening of the Dutch online gambling industry in January .The Heraldencourages readers to gamble responsibly.

This was a substantial commitment but was vital for Scotland’s long term interests, preparing ourselves for the challenges of an ageing population. We’ve recently extended free personal care to cover all those who are assessed as needing it, no matter their age.MSPs also charted a dferent course when, following a change of administration in , parliament voted to scrap tuition fees in Scotland, restoring Scotland’s long and proud tradition of free education.Similarly, the decision to abolish prescription charges brought to an end what was little more than a tax on ill health. The NHS of course is the greatest, and most valued, example of a universal service where care is provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay. Our health service, like others across the world, faces challenges. But it is a real achievement of the Scottish Parliament that we have resisted the marketization moves south of the border while ensuring that under the current government Scotland’s AE departments are the best performing in theUK.On other occasions, the Parliament has led the UK in making bold policy choices, such as the ban on smoking in public places. Our Climate Change Act includedthe most ambitious emissions reduction targets of any legislature in the world and, as Health Secretary, I was heavily involved in the campaign to introduce a minimum unit price for alcohol, which we knew would play a key role in tackling Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with drink – another world leading measure.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"As the Scottish Parliament prepares to celebrate its th anniversary, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on both its journey and her own.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on  years of the Scottish Parliament viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"It took a decade of hard work to make this policy a reality and I am personally very proud of the campaign, working with stakeholders, to persuade MSPs to back minimum pricing, as well as overcoming a legal challenge that went all the way to the Supreme Court.I am personally committed to making sure every child and young person in Scotland gets the best possible start in le. We have already delivered an increase in free, high quality childcare for all three and four year olds and extending entitlement to eligible two year olds and will increase it further before the end of this parliament.Scotland has also become a much safer society under devolution. Recorded crime has fallen to some of the lowest levels seen since the s. In particular, non-sexual violent crime has fallen substantially, thanks in no small part to the excellent work of the Violence Reduction Unit, which was established over a decade ago with cross-party support and is now being copied across the UK.In recent years, new powers have come to the Scottish Parliament and with those powers come increased responsibilities for MSPs to deliver for the people ofScotland.Income tax policy is now a key feature of the annual Scottish budget. We’ve used these new powers to introduce a fairer income tax policy, with most people paying less tax than they would south of the border – while continuing to raise revenue to support investment in the economy and public services.Last year Parliament passed the wide-ranging Social Security Act, paving the way for devolution of a number of benefits, as well as creating a number of newbenefits such as increased carers’ support allowance and best start grants for families with young children – and a new social security agency to deliver them. This new agency has a culture of dignity and respect at its heart and early feedback from service users has been overwhelmingly positive.I also appointed the first gender balanced Scottish cabinet and we are encouraging more women to stand for parliament, and bring a better balance to ourpublic le.Over the course of the Scottish Parliament consistent action has been taken to ensure communities have the opportunity to own the land they live and work on.Many communities have benefited from the right to buy that now covers rural and urban communities.Of course, the foundation of our country is a strong and resilient economy. That’s why we have slashed or abolished business rates for , premises –saving almost £. billion for our small businesses.We have invested in our infrastructure with all governments building new schools and hospitals and, of course, the iconic Queensferry Crossing.And, to help make sure we have the workforce we need for years to come, we have delivered just over a quarter of a million Modern Apprenticeships in the lastdecade.In April this year, new legislation to tackle controlling and coercive behaviour came into effect, giving Scotland some of the most robust domesticabuse legislation in the world.I’m also proud of the many steps we’ve taken to make Scotland a fairer society, including the introduction of equal marriage rights – attending one of the first same-sex weddings in Scotland is a memory that will stay with me for a long time.And we all worked together over many years to help Glasgow successfully host the  Commonwealth Games. This helped to inspire Scots to get more active,delivered new facilities and put Scotland on the world stage. It was a sight to behold.My final achievement is perhaps harder to quanty. There is no doubt that the re-establishment of Scotland’s parliament has profoundly changed our political culture for the better, with our nation’s lawmakers much more accessible to those they represent. It has also enabled us to have conversations we wouldn’t have had and to debate our own future, with the  independence referendum generating an increase in democratic engagement.Looking ahead, we now face the signicant challenges posed by Brexit which, of course, Scotland’s people and parliament overwhelmingly oppose. Given the long-term damage that Brexit will cause to Scotland, and the material change in circumstances this represents, I believe it is only fair that people are given the choice of whether to become an independent country. Indeed, the current SNP Government was elected on a clear manesto commitment that people should be offered that choice should Scotland be taken out of the EU against its will. Polls consistently show that people living here believe the decision on whether to hold a referendum should be a matter for Holyrood and not Westminster. Twenty years after it came into being, that is an important measure of the way people in Scotland view the Parliament and one that the new UK Prime Minister would do well to heed."},{"url":null,"title":"traffic","story":"The final section of the Aberdeen bypass is not expected to open until January.Traffic and Travel   wrapper  ,  wrapper...Bypass sections to open on WednesdayTransport Scotland has announced that new sections of the delayed Aberdeen bypass will open on Wednesday morning.Traffic and Travel   wrapper  ,  wrapper...Aberdeen bypass: No date yet for openingNorth-East MSPs have met Transport Secretary Michael Matheson to emphasise the urgency of work to ensure the Aberdeen bypass is opened as soon as possible.Traffic and Travel   wrapper  ,  wrapper...data-size\"x\"data-unitname\"  inverurie.jp native\"data-label\"Section\"data-categories\"\" data-status\"enabled\"data-dfpId\"\" data-overlay\"\"data-dfpSiteCode\"inverurie.jp\"data-isResponsiveSite\"true\"A options to go on displayA series of public exhibitions will be held next month for residents to view a number of initial options that have been developed for the A.Traffic and Travel   wrapper  ,  wrapper...Proposals for AWPR bus service announcedStagecoach is inviting customers across Aberdeenshire to provide feedback on new bus timetable proposals planned to come into force in November.Traffic and Travel   wrapper  ,  wrapper...AWPR lsquodelayrsquo under fireThe Scottish Government has been accused of #losing all control# of the Aberdeen bypass project.Traffic and Travel   wrapper  ,  wrapper...Survey suggests transport links are poorA survey of Newmachar residents has shown that nearly two thirds believe the main A road is too congested, while a majority don#t feel public transport links are good enough.Traffic and Travel   wrapper  ,  wrapper...Community events to mark bypass openingA weekend of community events will be held to mark the opening of the Aberdeen bypass.Traffic and Travel   wrapper  ,  wrapper...Be vigilant as surface dressing gets underway across the ShireAberdeenshire Council#s summer programme of surface dressing works is now underway across the area and motorists are being warned of the risks of loose chips on newly dressed roads.Traffic and Travel   wrapper  ,  wrapper...Bus company launches contactless paymentsStagecoach has introduced contactless payments on their buses.Traffic and Travel   wrapper  ,  wrapper...Bypass work continues despite liquidationWork on the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Routewill continue despite this week#s announcement that construction giant Carillion has gone into liquidation.Traffic and Travel   wrapper  ,  wrapper...BEAR Scotland preparing for Storm CarolineBEAR Scotland#s resources are prepared to assist in dealing with the #Storm Caroline# conditions with winds of up to mph forecast.Traffic and Travel   wrapper  ,  wrapper...Have your say on bus proposalsStagecoach is inviting customers across the area to provide feedback on new bus timetable proposals to commence from January .Traffic and Travel   wrapper  ,  wrapper...A average speed cameras set to go liveThe A Average Speed Camerasystem between Dundee and Stonehaven will go live on Tuesday, October .Traffic and Travel   wrapper  ,  wrapper...Resurfacing work to begin on roundaboutsResurfacing work on the A Blackhall and Inverurie roundabouts will begin this Sunday for six nights.Traffic and Travel   wrapper  ,  wrapper...Road to close this weekend for AWPR workThe CC Chapel of Stoneywood to Fairly Road is expected to close at its junction with the UC Tulloch Road this weekend.Traffic and Travel   wrapper  ,  wrapper...More action needed on air pollutionEnvironmental groups and The Scottish Greens have called on the UK Government to do more to tackle air pollution.Traffic and Travel   wrapper  ,  wrapper...Rail passengers give Scotrail the thumbs upAt  per cent, Scotrail#s passenger satisfaction is back to its normal high levels, according to a new poll.Traffic and Travel   wrapper  ,  wrapper...

And I understand that it is very unfortunate that this problem, while unrelated to the air traffic controllers’ industrial action, has coincided with it. However, that is not much consolation to frustrated users of the service.“The issue here is that this is a leline service and there are no alternatives for people who simply have to fly. Local people and businesses in the Northern Isles need a reliable service, and we simply cannot afford local service-levels to be reduced. We accept that we have to live with unavoidable weather events, but the recent disruptions have been workforce-related.“HIAL is a Scottish Government-owned organisation and one of the reasons for that is a recognition that it provides a strategically critical part of our transport infrastructure in the Highlands and Islands. It’s way past time for ministers to take a long hard look at the situation and reassure us that they are prepared to intervene on behalf of the travelling public.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The schemes are designed to protect electricity consumers in the North of Scotland from high costs of distribution in their area. In   this was done by providing an annual assistance amount of £ million to consumers in the area, which Ofgem estimates is worth around £ per household.Mr McArthur said: “It is simply unfair for islanders to be surcharged when so many households in our island communities already experience the highest levels of fuel poverty anywhere in the country.“If these plans are implemented, it will be good news for consumers across the highlands and islands.

The move is a result of a partnership with the organisation PAMISwhich campaigns for these facilities, and has been supported by Transport Scotland.The move comes as a result of research highlighting that , people in the UK need such special assistance and facilities. Users include people with profound and multiple learning disabilities and people with a range of other disabilities including Cerebral Palsy, Motor Neurone disease, Multiple Sclerosis, stroke, some older people and other specic disabilities.The requirements are set out in British Standards, and include:The new toilets are already open on deck six of MV Hjaltland and MV Hrossey, and will be available on board MV Hamnavoe by the end of the year.“This investment is another sign of our commitment to making our facilities as welcoming as possible to everyone in the community,# said Stuart Garrett, managing director at Serco NorthLink Ferries.#It will open up opportunities for many people with disabilities and their familes to visit some of the most beautul parts of Scotland. It also supports those living on the islands when travelling to and from the mainland for leisure and essential healthcare.”The move is the latest in a series of measures aimed at improving journeys for all travelers. Earlier this month the company became the first Scottish transport operator to introduce the pioneering Neatebox support service. This followed improvements to the NorthLink website, disability awareness training for staff, and a new partnership with a sign language interpreting agency.Mum and carer Jenny Whinnet, who helped to start the PAMIS campaign  years ago, said: #This is an exciting development for families and carers.#It permits people who need these facilities to travel further afield confidently and with dignity. This is very dferent to the early years of this campaign, when it was so dficult for me to travel with my son Craig because there were no Changing Places toilets available.”Jenny Miller, Chief Executive Officer of PAMIS added: “We’ve been very impressed with the commitment and consideration shown by Serco NorthLink Ferries in developing changing places toilets on their ferries.#They have really listened to the stories from the families and people we work with and who feel excluded from so many activities that we all take for granted. We’re delighted that the Orkney and Shetland ferries will be the first in the country, and possibly the world, to have a Changing Places toilet.”Paul Wheelhouse, minister for energy, connectivity and the islands is pleased to see the new facilities up and running.He said: #This type of improvement is exactly why we set up the Ferries Accessibility Fund.#We know accessible travel not only enables people to enjoy equal access to our beautul country, but it also enables people to fully participate in society and improve the quality of their lives, so we want to continue to identy and remove any disabling barriers which prevent people from making journeys or lead to them having an unpleasant time on board.#It’s very important that Scotland’s ferry services are fully accessible, offering the best passenger experience possible to everyone and this targeted investment marks very welcome progress on that journey.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He will be the most viscerally anti-EU this country has known. Britain has already become a global laughing stock, but with Johnson in charge, it will be dangerously so. We need to register our protest, and fast.A demonstration is planned for London on  July – No to Johnson, yes to Europe. That pretty much sums up the views of the vast majority of people in Scotland. Our nation voted overwhelmingly remain, and our decision must be respected. Johnson’s elevation to leader is the result of more than  years of planning, which has included a host of untruths and inventions, as journalist then politician. More recently, it is the culmination of three years of scheming, in which he became the poster boy for a Leave campaign that adopted the most hysterical and specious claims.Since then, the anti-Europeans and the recently convertedhave claimed that Brexit is the will of the people. But is it  It certainly isn’t the will of the people of Scotland, or Northern Ireland, where the Remain votes were far more decisive than the narrow  per cent UK-wide Leave vote.If they were so sure that now, with all the facts at their disposal, people south of the border would vote again to quit the EU, then why are they so scared to test the proposition  Because they know that, from the £ million per week for the NHS on the battle bus to other distortions, their claims would be rumbled.: Why Boris Johnson poses as big a threat to the Union as SNP – Lesley Laird: Journalist Boris Johnson discussed helping to have assaulted demands apologyThat was the past. The present is even more scary. Johnson will be voted in by . per cent of the population, a tiny rump of barely over , mainly elderly, white, male, diehard Conservative members, who seem to be quite prepared to pull up the drawbridge of opportunity for our children and grandchildren. As a recent YouGov survey pointed out, for many Tory activists, “delivering” Brexitmatters more than economic well-being.This Saturday might seem a strange time to hold a rally, but it comes three days before the announcement of the new prime minister. Imagine what message we would be sending outwe did nothing  If we sat on our hands and allowed the moment to happen without registering our alarm.Boris Johnson will move quickly, ordering civil servants to step up preparations for a no-deal Brexit. He will invite the EU to “negotiate” with him, even though they have said the Withdrawal Agreement was signed by both sides in good faith and cannot be amended. He will then harrumph in his inimitable style and head us to the clf edge. He will have the hardliners jump for joy, while many Tory moderateswill make allowances for him and go along with it all. Westminster should resume in September, but Johnson hasn’t ruled out shutting down Parliament in order to push through his catastrophic no-deal. Democracy is under threat.Last week’s disgraceful events, in which the UK’s Ambassador to the USA was forced to resign, is just a glimpse into the chaotic, dysal leadership we would have under Johnson. His record in office leaves a trail of diplomatic destruction and shows he is unfit for the office of Prime Minister.And what about the voters  The  July demo will be dferent from those that have gone before. This is the people sending a message to the powerful, not the other way round. They want to make the positive, passionate case for Europe, for the good it has done, the opportunities it provides – while also being mindful of changes that need to be made.They also want to express their frustration at the fact that while the UK Government has fixated on Brexit, it has failed to focus on the job they are supposed to be doing. Almost no legislation has been passed, no serious measures have been taken to improve living standards, while so much parliamentary time and energy has been devoted to the Brexit crisis.In March, we got a leline from the EU and extra time was granted to sort out this mess. We called for an urgent second EU referendum to take place, but instead the Tories have used the time to have an internal civil war. Parliament is not ing and the Government is crumbling. As the clock runs down to exit day in October, the threat of a no-deal hangs heavy over Scotland. We know it would be devastating and threaten up to , jobs. No government should be so reckless to consider this outcome, let alone actively promote it. We cannot solve the big global challenges such as the climate emergency, security threats and trade disputes when acting alone. That is why the SNP’s vision is of Scotland as a European nation. That is why we say Yes to Europe and No to Johnson.Stephen Gethins is SNP spokesperson for Foreign Affairs and Europe in the House of Commons and MP for North-East Fe©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"how a giant of labour s past can help scotland today richard leonard","story":"Affordable council and public housing will be a pillar of the next Scottish Labour Government#s plans, writes Richard Leonard.A new report by the Centre for Labour and Social Studiespublished last week, explores what it means to be ‘working class’. The report notes that  years have passed since the creation of the term, but it also reveals that over much of the th century, the lived experience of working people improved – a trend that has reversed in the past  years.I am often asked what – and who – I am referring to when I talk about the working class. The truth is, it is people from every ethnic background, British born or migrants, all genders, all sexualities, and people who live in every part of our country. Fundamentally, however, it is people who are paid for their labour, and as such I would say by this economic definition that the majority of people in Scotland are working class.The Class research highlights four common themes experienced by working people: precariousness, prejudice, power and place.Last week also marked the centenary of the first council housing introduced by the Liberals, although it was Labour’s  Housing Act led by John Wheatley, which heralded the real breakthrough. : This is what’s causing Edinburgh’s housing crisis – Professor Clf Hague: Here’s how we can end Scotland’s housing crisis – Tammy Swt-AdamsThis Act was the first legislation ever introduced by Labour in power aimed at transforming the lives of working people. With its -year plan for council house building funded by rising subsidies from central to local government, it stirred hope at a time of depression. Many of the great themes which guided Wheatley’s political le came together in the Housing Act. He was a socialist not because of books that he read but his personal experience of poverty. He nonetheless recognised the inspiring role of ideas and vision in politics. He also campaigned for a Living Wage and redistributive taxation, citing social inequality – “starving in the midst of plenty” – as the primary cause of economic slump. He understood the importance of practical socialism and he took his formative thinking in Glasgow and translated it into a national action plan. The aim of a Labour housing policy, Wheatley wrote, “is not to rescue people from the slums but to prevent them getting there”.Wheatley, who had been a Glasgow councillor prior to being a member of parliament, always understood that government – local or central – could provide the secure, affordable homes so needed. In his proposals for workmen’s cottages funded by the surpluses of the Glasgow Corporation Tramway Department, there is a more than a glimpse of the possibilities for a national council housing programme at affordable rents which he would later bring to fruition. Until the  Act’s subsidy provisions were withdrawn a decade later, more than half a million houses were built under its terms. A remarkable success.It is not surprising that a former councillor, with his le experience, focused on housing for the working class. Today,you speak to any local councillor and ask what is the most common topic that constituents raise: it is most likely to be housing.Affordable secure housing was part of the social justice improvement for working people and selling off council stock and not replacing it is part of the reversal. The result is that we now have a chronic shortage of affordable homes. Housing is taking up an ever-larger share of working people’s smaller pay packets.Young people particularly feel the negative impact of this reversal of fortunes, especially regarding housing. More young people are living in the private rented sector or with their parents due to the lack of affordable housing. Their employment is all too often that of low pay and insecure. Zero-hours contracts have grown exponentially. And children growing up in poverty are now more likely to have a parent working than not.For decades, we’ve been told that inequality doesn’t matter because the education system will allow talented and hard-working people to succeed whatever their background. But the greater inequality has become, the more entrenched it has become.Education is one of the most powerful means we have to overcome disadvantage. But our current system is mirroring and reinforcing the inequality in our society. The privileged remain privileged while people from working-class backgrounds are denied opportunities.The Scottish Parliament could be doing much more to address the challenges that people are experiencing. We need to build solidarity once again so a shared identity can emerge from shared conditions but also from shared values, a shared history of past struggles and of past victories, we must rebuild a willingness to support each other, and a sense of pride in and belonging to local neighbourhoods.The SNP Government has introduced a socio-economic duty on public bodies in Scotland to take account of equality issues such as gender, ethnicity, disability etc.But on class, the Government’s interim guidelines concluded: “This is, however, more dficult to measure and will require further consideration as to how we build it into assessment.” Too many working class people are still dying prematurely and poverty is often at the root of it. I want to eradicate poverty and inequality in Scotland. And making a long-term programme for affordable council and public housing to remove the experience of housing precariousness – just as John Wheatley did in  – will be one pillar of the next Scottish Labour Government’s objectives.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nan shepherd s masterpiece of nature writing is an inspiration leader comment","story":"Scotland and the rest of the world seem to be slowly waking up to Nan Shepherd and the wonder that she managed to find in Scotland#s mountains.Her book The Living Mountain was published in , more than  years after it was written, but despite the passage of time, this masterpiece of nature writing still has the power to inspire many of its readers.Now adventurer Elise Wortley plans to follow in Shepherd’s footsteps in the Cairngorms – dressed in tweed clothing, eating war-time rations and equipped with a wooden backpack and canvas tent. : Adventurer to follow in footsteps of trailblazing nature writer Nan ShepherdShe will climb the six highest Cairngorm peaks and spend a further  days “just living in the mountains” on a trip that will raise money for Scottish Women’s Aid.In this world of sometimes bewildering technology, there is much to be said for ing – at least occasionally – to a simpler time and seeking out the kind of tranquil joy that can be found in the simplicity and beauty of the natural world,not in person, then through the beautul descriptions of writers as skilled as Shepherd.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"unemployment remains lower in scotland than rest of uk","story":"Unemployment in Scotland is now .% lower than the UK as a whole as the jobs market north of the border continues to boom.The number of Scots out of work fell by  to , between March andMay this year.

Daily Mail!! grow up. Ask yourself the following question, how does today#s GlobalWarming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age  Anyone who cannot answer that question is too ignorant to hold an informed opinion on today#s climate change.Stops PC Plod and the band of merry men, from going in with batons to quell the grown-ups waffling on about, why their leader Comrade Corbyn inspires them with his words.How about giving them a half decent education concentrating on sciencesubjects. Then they would have an informed and considered opinion, not just the usual Greenwash so popular with the ignorant. If gted they may even go on to contribute with useful research and technological ideas so unlike are present green, ignorant and wholly ill-informed flock in thecouncil chamberAn area of industry which has not been looked into with any proper statistical information is thisof Agriculture. This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form. One of mine wanted to go, the other didn#t. One asked a question at the Town Hall and I am very proud # not that she had to protest # but that she had the courage to do so, and silence many there.Well done young folk # out of the mouths of babes as they say.It hardly takes any courage to join a protest, especially one being encouraged and congratulated onby so many folk! The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed. A bit like supergluing yourself tp a bus or train, outstanding!!!I didnt say it took courage to join a protest, I said it takes courage to speak at the Town Hall. Andit was about time off school, they all would have gone. Please have more respect for our bairns and young folk.And these bairns are, for your information, studying the stem subjects at school.It is not a case of having respect for the bairns, Johan Adamson. It is just a case of having absolutely no respect whatsoever for those who politicise them and drive them like sheep. Primary children used in a political strike!! Repulsive behaviour, you should be ashamed, so socialist, child exploitation is the words that come to mind.They had to complete a form, primary children! What next, form a political Union and become militant  Little Orwellian sheep bleating for the Pigs.These were AHS pupils Ian, not primary pupils, and no one has politicised them.Educated them yes, but then I forgot you have the monopoly on climate change education and stem subjects.The organisers were I think over , so young adults.The fact is I will always criticise revolting behaviourand ignorance and I am not referring to the children.Yes I do believe sixth year pupils are capable of organising thisWhy do you assume Ian that these bairns are not studying stem subjects and that only you know about climate change then Ian Infantile comments  Pot kettle springs to mind.Now just who printed these forms the children had to fill in  Which teachers OKed the strike and arrange for Brae and Aith schools also took part, as well as bairns from the Sound Primary School and organised and paid for transport  I do not believe that was AHS sixteen-year-olds for one second.Whether by accident or design this provides a very convenient fig leaf for the council#s lamentable performance on child poverty.Much was made of the #children#s march# at the SIC#s education committee meeting today however in a news report about the part of the same meeting that dealt with the council#s child poverty action report, it was clear that the council have done next to nothing since the Shetland Inequalities Commission reported in March .know. All these admirable young citizens are guilty of is taking a stand based on commonly accepted information. I could ask what special knowledge does Ian think he has that allows him to lord it over them# but nerves fail me.On Ian’s earlier point, it is self-evident thatwe need some people with a high level of competence in STEM subjects who can take critical stand on matters scientic. Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course. Nuclear Free Council, Declair Climate emergency,climate justice what a load of utter bunkum. Especially stop allowing political activists to exploit our children.I put forward the question : Is nuclear power the only solution to stop greenhouse gas emissions and the only way to stop climate change progressing further  It may be the worse case scenario in terms of our power demand solution, but what are the alternatives to our demand for energy without causing further environmental and ecological damage to the planet by in using fossil fuels or cleaner alternatives like wind or solar   It has been suggested the Sahara Desert could be used for solar energy to power Europe, but how much land would be required and could this be expanded  The alternatives to fossil fuels may be cleaner, but how would this affect global weather patterns or the depletion of species due to the destruction of natural habitats being replaced for energy production Very sadly the SG SNP has committed to wind energy with its catastrophic environmental damage and only intermittent supply, but that is the policy of the scientically ignorant and utterly stupid.Thank you for your comments, Ian. I fear humanity will have no choice but to go nuclear for its energy production in the future.Alternative resources, like wind or solar, may be the short term answer, but as mentioned, the downside to this is the large amount of land which will be required with the ability to vastly expand as demand increases. What would be the environmental damage and the destabilization of le on the planet have in the long term with such technologies  There is also the issue of economics dictating progress on future energy production, and would this be counter-productive due profits taking priority over progress and the reduction of the pollution into the environment  I agree with your comments Ian, in regard to nuclear based energy production. However, like many issues to do with progress, something catastrophic will have to take place before we realize we should have acted sooner.There it is again, the abusive and arguably ignorant use of that word “stupid”. Having reread all contributions above it seems Ali denies there’s a problem by saying there are dangerously low CO levels, John distracts by arguing the council should care more for child poverty, and Ian disparages, disparages and disparages again. Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet Ian’s singular approach is getting between him and his key message. I’ve long been puzzling as to what makes the good doctorso determined to overuse petty insult so freely, but it would be helpful to know just whathis specic problem with climate change protests is. If he could but answer his own Ice Age question to Brian , his motive might become a little clearer. And apologies in advance to Ianhe has already made his point and I’ve missed it, but it wasn’t me who thought it smart to surround it with invective. Wouldn’t it be just lovelyIan could contribute tolerantly without using putdowns  It’s almost as though he needs them to build himself up# Oh. Hold on# Eureka!#Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet # What a plonker, Peter, just cannot resist going political. Is thisLabour or SNP talking, he often points in both directions or is he now Green Maybe the characters on here who hate the idea of young people protesting about climate change should head down to the school and start shouting some of this stuff over the wall.But, then again, that might make them see . . . well . . . insane.Folk writing to the paper to have a go at the protesters is one of the most depressing contributions to local public debate imaginable.Hopefully, though, the usual naysayerswill only encourage them to do it more.There#s nothing wrong with anyone, of any age, having an opinion on whatever they like, and expressing it. But in their own time, only.The problem with this is that participation in this protest was permitted and facilitated,not encouraged by the education authority, which by default is an endorsement of the opinion being expressed in the protest and the timing method by which the protest was made, by the education authority.Education authorities and schools are supposed to be impartial, by granting #authorised absence# status to a politically motivated protest, that impartiality is now seriously called in to question and a dangerous precedent has been set.There was no reason other than a cynical publicity stunt for this protest to take place during the school day. If those still at school feel strongly enough to organise a protest like adults do, that#s fine, let them, but also like adults, it#ll have to happen in their own time, or they suffer the consequences of #unauthorised absence#, for it to be taken seriously.If they want to play in the big bad world, they play by the big bad world#s rules, not by special favours like this was.Only a few nutters are #impartial# about climate change these days.Do you mean that civil disobedience would have been better Well said Mark! The evident concern trollingis intended to deligitimise the voice of young people who, lets remember, are meant by right to have a say in matters that concern them. Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens. Therefore no one involved in supporting the reported protest has done any wrong, other than in the eyes of seemingly knee-jerk reactionaries who may well be hiding their true motives. Artfully comparing these identiable young people to Orwell’s unthinking farm animals, in order to subvert their point# well it more than lacks sensitivity and compassion. It is desperate, pitul and contemptible in equal measure. It may well also fall foul of observing normal standards of decency and tolerance that contributors to these pagesare meant to adhere to. Those joining the protest were not “stupid”, as has been claimed above. The overuse of that intolerant word may be though. I note you mention #Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens.# now could you explain how taking time off school and striking for the declaration of aclimate emergency makes the child an active and responsible global citizen  I rather feel they are being played by our Greeny ignoramuses and SNP political propagandists! Never mind, I am sure they enjoyed their day off school.Nuclear power  Thatgreat physicistRobert Oppenheimer , on seeing the first atomic bomb explode said with horror—-“ I am become death , the destroyer of worlds.”. The people of Japan and Chernobyl have had a taster and I suspect they arenot eager for a repeat. .However,Shetland is####..Hmm.Rock on.Haydn, Thorium reactors, not Uranium! no atom bombs, no long term isotopes decaying for millennia. Almost infinite clean energy with really cheap fuel.Where would your preferred site be for the Shetland nuclear power station be Dr Tinkler  Aith  Bigton  Would bring plenty work to the west side. You could include it in your manestoyou stand for the council again.Well, Ray Purchase, it is already here. Thousands of Shetlanders have had radiotherapy and had their lives saved by a nuclear atomic reactions of one type or another.I seriously doubtthere is a single person on Shetland who has not had their own, a member of their family or close friends le saved by the products of nuclear reactors.Are you so moronic as to deny that or is that a bit too deep for you to understand or Oh dear Dr Tinkler, it seems you’ve come down with a nasty case of whataboutery. I didn’t ask you about the undoubted benefits of x-rays and radiotherapy I asked you where you would build a nuclear power station in Shetland. Now do you think you could give a straight answer to a straight question  Physician heal thyself!If thorium proves viable, I would be happy for such a station in Lerwick. Safe, clean, small and less damaging than the district heating woodchip waste burner we have at present and infinitely less toxic. I also asked is that a bit too deep for you to understand  # So it seems to be!!Well done Ian, you answered the question! There was a lot of unnecessary waffling and needless aggression but you got there. So, in the incredibly unlikely event of a, totally safe, nuclear power plant being built in Shetland you’d still want it as far away from where you live as possible. Fair dos.Instead of nuclear power or gas have you ever put any thought into wind power  I’ve heard that they don’t cause any carbon pollution at all, so they’d be ideal. They’re very pretty too and scientic. Like an actual windmill, I’m a big fan.Sadly Ray, you are being misled. take Viking for example. Peat disturbance alone. over  kilometres of tracks, the ground footprint of over  square kilometres. A fair amount of COreleased there. Then tens of thousands of tons of concrete basses.emissions, Chatham House.  kilometres of the interconnector, Copper plastic!!! Now just imagine the peat is so unstable that helicopters are being used, just to move survey teams to reconnoitre the site. Tracked vehicles to damaging for the peat!! . Just what is that carbon footprint  Laughableit was not so sad!How something you and Mark Ryan Smith may understand. The very latest scientic information on controlling climate change “Tree planting #has mind-blowing potential# to tackle climate crisis” , now would not planting a tree be a more rational action for these children  That would be the sensible, intelligent and educated option. PS, could someone please inform the SIC SNP SCT and Green Lunatics!No one here has denied climate change Brian Smith. Just a discussion on the merits or otherwise of the School children#s strike. Our youngsters being encouraged to jump on the #Greta Thunberg# bandwagon. There you really do have a sacricial lamb to the European Green lunatics but that is another really sad story!You mustcarefully, Mr T.Well, Brian, I have never denied Climate change. I just dispute the best way to combat it.Deft footwork here from Ian. His, and his hero Farage’s position # not that he cares to own up to it # is not that there is no climate change. Obviously the climate changes over time. What he is conveniently avoiding are the questions around cause and appropriate response.Please do not make up speculative little stories porkies Peter. Farage is not my hero, however, I find him infinitely preferable to Corbyn and Salmond, however, here is not the place to digress further.Will Hell freeze over before Ian tells us what he presumes the protestors are ignorant of  Answering the question he posed Brian is not too mammoth a task for him surely. I suspect he is trying to dodge it for a reason.Read and weep Peter. If your intellect stretches that far. !! In the most simple of Science, It is set out below. The protestors are ignorant of the very most basic understanding of carbon capture and the prevention of climate change. Trees!! Only the very most utterly stupid, like yourself cannot see the wood for them!It is not clear the protest had a position on biomass, however Ian has firmly stated the need for those taking any position to be able to answer #how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age #Ian has thus far excitedly cited three articles, none of which reference any ice age. The first: #Tree planting ‘has mind-blowing potential’ to tackle climate crisis#, has Professor Crowther emphasising #it remains vital to reverse the current trends of rising greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and forest destruction, and bring them down to zero# this is needed to stop the climate crisis becoming even worse and because the forest restoration envisaged would take - years to have its full effect##Reafforestation, necessary as it is, isn#t no silver bullet, nor a speedy enough solution, though many on the protest would likely love to plant some trees.The second and third articles focus on biomass, which is contested.To help Ian make his point, does he mean the Cryogenian, the second last ice age or the Little Ice Age  Again, other than to spread scorn and belittle, what is Ian#s actual point Sorrymy point is beyond you Peter. My question # “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ”That would require a thesis at post-graduate level to answer. Hardly space here! My point was that these children simple to not have the science to have a considered and informed opinion based on knowledge. The science is actually simple, I suggest you look it up and read it.Lest anyone thinking of studying the sciences, physical or social, be put off, Ian’s approach to advancing a scientic argument is far from typical. Thomas Kuhn made a very useful contribution by proposing that as a science advances some innaccurate claims will inevitably be made and indeed built on, but will later be corrected as sufficient contrary evidence emerges. Hawkins himself corrected some of his own foundational work. A settled consensus generally emerges over time through reasonable and reasoned dialogue and argument in which peer reviewed sources, research evidence and the thinking they provoke are made apparent.This is perhaps one reason why the Shetland Times asks contributors to observe normal standards of decency and tolerance for the opinions of others. It helps to bring forth the truth.It is, however, more than unusual for anyone taking themselves seriously to make a strong central scientic claim then refuse to back it up, clary it’s meaning or intent# unless of course Ian is proposing rhetoric, cant and distracting insult are now sciences, in which case top marks are due to the happy fellow.What a load of pretentious twaddle. You have outdone yourself here Peter. The word Science simply means knowledge, no more no less. It is just as simple as that.Whilst he remains intent on running away from clarying and substantiating his own point, here is an easier question for Ian: Why does he call Greens lunatics  There must be some point of disagreement between him and them, in his own head at least.That would be self-evident Peter. Read up the following. Bio-Fuels, palm oil plantation. Diesel fuel promotions, particulates. Germany non-nuclearpolicy,brown coal burning. Shetland exports clean gas imports polluting wood chip. Tree planting reverses CO build up, wood chip more polluting than coal burning and deforests huge areas. The EU % of renewable, Biomass .Greenies promote non-nuclear. more people killed in wind farm accidents in Uk than nuclear ever has. All the above would indicate a somewhat lunatic approach from the Greens. Now we have, using helicopters to survey Viking Energy sites as peat too unstable for tracked vehicles to reach, unbelievable!!! I hate to say the cult of #Greta Thunberg#,depression, eating disorders, and anxiety attacks,Asperger’s syndrome, high-ing autism, and OCD. She also suffers from selective mutism and self-harm. The sacricial lamb of the Greens across Europe. The inspiration behind the school strikes!!!!! Nowthat#s not lunatic, what is Ian’s position on global warming is either well grounded or is, well, hot air. He knows how this goes. Either he has a reputable theorist publishing an article in a reputable journal, or even a weblink to a news story referencing such, or he doesn’t. Because some vested interests have bought and paid for their own pet scientiststhere may be dferent opinions regarding whatever his as yet unclear point was with his unnamed and undated second ice age. If he really wants to be taken seriously he should put up or# consider his alternative.C’mon Ian, one reference to one reputable scientist backing up whatever it is you so obviously don’t want to say. You know you can do it.I am would be intrigued to opinions relating to climate change due to agriculture and what would be the answer to providing food but reducing or stopping climate change due to agriculture. I may be wrong but I believe agriculture produces  times more greenhouse gases than all of transportation put together, but this has, conveniently, been avoided by the media and scientic community. There is a terrible dilemma between producing food to this of attempting to reduce green houses gases and the progressive climate change taking place Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough and we are confused.One minute providing grants to preserve Shetland#s peat carbon store, and the next proposing digging acres of it up, releasing all that carbon, to build Viking.Giving out paper straws in McDonalds with juice in a plastic cup .I mind askingabout planting trees on my croft. They said #oh we dont want these clumps of trees any more, not our landscape#, when I had always thought tree planting was good.Such a mixed message. Why dont we have a green rating system like we have for our washing machines. You could rate biomass, nuclear, windfarms from construction to operation in terms of green to red, so we would know where we are in the scale with our choices.Any way, still have a patch of high hill that would be great for a mini woodsI referenced Greta with a very heavy heart, a truly exploited child whose background would fire concern with any child specialist in the UK, psychologist or Social worker.Sorry, Johan, who isn#t #taking climate change seriously# Theresa May and the Tories are taking it very seriously, indeed, passing Mrs May#s unilateral # net zero# plan into law. The Treasury says it will cost over £ trillion , enough to fund the salaries of , nurses for  years.Too little for Greta Thunberg and her #Extinction Rebellion pals, apparently.This will find its way on to consumers# electricity bills, including those in fuel poverty, a clear majority of homes in Shetland #  percent, before the recent price hikes.The Shetland Labour Party that I grew up with was concerned with alleviating poverty, not creating it. They were not interested inwinning #Green Blue Peter Badges# for futile, bourgeois bagatelles like#tackling climate change#, without any hope of success.Britain, far less, Shetland, can achieve nothing alone.The only candidate to exhibit concern for Shetland#s poor is Ian Scott.Im confused. You state that the Tories are proposing  net zero and then you say Labour creating poverty.I am very seriously concerned about fuel poverty everywhere and especially in Shetland. I hope that there are no price hikes in our fuel bills, this is something we need to resist, and I also hope more help is forthcoming for retrofitting better heating systems and more insulation to improve housing quality.Please do not try to tell me what I believe.Johan, I don’t recall you ever mentioning fuel poverty before. Do you support or oppose “ net zero”, which was done in knee-jerk response to the campaigns of Greta Thunberg and her pals “Extinction Rebellion” Only, you have been supporting Ms Thunberg’s “climate emergency” campaign at local level, have you not Mrs May’s , nurses salaries for  years isn’t “emergency” enough for them, they want more.You can huff and puff as much as you like, the cost will find its way to the fuel poor, increasing their number.I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Greta Thunberg AND the fuel poor, whom you have now mentioned for the first time.Mr Scott has been arguing for Shetland’s poor since long before he became a councillor.No John I have not been supporting Greta#s campaign locally and yes I have mentioned fuel poverty before and I think I can support greener politics and the poor. It is an important point tho, how we are going to pay for it all. I heard somewhere the Tories are going to pay for it from the proceeds of G.Johan, I responded to your comment above that Greta Thunberg is right .You have also defended the Shetland schools strike “climate emergency” demonstration in this self, same thread.I quote: “Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough#..etc..”That sounds awful like you think Mrs May committing  years’ worth of , nurses salaries isn’t “taking climate change seriously enough” If you are now saying that you do not support Greta Thunberg and do wish to tackle Shetland’s lamentable fuel poverty, will you be making a clear, prominent statement to that effect in your campaign literature Including your and Shetland Labour’s proposals for solving the fuel poverty The twisting of my words is really uncalled for, and completely ignoring the main point of my post which is that we need a green rating system to stop you all arguing about what is green and what is not # but then you enjoy the fight too much and would poo poo any system anyway I suppose.Strange move of support from Wir Shetland to Ian Scott  You#re scraping the barrel, now, Johan, getting personal. After your Up Helly-Aa performance, your comment about #enjoying the fight# is, frankly,a bit rich.It appears you are not prepared to make the campaign commitment I suggested. That#s ok.I#m not supporting anyone yet as I haven#t heard from all the candidates. I merely pointed out that Mr Scott is the only one so far to have shown any real concern for Shetland#s poor. He needs to say more about that. Under the present arrangements #climate emergency# will dump on the fuel poor. They have votes, too, of course # more than  percent of the electorate.Good luck with your campaign.Given his concern for the fuel poor John Tulloch will presumably be supporting whichever candidate puts the cancellation of Brexit first and foremost in their manesto  The largest driver of upward pressure on heating bills over the past two years is the devaluation of the pound following the Brexit vote. Greta Thunberg had nothing to do with it. In the event of further declines in the value of the pound post prime minister Johnson increased hard Brexit probability, the suffering of the fuel poor will continue to worsen as the wholesale price of gas becomes relatively more expensive when purchased in pounds sterling.The  dilemma that John Tulloch posed to Johan Adamson could equally well be phrased thus: I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Brexit AND the fuel poor.I apologiseI have gotten personal. Be as naesty as du wants, I just cant fathom why you need to be so  Breakfast TV only this morning were talking about how the market is not working, people not changing utility supplier and these people paying more as a consequence.Its surely not fairyour contract runs out that they are able to leave you on a higher rate Action on fuel poverty needs to include tackling the inequalities in the market as well as action to make our houses warmer.Ok, Johan. I’ve made my points about fuel poverty and there’snothing I want to add.So forgive meI don’t digress into bickering about who has or hasn’t been “naesty”. Readers may judge.Good luck with your campaign.Yes, Ian can answer a question when he chooses to. And there is sense in some of what he says. Wind farms on peat, for example, happen when commercial interests chase subsidies, so it is up to governments to get the correct approach. Not all that blame goes at the Green’s door, and they are either correct to claim there is a climate emergency or they are not.On the climate emergency Ian’s thoughts can only be guessed at. They have something to do with an ice-age, which is appropriate as progress towards getting him to answer his own question is, as yet, glacial.A big problem inside these debates stems from some people get beguiled by fake scientic claims. This is why genuine people making genuine scientic claims are generally happy to back them up by referencing the work of the real scientists involved. This offers folk who may or may not be less expert than Dr. Ian Tinklersome protection from charlatans with an axe to grind. Again,Ian is serious, rather than just being a contraryIan, he will reveal his ice-age source s. Or would doing so would reveal his actual movitation  C’mon Ian, youknowyouwantto.I actually sent them to the Times. They failed to print them as perhaps regarded as irrelevant pertaining to the school strike. I will do so again so Peter can untwist his knickers.The book you really should read, Mr T., is The Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace Wells. Things are far more precarious than you think.David Wallace Wells. I would rather believe scientic specialists in ious fields than blindly take the word of a Journalist, Brian. He appears to hold no scientic qualication of any type. Writing for theis not reliable science training any more than writing for the Mail..Try reading it.Abruptclimate change , at younger dryasfor years also because of meteorite strike in Greenland. We still haven#t founda proper way of storing spent nuclear fuel, i can seethe repository at Sellafield being under miles of snow through the many ice ages to come before it issafe again.The nuclear nonsensewas never about cheap and safe electricity it was of course about weapons grade plutonium tons,produced here in Scotland alone,why that amount when a few tons could polish off the entire planet does anyone know Do we trust Boris and fruitcake farm with this ,aye right- their record speaks for itself! Maybe the bairns protesting about climate change holds a candle of hope up - -we are all going to need it.Graham Fleming, Thorium breakdown isotopes have short half-lives. Long term storage is nor an issue. Ask a standard grader that is beyond your understanding.Incidentally, the global stockpile of separated plutonium is about  tonnes. That is  tonnes too much, however Thorium reactors produce none at all. Sad you cannot get your facts straight Graham Flemming, so very SNP.Having read these pages for a long time Peter, it should be apparent by now that Ian is a dental surgeon by training and therefore qualies for Dr status.No need to have a PhDor any other bits of paper !Ok, well thanks to Ian, andthe Times did withhold the links as irrelevant to the school strike they maybe had a point. It was Ian that insisted to Brian Smith way back when that this issue was relevant, for whatever reason.I#m still not clear what Ian draws from these articles though, or why anyone would have to have this knowledge to take a view on the current level of threat, but I get that global warming isn#t about to lead to another ice age. I don#t recall the protest saying it would# It#s a welcome change to have Ian express himself without resort to petty insult though. Long may that continue. On his earlier point on science, however, I#m not sure most scientists would agree science means knowledge only, as Ian proposed, without including the search for it by using scientic methods.But here is the big unanswered question # whatever it is Ian take from these links # does he, or does he not, think we are facing a climate crisis  If we are then surely the kids are right to be concerned, especially as some government sponsored action on climate change is potentially green-wash.Slight problem with the colour test Johan.About % of men have problems when distinguishingbetween red and green .

The Loch Ewe farm has failed the required environmental standards for nearly  years. Mowi, despite virtually unlimited resources, were apparently unwilling or unable to make the necessary changes. broadcast in May.In January , the Scottish Parliament#s Rural Economy and Connectivity Committee agreed to undertake an enquiry into the state of salmon fishing in Scotland and in November  the regulatory body SEPA published proposals for a revised regulatory regime for the finfish sector. Within these proposals, SEPA said it would begin a programme of work to #modernise the regulation of existing sites#.Mowi#s head of environmental management, Stephen MacIntyre, said that the company wanted to #align its growth# with recent recommendations. The company had plans to sustainably grow their fish production levels over the next few years by #expanding into new high-energy farming areas located further offshore#.Bill Whyte, convener of the Wester Ross Area Salmon Fishery Board, said he welcomed Mowi#s recognition of the wild salmonid habitats and added: #We will expect further clarity about the process of biomass relocation. However,Mowi can provide evidence through EIAplanning and SEPA regulatory structure that the relocated biomass will have reduced potential impact on wild migratory fish, then we would be prepared to support biomass relocation on a conditional basis.#*A spokesperson from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency , said: “It is really encouraging to see that industry is proactively choosing to consider more sustainable locations for fish farms, away from more sensitive waters where pressures on the marine environment are greatest. “SEPA’s new regulatory framework for marine cage fish farming, launched on  June, , combines more accurate modelling and enhanced monitoring to encourage a more sustainable approach to the siting of fish farms. “In practice, we anticipate this will lead to fewer fish farms in shallower, slow-flowing waters and more fish farms in offshore locations where the environment capacity can better assimilate wastes. The new framework is designed to actively support operators who are seeking to relocate to more sustainable locations, and through improved practices and the innovative use of new technologies, reduce their impact on the marine environment.#They went on to add: “Indeed, our new framework provides exactly the type of flexibility and outcome-focus Mowi outlines it is looking for.Within this new framework, we will consider each inidual proposal on its merits against the legal standards.We encourage Mowi and other operators to work with us and other interested parties to explore their innovative proposals under our new framework.We look forward to doing so."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Kara-with-100m-IM-Gold.jpg","title":"inspirational western isles swimmer kara hanlon wins four gold medals at international island games in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine July.And the -year old was not the only WesternIsles athlete to celebrate a podium place in the shadow of the famous rock, asmore joy followed in the pool and in the athletics stadium.Isla Budge won bronze in the -metres freestyle event, while in Thursday’s triple jump final Mary Macleod won silver and Heather MacKinnon took bronze.Eriskay jumper MacKinnon had won gold in the event in Gotland two years ago with a shorter jump than it took to win third this time around.Hanlon’s week of glory began on Monday whenshe retained the  metres breaststroke title she won in Gotland in .

Sergeant Herbinson was, prior to joining the colours, an employee in the Phoenix Weaving Factory, Ballymena.He was a member of the Ulster Volunteer Force and of Ballykeel LOL . His brother, Lance Corporal James Herbinson, Royal Irish Fusiliers, is serving at the front. A letter received from the Rev. A. Gibson, Chaplain to the Central Antrims, states that Sgt. Herbinson was killed while out on duty in no-mans land. He states:He was a most excellent soldier and a very good NCO and the regiment will miss him very much. He had done very fine work when the battalion went into action on st July and I have heard from his officers how nobly he did his duty that day. He was buried in a little cemetery near the firing line.Lt. W.B. Stuartwrote: Dear Miss Herbinson, I cannot tell you with what regret it is hat I am writing to tell you of the death of your brother. He was killed by a bullet passing through his brain so that I am glad to say that he suffered absolutely no pain. I have known your brother personally for nearly two years and I feel that I have lost a real friend as well as an excellent sergeant. I have never met anyone whom I trusted more than your brother. He was absolutely fearless and could always be depended upon to do anything.“Perhaps you have heard that he was recommended for bravery at the battle of the Somme, when, after three attempts had been made, he collected eight men of his platoon and was going to make another attack, when, luckily, he was stopped as the chance was hopeless.

The emphasis was on practical skills rather than written work and this really suited me. I enjoyed every minute of it.”Lauren’s proud parents, Marbeth and Brian were there to see her collect her award.Marbeth said: “Lauren deserves great credit and we’re so pleased for her.“She struggled with her work at school and we now realise that this was as a result of her dyslexia. “All her hard work has paid off and we’re delighted for her.”Northern Regional College offers a range of Professional Cookery courses at its campuses in Ballymena and Ballymoney.

But on the Thursday of the final week a couple of the primary schools had done a non-unorm day and told the children to bring their unorms in – two mini buses were filled full of bags of unorms,” he said. “Since then we been receiving donations every single day. We want to emphasise that there will be unorms from all schools, primary and post primary, in West Belfast available on the two days we have set aside for collection and to thank everyone who has donated so far.”Free school unorms will be distributed on July  from pm-pm and July  from am-pm at St Peter’s Immaculata Youth Club.

The portraits were removed and the offended party, a Mr Lee Hegarty, was consulted on what should replace them.”“He suggested that the portraits of Her Majesty the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh should be replaced with photographs of, at best, the Queen meeting people during engagements in Northern Ireland,\" said Lord Maginnis.“One such photograph features Her Majesty the Queen shaking hands with the former deputy first minister, Martin McGuinness, at the Lyric Theatre in Belfast.“I do not mind that what I mind is that the case brought by the complainant was settled secretly and that the sum of £, was handed over, presumably for hurt feelings and distress.“This settlement was signed off by the then secretary of state, Theresa Villiers MP, on the recommendation, I am informed, of her permanent secretary Jonathan Stephens.“I have been told to look at the annual accounts to find out where the money came from – but it is not to be found. That should concern us.”After some time had passed after the issue of compensation was settled, Lord Maginnis said that last year Mr Hegarty was promoted to become accounting officer of the Parades Commission.He said this contrasted with what he described as the years of delay in compensating victims of historical institutional abuse in Northern Ireland. He said they had been “shamefully left out in the cold when it comes to their justiable claims for compensation”.“This is scandalous.

But, that short daily journey must have taken as least twice as long as it would have taken anyone  simply because almost everyone he passed knew him, stopped him and engaged in conversation with him.On the th anniversary of the school’s opening in  I was asked to help compile a book to mark the occasion. When I sat down to write a list of those who would have to be interviewed, John Dunne was the first name on the top of the pile.When I started to transcribe John’s interview it began like this: “In this era of media created ‘stars’, famous for nothing more than seeking fame-or infamy, in many cases-the tag of legend is one that is all too easily doled out.“Most people in their formative years can point to a mentor who influenced them greatly and provided knowledge and encouragement when these vital commodities were often all too scarce. More often than not, these people are unassuming and go about their lives in the same manner.“These people are society’s real legends and in the history of St Joseph’s, fewany, earned that accolade more than John Dunne.”That chapter of the book on St Joseph’s was entitled ‘One of nature’s gentlemen’, and there’s absolutely no reason to change that title for the purposes of this appreciation of John Dunne’s le because in my opinion its accuracy cannot be upgraded in any way.‘Big John’ as he was affectionately known to all former pupils of the school, made a positive mark on thousands of young lives in his four decades at St Joseph’s. It would be hard to find anyone that would disagree that the word big when applied to John Dunne not only represented his physical stature but also his intelligence and patience.By , the Dunne family had lived at Brandywell Road, Burnfoot and then back to Derry and more specically the newly developing Creggan estate.John Dunne began his career at St Columb’s College in  in the company of contemporaries such as Nobel laureates John Hume, Seamus Heaney.In  he told me: “I enjoyed the time at St Columb’s without really realising or wondering what le was about. There were people then who went back up to the College at six o’clock and studied until nine o’clock.“But, I and another man, Bill Smyth, who also ended up teaching at St Joseph’s, instead of going to the school, followed a great interest we had discovered-greyhounds. That was our main pursuit. Strangely, we both also ended up training as teachers at St Joseph’s College in Belfast which was linked to Queen’s University but separate in that it awarded its own accreditation.”It was at training college that John Dunne encountered a dilemma. Already well-known for his ability as a footballer, his lelong passion, he had to make the choice of whether he would pursue as a career as PE teacher.“I had distinct limitations, because when I was very young, I nearly died twice. When I was six months old and again when I was five, I caught pneumonia. I remember the second time and having to lie from about December to April before I came around.“I was in a sort of comatose state for a long time, but my mother God rest her, battled away and I survived. But, it left me severely limited in terms of stamina. In terms of pace, I was very quick off the mark, but I couldn’t sustain it. And, the further up you went in football, the more of a problem it became. I loved reserve football, but the full senior game was just too fast for me,” he said.In September  John began his teaching career at the newly opened St Joseph’s Secondary School in Creggan for the princely sum of £ per month. It was here that he spent the entire span of his professional le.The new school with its emphasis educating those who had not successfully navigated the old  plus exam, it was a ready-made home for John Dunne and many of his contemporaries alike. Like many of his era, John benefitted from easier access to grammar school system because of post-war changes to British education policy. But, also like many of his generation, John spoke candidly about his reservations on it. His words also revealed why he preferred the non-selective route through school.“The thing about going to St Columb’s is that we weren’t completely accepted. We were dferent somehow. The boarders who stayed there were the ‘real’ St Columb’s boys as far as the clergy were concerned.“There are things now that are still etched in my memory. Where I lived, there was a protest after a child lost a leg having been hit by a bus. The people were worried about the safety of their children so they weren’t prepared to let the bus keep travelling that route.“Anyhow, the protest could be seen from the College. A priest, who shall remain nameless said, ‘well, what would you expect from people like that ’“We took great umbrage at that. I had been through a kind of elitist system at St Columb’s, where you had to prove yourself in the first place by getting so many marks in an  plus exam, in English and Maths-and they weren’t easy. They were quite dficult examinations. I went to the Christian Brothers at they drilled us kept us on in the afternoon for an hour, got us up on Saturday mornings and drilled us and drilled us.“When I went to teach in a secondary school it was very dferent. You had children there that for one reason or another had fallen through the system. They hadn’t perhaps done themselves justice in the system that surrounded them. In my time at St Joseph’s there were children who should not have been there because they could not get anything out of the system at all, no matter how much we tried or how much sympathy we had for their position. But we did try.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I had been through a system where I met good teachers, people who had made a good impact on my le. So, what I did when I saw what they were doing was imitate them. I wove all the goodness in other people into a fabric that I could use myself, and I found that it worked,” said John.At the end of John Dunne’s first decade as a teacher, the Troubles erupted on the streets of his native city. St Joseph’s geographical location meant that major disturbances often encroached upon the school itself. It befell people like John Dunne to provide a calm backdrop to the mayhem outside the gates of St Joseph’s.In  he said: “It was a very, very strange environment to be working in, because all hell could have broken loose in the immediate vicinity of the school at any time. There were teachers out on the streets, acting as buffers, trying tom keep a lid on things.“In practical terms, I found it very hard because in summer time it was very hot and you had to open the windows to let a bit of air in. But, there were helicopters flying about and the noise was unbearable and the youngsters couldn’t hear you. A lot of young people became involved and some of them lost their lives as a consequence.”Apart from a very quick but understated wit, John Dunne was blessed with a fantastic voice, full of dramatic intonation, that would have been the envy of many stage actors.As a teacher of the English language John had the ability the bring the most boring text to le and kept his students enthralled. He could have been reading the contents of the back of a cereal box aloud, but when he spoke people listened.The ability to relate a story, complete with an array of accents when required, was one that he credited his grandfather John Downey with.“He was a great storyteller. I remember as a young boy he used to take me early in the morning for his pension. We used to go to Mass about seven or eight o’clock and then go to the train station on the Strand Road and out to Bridgend for his pension and then visit people in the area.“But when we were walking, he always told me stories about haunted houses, about what kind of flowers were at the side of the road.“There seemed to be no end to his knowledge and then he could deviate and tell me another yarn. I just thrived on his stories.“I think also it was the way I was taught at the Christian Brothers. They were very precise about language. It’s become too loose now. People are very loose, especially when using mobile phones.“I’ve even read about the use of the apostrophe being lost. I was taught these things were important when you wrote something. I stuck to it and I tried to instil it into youngsters without being overly heavy about it.”John Dunne’s dulcet tones were employed again when Derry City FC re-entered senior football in  and for many years after he commentated on many of the games played by his beloved Candystripes.This interview with John Dunne was conducted in  at Pilot’s Row community centre. At this stage he had been retired from teaching for almost two decades. But, the huge capacity that he had to retain swathes of information was still very much evident.Asto prove that very thing, in the later stages of this conversation a young boy, no more than ten or eleven years old walked past and said cheerily, ‘hello John!’Without blinking an eye, John Dunne recounted the boy’s family history and how many of his relatives attended St Joseph’s. That was proof that you could take the man away from St Joe’s, but not St Joe’s away from the man.The interview with John Dunne ended with him speaking about the five decades since the school opened.He said: “It’s been some fty years, especially for somebody like me who has finished up living in the Bogside. When I got here, I was a little bit apprehensive about being someone who worked in St Joseph’s and being accepted into the local community. But, it’s no bother. I am on first name terms with people.“I was walking over to Mailey’s pub one night in the summer about .. It was a beautul night. There was a group of young men sitting in a garden. I was walking in the middle of the road and one of them came out and addressed me by my name.“He said, ‘John, there are not many teachers that could do what you are doing and walked through this area untouched.“That’s good to know I said.”CAPTION: The late John Dunne."},{"url":null,"title":"operation motorman findings seamus bradley inquest made public next month","story":"The Inquest findings into one of the most controversial killings of the Troubles in Derry will be made public next month, the Derry News can reveal.Seamus Bradley was shot dead in highly disputed circumstances by the British Army during Operation Motorman in the early hours of July , .The Coroners Service for Northern Ireland has now confirmed that the findings of the Inquest will be announced by Judge Patrick Kinney on August  at Laganside Court in Belfast.

Durkan come after the latest public consultation attracted over  objections which he now believes will scupper plans for similar schemes in areas such as Rosemount and Bishop Street.Mr Durkan said the Department for Infrastructurehas been “extremely ham-fisted” in its handling of the consultation process.The parking scheme issue stretches back around ten years, with ious public consultations having taken place in that time. At one stage, it was expected to be introduced in  but had to be pushed back until .In  then Roads Minister Danny Kennedy gave assurances that, “in the absence of signicant objections”, the scheme would be in place no later than Spring .However, this week, after a consultation ended last April and a further information session was held in November, a spokesperson for the Department explained that the proposed Rossville Street Residents’ parking scheme received a large number of objections from the residents.Of the  responses received, there were  objections to the scheme.The DfI told the Derry News that key areas of concern coming out of the consultation included the number of permits allocated for visitors, access for family carers and concerns over costs.The Department has since confirmed that the resident and visitor permits would be free and that a special permit would be available for family carers, also free of charge.The DfI spokesperson added: “The Department acknowledges that there is still a need to manage car parking in the Bogside and is now considering how to progress matters.“Consideration is being given to advancing a smaller scheme within the Rossville area to include Abbey Park, Glenfada Park and Columbcille Court, possibly as a pilot. The Department would hope to commence consultation for a smaller scheme in September.“The Department will write out to all residents living within the limits of the original Rossville scheme as soon it is confirmed how an alternative scheme will be progressed.“The Department is not in a position to consider other schemes at this time.”StaggeringMark H. Durkan is worried that delays to the Bogside parking scheme will now hamper the roll-out of similar schemes.“The fact this is happening will now block progress on any residents’ parking scheme where in the city.“Bogside residents want a parking scheme so it must be the design of it that people are objecting to. It’s staggering that a much-needed parking scheme in an area where residents struggle and have been crying out for a solution to the problem of getting parked outside their homes during the day has been scrapped.“This scheme has been deliberated over for ten years and the department has brought proposals forward that have been met with such opposition. It begs the question, was enough done to liaise and interact with objectors, and could they respond in turn to these objections.“Bogside was identied as a key area, as was Bishop Street and the next was the lower Rosemount university area. But now it seems asthe department has pulled the plug on those schemes and there is no chance of progress.”Parallel schemesThe SDLP representative had enquired about the possibility of a similar scheme in other areas which are badly impacted by students such as Rosemount, and Abercorn Place and Terrace which are both affected by city centre workers.“These could have been done in parallel so that at least one scheme could be advanced. People in Rosemount are frustrated that they’ve been put on the back burner while this other scheme was being progressed, but they’ll be even more frustrated to see it isn’t being progressed.“Rosemount and Bishop Street will now be way down the line, the handling of this by the Department of Infrastructure seems extremely ham-fisted,” Mr Durkan added.The Rossville Street area Residents’ Parking Scheme would be the first such scheme for the City and involves over  residential properties mainly in the Rossville Street, Fahan Street, Little Diamond, Creggan Street and Chamberlain Street areas.A DfI publication in March stated that, proposals for the Scheme were first announced by the previous Minister for Infrastucture, and following informal consultations “there has proven to be signicant support from residents who are experiencing increasing dficulties parking outside their homes.”The Department wrote to all residents within the area and encouraged all interested parties to formally respond to the proposals before  April.If introduced as proposed, the scheme would have designated free of charge parking places for residents only between the hours of . am and noon and between . pm and . pm from Monday to Saturday inclusive.Visitors would have been able to park within areas designated for residents provided a valid visitor’s permit is displayed on the vehicle.

There needs to be swt action as an enhanced facility could alleviate the problem people are currently facing.A Department for Infrastructure spokesman said the current Driver and Vehicle test centre network was built around  years ago.ldquoMuch has been done to maintain and modernise the test centres in that time, particularly to meet the growing demand for vehicle tests. However, present and future legislative requirements, coupled with increasing and changing demands for testing services, mean that the current network is no longer sustainable, he said.ldquoAs such, we have been reviewing the network with a view to determining the most appropriate network of test centres to meet our future needs. To date, with the exception of a new test centre being built at Hydebank in Belfast, no decisions have been taken on the size of any other specic test centres within a future network.The spokesman said the new test centre at Hydebank and will provide additional testing capacity for the Greater Belfast area.He added: ldquoOur plans for a new network are continuing to be progressed, specically in terms of the design for the new test centres and the acquisition of land.ldquoHowever, in the absence of the NI Executive there is currently no means to progress proposals beyond the construction of the new test centre at Hydebank..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Carryduff man honoured with major accolade  ","story":"A CARRYDUFF country sports enthusiast has been honoured with a major award.John Leighton, who is the president of the Ulster Gundog League, has been presented with The Great Game Fairs of Ireland letime achievement award.The awards, made each year at the Irish Game Fair at Fine Food Festival held at Shanes Castle, Antrim, are designed to recognise and reward outstanding iniduals who devote themselves to nurturing rural heritage.Announcing Johnrsquos award, Albert Titterington, managing director of The Great Game Fairs of Ireland, said: ldquoIt is an absolute pleasure each year to have the opportunity publicly to recognise some of the outstanding members of the game show family who commit their time, talents and enthusiasm to preserving rural traditions and promoting country sports.ldquoThese people work tirelessly behind the scenes and without any thought of reward mdash and John epitomises that blend of modesty and high achievement.ldquoOver the years John has enjoyed considerable sporting success with the dogs he trains and we have been proud to have enjoyed his support and insight as he served as spaniels directorrsquo with our fairs, shaping competitions and ensuring top quality entries.Mr Titterington said Mr Leightonrsquos  years of gundog competition experience commanded ldquoinstant respect in gundog circles and described him as a ldquopopular figure across this island and beyond..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Cormac delivers at Irish Open  ","story":"ARDGLASS golfer Cormac Sharvin has just had the biggest week of his le.The  year-old was the top Irish finisher at the Dubai Duty Free Irish Open at Lahinch.He finished joint th place on nine-under par to earn the biggest payday of his le, pocketing a cheque for euro,.It was almost three times the amount he has earned on the European Challenge Tour so far this season.Unfortunately, he missed out on securing a dream spot at next weekrsquos Open Championship at Portrush.After signing off with a final round  on Sunday he said: ldquoI felt I didnrsquot play much dferent from the first three days.

He crossed the finish line in ., in sixth place overall, but first U-, a real eye-catching performance out of  finishersMeanwhile, Dee was not letting the side down as he again proved best in his age group, clocking yet another sub  time, his clocking of . was also good enough for overall seventh out of the  finishers.Ford kNewcastle was the venue for a nearer home race on Friday night and several East Down men and women took advantage of the opportunity to warm up for the action in Delamont the next day.Gordy Graham took third place overall in . a mere  seconds behind winner, Newcastlersquos David OrsquoFlaherty, while Catherine OrsquoConnor was second female in . to Gordyrsquos cousin, Laura Graham, who won in .. Paul Lloyd was st in . and Donal Smith placed th in  minutes on the button, out of a total of  runners.DelamontAs Van Morrison once said: ldquoMy momma told me therersquod be days like this,Thus was described East Downrsquos fantastic day out in Delamont on Saturday in the  X k relays, a new and exciting event organised by the Daye Brothers aka Atlas Running, which required teams of five runners each, with each one running a klap as the hot and hilly trails and paths around Delamont were described.At one point we thought we wouldnrsquot have enough runners to fill three teams so to get four teams of five representing East Down was pretty damn impressive.Some pretty impressive performances from the East Down gang as well with victories for the menrsquos A team and the mixed team and third in the all female team.Massive well done to all involved especially the team captain, Deirdre Weatherall who rallied the troops with carrots and sticks and a promise of ice creams, that did not materialise.All agreed that she did a fine job of getting  names in the hat and in the right place at the right time. It was great to see also that several relative newcomers to the club, Gillian and Gerard Grant, Donal Smith, Michael Morrissey and Alison Graham are happy to get involved with some of the older hands and the younger ones to enjoy the delights that a team relay can bring.Performances of the day have to be shared by Gavin Hynds whose third leg run for the EDAC male B team, which effectively hauled them up from last place to th.His time of . for the leg was only bettered by runners from the top two teams on the day, and by Neil Curran, the anchor leg runner for the EDAC A team.His final leg of . only put paid to the battling St Peterrsquos AC quintet during the final lap. The Lurgan team, which had held the lead from the start were understandably disappointed, but the EDAC squad deserved their win.Track and fieldOn to Sunday and it was our juvenile members who had to make the long journey to Tullamore in Co Offally to take part in the All Ireland T F Championships.Spread over two weekends, it therefore means that, for some, there are two journeys to the heart of Ireland on consecutive weekends.Thank you to all the parents for driving all these miles. Your efforts are greatly appreciated by everyone in the club and especially by the athletes themselvesNevertheless, it proved a great day at Tullamore at the first of three days of action with the sun shining for a nice change.East Down had four athletes taking part all in the m, but in two dferent age groups. In the U- race Anna Gardiner and Lucy Foster both ran in separate heats with both finishing in sixth position.The top three in each heat qualied automatically for the final later in the day along with the fastest two finishers outside the top six.Unfortunately, both EDAC girls missed out on qualication, but they ran super races with Lucy gaining a PB of .. and Anna running ...Lauren Madine and Kirsti Foster both competed in the U- race with both winning their heats and automatically qualying for the final later in the day.A last minute change of time table meant the final was brought forward by an hour so that meant quick warm-ups and back on the track was not the ideal preparation that would normally take place before an All-Ireland final.Nonetheless, the two girls put their minds to it and gave it their best shot. Having two out of eight from one club in an All-Ireland final is an achievement in itself.Kirsti came fourth overall in .., just missing a medal by tenths of a second.

These are two key elements of Delamontrsquos future success.Cllr Walker said he hopes that the public will be given time to view the content of the master plan when it is completed and that money to provide a raft of new facilities can be secured to allow work to potentially start next year.ldquoThe Education Authority stuck to its promise to invest in Delamont and I hope that the local authority will honour its commitment and start planning to provide more facilities at the country park which offers huge development potential, he said.ldquoWhile already a signicant tourism attraction, there are not that many facilities apart from a childrenrsquos playground, stunning walks and the hugely popular Steamerrsquos cafe and miniature railway.ldquoWhile I am not advocating that the beauty of the area is spoiled in any way, there are hundreds of acres of space which could be used to boost the parkrsquos tourism offering.Cllr Walker said the availability of finance to enhance the park is critical to its future development, providing new attractions and creating a boost for nearby businesses in Killyleagh.He added: ldquoThe eagerly-awaited master plan is the key to unlocking Delamontrsquos future development and can also pave the way for much-needed investment.

If Fascism hadnrsquot been beaten we would be living in a very dferent world today. ldquoWe would be living in fear of a regime which would not tolerate any descent. We are very lucky and should be thankful to those veterans who risked all and gave their tomorrow for our today.Cllr Hanna said the districtrsquos surviving veterans were small in number and well into their nineties, and that society owed a debt to them for their part in the battle to secure the freedom people enjoy today.He said he included the Merchant Navy in his proposal because many risked their lives on merchant ships to ferry supplies which helped win the war.ldquoThis was a cruel war where many lost their lives and I really hope we never have to face anything like this again. Those from Northern Ireland who fought and served during World War Two came from all sections of the community.ldquoBefore it is too late, I believe this council should acknowledge what these brave people did for us all by presenting surviving veterans with a silver poppy at a cross community service in November, said Cllr Hanna.He added: ldquoI hope that the council will support this motion as a mark of respect for the generation which has given us freedoms we take for granted.The SDLPrsquos Declan McAteer said he was ldquosomewhat dubious about the suggestion for the council ldquoto go out on a limb and procure silver poppy medals.ldquoI fully respect the sentiment of those wishing to identy with what is essentially a British symbol which wonrsquot by endorsed by all Irish men or women. The poppy, for better or worse, is associated with all conflicts that Britain was involved in from the First World War right through.ldquoI would say that perhaps thatwe do anything around this we

politicians recently pointed to what they described as ldquoserious problems at council management level for not taking the planning backlog seriously enough.Politicians have expressed concern that planners are not responding to their telephone calls and emails, with people who lodge applications also concerned that they are not getting any information from officials.Elected representatives say while all the fault does not rest with planners, they are firmly of the view that there are simply not enough staff to deal with the huge volume of work.Concern has also been expressed that the planning department is having problems retaining staff to work in a department that receives the second highest number of applications across the Provincersquos  councils.Politicians say there is a need to ensure the planning department is running properly which the council explains in the new report is exactly what it aims to do.A major review of planning has already been undertaken and amendments made to the so-called scheme of delegation which is a set of rules which determines whether a planning application will be decided by the local authorityrsquos Planning Committee or planning officers.A critical look has also been taken at staffing structures in tandem with the arearsquos chief planner, with council officials conceding that while there are issues with staff turnover, positions are filled as quickly as possible.In addition, the council has admitted there is a communication issue within the planning department with the change that needs to happen something that cannot be achieved overnight.Signicantly, the new council report warns that failure to deliver timely planning decisions is a ldquorisk within the corporate risk register, with the number of live planning applications increasing, not decreasing, with the figure standing at , at the end of May.The report says an internal audit of the planningrevealed that there are a number of key controls absent from the local authorityrsquos planning system, in particular, its performance against legislative targets, the completeness and validation of documentation supporting applications and enforcement actions.The audit also points to a lack of clarity in respect of key performance indicators within the planning department and the lack of non-compliance by the local authority with its own planning and enforcement procedures.The report says senior council management is considering ways forward to ensure compliance with policy and legislative targets, while maintaining the number of live cases to an acceptable level.Council officials say that over the coming months they intend to take steps to address the ious issues within the planning department to further enhance governance arrangements and are satisfied that these steps will address the need for improvements..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Plans for new

I also had the pleasure of meeting campaigners from across the UK as part of the Extinction Rebellion protests in Parliament.And I recently bumped into some students from Stanwell School who have been taking part in the climate strike movement and standing up for action on climate change and the climate emergency. I was glad to help get their and other constituentsrsquo voices heard on this in Parliament, because itrsquos not being debated enough - itrsquos getting lost behind other things.So whether itrsquos local action we can take on recycling and packaging, or global action on climate change and carbon emissions, we all need to do more to deal with an emergency thatrsquos going to affect us all for generations to come.I was out and about again in Penarth this weekend, along with a team of our fantastic Labour town and Vale councillors, talking to people about the forthcoming European elections. There was a lot of support for our clear Welsh Labour position backing a final say in a peoplersquos vote for the public on any Brexit deal.Following the mixed results in the local elections in England and Northern Ireland last week, there was much talk about Labour lsquobailing outrsquo the government. Let me be crystal clear on this ndash I will never lsquobail outrsquo the disastrous Tories on Brexit, and neither will the overwhelming majority of Labour MPs.We can resolve the situation, but not by any backroom stitch-up that would risk letting down both those who voted Leave and Remain. The only way forward out of this mess is to let the people have the final say on any deal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that. Under my leadership, thatrsquos exactly what would happen and whilst I do accept that there are dficult decisions to be taken, we have to take the public with us - not ignore their legitimate concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people.

The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They are joined by venture capital firms Frontline and Episode , angel networks UK Business Angel Association and Angel Academe, and institutional investor British Business Bank.Speaking at the launch of the Investing in Women Code at a reception in Downing Street, the Exchequer Secretary Robert Jenrick said: ldquoBreaking down gender barriers could add billions to the UK economy.ldquoIrsquom pleased to see so many of our major banks and venture capital firms support the code, and I call on others to follow suit.ldquoItrsquos shocking that only one in three entrepreneurs are women and I hope that todayrsquos commitment signals a turning point in attitudes towards investing in female-led businesses.It follows the findings of a review led by NatWestrsquos deputy chief executive Alison Rose earlier this year which showed closing the gap between male and female entrepreneurs could add pound billion to the UKrsquos economy.Challenges facing female founders identied by the report include low access to capital, high risk awareness, disproportionate primary care responsibilities and a lack of relatable role models. Research commissioned by the Chancellor had previously revealed that female-led start-ups get just a penny for every pound of venture capital investment in the UK.Signatories of the new Investing in Women Code pledge to nominate a senior leader to take responsibility for equality, as well as adopt internal practices that will improve access to funding and resources for women-led founder teams.They will also publish data on funding granted to businesses, showing whether the founding teams are male, female or mixed.Ms Rose said: ldquoWhen we began this process, everyone involved was in agreement that raising awareness of the Rose Reviewrsquos findings is only one small part of what is needed what we need is action.ldquoThe reaction from industry and the commitment that so many leading institutions have already shown towards the code has been fantastic and encouraging, and this is just the beginning.Responding to the initiative, Rebecca Park, managing director of external affairs at trade association UK Finance, said the number of participants showed the sectorrsquos determination support women entrepreneurs.ldquoInnovation and entrepreneurship are foundations for success and inclusion in our economy and society, and it is important that everyone has the opportunity to contribute, she said.ldquoBusiness ersity translates into UK economic growth which benefits us all.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast.

It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme.

Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/droad_1.jpg","title":"major new apartment building planned for dublin road","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew The Dublin Road in Belfast A new serviced apartment building could be developed along Belfast’s so-called ‘Golden Mile’ on the Dublin Road, it can be revealed.
