It was led by leisure and hospitality firms, who took on 226,000 more staff, as the slowing in Covid-19 infections encouraged more Americans to travel, and visit bars and restaurants. Manufacturers took on another 49,000 staff, with construction payrolls up 46,000. The latest survey of the construction sector found that shortages of materials and staff hold back the construction recovery in September.  Growth hit an eight-month low, as builders reported softer demand, unavailable transport, a severe lack of materials and continued staff shortages. It was also harder to find sub-contractors, who hiked their prices at the fastest rate on record.  Some firms said the unpredictable pricing environment had slowed clients’ decision-making on new orders and led to delays with contract awards. This dragged the IHS MarkitCIPS UK Construction PMI down to 52.6 in September, from 55.2 in August. That only shows a moderate expansion, and the weakest in eight months. Purchase prices increased rapidly in September, although the rate of inflation eased further from June’s all-time peak.  Staffing levels rose, but at the weakest rate since April, which partly reflected long wait times to fill vacancies.  Tim Moore, Director at IHS Markit, says labour shortages and the supply chain crisis led to a severe loss of momentum: More here: Surging energy prices rattle bonds and stocksThis suggests the markets are anticipating that UK inflation will push higher, intensifying pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates. Other government bond yields are also rising (including US Treasuries), as investors worry fret about rising prices hitting growth. George Vessey, currency strategist at Western Union Business Solutions, says: Joanna Fic, senior vice president at Moody’s, says that nine suppliers serving over 1.7 million customers have ceased trading since the beginning of September.  More will follow, Moody’s predicts, as suppliers face Renewable Obligation payments due in October. With customers of failed suppliers being taken over by rivals, there will be market consolidation and reduced competition for the remaining suppliers, including British Gas, Fic says. But profitability will be hit until higher commodity prices can be passed on to customers (when the energy cap rises next April). Such an intervention could include a ‘windfall tax’ to ease household bills (as has happened in Spain), or state loans and the creation of a “bad bank” to support energy suppliers Fresh highs in oil futures are keeping investors on edge, he adds, pushing up inflation expectations, which are in turn driving government bond yields to multi-month peaks.Every sector is down, led by consumer cyclicals, technology and industrial stocks, with mining stocks, travel companies and UK housebuilders among the fallers. “A continuing surge in energy prices means the sceptre of inflation is looming large over the markets again, says AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould. The November gas price at the Dutch TTF hub, a European benchmark, rose by €25.60 to €143.10 per megawatt hour by 0839 GMT. It earlier traded at a record €155.00 per megawatt hours.  “It’s amazing what we are looking at. Total craziness,” a gas trader said.But these are not normal times. The market is in ‘demand destruction’ mode. Energy prices hitting levels that will force some users, such as heavy industry, to cut demand. British wholesale gas for day-ahead delivery breached the £3 per therm mark for the first time on Wednesday morning. This takes wholesale gas prices further above the spike seen in 2018, when the “Beast from the East” weather system created a scramble for gas. A series of factors have driven up gas and energy prices across Europe -- from lower production levels and higher global demand, to a lack of wind to power the renewables turbines, and forecasts of a cold winter. Bloomberg’s Will Hares points out that the UK’s natural gas benchmark has more than doubled in the last month, as the crisis intensified. Yesterday, a UK industry body representing energy intensive sectors including steel, chemicals and fertilisers called for more help from the government to ensure they could continue to operate this winter. Without emergency measures, there could be shutdown at essential industries, they warned. Richard Leese, chairman of the Energy Intensive Users Group, said: It’s another sign that inflationary pressures are on the rise, intensifying the cost of living squeeze on households. More here.

The development of 1-4 Merchant’s Arch would not involve the removal of the laneway’s iconic arch structure. Photograph: iStockThe go-ahead from An Bord Pleanala for the demolition of an old building containing a mix of independent shops on Dublin’s Merchant’s Arch lane has been criticised by a heritage watchdog.The planning board last week upheld a decision by Dublin City Council to grant permission for the development of a four-storey over-basement hotel along the narrow, partly covered walkway, which is a key pedestrian route connecting Temple Bar Square to the Ha’penny Bridge.Ian Lumley, head of advocacy at An Taisce, said the heritage charity is “highly critical” of An Bord Pleanala’s permission for the redevelopment, which would see independent retailers, including a waffle café, Mojos Records, a vintage clothing store and a tech repair shop, replaced by a single boutique hotel and restaurant unit. The development of 1-4 Merchant’s Arch would not involve the removal of the laneway’s iconic arch structure.In its submission to the Board as part of the appeals process, An Taisce had said it would “strongly favour” retaining the existing series of small shops which contribute to the “sense of place” around Merchant’s Arch.Mr Lumley said the permission was further evidence of the Board’s recent “uncritical and laissez faire” approach to allowing large developments next to historic structures.“Our issue with Merchant’s Arch is that the development is overscaled and inappropriate in character for the area,” he told the . Meanwhile, more than 20,000 signatures have amassed on a petition to “save Merchant’s Arch” from the redevelopment.Fianna Fáil Dublin Dublin City councillor Deirdre Conroy, who is also an architectural heritage specialist, said the move was “bizarre”. The adaptation of a site adjacent to protected structures for accommodation should be a “major refusal”, she wrote on social media.Green Party councillor Claire Byrne said “time and time again” An Bord Pleanala has ignored the concerns of citizens and the City Development Plan in favour of hotels. “It’s like they won’t rest until we have a completely homogenised City Centre just for tourists,” the Dublin City councillor wrote on Twitter.An appeal against the council’s permission had been lodged by Temple Bar residents, including former  environment editor and local resident, Frank McDonald. An Bord Pleanala upheld the council’s decision, despite a recommendation from its own planning inspector to refuse permission on the basis that it would “seriously injure the visual amenities of the area and be contrary to the proper planning and sustainable development of the area”. An Bord Pleanala’s planning inspector A Considine concluded that, by reason of height and scale on a narrow plot, the development would be “out of character” and “visually discordant” in the area. The loss of the small independent traders would “damage the ersity and uniqueness” of the passageway, the inspector wrote.However, the planning board said the proposed development would be an “appropriate and sensitive design response to a prominent site”, subject to conditions. It believed the development would “promote and facilitate” tourism in the area. The loss of the existing mix of small-scale retailers into one consolidated unit would “continue to contribute to the existing vibrancy and character of the Temple Bar area, and also to Merchant’s Arch Lane”, according to the Board. It is the third time Tom Doone, the owner of the adjoining Merchant’s Arch pub, has sought to develop the site."},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker how many people have been inoculated in ireland","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 300,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and over 5,000 people have died.Globally, over 200 million people have been diagnosed and over 4\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Janssen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?Dose: Two doses, between 4 and 12 weeks apartEMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th. On June 28th, Niac revised its advice again and said the vaccine could be given\u0026nbspto people aged under 40, although the mRNA shots were preferable for that age group.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2-8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st.On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac initially recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50, but this was revised to include the under 40s on June 28th. Those aged 18-34 can apply to get the Janssen vaccine at pharmacies around the country.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2-8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?Over 80 per cent\u0026nbspof people in Ireland aged over 18 are now fully vaccinated, with over 90 per cent in receipt of at least one dose.

Photograph: Chris CurryiStockThe skin condition known as Covid toes may be a side effect of the immune system’s response to fighting off the virus, a new study has found.The symptom results in chilblain-like inflammation and redness on the hands and feet, with the condition sometimes lasting for months at a time.It typically develops within a week to four weeks of being infected and can result in toes and fingers becoming swollen or changing colour.Researchers behind the study, which has been published in the British Journal of Dermatology, examined 50 participants with Covid toes and 13 with similar chilblains lesions that arose before the pandemic.They found one mechanism behind both types of the condition involved the body generating an immune response with high levels of certain autoantibodies, which mistakenly target and react with a person’s own cells and tissues as well as the invading virus.They also found an overlap with type I interferon, a key protein in the antiviral response.In addition to the immune system, cells lining blood vessels which supply the affected areas also appeared to play a critical role in the development of Covid toes and chilblains.Senior author of the study, Dr Charles Cassius, said the research provided a deeper understanding of the condition.“The epidemiology and clinical features of chilblain-like lesions have been extensively studied and published, however, little is known about the pathophysiology involved,” he said.“Our study provides new insights.” – PAEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"culture of harassment in defence forces needs to be stamped out coveney","story":"Retired captain Yvonne O’Rourke, company quartermaster Sgt Karina Molloy and Capt Diane Byrne, of the Women of Honour group, after a meeting with Minister for Defence Simon Coveney last week. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillMinister for Defence Simon Coveney has said that a culture of intimidation and harassment continues in the Defence Forces and it needed to be stamped out.It was a culture that allowed people to be isolated and bullied and harassed, he told RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland. “That’s not acceptable to me, it’s not acceptable to the Department of Defence, it’s not acceptable to the leadership within the Defence Forces. “We’re going to change that.”“This is a historic problem in the Defence Forces, but in my view it is also a current problem. Which is why we need to act to stamp it out now.”Mr Coveney also said that despite an apparent decrease in such cases to “single figures”, according to official figures, because of the culture of intimidation many did not feel they could report incidents of harassment, intimidation or abuse.“One of the problems is that there is not an atmosphere that allows people to come tell their stories, when they want to and that cultural issue needs to change. I do have data of the number of cases taken to the Garda Siochana - which shows that the number of cases has reduced significantly over time, but that clearly isn’t dealing with the core of the problem because what many people have told me is that there is a culture that doesn’t allow people to come forward in a way that they feel safe in doing that.”The Minister said that the official number of cases was in single figures, “but that’s not the end of the story because what I’m hearing is that the structures and procedures are not there to allow people to come and report safely without feeling that they will potentially be labelled as a troublemaker or a difficult person within the Defence Forces - that is not an atmosphere that I can allow continue.”Mr Coveney announced he will appoint a confidential contact person for former and serving members of the Defence Forces who make allegations fo bullying, discrimination, harassment and sexual harassment.The Minister said the appointment of a contact person will provide a “safe place to support the reporting of alleged wrongdoing”. This person will document disclosures and guide former and serving men and women about their follow-up options. The contact will be “entirely independent from the Defence Forces and the Department of Defence and will operate under a service called Raiseaconcern, which works with private and public sector bodies about issues of wrongdoing in the workplace, on the appointment.”Raiseaconcern will provide the Minister with periodic updates on the number and type of cases and issues they are seeing, while ensuring all information is strictly anonymised, a Department spokesperson said. The information gathered will also inform the independent review process. The contact person will operate until an independent review of the Defence Forces and its procedures for dealing with complaints of bullying and harassment has been completed.RTÉ’s Women of Honour programme recently detailed a wide range of misconduct and abuse within the Defence Forces, including allegations of harassment, sexual assault and rape, committed over three decades.Mr Coveney said his Department has also been in contact with the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre to ensure appropriate counselling and supports are available to people who suffered sexual abuse in the Defence Forces.“I have consistently said that such serious allegations should be reported to the gardaí without delay, as they are the competent authority to investigate such actions. However, I am fully cognizant of the trauma suffered by the victims and I am pleased and grateful that the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, who are professionally trained in this area,” he said. Mr Coveney told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland on Wednesday that these interim measures are being introduced because “we are not going to wait” for the conclusion of the independent review, which he expects will begin “within the next three weeks or so”.Mr Coveney expressed hope that the people who have come forward with their experiences of abuse, harassment and sexual violence will “believe in this review” and its terms of reference. He said he will seek for it to involve a panel of people and include international expertise.“We do need to pick the right person to chair this and we have a number of people in mind,” he said, adding that he will liaise with the Women of Honour group to ensure they have confidence in the chosen inidual.Mr Coveney praised the “incredibly courageous” women who have spoken out against abuse and harassment suffered in the Defence Forces. Their stories have encouraged others to speak out to “fix something in the Defence Forces that is very wrong”, he added.It is “not acceptable” to anyone, Mr Coveney said, that there is a continuing culture that allows people to be “isolated and bullied and harassed” in the service.Women and men in the Defence Forces need a safe space to tell their stories and report wrongdoing, he said, while abusive behaviour must be “stamped out”. Defence Forces Chief of Staff, Lt General Sean Clancy, said the interim support measures announced on Wednesday are a “first step” in addressing the issues raised. He said he is “fully committed to ensuring that the work environment of Óglaigh na hÉireann is a safe, enriching and rewarding one for all who serve”.“There is no place for inappropriate or toxic behaviour within the Defence Forces. It will neither be tolerated nor accepted I will not accept it, neither should any member of the organisation,” he added.Mr Coveney said in a statement that the issues raised by Women of Honour are “extremely serious for both women and men and need to be addressed in the most comprehensive way possible”.There must be “zero-tolerance” for any kind of bullying, discrimination or harassment, he said, adding that stamping it out is the “absolute priority” for him, the Chief of Staff and the Secretary General.The minister is to address the Pdforra conference in Killarney on Wednesday afternoon, which represents approximately 8,500 men and women in the Army, Navy and Air Corps.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"coveney says uk not likely to trigger article 16 in near future","story":"Simon  Coveney said the  Government and the EU had listened “very carefully” to David Frost’s comments. Photograph: Peter ByrnePA Wire The Minister for Foregin Affairs has said he does not believe that the UK Government is likely to trigger Article 16 in the near future.Simon Coveney said on Wednesday that he did not think it was likely that Boris Johnson’s Government would take what is seen to be the nuclear option of triggering Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol.Mr Coveney was speaking following comments by Britain’s Brexit minister David Frost at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester, in which he hinted that action over Northern Ireland’s Brexit deal could be taken by Christmas as he called for “short, intensive” talks with the EU to get under way swiftly.If the UK and the EU cannot strike an agreement, Mr Frost said Britain will consider using Article 16.The move would effectively tear up parts of the deal to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, which he negotiated with the EU last December.Mr Frost told the Conservative Party conference in Manchester that he would “soon be sending” new legal texts to the EU with proposals to resolve the “serious political problem”.“I hope that might change over the next couple of weeks or so. It does need to be resolved though, one way or another, whether it’s through negotiations or Article 16,” he told a fringe event arranged by the Policy Exchange think tank.Mr Coveney said on RTE radio that there had been a lot of “tough talk” this week from Mr Frost.He insisted that he did not believe that the UK government would use Article 16.“My understanding is that the British government is not likely to trigger Article 16 any time soon,” he said.The Minister said he believed the UK was “committed to an intensive negotiation process for the rest of this month, with the European Commission, who are developing a new package of measures to try to ensure that we can take on board legitimate concerns that have been expressed with the implementation of the protocol”.Mr Coveney said that the Irish Government and the EU had listened “very carefully” to Mr Frost’s comments but said that he believed negotiations between the two sides would continue.“What we’re trying to do here is ensure that it is implemented in as flexible away as possible to reduce its impact, and I wouldn’t read too much into the tough talk at a Conservative Party conference,” he said.The protocol effectively keeps Northern Ireland in the EU’s single market for goods, but as a result has imposed a trade barrier on products crossing the Irish Sea from Britain.Unionists want Mr Johnson to tear it up, a move he has so far resisted as the Government presses for a renegotiation with Brussels.At a conference fringe event this week, DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said: “We simply cannot allow this situation to continue. And we need to see action taken by the government within weeks.”He added: “We need the government to set up, and to take action to remove this Irish Sea border, remove the barriers to trade within the United Kingdom, and fundamentally to restore Northern Ireland’s place within the UK internal market.”Triggering Article 16 “has its use in the short term”, but legislation was needed “to restore Northern Ireland’s place fully within the United Kingdom,” he said.–PA"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Fears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"dominic raab confuses meaning of misogyny in bbc interview","story":"British justice secretary Dominic Raab has confused the meaning of misogyny, stating that it is absolutely wrong whether it\u0027s a man against a woman or a woman against a man, during an interview on BBC Breakfast. Video: ReutersBritain’s Justice Secretary  Dominic Raab has previously said he is not a feminist and complained about the ‘raw deal’ men are getting. Photograph: Ben StansallAFPGetty ImagesDominic Raab has rejected the idea that misogyny should become a hate crime in the wake of the Sarah Everard murder, but then appeared confused about its meaning as he suggested it could apply to abuse against either women or men.The UK’s justice secretary, who has said he is not a feminist and previously complained about the “raw deal” men are getting, said it was his “number one priority to make sure women feel confident in the justice system”.However, pressed on BBC Breakfast about whether misogyny should be a hate crime, he appeared not to understand the term as he said “misogyny is absolutely wrong, whether it’s a man against a woman or a woman against a man”.Misogyny is hatred aimed specifically against women, and some campaigners would like to see it criminalised.Questioned about his confusion, Mr Raab said: “What I meant was, if we are talking about things below the level of public order offences of harassment, intimidation, which are rightly criminalised - if we are talking about, effectively, insults with a sexist basis, I don’t think that criminalising those sorts of things will deal with the problem that we have got at the heart of the Sarah Everard case.”He said the problem was with enforcement, rather than a lack of laws, supporting UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s views that a hate crime of misogyny was not necessary.Mr Raab also downplayed statistics that show less than 1.4 per cent of alleged rapes are prosecuted, saying most crime data is examined at the point of charge.“The conviction rate statistics are often, I’m afraid, rather skewed,” he said. “If you look at the normal way that people measure the conviction rate - as a proportion of the number of prosecutions that are launched - actually once you get to court, there is more or less around a 70 per cent chance of conviction.“The challenge we’ve got is the reporting of cases, through to the preparation of the file that goes to the CPS and then the decision to prosecute - the critical thing is getting the cases to trial with the evidence to secure that conviction.”Asked about accusations that misogynistic attitudes are tolerated in policing, Mr Raab said it was precisely why the government had ordered an inquiry into the circumstances of Sarah Everard’s murder by a serving police officer. He said some systemic changes would need to be put in place.“I know many, many incredibly dedicated police officers, men and women, who are appalled by this and are determined to fix this problem. But we do need to look at culture in the police and the second phase of the review, the inquiry the home secretary announced, is targeted at that issue,” he said.Speaking later on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Mr Raab acknowledged that the long backlog of cases in the courts was due partly to cuts in the criminal justice system, adding that he hoped it could be cleared within six to 12 months. –Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"boris cant defy laws political gravity forever","story":"The Conservative Party conference has shrunk. The auditorium here in Manchester more resembles a glorified fringe meeting because the main hall was deemed too cavernous to accommodate a smaller, Covid-affected, gathering without it looking half empty on TV, which is all that matters, of course. Boris Johnson will be afforded a larger setting when he speaks but his fellow ministers have been reduced to participating in somewhat desultory chats or set-piece addresses to a listless audience.It pains me to think that the first Conservative conference I attended was 40 years ago when the party leadership sat on a platform like the Soviet presidium looking down on the masses. If you think things are bad now you clearly don’t remember then. When the Tories gathered in Blackpool that year, the acrid smoke of the Brixton riots had only dissipated a few months before, IRA bombers were targeting London and other cities, manufacturing was contracting rapidly and unemployment was soaring.Labour was tearing itself apart – just the previous week in Brighton Tony Benn came within a whisker of becoming the deputy leader, an inconceivable triumph for the hard Left until Jeremy Corbyn, his acolyte, succeeded to the crown. In the opinion polls, the government and the opposition were being trounced by the new kid on the block, the SDP, which registered 50 per cent support at one point. It was a time of ferment and turmoil, a great clash of ideologies and big personalities.In Manchester today, it is as though the laws of political gravity have been suspended. Here we are at the end (we hope) of a period of rule by diktat, a pandemic that has killed thousands and led to record NHS waiting lists, no one able to travel easily, energy prices rising, fuel shortages, empty shelves and concerns that Christmas will be a miserable affair for a second year.Yet the Tories remain ahead in the opinion polls. Far from providing the bounce that usually goes with enhanced visibility, Labour’s conference has seen the party fall back. It is as though Sir Keir Starmer has sucked the life out of the Left, who find themselves in a parallel world where the Tories are attacking big business while Labour opposes tax rises for the NHS. Trots and union militants who would once have marched through the city shouting Boris Out and Tory scum are thin on the ground.The Tories can hardly believe their luck though whether it will last is another matter. Mr Johnson remains in irrepressibly bullish mood, sensibly declining invitations to acknowledge a crisis that does not exist, or at least not yet.His speech today will be a laurel-garlanded triumph, his entry to Rome after vanquishing the barbarians of socialism in 2019. But past glories are never enough preparing for the next election is now the priority and here Tories are less sanguine and somewhat uncertain.Are they still a small state, low tax party or pre-Thatcher interventionists in the mould of Harold Macmillan? Mr Johnson and his team have drunk the milk of dirigisme during the pandemic and have found it intoxicating. They have thrown an avuncular arm around the nation and are reluctant to release their grip. The tax burden is higher than at any time since the 1950s with no guarantee it will not rise further despite protestations from the Prime Minister and Chancellor that they remain visceral low taxers.In his speech on Monday, Rishi Sunak reasserted the importance of sound money and restoring credibility to the public finances shattered by the pandemic splurge. Yet there was little focus on the other side of the balance sheet, namely spending. Taxes are going up, but where are the cuts to help balance the books? We are told there is to be no return to austerity but paring back the public sector is not a hair-shirt endeavour but an essential requirement.Just 10 years ago this was an article of Tory faith. Before the 2010 election they were ardent supporters of a smaller state both as an end itself and as a necessity. The aggrandised public sector that ballooned under Labour was no longer affordable. As Liam Byrne, the outgoing Treasury chief secretary said in the notorious letter that he left behind on his desk for his successor, there was no money left.In opposition, reducing the size of government was a key Tory policy, a decisive break with a 50-year trend that had seen government become excessively intrusive, interfering and statist. They calculated, correctly, that the assumptions of the bureaucratic age – that the centre knows best – had been smashed by access to the internet. Now, people search out the cheapest or the best option in a matter of minutes. Yet when it comes to public services, not least the NHS, choices are not available.In opposition, the Conservatives were keen to pursue the approach adopted in Canada in the mid-1990s when their budget deficit spiralled out of control. It involved a comprehensive re-evaluation of what functions government should be undertaking and the jettisoning of anything non-essential. They reduced federal spending by almost 10 per cent in two years, leaving room for tax cuts which helped boost economic growth.Of course, the ambitions of the Tories were knocked back by the financial crash and the failure to win a majority in 2010, requiring a coalition with the Lib Dems. But the chance to rethink the state from the bottom up was lost and there is no sign it is being reconsidered.The outcome of the Chancellor’s spending review later this month will doubtless require some departments to cut their cloth but no one is expecting anything dramatic or fundamental. The biggest casualty so far appears to be Mr Johnson’s idea of building a tunnel to Ireland which was always daft. It is a shame that at his recent reshuffle he did not take the opportunity to abolish a few otiose departments (like Culture, Media and Sport) to show a commitment to rolling back the frontiers of the state. We are seeing the biggest real-terms increase in departmental spending in decades.Levelling up cannot just involve announcing more money to be directed largely to areas that have already had higher levels of public spending than anywhere else. For years there has been talk of redefining what the state does.

Many common plant names reflected racist slurs”.Some examples may include the kaffir lime, with “kaffir” an offensive term for black Africans with its origins in the Arabic word for non-believer.The succulent Crassula marnieriana could also be seen as offensive, as it is sometimes known as “hottentot”, an antiquated term for the southern African Khoekhoe people.Breadfruit, which the map points out is sold on Brixton’s markets, has been highlighted for its links to slavery, as it was cultivated to feed slaves on plantations.Dr Zareer Masani, a historian of Britain’s colonial past, has decried the finding of offense in Britain’s botany. He said: “The fact that the current craze to blame colonialism or slavery for almost everything has now reached our plants is a measure of how absurd things have become.“Organisations like TFL need to get a grip and focus on the services they’re meant to provide. “The obsession with this kind of political correctness has travelled from our statues and road names to the very food we eat, the clothes we wear, the language we use and now the flowers we enjoy.  “One can only guess which new area of our lives is left for our new Puritans to attack next.More from NewsWatch: Protester removed from Louis Vuitton catwalk after storming show in ParisFar-Right TV host overtakes Le Pen in polls and could face Macron in presidential raceFrivolous energy policies will undermine Conservative support for climate actionSerial killer Stephen Port was obsessed with extreme pornography, inquest toldSturgeon\u0026#39s constitutional fight may be her greatest unforced error yetMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ethnic minority charity welcomes return blackface morris dancers","story":"An ethnic minority charity has welcomed the return of a Morris dancing group who defended the use of blackface during performances.Morris dancers have been wearing blackface as far back as the 15th century but came under criticism last year after the death of George Floyd sparked a wide-ranging discussion of racism and prejudice.A wave of Black Lives Matter protests prompted the Joint Morris Organisation (JMO) in July 2020 to ban the practice among its 800 members as it has the “deep potential to cause hurt”.This saw the Britannia Coconut Dancers (also known as the Coconutters), based in Bacup, Lancashire, split from the JMO over their refusal to stop using blackface make-up. The group commented at the time that “removing any part of our costume will take away the mystique of who we are”.Last weekend, the Coconutters had been asked to perform at the Bacup Makers Market, but the performance was cancelled after some residents threatened to boycott the market entirely. The group were then rebooked the following day and staged a five-hour dance through Bacup in their “full traditional outfit”.The Coconutters claimed they had received “exceptional” support from the townspeople and local businesses. It was the first time the group had performed publicly since the blackface ban.And Lancashire BME Network, a charity which highlights the plight of ethnic minorities within the region, said they had no objections to the performance as it is a “rich cultural tradition”.The charity said the use of blackface within this context was not racist as the practice historically related to underpaid mill workers “who painted their face black so their employers would not know that they were dancing for extra money”.Jonathon Prasad, project officer for Lancashire BME network, said they were “supportive” of the group as they have never viewed it as a racial issue.He told the Lancashire : “In the past when I’ve worked on similar topics, I’ve never seen them as a racial thing at all.“We believe that communities should be going out and really asking questions about why people do blackface.“If it was a minstrel type of show, that’s a different sort of context and we might have a different opinion.”Gavin McNulty, secretary of the Britannia Coconut Dancers, defended the performance saying “they were continuing a tradition which has been upheld for over 200 to 300 years.”Mr McNulty confirmed the group had darkened their faces during the performance in “keeping with our tradition which is respected worldwide.”He told the Daily : “This is the way it should be and this is the way that we as a team, in our community want it, hence all the controversy of the past couple of years.“We danced out on Sunday 3rd October through the town of Bacup and the support from the townsfolk was exceptional and thanks to Facebook we had people watching from all over the world such as Australia and the Netherlands, even America, so this shows the support the team has.”The true origins of the use of blackface within Morris dancing remains hotly debated.British folklore expert Professor Ronald Hutton told the  last year that while the Morris name is derived from the Moors, the use of black make-up predated racial connotations and was widespread in folk plays.In June 2020, the JMO had said that blackening faces is a dwindling practice among dancing teams, and “will be banned to make the folk tradition fully inclusive of all races and backgrounds without performers or spectators feeling uncomfortable.”The organisation is also moving to prevent the tradition being exploited for nationalist symbolism by far-right groups.More from NewsWatch: Protester removed from Louis Vuitton catwalk after storming show in ParisFar-Right TV host overtakes Le Pen in polls and could face Macron in presidential raceFrivolous energy policies will undermine Conservative support for climate actionSerial killer Stephen Port was obsessed with extreme pornography, inquest toldSturgeon\u0026#39s constitutional fight may be her greatest unforced error yetMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"hydrogen boiler revolution pretty much impossible says minister","story":"Using hydrogen to replace natural gas as a green alternative in boilers is “pretty much impossible”, a minister has admitted, despite the Government planning major trials over the coming decade.The Government’s plan currently targets the production of 5GW capacity by 2030, which it hopes to use for industry, transport and potentially home heating.A village will be selected to trial hydrogen in its pipes as a heating alternative by 2025. This will involve the conversion of the local grid and the replacement of devices such as boilers, meters and hobs. A town-scale trial is planned by 2030.Energy secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has suggested that all homes with gas boilers could potentially be switched to hydrogen, depending on the outcome of trials.But Lord Martin Callanan, a junior minister in the business and energy department, has admitted that low-carbon hydrogen is unlikely to become a viable alternative.Describing himself as a “little bit of a hydrogen sceptic”, Lord Callanan said: “If I’m being honest the idea that we could produce enough hydrogen at reasonable cost to displace mains gas is pretty much impossible.“Technology might get us there, there might be some scientific breakthrough. But it’s more likely that it will end up being used by trains and HGVs, for some industrial processes, rather than for home heating.“But the official policy is we will see how the market develops and take a view in the mid-part of this decade as to whether it will play a significant role in the home.”The Government wants hydrogen to provide enough energy for  67,000 homes, or 0.2 per cent of domestic heating demand, by 2030, rising to around 10 per cent by 2035, which could involve blending it into the natural gas grid.Hydrogen can be made either using methane, with the emissions captured and stored, classed as “blue”, or through electrolysis, considered “green” if renewable electricity is used.Blue hydrogen is not considered to be a zero-carbon energy source, and requires carbon capture technology that is yet to be deployed at scale.Creating green hydrogen for homes would use six times as much electricity as direct heat electrification from heat pumps, according to a study last year.Lord Callanan acknowledged that moving to green heating in homes is “one of the biggest political challenges that we are faced with as a government.”“It doesn’t get that much publicity, but it’s something that will cost us an enormous amount of money over the next 15 to 20 years.”Gas boilers contribute around 14 per cent of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions, which the Government has committed to getting to net zero by 2050. A Government strategy outlining its plans to decarbonise heating has been repeatedly delayed, amid concern over the cost for households.Lord Callanan said plans to raise the cost of gas would be “nigh on impossible politically” amid the current energy price crunch.But he said it would be necessary to rebalance social and green levies, which are currently around 20 per cent of electricity bills and mean running a heat pump is more expensive than running a gas boiler.“To persuade people to make the change, we have to provide them with the right incentives. But it’s a difficult policy challenge. Thankfully one for the Treasury and not me,” he said.The Government is expected to announce a consultation on rebalancing the levies, with possible options being to move them onto gas or into general taxation.More from NewsWatch: Protester removed from Louis Vuitton catwalk after storming show in ParisFar-Right TV host overtakes Le Pen in polls and could face Macron in presidential raceFrivolous energy policies will undermine Conservative support for climate actionSerial killer Stephen Port was obsessed with extreme pornography, inquest toldSturgeon\u0026#39s constitutional fight may be her greatest unforced error yetMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"royal navy submarine jousts japanese show strength aimed china","story":"A Royal Navy submarine has taken on the Japanese navy in the first training exercise of its kind in a show of strength to China.The exercise last month involved “thousands of tons of steel in a game of cat and mouse” a former Royal Navy anti-submarine frigate captain told the .The Japanese navy said it had conducted “a bilateral exercise with the Royal Navy in order to strengthen cooperation and realise a free and open Indo-Pacific”.The exercise took place on Sept 14 and 15, the Japanese navy said.The deepening defence relationship between Britain and Japan and the forging of new friendships in the region is likely to anger China.Taking place in waters off Japan, the drills were part of the ongoing deployment of the UK Carrier Strike Group, based around HMS Queen Elizabeth, Britain’s newest operational aircraft carrier.The Royal Navy’s nuclear-powered Astute-class submarine would likely have gone up against a Soryu-class diesel-electric boat from the Japanese navy.Tom Sharpe, a former commander in the Royal Navy and an anti-submarine warfare specialist, said the interaction demonstrated the “width of soft and hard power options a carrier strike group brings to the table”.“This is a strategically vital part of the world, with the Chinese army and Air Force currently and repeatedly encroaching Taiwanese airspace.“This is the sort of exercise that strengthens everything from strategic alliances to tactical operating procedures.“VIP visits, group formations and freedom of navigation operations photograph well and tend to capture the headlines.“Meanwhile, underwater, far from any cameras, thousands of tons of steel are engaged in a game of cat and mouse, the implications of which will resonate from the very highest levels of political alliance-forming to the operators in the respective submarine control rooms.”Diesel-electric submarines are often quieter than nuclear powered boats when submerged, due to the noise generated by the primary coolant pumps around the reactor.Even so, nuclear submarines are more highly prized as they can operate for longer, deeper and at greater ranges than diesel-electric boats.Taro Kono, the leading candidate to succeed Yoshihide Suga, Japan’s outgoing prime minister, has expressed support for transitioning Japan’s 20-strong submarine force to nuclear powered vessels, given the increasing threat from China.These drills are likely to have emboldened calls for Japan’s submarines to adopt nuclear power and come just weeks after Australia agreed to develop such a fleet with Britain and the US.The exercise would have been tightly controlled to prevent an inadvertent collision underwater.The British and Japanese boats would likely have taken it in turns to be the hunter force. Each would have operated in an area of roughly 20 square miles, with the boxes separated laterally by at least a mile.Without surface ships present, the submarines will have practised search and attack phases. If warships were involved, it is likely one submarine would have been assigned to the surface group and the other would act as the aggressor, trying to get a clean shot on the group’s mission critical ship.Mr Sharpe said the ultra quiet submarines would have been “holes in the ocean” throughout the exercise, as each tried to get a firing solution on the other.The key vulnerability of diesel-electric submarines is the necessity to come to periscope depth periodically, to “snort” fresh air whilst running the diesel engines to recharge the batteries. It is not known if the Japanese boat had to conduct this procedure.The British hunter-killer submarine would have been able to remain submerged throughout the exercise.A Ministry of Defence spokesperson said: “Japan is one of our closest strategic partners. The ability to integrate militarily with allies and partners has been the hallmark of this global deployment”.More from NewsWatch: Protester removed from Louis Vuitton catwalk after storming show in ParisFar-Right TV host overtakes Le Pen in polls and could face Macron in presidential raceFrivolous energy policies will undermine Conservative support for climate actionSerial killer Stephen Port was obsessed with extreme pornography, inquest toldSturgeon\u0026#39s constitutional fight may be her greatest unforced error yetMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"survey reveals poem uk voters believe greatest ever written","story":"Rough winds may shake the darling buds of May, but not the enduring popularity of Shakespeare’s verse, as the Bard’s Sonnet 18 has been voted the greatest poem of all time.The work, which begins “Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?”, has polled first in a UK-wide survey on the nation’s favourite poetry.Despite being written 400 years ago, the 14-line rumination on beauty, time, and the immortality of art has lived on in the public imagination and was chosen ahead of more modern verse.The 18th poem in William Shakespeare’s cycle of 154 sonnets was voted for by 18 per cent of those surveyed for their literary favourites, ahead of works by other evergreen poets including William Wordsworth and John Keats.The poem is part of the “Fair Youth” sequence of sonnets, which are believed to be addressed to a beautiful young man and romantic interest.While the work seems a straightforward poem extolling beauty, like the others which precede it in the collection of sonnets first published in 1609, it signs off with a couplet declaring that only his verse will make the youth immortal: “So long as men can breathe or eyes can see”.The sonnet was chosen ahead of Wordsworth’s rhapsodising nature poem I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud (also commonly known as “Daffodils”), conjuring the beauty of the Lake District, which was picked by 10 per cent of those surveyed.American writer Edgar Allen Poe’s gothic work The Raven was chosen by 9 per cent of respondents in a survey by research group Perspectus Global, as was Rudyard Kipling’s stoic poem If.Traditional poets of the English canon appear in the top 20 list, which includes William Blake’s The Tyger, Lord Byron’s She Walks in Beauty, and Wilfred Owen’s First World War work Dulce et Decorum est.But more modern verse also appears on the list, with Benjamin Zephaniah’s Dis Poetry and Maya Angelou’s poem Still I Rise also being cited in the survey, along with Carol Ann Duffy’s The Way My Mother Speaks.While modern works such as the song Cat D, by spoken word artist George the Poet, appears on the list, Shakespeare’s 17th-century sonnet remained the most cited poem in the survey.Although a love poem polled first, and several amorous works are included in the top 20, the survey found that, online, only one in 10 people in the UK could contemplate reciting romantic verse.More from NewsWatch: Protester removed from Louis Vuitton catwalk after storming show in ParisFar-Right TV host overtakes Le Pen in polls and could face Macron in presidential raceFrivolous energy policies will undermine Conservative support for climate actionSerial killer Stephen Port was obsessed with extreme pornography, inquest toldSturgeon\u0026#39s constitutional fight may be her greatest unforced error yetMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"boris talks good game no margaret thatcher","story":"The Prime Minister today stands before the Tory faithful posing as a bold reformer with the ‘guts’ to tackle issues that were ignored by his predecessors.Painting a picture of a Britain which for too long has struggled with a legacy of under-performance, he is explicitly inviting a comparison with Margaret Thatcher.Thatcher was a woman who knew her mind, had a strong sense of direction, a determination to succeed and a willingness to promote capable people – with whom she did not always agree – to get the job done. When she took power, Britain was an international basket case. We had just been bailed out by the IMF and successive governments of both stripes had been held hostage and destroyed by the unions. Margaret Thatcher knew that the country needed to be turned around and was determined to do so.The result was a transformation in our quality of life and international standing. The 1980s saw reforms to labour market rules and regulation across swathes of the economy. Thatcher’s governments faced down the unions, privatised state-owned utilities, simplified the tax system, deregulated the City – and gave council tenants the right to buy their homes. And that’s before we consider events like the Falklands.By comparison, Boris Johnson talks a good game, but leaves us wondering when we will see the results, or what they will look like when they do arrive. Take the fuel shortages – a structural issue with supply of HGV drivers, exacerbated by Covid and, in Britain, Brexit – which became a crisis through media alarmism and poor communications from the Government. The Prime Minister’s response appears to be to make a virtue of chaos, casting this as part of our transition from a ‘low wage, low growth, low skills, low productivity’ economy. After the event, it turns out this was all part of the plan.And the plan is to stoke inflation ministers have urged business to pay drivers (and many others, including abbatoir workers and restaurant staff) more to fix supply problems now being seen across the economy. We are getting the higher wages, which will be paid by consumers in higher prices, but, so far, are seeing very little on how or when we are going to get the greater productivity. What is certain is that it\u0027s not going to happen soon, so in the meantime we are just going to have to settle for paying more for less. Margaret Thatcher once described inflation as theft – from the savings of anyone who has been thrifty. She also famously said that the problem with socialism is that ‘you eventually run out of other people’s money’.

Common sense, and the briefest acquaintance with chapter one of an economics textbook, would seem to suggest that if you increase the supply of something – in this case workers – then the price will go down. And if there is unlimited extra supply, the price will never go up.Although everyone accepts that that is true of most commodities, for some reason labour was viewed as an exception. In fairness, there are some differences. Additional people earn and spend money, so to some degree expand the economy. And often the new arrivals weren’t competing directly with native workers. Lots of oh-so-clever models were constructed to prove there was no impact. Anyone who argued otherwise was sneered at for ignoring the “evidence” and dubbed a bigot.Now that we have restricted freedom of movement from the EU, what is happening? Wages are rising rapidly. Average earnings are going up 8 per cent annually, and in trades such as transport or construction by 20 per cent.  While this has much to do with the effect of workers returning from furlough, these are still astonishing figures.The Labour Party, the main architect of unrestricted immigration, ties itself up in knots over whether to back a £15 minimum wage, deaf to the irony that most companies would kill to find someone willing to work for less than twenty quid an hour right now. If this was a lab experiment, and to some degree it is, the conclusion would be clear. Turning off the flow of workers increases salaries.With unlimited access to a young, talented workforce from Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, British companies became hooked on cheap labour. Why spend hundreds of thousands of pounds automating that supply depot when an agency in Budapest could supply plenty of guys to do the night shift at minimum wage? Who needs to spend money on complex check-in software for a hotel when you can hire a cheerful Portuguese youngster for peanuts? It was great for profits, and also pretty good for skilled professionals who didn’t compete for those jobs. But it was hardly great for productivity.Even worse, we created industries based entirely on cheap imported labour. Britain is the only major developed country where hand car washes have been available everywhere. We produce far more chicken than Germany, although it is a larger country (and not the organic, free-range kind, but the battery, force-fed stuff) using an immigrant labour force. Does that make any sense? Not really. It is tough for the owners of battery chicken factories, but it makes more sense to import birds from the EU than people.Sure, there will be some disruption. And some prices will rise, although in other cases profits will be lower instead. We are witnessing that now. The Government could have planned for the transition better, and so could business, but we need to keep a couple of points in mind. The market works through shocks and disruption. They are not usually this extreme, to put it mildly, but they are also part of the process. And it is very difficult to plan an economy. You can try, but there’s no point being surprised if it goes wrong.The important point is this. The experts and business leaders who told us immigration didn’t impact wages got it badly wrong. The result? Wages stagnated for millions of blue-collar workers for years. We won’t get an apology – but we also shouldn’t listen to them again.More from NewsWatch: Protester removed from Louis Vuitton catwalk after storming show in ParisFar-Right TV host overtakes Le Pen in

system overreacts","story":"The skin condition known as Covid toes may be a side effect of the immune system overreacting in its response to fighting off the virus, a new study has found.The symptom results in chilblain-like inflammation and redness on the hands and feet, with the condition sometimes lasting for months at a time.        It typically develops within a week to four weeks of being infected and can result in toes and fingers becoming swollen or changing colour.However, symptoms are said to be mild in the majority of cases and the feet return to normal within weeks.Although the condition can affect anyone who catches the virus, Covid toes reportedly affects children and teenagers most commonly.Researchers behind the study, which has been published in the British Journal of Dermatology, examined 50 participants with Covid toes and 13 with similar chilblains lesions that arose before the pandemic.The latest findings showed that one mechanism behind the condition involved the body generating an immune response with high levels of certain autoantibodies, which mistakenly target and react with a person\u0027s own cells and tissues as well as the invading virus.The other mechanism was found to involve an antiviral protein called type 1 interferon, which is a key protein in the antiviral response.In addition to the immune system, the researchers from the University of Paris, France, found that cells lining blood vessels which supply the affected areas also appeared to play a critical role in the development of Covid toes and chilblains.The senior author of the study, Dr Charles Cassius, said the research provided a deeper understanding of the condition.The epidemiology and clinical features of chilblain-like lesions have been extensively studied and published, however, little is known about the pathophysiology involved, he said.Our study provides new insights.The lesions caused by Covid toes usually go away on their own, however some people may need treatment with creams and other drugs.More from NewsWatch: Protester removed from Louis Vuitton catwalk after storming show in ParisFar-Right TV host overtakes Le Pen in polls and could face

news denise-van-outen-unusual-sleep-\"Denise and Eddie get a good nights sleep with Silent NightByMartin Winter:,  Oct Updated:,  Oct TV icon Denise Van Outen had a very unusual wake-up this morning – on a billboard in Manchester city centre. The Celebrity Gogglebox star and boyfriend Eddie Boxshall appeared in a double bed attached vertically to mxm advertising board. She said: “I must admit, this is one of the more bizarre ways to wake up. “But despite being suspended above the ground - and being vertical rather than horizontal - I’m surprisingly comfortable. “I can’t say I’d want to wake up this way every day, but it’s been lots of fun andit helps people take some steps to improve their own sleep, I’ll be happy. The one-of-a-kind billboard was created by sleep brand Silentnight, which celebrates its th anniversary this year, to highlight its range of sleep solutions.  The brand also commissioned research of , adults which found the average Brit gets just three good nightaposs sleep a week. In fact, one in ten even say they NEVER sleep well throughout a whole night. Nearly one in fivecan’t get to sleep because of a bad tummy, while  percent strugglethey’re in an unusual location. A quarter of Brits find themselves frustrated by a snoring partner, while  percent find it harder to drop off at nightthey’ve succumbed to a nap in the daytime.And seven in ten are sleeping on the wrong mattress. But for  percent, stress is the number-one thing keeping them up at night. More than halfof respondents even feel as though they wake up with aches and pains in the morning after a night of poor sleep. Three-quarters also feel as though the night is never going to end when they’re staring at the ceiling struggling to nod off. Brits also find the post-lunch slump the point in the day they feel most tired, pinpointing : in the afternoon as the minute they find it hardest to keep their eyes open.  A little under halffeel being overly tired affects their mood, while  percent fuel themselves with coffee to give them much-needed energy. Just under one in threehave even been so concerned by their own tiredness they visited a medical expert, according to the OnePoll research. Katherine Collins, senior brand manager at Silentnight, said: “There are all kinds of reasons why people might struggle to sleep on a given night – or even regularly – and it’s time to put compromise to bed. “A lot of the reasons are things that can’t be changed by external forces, but there are things everyone can do to improve their sleep. “Things like cutting down on caffeine, eating and drinking the right things and making sure your mattress supports your sleep style can have a huge impact. “And while we don’t imagine most people would sleep too well suspended from a billboard, we’d back our mattresses to at least feel comfortable while you’re up there.” TOP  REASONS BRITS DONaposT GET A GOOD NIGHTaposS SLEEP...It was too hot Stress Partner snoring The light coming through the curtains wakes them up early Money worries It was too cold A bad tummy Being in an unusual location An uncomfortable mattress Traffic noise outside Napping in the daytime, which made sleeping harder Drinking and partying, so sleep was more fragmented An argument with their partner Their kids struggled to sleep - so kept them up Jetlag after ing from a holiday Their own snoring A baby crying Allergies making your nose run Partner is a duvet hog A squeaky bedMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Denise Van Outen\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Therese Coffey jumped up and down and danced with abandon at a Tory conference karaoke party last night. The Work and Pensions Secretary sang the uplting  power ballad, made famous in the film Dirty Dancing, with fellow Tory minister Will Quince.Today she will oversee the end of the £-a-week Universal Credit uplt, the biggest overnight welfare cut since the Second World War. The -month-long Covid benefit will be removed from payments arriving between October  and November , plunging hundreds of thousands into poverty and affecting more than million children.  Mr Quince was until recently the minister responsible for Universal Credit and is now the Minister for Children and Families at the Department for Education. We asked Ms Coffey this morningshe regretted her choice of karaoke but she refused to comment. We asked the welfare chiefshe thought it was fair that she appeared to be having the time of her le while families braced for sleepless nights, worriedthey will be able to feed their children. She declined to comment. Askedshe had anything to tell claimants who have been left in impossible situations, she still declined to comment. Landlords, mortgage lenders, debt charities, homelessness groups and Save The Children are among those opposing the benefit cut. Six former Tory Work and Pensions Secretaries have also hit out at the move, while Tory MP Nigel Mills yesterday warned: “We may end up going so far that we look cruel and harsh, leaving people in an impossible situation.”  But the Prime Minister has refused to U-turn - instead unveiling a £million hardship fund that is a tenth of the amount being cut.Cruel Mr Johnson claims “there is no alternative” other than waiting for the free market to produce higher wages - despite families facing a winter of discontent with soaring inflation and higher energy bills.The RSA think tank today warns the cut will hit “levelling-up” areas in the north and Midlands hardest.  Priority levelling-up fund areas have % more claimants than lower-priority ones, with % of those in priority areas claiming the benefit. Hannah Webster, joint head of people and place at the RSA, said: “It still isn’t too late to change course. By reconsidering the imminent cut to Universal Credit, the government will help ensure everyone has access to a system of support that allows them to meet their needs.” Labour will today unveil an ad van outside the Manchester conference demanding Boris Johnson “cancel the cut”, styled in Tory blue. Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said: “The Secretary of State singing that she is having the ‘time of her le’ while making families £, a year worse off today is frankly an insult and a disgrace. “It is not too late for the Government to reverse this disastrous decision, support struggling families and cancel this cut.”The Work and Pensions Secretary is understood to be lobbying for a cut to the ‘taper rate’ of Universal Credit in this month’s Budget.That would allow up to .million working claimants to keep p of every £ they earn from wages, rather than p as is the case now. But such a change in the taper rate would not make up for the £ cut for the vast majority of claimants. Ms Coffey is a regular on the conference karaoke scene and once sang aposDonapost Stop Me Nowapos with Matt Hancock.

Itaposs not just about the karaoke... itaposs not just about the drinks that are there. What I love is that we genuinely get to see each other and wow, what a dference it makes to be here in person. She added: We are genuinely here to govern the country to make le changes for people in this country.Other Tories were spotted dancing last night too, with Michael Gove boogieing to ‘I wanna Dance with Somebody’.And Liz Truss was seen dancing to ‘Simply The Best’ at a gay club on the city’s Canal Street.

Lexi Robins was born with Fibrodysplasia Ossicans Progressiva- a disease that slowly replaces the connective tissues, tendons, ligaments and muscles into extraskeletal bone.The baby will eventually become paralysed. It is thought that only about  people have been diagnosed with FOP in the UK, with  sufferers worldwide. Parents Alex, , and Dave, , have revealed their petition with FOP Friends charity - surpassed the , signatures mark and will now be debated in parliament.  The couple, of Hemel Hempstead, Herts, is hoping to get crucial research carried out by the NHS. Alex said: It would be absolutely incrediblewe could get the funding, it would be le-changing for everyone with FOP. Lexi is very small and the condition develops throughout her body, so our race is to get this all moving and get a cure before it develops because at the moment she is completely able-bodied.  Alex, who is also mum to Lexiaposs older brother, added: Weaposve been fundraising, we have raised £, and it costs £, to keep the lab open for a year. Itaposs all going into an FOP lab in Oxford. All the parents have to try and fundraise and pay for that. There is nothing unfortunately that the NHS contributes so weaposve raised a petition to get it into the Houses of Parliament and get this changed and get funding through the NHS. We want to have resources put into this rare disease, and experts - because we donapost really have anything at the moment. The familyaposs petition has been backed by their local MP, Mike Penning. Conservative Mr Penning said: My constituency, Iaposm very proud to say, has the largest number of signatures to the petition in the country, which is great news. There will now be a debate in Westminster Hall in the House of Commons on the subject of funding research into this, which I think is fantastic news.  He added: This disease is le-changing for the parents as well as for the children. Andwe can get the research out there into finding out whataposs causing it,we can just find out what the cause was triggering this will be great news. Iaposm really proud of Alex and Dave - to pick this up and they run and they run and run and run with it because of their love of their children and other peopleaposs children. Christopher Bedford-Gay, who founded FOP charity FOP friends, said: Awareness of FOP is critical, and with over , signatures, one cannot argue that, eventhe government chose not to fund FOP research, that awareness has been massively raised through Alex and Dave, and the FOP communitiesapos efforts. We can dream big, butthis effort leads to just one more early diagnosis, it will have been worth it!

Sushi branch in west LondonLucy Edwards, , had been out at a London Fashion Week event with her fiancé when the two decided to eat out at Yo! Sushi Image: Lucy EdwardsByElla DoyleMichael Moran:,  Oct Updated:,  Oct | commentsA blind woman has told how she was left ‘shaking’ after a staff member allegedly threw her out because she had her guide dog with her. Lucy Edwards, , had been out at a London Fashion Week event with her fiancé on Monday, September  when the pair decided to eat out at Yo! Sushi’s Woodstock Street branch, west London.The -year-old told MyLondon : “I know this sounds really sad in some ways, but my fiancé is completely sighted and we often have discussions together on what chains we like to eat in, becauseIaposve got my guide dog with me, I do always get anxious.” Lucy has faced discrimination before for her disability, and raises awareness about being disability issues on TikTok and Instagram.She said: “When we first walked in, it seemed to be all fine. Ollie thought, ‘I think we’re going to be okay here’.”  The waiter showed the couple to a table with tall bar stools. Lucy explained that the stools would be challenging for her and her guide dog, who she has only been working with for around a month. But as the pair requested to be moved to a lower table, Lucy said the waiter noticed her guide dog, and immediately “switched”. “He was like, ‘Nope, dogs aren’t allowed’,” she said. Far from being the first incident of its kind for Lucy, she said she gave the waiter the aposbenefit of the doubtapos. She recalled thinking: “He might not know what the jacket symbolises, right ” Guide dogs wear special harnesses for mobility assistance, which distinguishes them from pet dogs.  Lucy explained calmly to the staff member that the reflective strips on her dog’s jacket show she is a guide dog. “She’s my eyes, you know, I have to take her everywhere with me in order to get about, she said. “And he said, ‘No, no, no’. I don’t care what dog that is. You can’t come in.” Lucy then began to film the incident on her phone. She shared the video, entitled ‘Ableism in Action’, to her TikTok page, where she has . million followers. Denying someone entry for using a guide dog is illegal in the UK. Lucy said she then asked to speak to the manager, and requested an apology from them before leaving the restaurant. She said: “I was still firm, but not shouting. But I was shaking. You know, I haven’t really stood up to anyone like that before. But I feel like me and Ollie, because we’ve been together for eight years, we had a kind of out of body experience. “I had him, and I had the security of him, to be able to speak my voice because I thinkI was alone, I wouldn’t have done it.” Lucy continued: “I owe it to people who have maybe just got a guide dog for the first time and are worried about going out. How must they feel ”.  She explained that in the past, events like this have made her feel “sick to her stomach”. “I’d cry. I’d go home. And I wouldn’t go out for another month,” she said. “This is what this does to people. This discrimination - not just the disabled community - but we need to think about other marginalised groups here. “This is basically saying because of who I am, I can’t access something. And that is really serious. “I don’t think people still know it goes on.” A Yo! spokesperson said: “We are disappointed and sorry about the experience that Lucy Edwards had at our Bond Street restaurant. One of our colleagues made a mistake, and of course guide dogs are welcome in all of our restaurants. “Creating an inclusive environment for all of our customers and team is important to us and this incident does not reflect our values. “We are undertaking a thorough review to ensure that YO!’s values are reflected in all interactions and practices across our business, so none of our guests are made to feel this way in future. “We have contacted Lucy directly to apologise for her experience and invite her contribution into building awareness and shaping our ongoing training processes.” Comment MORE ON Guide dogsLondon Fashion WeekYo!

It comes as food experts told shoppers they should buy Christmas dinner in advance and store it in the freezerthey want to avoid going without. As families scramble to avoid missing out on their favourite Christmas food, budget retailer Aldi is reportedly selling , frozen crowns a day while pudding sales are up  per cent. Families are said to be hoarding as much as £, worth of food for the festive season as a supply chain crisis continues.News of the early festive spending at Aldi comes hot on the heels of reports that sales of frozen turkeys from supermarket chain Iceland have surged  per cent, compared to the same time last year.  Chief Executive of the British Frozen Food Federation Richard Harrow said some customers have been “permanently converted” to buying frozen, reports Mail Online. He said: “This combined with current concerns about food supply means many people will be opting for frozen food this Christmas. A shortage of butchers, in particular, could impact food supplies over Christmas for millions, it is feared. Farmers have said they are being forced to shoot pigs and dump their bodies because there is a shortage of butchers to slaughter and carve them. Some , animals are reportedly under threat of being culled in the next week.  The meat crisis is building upon issues caused by a lack of HGV drivers, which has also led to a shortage of fuel at petrol stations and labour shortfalls that could result in a lack of choice come the festive season. Some Christmas gts and foods are expected to be scarce or off the shelves completely. The Government last week announced that more than , foreign workers will be temporarily permitted to work as lorry drivers and in the food sector as ministers look to tackle the worsening issues. A temporary visa scheme will see opportunities created for , HGV drivers and , poultry workers to take up employment in the UK until Christmas Eve. The move has been taken in a bid to keep supermarket shelves stocked with turkeys and toys as well as counter delivery dficulties at petrol stations. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the changes, with the visas available from this month, would ensure preparations remain on track for the festive season. Meanwhile military HGV test examiners are being drafted in to get , British truckers onto UK roads. The plan is to have more recruits trained to drive lorries over the next  weeks in time for Christmas to plug the HGV driver shortage which has left supermarket shelves bare.

After three car parks at the Trafford Centre in Greater Manchester closed due to the Summer Social event and for the use of motoring giant Tesla, customers were forced to find alternative spaces to leave their cars while shopping.The fight for a parking spot has led many shoppers to park on pavements, double lines, and inside disabled bays without permits, the Manchester Evening News reports.As a result of this, the shopping centre deployed parking wardens who have been handing out fines. Some customers took to social media to vent their frustration, while others complained to the shopping centre about the situation. One person tweeted: Been to the Trafford Centre to drop daughter off, f*****g nightmare parking, one car park closed for a funfair one closed for a f*****g tesla exhibition. Another added: Why is the Trafford Centre so rammed today  Not usually this busy. Need to move the stupid fair and #tesla area which are taking up loads of parking spaces. The Trafford Centre has now warned shoppers to park in the designated bays to avoid a penalty charge.

Affordable kids clothes  Itaposs not just Kate who sometimes dresses in High Street clothes - her children do too.In , she was spotted perusing the kidsapos clothes in the former Gap store near Kensington Palace, where she is said to have picked out some items for a then baby Prince George.Meanwhile last year, in their Christmas card portrait, George sported a brown Regatta fleece top that was said to have cost just £.Similarly, in April, Prince Louis wore a pair of £ Adidas trainers in his third birthday portrait while Princess Charlotte wore a £ Zara dress in pictures released to mark her fth birthday.Recycling clothes  Itaposs all well and good shopping on the High Street - butyou buy a new outfit every time you leave the house, the cost will soon rack up. But with Kate, there have been countless examples of where she has worn her clothes, time and time again. Even the dress she wore yesterday got an outing on a previous engagement. And one item in her wardrobe that sheaposs been pictured wearing over and over again is her Penelope Chilvers tassel boots.She was first spotted wearing them  years ago in  and she most recently wore them on a trip to a farm in County Durham earlier this year.But itaposs not just her own clothes that she recycles, her kids have also been seen wearing hand-me-downs. In , Princess Charlotte was pictured cradling her then newborn brother Prince Louis wearing a cardigan older brother Prince George had worn in the Queenaposs th birthday portrait. Meanwhile, at Trooping the Colour in , Prince George wore the same outfit his dad Prince William donned at the same event in . Shopping at The Range  Kate probably has access to the worldaposs most high-end stores to do her Christmas shopping.But just days before Christmas in , she was spotted browsing the aisles of discount store The Range in King’s Lynn close to the Queenaposs Sandringham Estate in Norfolk.Teacher Sarah Daniels told how she spotted Kate with George and Charlotte in the arts and craft aisle before they moved on to the toy section, where George apparently showed interest in ‘dinosaur slime’. Mrs Daniels told the Daily Mail that at one point Charlotte sat on the floor and was told by her mother, dressed casually in jeans, low-heeled boots and a jacket: Get up, poppet. And when George asked about the slime, she claims she didn’t register a response from the prince’s mother. Maybe slime wasnapost within their budget  Ikea furniture We are often told that having a stylish home doesnapost mean having to spend a tonne of money. And it seems this rings true with Kate.In , Kate and William revealed that they had some Ikea furniture in their home during a visit to Swedenaposs national museum of architecture and design in Stockholm in .Marcus Engman, the companyaposs head of design, said they told him that they had Ikea furniture for Prince George and Princess Charlotte. Iaposm proud that we can suit everybody, he said. Thataposs what we want Ikea to be - for the many people of the world, both royalty and ordinary people. Taking her own photos Drafting in a professional photographer every time there is a family event would be a costly business. Luckily for Kate, she is a dab hand with the camera and usually takes gorgeous pictures of her children and the rest of her family herself. Over the years, sheaposs taken some beautul portraits of George, Charlotte and Louis on their birthdays, which have delighted royal fans. Flying on budget airlines You would think that every time they travel, the royals would do it in the lap of luxury.But in , Kate along with William, George, Charlotte and Louis were seen boarding a low-cost flight on a budget airline. The family caught the Flybe economy flight from Norwich to Aberdeen, with their tickets thought to cost around £. Video from the day showed George and Charlotte walking onto the tarmac with their dad, who was holding a number of bags, while Kate carried a baby Louis slightly behind. A fellow passenger told the Mail: The family were sat right at the front. I fly this route all the time and we were none the wiser.Sharing takeaways No trip to the seaside is complete without treating yourself to some fish and chips. And thataposs exactly what Kate did earlier this year, on a visit to the Scottish town of Anstruther.Kate, as well as William, popped into the Anstruther Fish Bar but they ordered just one £. takeaway haddock supper rather than getting one each.The takeaway was wrapped in paper, which they shared and ate on a bench on the pier.

Crowds came together in Eastbourne, East Sussex - where the man charged with her murder lived - to honour the -year-old. The crowd held pictures of Sabina and placards with messages such as “she was just walking home” and “stop killing us”. Speaker Natasha Peacock, one of the organisers of the event, told the crowd: “Women are fighting for their lives and considering the risk of going out at night and potentially being attacked, raped and murdered. “This is a crisis, how many more of us need to die before this is taken seriously ” Sabina was killed as she walked to a pub near her home in Kidbrooke, south east London, on September . She was walking through a park two minutes from her home when she was allegedly attacked. Koci Selamaj, , has been charged with her murder. Sabina’s death came six months after the murder of Sarah Everard at the hands of Met Police officer Wayne Couzens.  Selamaj appeared at Willesden magistratesapos court for a two-minute hearing on Tuesday, as the Mirror tracked down where he spent some of his childhood in Albania. He was wearing a grey sweater and grey jogging bottoms. Selamaj, of Eastbourne, East Sussex, was asked to confirm his name, address and date of birth by the legal advisor. He then indicated a not guilty plea for one count of murder through his representative, Aidan Harvey.  District judge Denis Brennan remanded Selamaj in custody to appear at the Old Bailey on Thursday. Ms Nessa, , was found just a few minutesapos walk from her home on September . Her body was discovered by a dog walker under a pile of leaves in Cator Park, Kidbrooke, south-east London. She has been making her way to the Depot bar the evening before to meet a friend, it is thought - but never arrived.  A manhunt then followed, before detectives arrested Selamaj at an address in Eastbourne at am on Sunday. Two other men, aged  and , who were arrested by police investigating the death of Ms Nessa have been released under investigation. In Selamajaposs home country of Albania the Mirror visited the home where he spent some of his childhood. The defendant was born in the town of Elbasan, an hour’s drive from the capital of Tirana. Neighbours said he is one of four children, two boys and two girls, and that he spent a short amount of time living in the flat with his parents before moving abroad. “We had no problems with him - from any of the children,” one told the Mirror. “They were all normal.”  Selamajaposs dad Bashkim, , is a retired builder and his mum Tefta, , was a communist-era farmer, neighbours said. Bashkim and Tefta are living in Tirana but still own the flat in Elbasan. Ms Nessaaposs death has prompted an outpouring of grief and anger. Her family spoke about their loss at a vigil on Friday evening held in the park where her body was found. Jebina Yasmin Islam, Ms Nessaaposs sister, broke down as she addressed a crowds of hundreds at the candlelit ceremony. She said: “I just want to say thank you to everyone who came today to show support for my sister. “We have lost an amazing, caring, beautul sister, who left this world far too early. She added: “Sabina loved her family.  Words cannot describe how we are feeling, this feels like we are stuck in a bad dream and can’t get out of it - our world is shattered, we are simply lost for words. The Duchess of Cambridge has also commented on the tragedy. She said online: I am saddened by the loss of another innocent young woman on our streets. My thoughts are with Sabina’s family and friends, and all those who have been affected by this tragic event.

With last winter disrupted by lockdown, and young people missing so much school, college, time with friends and seeing grandparents, getting the vaccine will help make sure this year is a whole lot better. Not only does the vaccine protect young people against serious illness – almost  per cent of Covid patients admitted to hospital are unvaccinated – it also means they’re less likely to spread the virus to elderly family members. No more FOMO We’ve come a long way with the vaccination programme since those dark days of last winter. The Covid- vaccine has already saved more than , lives and prevented  million infections.Jabs are now being rolled out for the - age group, and more than  per cent of --year-olds have already had theirs. And getting the jab couldn’t be easier: schools and colleges are offering it through their immunisation programmes, while older teenagers can make an appointment through the online booking service at nhs.uk covidvaccination.If you’re a parent orof a --year-old, schools will ask for your consent before they receive the vaccine, and you can help --year-olds book their dose online. Then it’s one less thing for you to worry about – and they won’t need to worry about missing out on all those good times with family and friends.Fashion and lestyle influencer Arabella Daho , , is keen to book her vaccine appointment. “I think the vaccine is a great thing for everyone to have – it’s helping to keep us safe, she says. We have loads of events coming up such as Halloween and Christmas, and we don’t want to miss them. “On my digital s I’ve interviewed a few of the doctors who worked on the vaccine, talking about how safe it is, and why it’s important for everyone to get it. It was good to talk to them – I learned a lot, soanyone wants to see those videos or do research to help them feel better about getting the vaccine, I think they should. “Young people think they’re immune to everything, but we can actually be spreading Covid, especially to older people, who are more vulnerable. So getting jabbed helps communities and families get back to normal.” ‘All my kids have had their vaccines’ We asked GP and mum-of-three Dr Dawn Harper about what the vaccine means for young people… How do you feel about your kids being offered the vaccine  All my kids are in their s and they’ve all had their vaccines. I was very keen for them to get vaccinated as soon as they were eligible. If I had a -to--year-old I’d be putting them forward for the vaccine. We’ve been able to draw on global data several countries have already been offering the vaccine to --year-olds, and we have a lot of evidence to show that it’s safe for that age group. And while young people are less likely to become seriously ill with Covid, I am in total agreement with the chief medical officers concerning the impact on their mental health and their education, and also the possibility of long Covid. And, of course, we are only enjoying the relative freedoms we have today in the UK because of the vaccine programme. Without it, we’d still be in a lockdown. We need the vaccine to protect ourselves from Covid and long Covid, and also to protect our loved ones and our community. So I’m very keen for young people to come forward and have the vaccine. Did you have to persuade your children to have the jab  They were up for it. For me, lockdown was easier: I’m  and don’t mind walking my dog on my own, but I think young people really struggled missing out on their social lives.  What are the side effects of the vaccine in young people  The main one is perhaps a bit of soreness in the arm. I had a sore arm after my first vaccine but nothing at all after my second. It’s incredibly safe. I’m still amazed at how the researchers worked to get this to market as quickly as they did, running trials simultaneously without cutting safety corners. Long Covid is a worry for many parents. Will the vaccine protect young people against it  I have patients with long Covid. It is a horrible condition and there is evidence that the vaccine protects against this. We’re still on a very steep learning curve with long Covid. It’s unpredictable. We have fit young people who have been knocked sideways by it. The things that people talk to me about is the fatigue, the brain fog – I’ve got patients who are very intelligent academics who just can’tat work. Is the vaccine suitable for vegans and people with food allergies  It’s totally vegan-friendly and not a problem for those with allergies. What about those who are scared of needles  For the -to- age group, school nurses are well experienced in managing this. If you’re nervous you can ask to lie down. You can also buy over-the-counter cream to rub into your arm  minutes beforehand. I don’t even think I felt my second vaccine going in it’s such a tiny needle. For a moment of a sharp scratch, to know that you’re protected against Covid it’s well worth the trade-off. Has the vaccine been rigorously tested on the younger age group  Yes, I feel very confident about the science behind it. There’s been a lot of debate on risk vs benefit in dferent age groups. Young people are less likely to get seriously ill, but we need to weigh that against missed education, protection from long Covid and letting kids get out and about again so that we can help them with any mental health issues. If you come from a middle-class background where you’ve all got your own computers, home schooling was much easier thanyou’re all trying to share one screen, so it’s really important that we try to even out those dferences and get people back into the classroom.Last winter’s lockdown was so tough on young people’s mental health. Does the vaccine mean that things will be better this year  That wouldbe my hope. We’ll see messages coming out about meeting outside and ventilation I still wear a mask in the supermarket we have hand sanitiser in our bags and our cars, and I think that makes sense. But expanding the vaccine programme to include these younger people will mean that hopefully they can start to get back to some kind of normality. AGED  OR  If you have a teenager who hasn’t booked their vaccine yet, you can give them a helping hand so that they don’t get left behind – and protect the rest of the family from serious illness. Jabs can now be booked online at nhs.uk covidvaccination, or you can ask your GP or go to your nearest walk-in centre. PARENT OR CARER OF A --YEAR-OLD Offering young people the vaccine is essential to prevent them missing school and help make sure they can carry on doing the things they love with their friends and family. Everyone in this age group will be offered a first dose of the Pfizer vaccine through their school’s immunisation programme, which already administers the HPV and MMR vaccines. Parents and s will be asked for their consent via a form – andyou have any questions you can discuss them with the School Age Immunisation Service."},{"url":null,"title":"man keeps getting mistaken hipster","story":":root Man shaves off hair but leaves ring around head - and gets mistaken for hipsterStu Turner, from Cardf, buzzed everything but a narrow strip of hair off to support the Little Princess Trust, a charity that provides real hair wigs, free of charge, to children and young people who have lost their own hair from cancer treatment or other conditionsStu is sporting this haircut as he is raising money for charity Image: MEDIA WALESByJohn JonesAlahna KindredNews Reporter:,  Oct Updated:,  Oct | commentsA man is being called ring head after shaving his scalp for a heartwarming reason. Stu Turner, from Cardf, shaved off most of his hair this month. The -year-old buzzed everything but a narrow strip of hair off - after he spent months growing a beard and long hair in lockdown.The civil servant told WalesOnline : Itaposs certainly been an adjustment. Itaposs definitely a bit colder than Iaposve been used to - I can feel a draught a lot more easily than I could before.At the beginning of the first lockdown I said I wasnapost going to cut my hair and beard until we were back working in the office, but what I expected to be three months turned out to be  months - so I had a lot of hair to lose. Got a story  Email webnews@mirror  Having had a beard on my face for most of my le, I can tell you that nothing really prepares you for the feeling of your own breath on your chin. Stu braved this look for charity. The Welshman is supporting the Little Princess Trust, a charity that provides real hair wigs, free of charge, to children and young people who have lost their own hair from cancer treatment or other conditions. Not only has Stu donated his hair to the charity, but he has also raised more than £, for both the trust and Cancer Research UK from his haircut.  Stu said: I went out in town the other day, and my hair went down really well. I started getting quite a lot of respect from people, which wasnapost really expected. The strangest thing was that some people didnapost assume it was a charity thing or a bet that Iaposd lost, a lot of people thought that I had some sort of new, trendy Generation Z style haircut!  When Iaposm walking around, Iaposm still quite thankful for my face mask as Iaposm not quite ready to subject myself to the comments Iaposd get from some people. But when you do something like this, youaposve got to accept that people will stare, thataposs all part of making a fool of yourself for a good cause. I think the people who were most annoyed about the positive reception I got were my friends - theyaposre the ones who set out to try - and succeed - at making me look foolish. Part of Stuaposs fundraising gave donors the chance to comment on the hair and beard style that they wanted to see him adopt alongside their donation - with the style with the most money behind it being crowned the winner. for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information atwww.mirror email.His friends and family threw in plenty of left-field suggestions, including a aposFriar Tuckapos, a mohawk and handlebar moustache, a buzz top, pineapple and a aposhair islandapos, made famous by football manager Steve McClaren. However, in the end, there could only be one winner and the aposcircle hairapos style took victory with £. pledged in its name - more than £ more than its nearest competition. He has smashed his goal and raised more than £,. Stu added: Iaposm astounded at how much Iaposve raised already. I never had a target, it was always just seeing how much I could I get - butit was to go even higher, that would be fantastic. The Little Princess Trust and Cancer Research are both fantastic causes - Iaposve raised money for them a couple of times before and they do amazing work.

One of the initiatives already underway is the creation of the first McDonald’s restaurant to be built to UK industry net zero emissions standards, Devon Live reports.The restaurant is being built in Shropshire, and when it opens next month, it will be a first for the UK industry and will act as a blueprint for future new builds. McDonald’s UKI is also planning to ensure customer packaging is made from renewable, recycled, or certied sources, and will be recyclable or compostable by .

Other additions in the Plan for Change include hiring a Nutrition Innovation Council who will work on developing more balanced menu options. The franchise recently launched the % vegan McPlant burger, and has plans to offer customers more vegan plant-based food and drink in the future. Paul Pomroy, Chief Executive of McDonald’s UK  Ireland, said: “McDonald’s has a long history of taking action where it really matters to the communities we serve. But we are at a moment now where we need to accelerate our ambition and work even harder to look after each other and the planet. “This new Plan for Change is not just our sustainability strategy, it’s our business priority. That means it isn’t a plan for one change, but for many – changes that together, with , restaurants, over , people, , British and Irish farmers and  million customers visiting every day, really will add up.” McDonald’s UKI has been attempting to reduce its impact on the planet for the last two decades, and the new Plan for Change hopes to build on the foundation the company has already made. The franchise has also been sourcing responsibly for over  years, with its menu already including % British and Irish beef, free range eggs, organic milk, RSPCA-assured pork, MSC-certied fish and Rainforest Alliance certied coffee. UK Net Zero Business Champion, Andrew Grfith, said: “Having an iconic brand like McDonald’s join the hundreds of businesses across the UK that have signed up to the UN’s Race to Net Zero campaign is an exciting milestone. “I hope businesses across the UK will be inspired by their ambitious initiatives, helping us all to build back greener.”To find out more on Plan for Change, click here.

Two hours later, his mum found him unresponsive and with a blue mouth. He died in hospital a short time laterBeni Lupu was found unresponsive in bedImage: Getty ImagesBySophie Halle-Richards:,  Oct Updated:,  Oct A mum found her baby boy unresponsive and with a blue mouth on the bed where he was sleeping, an inquest heard. Beni Lupu fell asleep on his mumaposs bed in Glodwick, Oldham, Greater Manchester, on June  last year. His mum Marianne Lupu left the bedroom and went downstairs with one of her other children and when she ed two hours later, she found the five-month-old boy unresponsive.An inquest hearing at Rochdale Coroneraposs Court heard paramedics were called to the property and the baby was transferred to Royal Oldham Hospital, the Manchester Evening News reports.Despite efforts by medical staff to try and resuscitate him, Beni was pronounced dead a short time later. The court heard that prior to his death, Beni had been a happy and healthy baby and had attended regular medical check-up appointments with his dad, Jheorghe Lupu.  Mr Lupu arrived in Oldham from Romania for work in  and a few months later his we and young family came to join him. The hearing was told that Beniaposs parents had recently been referred to the help of local social services after one of his elder siblings was seriously injured having fallen down the stairs. The court heard that Beni had been sharing a double bed with his mum and sibling in the evening prior to his death. Mr Lupu had been asleep on the floor with the coupleaposs other two children, having finished a night sht. Beni woke up at around am and then again at am for a feed, before being placed on his back and being given a pillow, the court heard. Detective Inspector Kenny Blain said the house was in a poor state when officers from Greater Manchester Police visited it following Beniaposs death. He told the inquest: The property was cockroach infested and there were rodent pellets on the floor.  The inquest heard Mr Lupu had reported the issue to his landlord, but it was still unresolved at the time of Beniaposs death. DI Blain said he believed the sleeping arrangements were unsuitable and unnecessary as he noted there was another bedroom with a spare double bed available. He said: One of the bedrooms had a mosses basket which was covered in miscellaneous items. The bed that Beni was sleeping on was full of fleeces and blankets. There was a cot which was reportedly broken but it appeared to be al. The property was extremely warm and the radiators were turned up high. There were cigarette butts in the toilet and the back bedroom. There was no evidence of smoking in the main bedroom. DI Blain added that although the sleeping arrangements were not suitable for four young children, there were no signs that Beni had been physically neglected.  No criminal charges were brought against Beniaposs parents and the family is understood to have ed to Romania. Paediatric Pathologist, Dr Gemma Petts, told the court that despite extensive tests, she was unable to ascertain the cause of Beniaposs sudden death. Dr Petts said that on examination, Beni had no external injuries and toxicology results showed no drugs or alcohol in his system at the time of his death. The tot had a number of viral infections at the time, but none of these were deemed to have contributed to his death, Dr Petts said. She told the court that Beniaposs death could be attributed to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome , but added that she could not be sure what caused him to pass away. Dr Petts said: Unsafe sleeping is very often seen in children who die suddenly. At  weeks, he would have been at risk of getting in a position where he couldnapost get himself out. Another risk factor is a household where smoking occurs. A statement read to the court from Dr Simon Walton, a GP at Glodwick Primary Care Centre, outlined Beniaposs short medical history. He was seen in the first few months of his le after displaying symptoms of jitteriness and head lag and was said to have low vitamin D and calcium levels. The inquest was told that on March , , Beni underwent a child protection assessment at Royal Oldham Hospital at the request of social services. His parents had been referred to local services after one of their other children was admitted to intensive care, having fallen down the stairs at home. A number of unexplained injuries were noted which were not consistent with a fall, the court heard. Following the assessment in March, Beni was allowed to go home with his parents, with no follow-up appointment deemed necessary.

Sarah Bernasconi-Parsons raises funds to buy ‘cuddle cots’ allowing parents to spend time with their unborn children. Her campaign was inspired by the death of her own daughter, Maggie Pearl Parsons, who was still-born in .This week Sarah was overjoyed to learn she has won a Pride of Britain award.But she also revealed that earlier this year her daughter’s grave was destroyed by Mark Plaister, a man she knew, in a series of six cruel attacks. Sarah, , and her partner, Mark, , were left devastated by the damage, which Plaister had himself reported to them, masquerading as a concerned friend.  When the attacks continued, the couple set up their own covert camera, which eventually caught Plaister in the act. The couple then performed their own citizens’ arrest at the cemetery before police arrived. Plaister’s actions were described in court as ‘beyond wicked’ and aposone of the most despicable offencesapos the prosecutor had ever seen. Since the loss of her daughter, Sarah has dedicated her le to fundraising for cuddle cots and memory boxes for bereaved families.  She was instrumental in the creation of the secret garden, at the cemetery, where her daughter’s remains are buried. Sarah, from Blackburn, Lancashire, says: “I knew Mark Plaister from the cemetery, as he also is a bereaved parent. “When he messaged me to say Maggie’s grave had been trashed, we rushed down to the cemetery and he met us there. He watched as I sobbed my heart out. My husband actually shook his hand, because we thought he was helping us.  “Little did we know that he was behind the whole thing. When we saw him on the CCTV, we were shocked beyond belief. We caught him at the cemetery and my husband arrested him and kept him there until the police arrived. “I’m happy he has been dealt with in court, but I would like to know why he did it. As a mother, I need to be able to protect my daughter, and look after her, even though she is no longer with us. “I felt so helpless whilst her grave was under attack and I can never forgive him for that.”  Maggie was still-born at full term of Sarah’s first pregnancy, in June . Her death left her parents devastated. Sarah says: “The doctors later found out that I had a blood disorder which had caused my body to swell up, and the midwe couldn’t find a heartbeat.“I contracted sepsis during labour and had to have an emergency section. Afterwards, we were able to spend three days with Maggie in a cuddle cot, bathing and dressing her, and loving her.“We held a naming ceremony in the hospital chapel and all our family and friends came. It was a very proud day, despite the tragedy.” After Maggie’s funeral, her ashes were buried in Pleasington Cemetery, Lancashire. Sarah launched: ‘Maggie’s Stillbirth Legacy’ and began fundraising for support for other bereaved families.  In Maggie’s memory, the Secret Garden was opened at the cemetery, as a quiet place where all grieving parents could go. Sarah says: “Over the years, the fundraising has become my entire le. It keeps Maggie’s memory alive and it gives me focus. We buy cuddle cots and memory boxes. “I knew Mark Plaister from the cemetery because he was a bereaved parent too but I had never really spoken much to him.” In May , Plaister messaged Sarah to say that Maggie’s grave had been targeted. She says: “We rushed to the cemetery and he was waiting there. I was so upset because all her ornaments had been trashed. Mark’s mum, Julie, who had since died, had bought her a pink castle. My mum, Sheila, had bought angels and butterflies. They had all been smashed. “Plaister stood and watched us, and my husband actually shook his hand and thanked him, for alerting us.” Over the following month, Maggie’s grave was attacked a further five times. Sarah says: “It was very traumatic. It felt as though we were losing her all over again. We weren’t sleeping or eating. We felt as though we couldn’t protect our little girl, and that was heart-breaking. “The staff at the cemetery and the police were very supportive, helping us to clear up the mess and to look for the broken ornaments. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter “The police sent a van down, with cameras, to keep an eye on the cemetery, and Plaister messaged me asking what the police were doing and how long they were staying. He seemed very interested and my husband said to me: ‘It’s him.’ “We actually argued over it because I couldn’t believe that another parent would do that to us – he had tried to help us, and I couldn’t accept that he could be so duplicitous.” In desperation, the couple rigged up their own CCTV camera, hidden in a bunch of flowers. It captured Plaister trashing their daughter’s grave. Sarah says: “I was absolutely stunned. It just didn’t make sense.” The following morning, having reported Plaister to the police, the couple went to check their daughter’s grave. When they arrived, they caught Plaister in the act. Sarah says: “I began screaming and my husband ran over and detained him and kept him there until the police came. He admitted to all six acts of vandalism, there and then. “I asked him: ‘Why did you do it  Why us ’ and he replied: ‘Only six times.’ I was sickened. “I will never know why he did it, perhaps he will never know himself. But he’s a danger to society and I pleased that he is not allowed anywhere near my daughter’s grave in the future.” Mark Plaister appeared before Burnley Magistrates in January this year. Describing Plaister as aposbeyond wickedapos, prosecutor Carl Gaffney said the defendant had subjected his victims to aposmental tortureapos and had still to this day failed to provide an explanation as to why he committed the crimes.  Plaister, , pleaded guilty to six counts of criminal damage between May and June . Mr Gaffney added: This is one of the most despicable offences that I have ever seen and I have been practicing for more than  years, and in that time I have prosecuted murder cases that have had less of an emotional impact. To do what he did and then to do it again, and again and again, and then to mentally torture these people by trying to befriend them is beyond wicked. This is as serious a criminal damage offence as I have ever seen, and I do not apologise for saying these things. Sarah and her family doubled down on their grief, and channelled it into something good, to support people like herself, like him. She has even said that he must be going through his own grief, but that does not excuse what he has done. In sentencing, District Judge Hogarth said: This is an exceptional case, and I note that you have suffered two traumatic incidents yourself and have two children, one who has complex needs. I cannot impose a punishment that will be commensurate with the affect this has had on your victim. You say you donapost know why youaposve committed these offences so it is not alright for us to move forward without allowing you to examine your behaviour and why you did it, and that is why I impose the sentence I am imposing. Plaister, who has four convictions for  previous offences of a similar nature, was given a six month prison sentence suspended for  months. He was ordered to carry out  days rehabilitation work, was placed on an electronic curfew for eight weeks, was made subject to a restraining order preventing him from going near the grave of Maggie Bernasconi-Parsons until further notice, and was ordered to pay £ in compensation, which Mrs Bernasconi-Parsons said she would donate to charity. Earlier this month, Sarah was delighted to discover she has won a Pride of Britain award for her work with ‘Maggie’s Stillbirth Legacy’. She says: “I am in shock, I didn’t expect to win at all. This is not my award, it belongs to Maggie, for inspiring me.”To visit Maggieaposs Stillbirth Legacy fundraising page on Facebook click here.Comment MORE ON Crime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It typically develops within a week to four weeks of being infected and can result in toes and fingers becoming swollen or changing colour. Senior author of the study, Dr Charles Cassius, said the research provided a deeper understanding of the condition. The epidemiology and clinical features of chilblain-like lesions have been extensively studied and published, however, little is known about the pathophysiology involved, he said.  Our study provides new insights. Researchers behind the study, which has now been published in the British Journal of Dermatology, examined  participants with Covid toes and  with similar chilblains lesions that arose before the pandemic. They found one mechanism behind both types of the condition involved the body generating an immune response with high levels of certain autoantibodies.  They mistakenly target and react with a personaposs own cells and tissues as well as the invading virus. They also found an overlap with type I interferon, a key protein in the antiviral response. In addition to the immune system, cells lining blood vessels which supply the affected areas also appeared to play a critical role in the development of Covid toes and chilblains. Medics have previously warned those who have had both Covid vaccine jabs that there are  symptoms they must still watch out for.Experts are telling people it is crucial to stay vigilant and be aware of the signs they could still have Covid- - evenyou have had both doses. The symptoms include a high temperature, persistent cough, loss or change of taste smell, muscle pains and red and sore fingers or toes.

But he claimed the cabin was aposfalling to piecesapos - and says he wonapost be back. BA couldnapost have picked a worse day to let standards slips - Jarvis runs a luxury travel review website and travel agency and flies frequently reviewing airlines and hotels. The man was travelling with girlfriend, Kamara Harding, , but endured a catalogue of issues including aposdirty, scuffed seatsapos and water dripping from the roof.He says the conditions made him uneasy as the Covid- pandemic rages.Despite Jarvis claiming the -hour round-trip would have cost £, without his air miles, he was stunned when the airline offered him just £ per person voucher as compensation. The -year-old even cheekily juxtaposed his BA video with footage of his first class flights on Emirates to show off what service he enjoyed - including bottles of Dom Perignon champagne and aposmounds of caviarapos.  The airline offered £ per person e-vouchers to the pair, stating theyaposd dealt with the case aposfairly and appropriatelyapos and wouldnapost be offering further compensation. Jarvis is aposhorriedapos at the thought of people spending their money on a aposshockingly badapos experience and warned travellers to do their research. British Airways apologised and said their aircraft go for maintenance on a regular basis and they are investigating why Jarvisapos experience clearly didnapost meet their usual high standards on this occasion. Jarvis, from west London, said: There were large gouges missing out of the seat itself and the surrounding of the seat. Chunks of leather had been gouged out to the point where you could see the metal skeleton of the seat underneath. The seat also didnapost fully recline into a bed despite that being something they advertise as part of the service, because the mechanics of the seat were broken. The seats also clearly hadnapost been cleaned, which especially during covid is just not acceptable. There were crumbs in the storage cubby holes and streaks of a sticky liquid on the tray tables which had dried on and not been cleaned. The air conditioning above my girlfriendaposs seat was leaking and dripping water onto her which is also particularly unacceptable during covid, as thataposs what filters the air.  The luxury traveller, who flies upwards of , miles a year, has visited  countries in his travels while experiencing and reviewing a range of first-class cabins and resorts. He claimed the aposbroken-downapos plane is nothing like the luxury advertised by the flight giant and is urging travellers to fly with other airlines. Jarvis also claimed the food wasnapost up to scratch, being aposstale, swimming in oil and thoroughly overcookedapos despite the hefty price tag.  Jarvis said: BA always seems one of the worst airlines when it comes to first and business class - the bottom of the barrel. Itaposs just the Dreamliners that have this problem and BA said they are aware of an issue with the seats. The problem is that they tend to do the longer routes because thataposs what theyaposre designed for so you tend to do the longest flights on the most broken down planes. They offered me £ per person as compensation for all of the issues we had which implies that that experience was only £ away from the ideal experience that BA would hope you would have. Itaposs unacceptable. Thereaposs no reason why a paying customer in any cabin should expect a seat that isnapost clean or has air conditioning dripping on them. What makes it particularly bad is that first class is advertised as being this supremely luxurious experience but thataposs not true.The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening. Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  The luxury traveller now vows to fly with other first-class carriers wherever possible and to advise clients of his to avoid British Airways, particularly for special trips. Jarvis said: I have to look at it from the view of potential clients who could be on a once-in-a-letime trip like their honeymoon. The thought of somebody saving up all of their money and spending it on BA is horrying. I would strongly recommend against picking BA as your airline for a once-in-a-letime experience unless you want that once-in-a-letime experience to be the worst experience youaposve ever had on a plane. British Airways said the health and safety of their customers was their top priority and that their aircraft go for maintenance on a regular basis, while they have invested £.billion in their fleet, inflight cabin product and catering. A spokesperson for British Airways said: Weaposve apologised to Mr Marcos and are investigating what went wrong, as his experience clearly didnapost meet our usual high standards on this occasion.

The handy tool that can help you on the way to your nearest stationCars lined up at am for the Texaco station in Slough, Berkshire, this morning Image: ©Stan KujawaByBenjamin LynchSEO writer:,  Oct | comments The fuel shortage is causing dficulty for drivers up and down the UK. Long queues have been seen as a result of the crisis and panic buying has only made the problem worse.The shortage of HGV drivers is one of the main problems. In July, the Road Haulage Association estimated that there was a shortage of around , qualied HGV drivers.British Army troops and Royal Air Force personnel have been brought in to help drive fuel tankers, but must be trained with extra safety qualications to drive fuel tankers.The government stated it would offer temporary visas for , HGV drivers. But according to reports by the BBC, the prime minister Boris Johnson said only  petrol tanker drivers from the EU have applied for the temporary visas intended to help tackle the petrol crisis.The shortage, which is only slowly improving, means that some people are finding it tough to find fuel, or their nearest station has long queues. So how can you get around this problem and make sure it isnapost you queueing  How can Google Maps help me find fuel   So many of us will need fuel in the coming days and weeks, be it for getting to work or simply dropping the kids off at school.But long queues are a nuisance due to some fuel shortages. However, Google Maps has a handy trick for helping us find the best place to go.Simply search apospetrol station near meapos and the app will give you several options.You may want to use the website fuelGenie, which shows you the nearest station, the price of the fuel, as well as the type of fuel it has to offer.Google Maps is available on our laptop or PC, but the app on either iPhone or Android is probably the easiest option  On your phone can change the map to traffic settings by pressing the diamond shaped icon which sits over a v-shaped chevron. Simply click the terrain tapon laptop or PC. For areas where there is no to little traffic, the road will glow green. Busier traffic will show up yellow, while clogs and queues will appear as red and dark brown.

Kelsie was still unconscious when doctors performed an emergency caesarean section, successfully delivering baby Kobe  weeks early, weighing lb oz. The mum finally she woke up seven days later and met her newborn baby. She said the whole thing was “just amazing”. “To wake up from a coma and have a newborn baby — it’s just too much to get your head around,” she told The Sun.“I know the doctors had to do it to protect the baby, but shock doesn’t really cover it. “Obviously, we are all so, so happy. We’ve gone from such an awful low to being back together as a family with our new baby.” The mum-of-three continued to say it was like a “miracle” that the doctors had managed to look after the two of them.  Kelsie, a graphic designer first began to feel ill last August, when she started feeling weak and “within hours” began to go downhill. The next day she was violently sick and couldn’t keep food down and next she lost her smell and taste and was struck with achiness. She says she was worried not just for herself, but also for her baby.  When breathing became dficult, two days after she fell ill, an ambulance rushed her to hospital where she was diagnosed with Covid and put on a ventilator. She was in the depth of an induced coma and heavily sedated when Kobe was delivered by C-section. After  days in the hospital, doctors decided Kelsie’s “little fighter” was strong enough to go home.  Looking back, Kelsie said it isn’t worth thinking about what could have happened - she was just so happy to be back home with the rest of her family. Her partner Danny, , echoed her sentiment, saying it was “mad” the way the situation had panned out. “To go into a coma and then wake up and have a baby, it’s the stuff of miracles,” he said.  NHS ObstetricianDr Jo Mountfield is urging pregnant women to get vaccinated against Covid-, citing an increased risk of infection in their third trimester as a compelling incentive.She said pregnancy typically caused extra pressure on the lungs, even for those who were healthy and young. If you had a baby in your abdomen stopping you from breathing properly, and then you got Covid badly, the best thing medics could do is deliver the baby, she said.

Here we look back at how they developed their bond and now enjoy being in each otheraposs company... Early relationship Kate and William started dating while they were students at St Andrews University in Scotland.And it appears even in those early days and before the pair announced their engagement in , Charles welcomed his would-be daughter-in-law into the family with open arms. In an interview to mark their engagement, Kate said Charles had been very, very welcoming and very friendly. She admitted that she was nervous to meet her future father-in-law but added: It couldnapost have gone easier, really for me.

Click here to sign up .Months after their engagement was announced, Kate and William wed in a grand ceremony in Westminster Abbey in April . Proud dad Charles was there to watch his eldest son tie the knot and gave a tear-jerking off-the-cuff speech about the couple during a champagne reception at Buckingham Palace.And according to Hello! he described Kate as like the daughter he never had and said: We are lucky to have her.He then wished the couple a letime of happiness together.  Although joint public appearances between Kate and Charles have been few and far between, when they have happened, the pair are often spotted sharing private jokes. Last year in a visit to a veterans rehabilitation centre in Loughborough, Kate was pictured in fits of giggles as she stood next to her father-in-law.William and Camilla were also there on the visit, and body language expert Judi James told the Express that by wrinkling her nose, Kateaposs laugh shows genuine humour and rapport.She added: The affection Kate clearly feels for her father-in-law could be one big thing she has in common with Camilla. Healing rt between Charles and William  Despite Kate and Charlesaposs sweet relationship, the bond between Charles and William is said to have been rocky in the past. But according to reports, it was Kate herself who helped to smooth things over between her husband and father-in-law. And she did this by reportedly helping to organised a family portrait for Charles for his th birthday in . According to the Daily Mail, Kate was instrumental in making the portrait happen, which sees Prince George and Princess Charlotte beaming and cosying up to both Charles and his we Camilla. While the Duchess herself snapped a lovely symbolic photo of Charles and his eldest son on Williamaposs birthday in , in which Charles can be seen resting his head on her husbandaposs shoulder.Organising grandparent time Charles is now the proud grandfather of five grandchildren, including Kate and Williamaposs kids Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis. But previously there had been claims that Charles, , was unhappy he did not get to see enough of the trio. In an interview two years ago to mark Charles th birthday, Prince William echoed the sentiment. He said: “I would like him to have more time with the children… to, you know, play around with the grandchildren. When heaposs there, heaposs brilliant, but we need him there as much as possible.”To this end, Kate is said to have urged Charles to visit their home Amner Hall last summer and took on the logistical challenge of getting her family back home from a holiday on the Isles of Scilly to coincide with his visit.In doing so, it was reported that the heir to the throne was able to give his grandson George a seventh birthday present in person. Comfort at funeralEarlier this year, the royal family were left grief-stricken when Prince Philip died aged  at Windsor Castle. AndPrince Charles looked visibly emotionalat his fatheraposs funeral as he led the procession to St Georgeaposs Chapel.After the ceremony, Kate was spotted comforting Charles by putting her hand on his shoulder and giving him a kiss on the cheek. Sweet nickname He goes by the names of His Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales and Charles - but Kate appears to have an endearing nickname for her father-in-law - showing their happy relationship.Kate, Charles, William, Camilla and the Queen were all at a drinks reception at the G summit in Cornwall in June. And it seemed as though Kate referred to Charles as grandpa as they arrived at the reception at the Eden Project.A lip reader told CornwallLive that the Duchess of Cambridge had used the moniker for her father-in-law.Comment MORE ON Kate Middleton, Duchess of CambridgePrince Charles, Prince of WalesRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

In the updated chapters of his unauthorised biography, Meghan: A Hollywood Princess, Morton explains how the two women, both thrust into the spotlight, were still getting to know each other when Meghan married Prince Harry. Here, body language expert Judi James takes a look back over Kate and Meghanaposs most photographed moments together to decode exactly when their friendship started to go sour - and unsurprisingly, how the public focused on them rather than the two royal brothers who were actually feuding... The relationship between these two royal women was built on three huge assumptions: firstly that they were naturally destined to be the closest of chums and allies, like Diana and Fergie were. Second that Meghan would enter the royal Firm at the same ‘level’ and state as Diana and Kate - i.e young, nervous, lacking in experience and in need of support, protection and hands-on coaching. And the third and biggest assumption was that William and Harry were the royal version of Jedward the very tightest of brothers who only needed a second we to turn their rather lopsided trio into a very idealistic ‘Fab Four’. Most of these assumptions were sexist. The phrase ‘The Merry Wives of Windsor’ might have been there waiting to be dusted off for use in some new headlines, but Diana and Fergie were pals before Fergie caught Andrew’s eye. Nobody ever expected Prince Philip and Anthony Armstrong-Jones to start dressing alike and skipping about together, or even Beatrice and Eugenie’s Eddo and Jack. And there was no way on this planet that a super-confident orced woman close to  with a career as a Hollywood actress, who was a very active and passionate speaker and campaigner, was ever going to need much hand-holding for this new role. If she did she had her husband on hand to fill her in about protocol and traditions. I believe Kate might even have been daunted by her new sister-in-law’s confidence, energy and professionalism. And of course Katewere also thrown into service as a smokescreen for a bigger and more unthinkable rt between the royal’s own version of Jedward.   The not-so Fab Four The stage appearance to launch the ‘Fab Four’ was gruesome. Kate and Meghan appeared to have been dressed from the same royal dressing-up box and seated in similar poses to make it look like the launch of a new royal doll for the ‘collection’.Meanwhile, the brothers were clearly already locked into some form of conflict - asked whether there had been disagreements between the couples during the planning of the launch, William’s Oh, yes was instantaneous and sounded heartfelt. Meghan dropped her head and placed a hand up in a cut-off gesture as though to hide her face, and the chuckles from Kate looked like nervous giggles.Kate was pregnant and sitting back in her chair, so although the idea of not having the ‘energy to bond’ with Meghan sounds like an odd sick note when most pregnant women continue their careers, let alone their social lives, she clearly can be unwell during her pregnancies.But even so, despite matching frocks there was already a sense from Meghan and Kate’s body language that Meghan’s experience, passion, drive and urgency for her cause was in contrast to Kate’s method of sitting back in her seat and watching the on-stage sibling tussle with a polite smile. Kate had spent years being marinated in royal rules, procedures and restrictions, so Meghan’s sense of purpose for a cause must have hit like a bath bomb. The post-wedding tears trip to Wimbledon, July Following rumours of tears during prep for Harry and Meghanaposs wedding, the two women put in a very ‘Diana and Fergie’ body language display at the tennis to signal publicly that all was well and suggest they really were the best of pals. I wouldn’t be too sure that a bit of ‘thank you’ jewellery sent out in a post run that included bridesmaids in the posh equivalent of a circular e-mail would be too telling, but the body language here did suggest an intention to log friendly rapport from both women, suggesting they were united in their messaging at least.There was a lot of eye contact and appreciative gestures from Kate here to signal she really was bonding with her sister-in-law, and the mirroring between the women did hint they were enjoying one of the key interests they shared.There was even some whispering and giggling together behind hands poses to help suggest they now had a more than just polite relationship and were beginning to look like genuine friends.Wives at war  The very sexist tone of two women being locked in some ‘cat fight’ continued though, despite the fact that we now know it was the men who had the real problem in their relationship.Kate and Meghan are two very dferent personalities, and dressing them the same was a pretty clichéd way of insulting two successful women - but I’m pretty sure they would have happily performed many years of politely smiling PDAs had the brothers not been locked in their rt.The balcony poses and photos of the two women at more formal events might have looked iconic in terms of defining a rt, but the context is slightly wrong. Perhaps because of William and Harry’s spat the royal pecking order was suddenly more defined at these events, and Harry and Meghan always seemed to be pushed back into the chorus line behind William and Kate. Where the two women appear to be standing together wearing icy expressions and ignoring each other, they were in fact standing one behind the other, so happy chats would have been dficult. At this point the tension on Harry’s face and the haunted expression in his eyes told all the story of what was about to come but attention was of course focused on the two women at the time. Even at the first Commemoration service, it was Kate and Meghan’s body language together that soaked up all the interest. Here they stood together in mirrored poses, wearing polite smiles, but it was their husbands wearing the haunted eye expressions while patently ignoring each other.The Christmas  walk to church threw up the kind of ‘denial’ body language we normally only see from politicians or Strictly contestants who have cheated on their wives. Kate took up the challenge to signal all was truly happy between herself and Meghan in what was obviously a set piece for the cameras. While William and Harry walked on the outside, yet again free from all the interest and speculation of a rt, it was up to Kate to step across to Meghan to chat and smile to suggest a relaxed and spontaneous moment of friendship. Meghan kept her arm linked into Harry’s and her bag as a barrier between herself and Kate. The Duchess of Cambridge was pregnant with Prince Louis at the time but solo, unaided walking was surely still on the menu, although she did turn her head and smile to form an appealing-looking pose for the press.It was during the very last outing for the now not-so Fab Four that the tension was much more obvious and palpable. A mutual gloom appeared to settle over William and Kate as they arrived to take their seats in the pews in front of Harry and Meghan.Even Kate’s signature smile had vanished on what was Harry and Meghan’s last gig before they fled to the arms of Oprah.We didn’t get to seeMeghan’s bravely polite smiles of greeting were ed by her sister and brother-in-law, but the way her beaming smile dropped like a brick suggested they were not.

It includes the Scottish mountains and higher ground in England and Wales, Met Office senior meteorologist Greg Dewhurst said.Mr Dewhurst explained: We’re likely to see some snowy weather in higher parts as October moves into November. Likely areas to be affected are the Scottish mountains as well as higher ground in northern England and northern Wales.  Low areas are unlikely to see any. It’s quite normal for this time of year. The Met Officeaposs long-range forecast from October  to November  says the weather will turn more widely unsettled across the UK. The wettest and windiest conditions will remain in the north and northwest, while southern and eastern areas are likely to experience more settled weather.  The forecast adds: Moving forward, wider dry spells are likely across the country, with the risk of overnight fog which will clear by day. Through this period temperatures will remain near or above average. There is a chance of a colder settled period becoming established by early November.This week, the UK has been hit by flooding with knee-deep water in some parts of the country. Floods have submerged roads in Devon, Gloucestershire, Plymouth, Sussex, Kent and Dorset yesterday morning. While cities such as Exeter, London, Newcastle and Liverpool were also left underwater after heavy rain. The floodwater caused chaos across the nation, shutting down motorways and blocking roads. Even trains were disrupted as railway tracks were left underwater leading to delays for commuters across the UK.  On Wednesday, the weather forecast is for it to remain settled in most places, with sunny conditions in southern and eastern areas. Later in the afternoon, the North and West will turn cloudy, with outbreaks of rain, the Met Office said. Rainfall is expected to be heavy in western Scotland, but where the weather will be mostly dry and mild. UK  day weather forecast Today: Any lingering cloud and rain far east England clearing, otherwise a bright and chilly start. Turning cloudy in the north and west with outbreaks of rain and drizzle, heaviest across Northern Ireland and western Scotland. Otherwise fine and dry. Tonight: Cloudy in the north and west, with outbreaks of rain, especially western Scotland where persistent and occasionally heavy. Elsewhere, mostly dry and mild but turning cloudier. Thursday: Some rain and drizzle in west, this persistent and occasionally heavy across western Scotland and Northern Ireland. Bright or sunny periods developing south and east Britain, feeling warm. Outlook for Friday to Sunday: Rain continuing across parts of Northern Ireland and Scotland before easing over the weekend. Largely dry where with iable cloud and early fog patches.

Storms will give way to a plume of warm air from the Continent dragged in by the remains of Hurricane Sam.  Temperatures in parts of the country could hit C tomorrow as high pressure builds across Europe into the UK. Much of Britain will bask in a balmy blast of sunshine and blue skies although parts of the northwest will stay wet and windy. Jim Dale, meteorologist for British Weather Services, said: The warmer weather will kick in from mid-week onwards, and we could see C in parts of the country by Thursday.High pressure building from the Continent will bring a change from the wetter, windier weather to drier, sunnier conditions. As we are now in October, we can call this an Indian Summer, and it is safe to say we are in for some balmy weather in the fallout from Hurricane Sam.

Having witnessed fights almost break out at open houses, the couple jumped at an opportunity for a nice, affordable home they stumbled upon in Maryland, US. Danielle did background research on some of the building work that had been done at the property and the couple decided to put in an offer. They said the three-bedroom house was going cheap and was on the market for ,- more than , below its value - due to previous interested buyers bailing out of the deal.A few days later, the couple were delighted to learn their offer had been accepted - but when Danielle decided to Google their new neighbourhood to find out more about where they would be living, she screamed when the results popped up.

Rainier boy reported held in devilaposs gripapos, with the article stating that after  to  performances of the exorcism the devil was finally cast out of the boy. It said ministers witnessed furniture sliding across the floor and the teen yelling and cursing in Latin phrases. Danielle told NPR : Honestly, the first thing I thought was, aposoh God, this is going to tank our resale valueapos.And then the next thought I had was, maybe I better rewatch that, start learning more about what it is that we just bought. And also, I had no idea that that was even based on a real story. Thankfully, Danielle has not been put off by their new homeaposs haunted past, saying that she is knowledgeable about the occult and believes demons haunt people, not properties. Ben is also embracing the history, adding: Iaposm thinking Iaposm going to get a Catholic priest Halloween costume this year and get an amplied speaker and have The Exorcist soundtrack just playing on a loop on our front porch for trick-or-treaters. Danielle and Benaposs new home is dferent from the one featured for the external shots of the house used in The Exorcist film, which is nearby in Washington D.C.

Sure, they can usually be left on their own for an hour or two here or there, but theyaposre dependant on you and theyaposre certainly part of the family. But, as many pet owners know, our furry or feathered friends can often become a little too reliant on us, which is when issues such as separation anxiety start to creep in. One woman has learned this the hard way, after adopting her adorable pet toucan, Touki, two years ago - and sheaposs never been able to leave him since. Janelle Tsao hasnapost been on a single holiday or trip away in the two years since she adopted the exotic bird because he doesnapost want to be without his human - and she wouldnapost change it for the world. It sounds ridiculous but his livelihood has taken over my le. I donapost travel, I donapost leave my home overnight or without an adult around him  , I donapost have a le apart from Touki now, the -year-old, from Los Angeles, Calornia, explained. Itaposs a lot to ask aposCan you watch my flying two-year-old apos Itaposs like having a child, heaposs beautul, intuitive and always curious. These birds are like flying toddlers or monkeys - they will get into everything. And,she ever did ask anyone to step in and take her of her winged child, it would be an awful lot of work, as Touki can be mischievous and he often does large and rather messy poos around the house. Yesterday, I was chopping tomatoes and placed them in a bowl with a lid, which he isnapost allowed to have, theyaposre too acidic, Janelle recalled. He flies down to the counter and lted the lid and stole a tomato, then he flew up to the second floor of our loft and quickly swallowed it before I could even start climbing! For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Janelle and her girlfriend Arielle Zarutsky fell in love with exotic wildle during a trip to Las Vegas, so their hearts were completely stolen when they spotted Touki at a breeders in June , when he was just a few weeks old. Our hearts just melted. He was very quiet and I guess shy in the cage. I think itaposs because he was injured and he had scab like things in his feathers, Janelle explained. I made the commitment right there, that I would do whatever it took to love and care for him. It was always a dream of mine to care for a toucan. Fortunately, the couple were well aware that toucans are not your average pet - they need a huge amount of space as spend their time in the wild in the treetops. Theyaposre also extremely territorial and monogamous, so only bond to one other animal or human. In fact, Touki is so attached to Janelle and Arielle that he will cry - extremely loudly -one of them so much as leaves the room.  Toucans have a tendency to display dferent behaviours, randomly. He will have separation anxietyone of his humans leaves the room and he will croak call or screech loudly until one or both of us s to the room, Janelle said. It can be very annoying, like a screaming parrot. Working from home can be very challenging, making phone calls can be impossible, as he is so needy and demands attention all waking hours. Sometimes Iaposll put on nature birds singing in the background to get him to quiet down a little, sometimes it doesnapost work. Not only that, the couple have been forced to cover all their furniture with plastic, to protect it from the exotic birdaposs brightly coloured poops, which he does around every five to  minutes. Janelle also receives a lot of comments from activists who claim that they should not keep such an exotic animal as a pet. She said: They will assume we took him from the wild and will say apositaposs cruel, you should put him backapos. Of course they donapost know his predicament and donapost realise he was raised by humans in captivity and itaposs a completely dferent situation. We donapost recommend them as household pets theyaposre very beautul creatures and we have so much to learn about them. Despite all the hard work that comes with being Toukiaposs humans, the couple wouldnapost change it for the world. We do not keep him as our pet, rather, he keeps US as his! I love him deeply and donapost see my le without him. It is a joy and fortune to have such a majestic animal respond and connect with human interaction.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

countryside can be a daunting thought for anyone used to urban living.With plenty of facilities nearby, le in the city centre can seem effortless. However, with the pandemic leading to many people re-evaluating what they want and need from their home, prospective buyers are choosing country le now more than ever before.Chapelton residents Amanda and Paul Dalgarno, both , are pleased to have made the move prior to the pandemic and are now thankful for the benefits that le in the town has brought them.Amanda talked this week about switching their city flat for a countryside apartment.“We were living in a flat in Aberdeen but, like many, we craved more space as well as a garden and our own front door. We had looked at every new-build housebuilder in the area and then came across Chapelton while searching online.“We took a short drive to the town and instantly fell in love with the traditional style and colours of the buildings. Every property has inidual characteristics.“We came to Chapelton looking for a house but when Places for People suggested that we view one of their apartments we realised it was everything we wanted in a home.“We chose a two-bedroom ‘Kilbryde’ apartment which is complete with its own front and back door, garden and great views. And with plenty of space, it doesn’t feel like a flat at all.“The open-plan kitchen and living area is much bigger than any of the other properties that we viewed and has allowed us to furnish the space with some beautul pieces and accessories that we love.“My interiors style is quite eclectic so I’ve gradually collected items with some industrial pieces as well as second-hand furniture which I’ve refinished.“This works really well with the period features of the property which we were delighted we could have in a new-build.“I decided to document the journey of our new home on Instagram where I love to share posts about recent upcycle projects.“Since moving to Chapelton I’ve also become quite passionate about gardening and spend more time outdoors than when I lived in the city. My husband and I love having green space of our own.#We used cobblestones to recreate an old courtyard style garden and added plenty of greenery to soften the space. The pots and planters are great as they are low maintenance and allow us to move things around to change things up.#We did all the work in the garden ourselves which makes us appreciate it even more.“We always lived in the city before moving here but we definitely see this as our forever home now and wouldn’t look back.#We have made some great new friendships with our neighbours and enjoyed street barbecues and the farmers# markets here.#The new businesses at The Boxes at Chapelton are just around the corner too, allowing us somewhere to shop locally.”Chapelton is five miles south of Aberdeen and has grown to over  households with a wide mix of properties to suit all needs and budgets.The first neighbourhood within the development, Cairnhill, sets out a blueprint for a new sustainable community with features that include: a self-sufficient and walkable community with shops, services and jobs a neighbourhood centre and high street primary school and playing fields, leisure and community amenities as well as retail and business facilities.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/10/2.62905283-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/10/2.62905283-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/10/2.62905283-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/10/2.62905283-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"drink driver who was six times the limit loses licence and his 60000 range rover","story":"A drink-driver who was SIX TIMES the limit behind the wheel of his £, Range Rover has been heavily fined and had the vehicle seized.

Five of them are elected by the Society of Writers to the Signet, two by the senate of Aberdeen University, and three by Aberdeenshire and Moray councils.A spokeswoman for the Dick Bequest trust said: #The trustees will be meeting later this month to consider matters.#The Dick Bequest was established following the death in  of Mr Dick, who left almost £, for educational development in Aberdeenshire, Banff and Moray.It continues to distribute grants to help teachers in the area develop their skills through travel or study, and also supports the purchase of school equipment.The historians found that Mr Dick had a business partnership with Robert Milligan, whose statue was removed last year by the Museum of London from its plinth in London’s Docklands.They were said to have been “slave factors”, who bought enslaved people from ships, and sold them to local enslavers or “re-exported” them to markets in other colonies.Aberdeenshire Council has already distanced itself from the fund, while Moray councillors will consider their involvement at a meeting on Wednesday.Aberdeen University, meanwhile, vowed to “acknowledge” its place in the legacy of the Dick Bequest.Robert Pirrie, chief executive of the Society of Writers to the Signet, said the society had #no power or authority over the Dick Bequest’s purposes, assets or decision-making#.However, he confirmed it was also #considering the situation#.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2021/09/MicrosoftTeams-image-19-300x180.jpg class=attachment-part-medium size-part-medium wp-post-image ","title":"coronavirus in scotland track the spread in these charts and maps2001","story":"We’ve put together a collection of daily updated charts to track the coronavirus crisis in Scotland.

loss to Montreal Impact in the MLS on Sunday # but was substituted at half-time.Imagine what fresh levels he could reachthe Dons were firing on all cylinders and winning games.When that will be, who knows, but Ramsay is certainly doing his best to haul Aberdeen out of the rut.Prior to his move from Stabaek in Norway to Pittodrie, Hernandez managed seven assists in  appearances # four coming in  league games in his final season.Ramsay has pitched in with three assists in the last two games against Celticand St Mirren In the eight Premiership games this season Ramsay has created  chances for Aberdeen and fired in  crosses # it#s a pity the Dons failed to convert most of them.Ramsay has an exquisite dead ball delivery that causes panic in opponent#s boxesAt just  years old, I am loath to compare him to anyone, but Ramsay really can bend it like Beckham.Although a left-field signing, Hernandez has undoubted pedigree, having played in Venezuela’s run to the Copa America quarter-finals prior to signing for the Dons.A change in formation and the coronavirus pandemic were partly responsible for Hernandez# inability to make an impact at Aberdeen.However, that could ultimately work out as a positive for for the Dons.Had Hernandez been a Pittodrie success, would the route for Ramsay to break through have been so clear Aberdeen splashed out £, for Hernandez with very littleso far.Yet Hernandez#s loan has opened the way for Ramsay to shine and the Dons could cash in with at least  times that outlay for the Venezuelan.Everton had an £ million bid rejected by Rangers for Scotland international right-back Nathan Patterson in the summer.Patterson and Ramsay are both teenagers and both contracted to their clubs until summer .It seems £m is the going rate Everton are willing to pay for a Scottish teen right-back, so that is what they will need to pay to land Ramsay.With Manchester United interested, maybe ramp up the price a little bit more.Hampden will be packed and rocking for Saturday#s Group F World Cup qualier against Israel.The Hampden roar can still be inspiring. It can still send shivers down your spine when it hits full volume.That will be be the level of backing the Scots will have on Saturday in a game that is absolutely pivotal to hopes of securing a play-off spot.Scotland took control of their own destiny with a superb - defeat of Austria in Vienna last month # a nation seeded higher than them.Beating higher seeds away from home is a fundamental to securing qualying campaign success for any tournament.The Scots have started the job, now they must finish it, because defeating Israel would all but secure a runners-up spot.Away games against minnows Faroe Islands and Moldova follow the Israel clash and Steve Clarke#s squad are too well disciplined to drop points in those games.Take nine points from the next three games and the Scots will book a play-off slot in March.Critics of the Premiership point to the regularity of games against the same teams.Yet this will be the seventh time Scotland have faced Israel in competitive action in three years. There should be no surprises.Rising north-east boxing stars Dean Sutherland and Billy Stuart have been confirmed to top a boxing bill at Aberdeen Beach Ballroom on Friday November .I would urge any boxing fans to go along to the night as there will be some fantastic talent on show.It is the first time undefeated Aberdonian Sutherland will fight since securing the WBO Youth World Welterweight title with a seventh round stoppage of Mexican Jose Antonio Delgado in July.Sutherland is on a rapid rise to more belt success and this is a fantastic opportunity to catch him in a home show.Likewise Stuart is another superb talent and will be looking to bounce back from his first professional defeat.Stuart will be in action for the first time since losing an IBF World Youth super-bantamweight title fight on majority decision to Mexican Alejandro Jair Gonzalez in July.This Aberdeen show will be the next step for both Sutherland and Stuart on the way to title glory.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column september 17 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Our health and social care system is under severe pressure in the pandemic # from GP practices to carers and hospital services to ambulances.We#ve never seen anything resembling the unrelenting demands placed on hard-pressed ambulance crews.They keep smiling through it and are a credit to their profession.

Academics agree that a sustainable level of material use, which would still allow for a high quality of le, is about eight tonnes per person per year.Zero Waste Scotland is advocating for mindful shopping, encouraging Scots to buy smarter and adopt reuse, repair and renting behaviours as well as embracing second-hand shopping.When finished with an item, it is calling on people to dispose of items responsibly by donating, reselling or recycling.With global climate change discussions at an all-time high and COP coming to Glasgow this November, the topic of responsible consumption in relation to the climate crisis has never been more timely.Everything we buy has a carbon cost and we are urging Scots to think dferently about what we buy and how we consume.Changing our own consumption habits is the single biggest thing we can all do to play our part in tackling climate change.Now is the time for action and we want people to bin less and buy better, seeking out items which will last longer.Responsible consumption isn’t on the COP agenda so we wanted to ensure it is top of the consumer agenda.To learn more about the campaign, please visit www.howtowasteless for further details.Iain Gulland, chief executive, Zero Waste Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters does genetic tolerance aid wild swimmers","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowWild swimming has become increasingly popular during lockdown, but in general people are ided into those who love swimming in cold water and those who think that it’s complete madness.Now scientists have found a possible explanation for this ision related to a muscle protein called alpha-actinin- .We have two types of muscle fibres # type  and type .Type  fibres provide fatigue resistance important for prolonged, submaximal activity like marathon running, while type  fibres produce a rapid and powerful force for short-burst, vigorous activities such as sprinting.The two types of fibres respond dferently to cold exposure # type  fibres produce an involuntary, low-intensity, continuous increase in muscle tone, while type  fibres give bursts of high-intensity activity causing overt shivering.ACTN is only active in type  muscle fibres, and deficiency of this protein is caused by a non-ing ACTN gene.This occurs in - per cent of the world’s population, around . billion people, and is most common in Europe and Asia.These people lack type  muscle fibre activity and although this is compensated by having larger type  fibres, it adversely affects muscle , impacting on athletic performance, particularly in sprint and power activities.Now scientists have investigated the role of ACTN in cold tolerance .Male participants,  with ing and  with non-ing ACTN, were immersed in water at °C for -minute periods interspersed with -minute rest periods at room temperature .The ordeal ended either after a maximum of six immersions or when participants’ body temperature dropped to .°C.The scientists found improved cold tolerance in those with non-ing ACTN, some  per cent of whom maintained body temperature above .°C compared to  per cent of those with al ACTN.So those lacking al type  fibres had better cold tolerance, suggesting that cold-induced increased muscle tone is more efficient at generating heat than overt shivering.Improved cold tolerance probably gave our ancestors an evolutionary survival advantage after their migration from Africa to colder climes in Eurasia, so explaining the high frequency of non-ing ACTN in today’s northern populations.It would be interesting to investigate how many Scottish wild swimmers carry this genetic iant.

They were silent, because they#d been caught out.Then Jesus took a little child in his arms and said to them: #Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me, welcomes not me but the one who sent me.#Greatness, Jesus was saying to them, is found in welcoming and receiving into our arms someone vulnerable, powerless and dependent, regardless of age.Greatness is found not in what we have accomplished but in what we have done and given to #the least of these#, the hungry, thirsty, naked, sick, and imprisoned: the symbolic children in each of our lives.Greatness never makes itself superior over another. It is not about me, my job, my reputation, my status. Our greatness is revealed in our service and care of others.Max is doing well, by the way, and I can hardly wait to see him again.God bless you and yours, from biggest to littlest, today and always."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column september 24 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.We would like to add our best wishes to Mr Peter Ciarella on reaching his th birthday.He is undoubtedly one of the best-known and loved people in the district, and his contribution to Lochgilphead over the decades is immeasurable.It#s amazing how the foresight and hard work of dferent groups of people, working independently for their own particular areas of interest, have resulted in a number of improvement schemes coming to fruition at the same time.Mid Argyll is looking forward to the completion of projects to upgrade the Lochgilphead swimming pool, front green and Kilmartin Museum.

We were delighted to welcome them to Argyll for their first performance as a quartet and for three of the four performers this was the first time they had performed in more than a year.The quartet # Andrew, Dean, Jack and Richard # introduced each piece, giving background to both the role of the saxophone and the composer, with many of the pieces arranged by the group themselves.Purcell’s #Festival Rondeau# was the dramatic opening, a work well-known across all age groups, so a perfect start to the concert.Following this was a work composed specically for a saxophone quartet in  by Jean-Baptiste Singelée, a friend of Adolph Sax who invented the saxophone. We were treated to the traditional Andante before moving onto the exciting Allegro.The third selection of pieces were all by Debussy. This was a surprising choice as the saxophone is not really associated with the Impressionist period, however, it showed the versatility of both the saxophones and performers. #Arabesque No.# was followed by #The Little Shepherd# which was delightful, calm and serene with only the sound of the river flowing through the trees and birds singing along. The jaunty #Cakewalk# completed this ied section.#Air on a G String# by Bach and known to many as a TV advert was the next offering. The opening descending bass line showed the depth and quality of the baritone saxophone in much more than just a supporting role. This music predates the invention of the saxophone by more than  years.Gershwin and a selection of show tunes from the swing era were just what we needed after the relaxing #Air#. The four musical songs, all showcasing dferent styles, certainly had the audience smiling, toe-tapping and singing along. In the final piece #I Got Rhythm# we were all moving to the music, including the quartet. Closing your eyes, you could imagine you were relaxing in a jazz club anywhere in the world.The next piece, #L’Arlesienne Exhibition#, is a collection of highlights for the saxophone in an orchestral situation. The music was composed by Hiroki Takahashi, with many familiar themes from film and TV # including The Apprentice # all thoroughly enjoyable.Gershwin’s #An American in Paris# portrays the many sights and sounds that Gershwin experienced there in the s. While it was composed for an orchestra which included saxophones and car horns, the music played by the quartet didn’t include any car horns # just skilled and imaginative saxophonists.A change of pace to enjoy some relaxed, laid-back music from West Africa followed with Will Gregory’s #High Le#. The repeated rhythms with the peace of Kilmory, the cooling air and the gentle river flowing was almost hypnotic and brought the concert to a finish.The audience cheered, clapped and blew their cars horns to ensure the quartet provided an encore. #Witch Hunt# by Ulrich Schultheiss was the encore # a dramatic and fiery work challenging all the performers and bringing a fantastic concert to a close.The quartet members themselves didn#t feel the cars were a barrier and said they #had a blast at a unique and special event#.MAAA thank the th Argyll Scoutsfor helping with the car parking. Traffic cones and hi-vis waistcoats were loaned by MacLeods and the wagon we used as a stage was from Ferguson#s Butchers. Picnic boxes were pre-ordered from Lucy’s Ardfern.

especially when it comes to the impact of proposed sites on traditional fishing grounds # poor site maintenance and monitoring which can lead to instances of vessel entanglement and also the environmental impact of the sites on both commercial and non-commercial species.The group believes that while the sector has made many advances over the past decade, increased transparency and oversight are needed to ensure the aquaculture sector can better co-exist with the fishing industry.The initial aim of the group would be to ensure that there is a proper analysis of localised fishing and follow up with clear and sensible communication between the two sectors to ensure that with expansion does not come conflict.It is a timeous idea, which will hopefully reassure fishermen that they will not simply be displaced by fish farming but will be respected for their own produce.The group will cement a policy to assist the fishing industry deal realistically with the fish farming industry and the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation.Simon Macdonald, chair RIFG Aquaculture Work GroupSir,NFU Scotland is calling on the UK Government to address the nation’s growing labour crisis, which is undermining all parts of the food and drink supply chain, leading to signicant losses on some Scottish farms and resulting in a growing number of empty shop shelves.Last week#s #BackBritishFarmingDay on September  came as a UK Government announcement of a free trade #agreement in principle# between the UK and New Zealand is believed to be imminent.Having agreed in June to provide unfettered access in the future to Australia, the cumulative impact of another deal with a major exporting nation has huge signicance for Scottish farmers and crofters.With so much to celebrate about the quality and standards of our food and drink, #BackBritishFarmingDay was a fantastic opportunity to thank the nation for their incredible support throughout Brexit and Covid-.NFU Scotland, both independently and in conjunction with the Scottish food and drink industry, has written several times to UK Government calling for measures that address the shortfall in both seasonal and permanent staff.Should it fail to do so, I have absolutely no doubt that the situation will deteriorate further.It is galling to hear that the UK Government is on the verge of signing up to another free trade deal that will permit a growing level of imports while delivering very little to our food and drink sector in .The blunt fact is that neither deal has been afforded any kind of proper parliamentary scrutiny as the government’s promised Statutory Trade and Agriculture Commission has yet to be established.Safeguards against market disruption are also promised, but the cumulative impact of these deals will be profound for UK farming.If handled badly, these may make it impossible for some of our family farming businesses to continue to compete with high levels of low-cost imports produced to standards that would not be allowed here.Martin Kennedy, president, NFU ScotlandSir,National audits of diabetic services have shown that only around  per cent of people with type one or two diabetes have nine key annual checks to help prevent long-term diabetic complications.The pandemic has made this situation dficult because many routine checks and face-to-face appointments have not been available.The InDependent Diabetes Trusthas published a free new booklet which explains the nine key tests.It helps people look after their health by ensuring that they know what checks they need from health professionals.Get your copy of Diabetes care #

Try and get evergreens planted by the end of the month.Dormant roses are now available at local nurseries and garden centres and are very good value for money.You can easily create a rose garden for the coming year that will provide beautul flowers and fragrance from early summer through to autumn. Before planting, mix in some good quality compost and make sure the plants are watered well once planted.It#s an excellent time to plant coners as well. Coners are cone-bearing seed plants and include cedars, cypresses, firs, junipers, larches, pines, spruces, and yews.While being practical and useful, coners are also visually stunning and can transform a garden into something quite magnicent.They are a wonderful way of adding colour and shape to your outdoor space, particularly as many coners change colour throughout the year.With several hundred ieties available in the UK, there is one to suit every type of garden, and they are easy to look after.They need good drainage and water to get them established, but once growing will need little attention as they are pretty disease resistant and maintenance free.In addition to coners, another way to bring colour to the garden at this time of year is with autumn bedding plants.One of the most exciting group of plants to brighten up any part of the garden is Heuchera.Native to north America, Heuchera were originally grown for their flowers # dainty spikes of red, pink and white bells.They carry their plume like flowers high above their crowns of leaves, but gardeners are now mainly interested in their foliage which comes in a iety of colours.Heucheras grow in full or partial sun, in well composted soil and are fairly pest resistant.They can be established as ground cover in many garden situations like under trees where grass could struggle.October is often a time spent clearing up after the summer and preparing for the winter and wpring ahead so here are some top tips for jobs this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"gardens of argyll in new tv series","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowTwo Argyll gardens will appear in a new BBC ALBA series which started last week.Gàrraidhean Mòra na h-Alba, or Gardens of Scotland is presented by Murdo Macdonald, and the programme will feature Ardkinglas and Benmore gardens.In a programme screened on Thursday September  and available on BBC iPlayer, it was the turn of Ardkinglas Garden at the head of Loch Fyne.There, Murdo finds out about the model railway that used to run along the lochside, and wanders around the azaleas bursting with colour in the Ladies# Garden.He walks up to the old mill by the river, then explores the champion trees and renowned rhododendron collection in the Woodland Garden.He also finds out more about the fairy garden for children which is made up of lots of little houses next to the bottom of tree trunks, laid out in trail.#The fairy garden attracts thousands of families each year so it#s become a destination in itself,# said Murdo. #The Ladies# Garden with azaleas is also well worth seeing in summer it’s stunning because it#s ablaze with colour.#On October , Gàrraidhean Mòra na h-Alba will showcase Benmore Garden at the end of Loch Eck, a regional garden of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh.Murdo visits the Victorian fernery, the Tasmanian Ridge and the Chilean Rainforest Glade, where he plants a monkey puzzle tree.Murdo said: #Benmore is a dramatic garden in its terrain with amazing views and you could easily spend days walking around, just taking in what’s there.#There’s a wildness to the garden that isn’t as apparent at some of the other more formal gardens which can almost make you feel as though you’re in a dferent country.#"},{"url":null,"title":"glendaruel hosts tighnabruaich open","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowGlendaruel and Colintraive Gun Club hosted the Tighnabruaich Open on September , the first club competition to be held since March .The High Gun of the day, after a three-way shoot off, was Ted Blakeway.In second was Alan Brown third, Paul Chalmers and fourth equal were Martin Young,  Gordon Grfiths and Eric McAllister.The ladies prize went to Jessica Young.

Yet we often treat them in a dismissive way.Let#s think about some insects.Take the bluebottle. How often has it outwitted us with its amazing flight paths, ducking and ing to avoid our threatening gestures.While we have developed some of the most sophisticated flying machines the world has known, none can match the bluebottle in its agility.We have mentioned pollination. What insect is more important than the bee as it goes about its business from flower to flower ensuring that the plants will produce seed for another year and giving us honey as a product of its labours.How beautul too are its colours and the structure of its body – a remarkable little insect.Then there is the humble moth and its gravity-defying antics walking across ceilings. It has a very fragile body but in its short le can nevertheless act out its own acrobatic skill in an amazing performance.Or we may think of the spider and the beauty of its web, perhaps seen on a frosty winter morning. A true work of art woven with such delicacy.In the bible we read this: #Go watch the ants, you lazy person. Watch what they do and be wise.

This included him having a relapse when we thought we might lose him.He was diagnosed with an autoimmune condition and needed a long course of treatment and regular blood tests but thankfully he pulled through.Sadly, Red’s story is not an isolated case. Many animals arrive with us when they are literally broken.Some have suffered for a long time, carrying physical and emotional scars. Animals can’t tell us where it hurts, why they’re sick or why they’re scared.It’s our job to uncover what has happened to the animals and what treatment they need.Red’s happy ending is the best possible outcome for us. To see the broken animals which arrive with us go on to loving forever homes. It’s the reason we do what we do.We don’t just fix broken bones. We fix broken hearts too.The Scottish SPCA receives no government funding and is entirely reliant on donations from the public.To find out more about our Broken campaign and becoming a member of the Scottish SPCA, visit www.scottishspca.org brokenanimals.Jo Neilson, Scottish SPCA senior vet"},{"url":null,"title":"action packed day for young soccer stars","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more #

It needed to secure the signatures of MSPs from at least three political parties represented in the Scottish Parliament # which it achieved in spades.The Conservative MSP said: #I welcome the progress that has been made in terms of identying a new route into Argyll and Bute to replace the existing A Rest and Be Thankful pass, but it is clear that the timescales to deliver the new route do not meet the urgency that is expected by local residents and businesses, who are at their wits# end.#There is clear consensus for Transport Scotland to act with greater urgency, and I feel it is right that MSPs from all parties have the opportunity to discuss this issue given its immense importance to the people of Argyll and Bute.#The stretch of road, a key access route between Glasgow and Argyll, has been subject to regular closures caused by landslides, costing over £ million in mitigation measures over the last decade. Yet deluges continue to trigger debris flows that shut the pass, most recently in July this year.The push for a Holyrood debate followed calls from the A Rest and Be Thankful Campaign group, who represent , businesses across Argyll and Bute, for Transport Scotland to speed up its plans to deliver the new road which is earmarked to replace the existing pass.A spokesperson for the campaign said: #We are asking for the Scottish Government to recognise the Rest And Be Thankful as an emergency, cut through the business-as-usual approach and deliver a change that will not only improve lives and livelihoods, but also reduce the carbon footprint of what is also considered a climate emergency. We need the Scottish Government and parliament to deliver on their pre-election promises of a rapid solution for the Rest And Be Thankful.#Speaking after September#s A Task Force meeting, Argyll and Bute councillor Alan Reid said it #was very disappointing. Progress towards a permanent solution to the problems at the Rest  Thankful is moving at a snail’s pace. We were told it could be  before the SNP even announce their preferred route. The SNP still don’t realise the urgency of finding a solution. It’s high time they did.#That the Parliament recognises what it sees as the ongoing frustration felt by communities and businesses across Argyll and Bute as a result of the reported continued problems on the A at the Rest and Be Thankful pass acknowledges the establishment of the Rest and Be Thankful Campaign group, representing , businesses across Argyll and Bute notes the group#s calls for a more robust, long-term solution to the existing road, and for faster action to be taken to deliver it understands that, following public consultation, Transport Scotland has identied a new route to replace the existing A Rest and Be Thankful pass considers that the timescale set out to achieve this does not meet the urgent needs of communities and businesses across Argyll and Bute notes the view that Transport Scotland should explore the potential use of the nearby forestry road as a temporary mitigation route, and further notes the calls on the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland to work with MSPs from all parties, the Rest and Be Thankful Campaign and other local stakeholders to achieve a suitable outcome.The debate is supported by: Jackie Baillie, Miles Briggs, Ariane Burgess, Alexander Burnett, Jackson Carlaw, Finlay Carson, Sharon Dowey, Russell Findlay, Murdo Fraser, Meghan Gallacher, Pam Gosal, Rhoda Grant, Jamie Greene, Jamie Halcro Johnston, Rachael Hamilton, Craig Hoy, Dean Lockhart, Douglas Lumsden, Jenni Minto, Edward Mountain, Emma Roddick, Douglas Ross, Graham Simpson, Alexander Stewart, Paul Sweeney, Sue Webber, Annie Wells, Brian Whittle."},{"url":null,"title":"scout-adkin-qualifies-world-championships-thailand","story":"PEEBLES hill-running siblings Scout and Jacob Adkin were both in action at the British Championships at Sedbergh in the Lake District last weekend.Scout Adkin took the womenrsquos senior title finishing more than a minute ahead of Katherine Maltby who claimed second place and a signicant margin ahead Naomi Leng in third position.The race was also the trial for the World Mountain Running Championships in Thailand next February and Scoutrsquos victory guarantees her selection for that tournament.Jacob, however, took fourth place despite an injury which later ended with a hospital visit and an avulsion fracture diagnosis.He injured his ankle on the first descent but continued and was visibly in pain, hobbling over the finish line.This contributed to Scotlandrsquos senior men beating England by a single point.ldquoFortunately it is not a lsquoproperrsquo broken leg, he told the Scottish Athletics website.ldquoI was in a bit of pain but didnrsquot want to let the team down and it was brilliant for Scotland to get two sets of team golds.ldquoThe diagnosis was that it was a clean little fracture at the end of the bone and Irsquom not in plaster of anything like that.

Coners are cone-bearing seed plants and include cedars, cypresses, firs, junipers, larches, pines, spruces and yews.While being practical and useful, coners are also visually stunning and can transform a garden into something quite magnicent.They are a wonderful way of adding colour and shape to your outdoor space, particularly as many coners change colour throughout the year.With several hundred ieties available in the UK, there is one to suit every type of garden, and they are easy to look after.They need good drainage and water to get them established, but once growing will need little attention as they are pretty disease resistant and maintenance free.In addition to coners, another way to bring colour to the garden at this time of year is with autumn bedding plants.One of the most exciting group of plants to brighten up any part of the garden is heuchera.Native to North America, heucheras were originally grown for their flowers – dainty spikes of red, pink and white bells.They carry their plume like flowers high above their crowns of leaves, but gardeners are now mainly interested in their foliage which comes in a iety of colours.Heucheras grow in full or partial sun, in well composted soil and are fairly pest resistant.They can be established as ground cover in many garden situations like under trees where grass could struggle.October is often a time spent clearing up after the summer and preparing for the winter and spring ahead so here are some top tips for jobs next month from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"connor is tarberts junior champion","story":"The threat of wet and windy weather did not daunt the enthusiasm of the young golfers, who took part in three dferent competitions.The junior champion was Connor MacRae, group three champion was Aiden Kerr, group two champion was Jack Sinclair and group one champion was Macey Fair.As part of their prizes, the children received a British Open top from Portrush which was kindly signed by European Tour star Robert MacIntyre.#Congratulations to everyone who participated and many thanks to Lesley at Loch Fyne Gallery for her sponsorship,# said a club spokesperson.#Thanks to Captain Kenny for organising the coaching and the championship.

There were two lighthouses at the harbour entrance: one on a northern clf and the other to the south. These were intended to guide vessels through the portrsquos channel which had dangerous sand banks on either side.ldquoBut heavy rain prevented The Starrsquos crew from seeing the lights properly and there was a breakwater to be avoided before the harbour could be taken.ldquoOn entering the port, a huge wave bore down on the boat, threatening to throw it onto the breakwater.ldquoThe crew took what evasive action they could but, sadly, the boat was dashed against the masonry pier with such force that she quickly broke up with the tragic loss of all the crew but one.An active search was made but none of the bodies were reportedly found at that time.Almost five months later, the body of the skipper was found by fisherman William Cross, washed ashore at Dunwich, on March , .Newspapers reported at the time of memorial services being held in Musselburgh and visits made to grief-stricken families by the provost.Stuart Ritchie said it was believed that the skipperrsquos body was the only one found.He said: ldquoAfter a good deal of searching over a period of time, recently I found my great grandfatherrsquos death certicate. I feel very sad that, apparently, Jamesrsquos body was never found so a funeral may never have taken place.But he added: ldquoIt is good that the descendants are meeting up.ldquoIt would be even betterthe wider community in the Musselburgh Fisherrow area was made aware of this heritage and perhaps the local authority could do a bit to help here.He felt a lasting memorial to the crew of Star of the East at Fisherrow Harbour would be a fitting tribute to them.Mr Johnston added: ldquoAttending our harbour ceremony felt like stepping back into the past to remember and honour, not only James Ritchie and the other brave men of The Star who lost their lives, but also to allow us today to pay tribute to every family within the Fisherrow fishing community for the important contribution it has made to the economy and history of Musselburgh over many years.Walter Brown jnrrsquos great grandson Walter Moffat, , who lives in Toronto, Canada, visited the skipper Walter Brown snrrsquos grave at Dunwich in early  where a memorial stone had been placed by his widow Jane lsquoBonthronrsquo Brown.He said his ancestor was seen by commanding everyone to ldquosave themselves as he held the mast going down with the ship.ldquoCoincidentally, Walter Brown jnr forgot to take his bible on that trip ndash I have it at home, said his descendant who is the grandson of Walter Brown, the son of Walter Brown jr and Elizabeth Brown , who was just one when his father died in the shipwreck.The Scottish Fisheries Museum at Anstruther is planning to mark the th anniversary of the loss of The Star at its annual memorial service in the museumrsquos Memorial Room in October.

ious European engagements.In , Cope was promoted to lieutenant-general and, just before the  Rising, he was appointed military commander in Scotland.After Prince Charles and his men had landed at Eriskay, Cope withdrew to Inverness, leaving Edinburgh exposed.The Prince lost no time before he entered the Capital in triumph with his army of Highlanders, rough types who were capable of anything.After Cope had loaded his troops onto ships at Aberdeen and sailed for Dunbar, the two armies met at Prestonpans on September , .Many of Copersquos troops were inexperienced recruits and his officers were a feeble lot.Early the following morning, when the Highlanders charged, Copersquos dragoons fled in panic, leaving the infantry exposed.Had the humane Prince and his officers not interceded, a bloodbath might well have have ensued, with no prisoners taken.The craven Cope fled to Berwick-upon-Tweed with some of his officers and a rabble of surviving soldiers.He faced a court martial but was exonerated, the cowardly conduct of the soldiers being blamed for everything.He obtained another appointment as Governor of Limerick but never held an independent field command again.There was an early rumour among the Scottish victors that Sir John Cope had overslept on the morning of the battle although it inspired the rousing bagpipe tune Hey, Johnnie Cope, Are Ye Waking Yet , that version of events is not true.Then there was a story that although Prince Charles had spent the night before the battle on duty with his men, Cope had slept at comfortable quarters in Cockenzie.This tale was reported by the Edinburgh historian Robert Chambers as early as , although Copersquos  biographer Sir Robert Cadell found it yet another calumny: in spite of the assertions of Chambers and others, Cope had slept with his troops on the battlefield, as veried by the Culloden Papers and the Proceedings of Copersquos court martial.In his  biography of Prince Charles, the mischievous W. Drummond Norie lsquoimprovedrsquo the old legend further, claiming that Cope had been spending the night at a comfortable house in Cockenzie, nowadays referred to as the lsquoInk Bottlersquo and pictured in his book. This story was widely believed at the time.On June , , The Scotsman newspaper wrote that: ldquoIn Cockenzie several properties have been medically condemned and after a long allowance of time these have been closed amongst others portions of the historic Ink Bottle [Copersquos House].But the old house survived this crisis, however, being featured and photographed in the Edinburgh Evening News of August , , as a curious reminder of the hapless English generalrsquos efforts in the Battle of Prestonpans.The Cockenzie and Port Seton chronicler Dr R. Turner, writing in , rightly puts the curiously shaped old Ink Bottle house in or near Cope Lane in Port Seton, not far from the Old Parish Church Manse, adding that it had recently been demolished.I have been snooping round these parts to very this fact: the Ink Bottle is no longer standing, having fallen victim to the vandals of the s.Some historical revisionists from south of the Border have belatedly tried to save Sir John Copersquos reputation: the expedition to Inverness was caused by the bad advice he was given by some Scottish renegade noblemen, and the defeat at Prestonpans was wholly due to the poor quality of the soldiery.As we know, the story of him deserting his troops the morning of the battle is not true, but he did leave his military chest containing his papers and pound, for soldierrsquos pay under a staircase at Cockenzie House, where it was gleefully seized by the Prince and his men.It had been Copersquos decision to leave Edinburgh exposed, and it had been his responsibility to make sure the troops were properly trained and ably officered.The headlong flight to Berwick-upon-Tweed does not inspire confidence either, since it had been his duty to try his utmost to rally the troops, even at the cost of his own le.As a result of Sir John Cope being recalled, the Auld Enemy made sure that more canny officers, and tougher soldiers recalled from the Continent, were brought to Scotland to suppress the Rising: this target was achieved, just as planned, by lsquoButcherrsquo Cumberland at Culloden in ."},{"url":null,"title":"charity-golf-day-musselburgh-golf-club-raises-1-000-maggies","story":"Each year, players gather at Musselburgh Golf Club at Monktonhall to play for the Norrie Hosie Friday Cup.The tournament has grown from small beginnings, when local man NormanHosie Senior, from Stoneybank, began playing with friends back in the s.He donated a trophy for the match, the organisation of which has been taken over by his son Norrie Junior, from Wallyford, who has attracted sponsors for the event, which raises hundreds of pounds for charity each year, including Alzheimer Scotland, Royal Hospital for Children  Young People, and Changes, a Musselburgh-based community health project.This year, Mr Hosie Jnr decided to donate the money to Maggiersquos Edinburgh at the Western General Hospital, which helped him and his we Shirley after her breast cancer diagnosis last November.About  golfers took part in the recent competition, which was won by Alister Gray and raised pound for the charity.

to Scottish Ministers to see the plans given the green light.Rosie Leven, the reporter appointed by the Scottish Ministers, gave the planned three-storey building at  High Street and land to the north the go ahead.Neighbours overlooking the proposed three-bedroom house had objected to the planned property, which measures just over four metres wide and  metres long, on the grounds of privacy.Mrs Leven attached a condition to the approval that a balustrade should be included on the roof terrace.She said: ldquoI consider that the proposed first floor kitchen doors and roof terrace are part of the main living space of the proposed house and are likely to be more regularly used, during a larger proportion of the day, than the bedroom windows.ldquoI consider that it is from those first floor windows spaces that there is the greatest potential for an adverse effect on neighbouring residential amenity.ldquoIn this respect, the appellant has suggested that a condition could be placed on the consent to require a . metre balustrade around the three open sides of the roof terrace.ldquoIn the circumstances, I find that such a balustrade would help to reduce the ability for overlooking, both from the roof terrace itself and from the double doors to the kitchen.ldquoTaking this into account, I accept that there may be some overlooking from and to the proposed bedroom window, but with the addition of a balustrade, I consider that the overall impact on the amenity of the neighbouring properties would not be signicantly adverse.Concerns had also been raised about whether the proposed building was in keeping with the character of the town centre.The Reporter noted that traditional buildings ldquodominate the area but added ldquothere are dferent heights and styles of building.She

Proposals also include “active travel” routes, e-bike chargers and welcome facilities, alongside coach permits and charging at some car parks.The programme is being funded with joint investment of up to £. million from the Scottish Government and UK Government, as part of the Islands Growth Deal — a ten-year investment programme jointly funded by the UK and Scottish governments, the three island councils and their partners from the public, academic and business sectors.During the in-person sessions, due to take place next Tuesday and Wednesday, attendees will be guided through proposals with representatives from project partners.OIC leader, Councillor James Stockan, said: “The Islands Deal commitment we have from the Scottish and UK Governments to support the Orkney Gateway is hugely gratying and reflects the position our World Heritage Site holds as one of the jewels in Scotland’s and indeed the UK’s tourism crown — not to mention the global archaeological signicance of the site.“But we must remember that at the core of this is a landscape and series of monuments which for many Orcadians is a direct, mysterious and powerful link to their past. And we know equally they are held very dear by people who’ve moved into these islands over the years.“So, as partners, we are all very clear that we want to gather local people’s views on the range of options that we could bid for through our final Islands Deal business case.”The consultation events are scheduled for Tuesday, October , at Maeshowe Visitor Centre, Stenness, from pm to pm, and Wednesday, October , at St Magnus Centre, Kirkwall, from pm until pm.If you’re unable to attend these events, further information is available at www.orkney.gov.uk orkneygateway.

This includes Memorandums of Understanding with Orkney Harbour Authority and Scrabster Harbour Trust to enhance port infrastructure and position the area more competitively to support offshore wind projects in the future.The announcement of this bid comes after the completion of the leasing round of Scotwind, a programme which will lease areas of the seabed around Scotland for wind farm developments.The Scottish Government hopes that as much as ten gigawatts of new generating capacity will be built over the next decade.Stephen Kerr, project director of the West of Orkney Windfarm, said: “While ScotWind has created the opportunity for a global industry to tap into Europe’s best wind resource, our consortium believes that success will be driven by targeted proposals built upon strong local relationships.”We have designed our bid specically around this location and brought together a unique combination of stakeholders to maximise the opportunities for the region.“In particular, the upcoming round of offshore wind projects are a terric opportunity for ports in Caithness and Orkney to win signicant long-term contracts in the installation and operational phase of these major infrastructure schemes.“Our agreements with Scrabster Harbour Trust and Orkney Harbour Authority will enable us to work together with a clear focus on long term delivery. Each port has its own specic capabilities and attributes, and on successful site award we have committed to fund collaborative design and supply studies and to invest where appropriate in improving each harbour’s infrastructure.“We will apply a similar collaborative approach across the supply chain, working closely with Scottish and UK suppliers to deliver on climate targets and enhance local economies.”The consortium has undertaken extensive site investigations, including birds, marine mammals and near-shore geophysical surveys, and has finalised a grid connection agreement with National Grid that will enable the project to commence generation in .Jim Buck, harbourmaster for Orkney Harbour Authority, said that Scapa Flow # the second largest natural harbour in the world # offers an environment like no other and said that the £million masterplan to develop ports around Orkney is key in attracting new business to the islands. “Our Masterplan embraces decarbonisation and a transition away from fossil fuels,” said Mr Buck.“It includes a range of infrastructure enhancements across key locations around the Orkney mainland, including a new deep-water facility in Scapa Flow, which will be crucial to us realising our ambition to deliver social and economic benefit from offshore wind energy.“The West of Orkney Windfarm is ideally positioned to make signicant use of these future facilities and this collaboration represents another key step on our journey to position Orkney as a base for innovation and a major contributor in delivering a carbon-free future for the islands.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But were it not for Murdo Dan’s job as a joiner and Chrissie Mary doing a few shts as a carer, their economic ‘situation’ would be very dficult indeed.To supplement their income, they have decided to use their meagre savings, borrow a not insignicant sum from their local bank, and apply to stick a couple of pods on the croft.Meanwhile, Nigel and Pippa saw a croft for sale in the Sunday Times Property Section for what they thought was a snip at £k and decided to use part of a trust fund to purchase it as a commercial investment.They thought that they could also capitalise on the local tourist ‘boom’ and have applied to turn the derelict croft house into a vegan cafe and craft shop and also to stick several pods on their newly acquired croft to offer a ‘holistic getaway’ for their jet-set pals.Do you, and I certainly don’t mean to pre-judge anyone who reads this paperthink that their ‘cases’ should be treated any dferently by the local planning authorities If the answer is “yes”, then think again.Too dficult a scenario to judge Try this one.Should an application to build a couple of pods on a croft, which is basically  per cent bog, in the middle of Ranish and has no view of anywhere except adjacent croft bog, be given any additional merit over a similar application in beautul Scaristavore or Ardroil where ‘breathtaking scenery’ will be the selling tagline Wrong again.As a member of the local planning board here in the Western Isles, I’m more than well aware of what my responsibilities are and it’s certainly not to pre-judge any applications based on my own preconceptions, or prejudicesof what should or shouldn’t be allowed.I’ve to stick to the guidelines and the training I’ve been given, understand what’s expected of meand to base my decision without emotion or bias. across the front pages of this paper and others, on social media and the television news, can influence any of my our decisions.The capitalist playground which crofting tenure has now become, and the seismic change in the scale of speculation on ‘marketable’ properties available, is in danger of knocking the fragile socio-economic balance of the west of Scotland even further off its already very shoogly axis.Crofts have now become the equivalent of crypto-currency the ‘Bitcoins’ which can provide financial security for those fortunate enough to be sitting on ‘gold’.What’s being done to stabilise and bring a dose of reality to a market which threatens to get completely out of control How can single iniduals be able to own several crofts with not an intention to ‘work’ or develop any single one of them I believe that a crofting historian once said that this form of land tenure has become ‘the single biggest impediment to sustainable development in Western Scotland and the Highlands and Islands’.That wasn’t yesterday.‘Things’ are already well out of control.But who should intervene I’m not the only one who keeps asking the question.Apparently ‘we’ should legislate to address.We need, it has been suggested, to become Jersey or Guernsey.That people shouldn’t be allowed to buy homes here unless they intend to be used as a primary residence .Second homes taxation needs to increase signicantly and the additional income be used to support tourism infrastructure.From the Butt to Bodmin there have been ious proposals as to how to legislate to prevent the worst effects of tourism from destroying fragile local economies.Have any worked, andso, could they be implemented here to make any dference Let me be very clear.Tourism is hugely important to our rural economy.More so since Brexit and Covid.But I’ll say this again, at the risk of boring you all: it needs to be carefully nurtured and sustainably developed.We cannot survivewe turn our villages into ‘ghost-towns’#yes, I know…..for the winter months.We need a balance, we need the ‘tools’ with which to legislate properly and we need those charged with ‘oversight’ to take better ownership.We need, and I’ve yet to see any evidence of this, these same people to begin to take this seriously.For our future generations.They are the ones who will be impacted mostwe don’t sit up and pay attention.Now."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CATTLE-SALES-SEP-21-2-scaled.jpg","title":"remember your roots skye plan is urged to recognise","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThose were the comments of Roddy Murray, former Western Isles councillor and now the grazings clerk for Tarskavaig in Sleat, who this week voiced his concern that there was no mention of crofting at all in the ‘Skye and Raasay Future’ plan published in August with the full backing of all four local councillors.He told the Free Press: “There are  projects listed in the plan but not a single mention of crofting.

You only have to look at the , high quality calves sold for high prices last week in Portree to see that.”In terms of infrastructure improvements to support crofting, Mr Murray said the auction mart in Portree must be redeveloped to improve parking and animal welfare, and an abattoir facility must be provided so that livestock does not have to be driven to Dingwall.He added: “We are being told by the Scottish Crofting Federation that there is a huge demand for new crofts.#To meet that demand we either have to encourage landowners to make this happen or there has to be acquisition of an estate.“If we want to keep our young people in our communities we need to address the availability of crofts.”The Scottish Government are guilty of an “abject failure” when it comes to creating new crofts on publicly-owned land, Mr Murray added.Stung by the criticism, the council said they hoped to “discuss the plan further with organisations like the Crofting Commission” and would be keen to hear from any other interested parties.A spokeswoman said: “Skye and Raasay Future has been prepared with and by wider representatives of the community across the area.#It reflects people’s vision and priorities for the future, following feedback gathered through workshops and online consultations held throughout the year.“In workshop discussions, the important role that crofting plays in the identity and culture of Skye and Raasay communities has been clearly referenced..#Skye councillor John Finlayson said all stakeholders should be involved in “shaping, evaluating and changing” the plan’s priorities and he acknowledged the importance of crofting “in all its guises” across Skye and Raasay.He added: “Crofting is still a central part of le on Skye and while it is part of our history and culture it will also I hope continue to be a key part of our future and it is an important element of SARF.#As those who took part in the engagement to create the initial plan agreed, it is important that representatives from the crofting community are fully engaged in the continued development and implementation of the plan and I am confident this will happen.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4108705.jpg--.jpg?1632478259000\n","title":"craigdun bids fond farewell to wilma","story":"CRAIGDUN Private Nursing Home in Cullybackey has bid a fond farewell to Wilma Swann who retired recently after  years of dedicated employment.

Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.

The other thing I think is everybody should claim this £.“At leastyou get the £ it does get spent and it gets spent in the local shops and that’s going to be a short-term boost to the economy.“Everyone should claim it to make sure in fact it doesn’t go back into the coffers and get spent on something .”Mr Roberts from Retail NI argued the scheme was about “securing jobs within small businesses”.He said the main point of the scheme was aimed at spending with local retailers but said there were options available for those who wished to use it to help others.“In terms of options consumers have to spend it on, they can spend it in a charity shop, they can buy a gt and donate it to a charity shop,” he said.“They could buy groceries and give it to a food bank. If people want to donate it to charity, they have got a lot of options.“People shouldn’t feel guilty about spending this. I think the take up of this voucher has been very good. I don’t think there is going to be a lot of money left at the end of this.”The discussion on the show was prompted after a caller asked host broadcaster Stephen Nolanhe would be “donating” the money to a “poor person”.Mr Nolan said he applied to the scheme immediately, with the intention of spending the money on his mother.“I have got enough to spend my own money on my mother so that one call yesterday is kind of testing me morally,” he said.“Why am I not spending that money on a kid who will come down on Christmas day and mum and dad are just as decent as the rest of us, but can’t afford to buy that kid a present ”The Department for the Economy has been approached for a comment..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadNI high street voucher: , applications blockedSDLP MLA Cara Hunter: My living hell with brain tumour at Should I call in twice  BBC’s Nolan criticised by ‘Damian from Londonderry’ over Derry policyReunication of Ireland is close, says top economist PosenLeeds United and Everton Belfast fixture as clubs open stores: We’ll be as big as Liverpool, says Whites’ fanTop VideosPlayVideo: Flower pot destroyed and eggs thrown at windows overnight in Belfast Holyland areaPlayVideo: Will Belfast spend the high street voucher wisely PlayVideo: Report into mother-and-baby homes releasedLatest Northern IrelandChristy Manzinga warned to ‘screw the nut’ as players will be on the wind-up after Linfield suspensionFrank Wilson explains why Boys Model  Schools’ Cup ‘utopia’ tops even Ulster and Ireland honoursIreland hopeful it can sign up to global tax deal, says CoveneySimon Coveney: UK ‘not likely’ to trigger Article The north Belfast initiative which is helping women patch up their dferences and form friendshipsLatestScottish scientist jointly wins Nobel Prize in chemistryTensions flare as Chinese military flights near Taiwan intensyChristy Manzinga warned to ‘screw the nut’ as players will be on the wind-up after Linfield suspensionTeenage gang attack victim died from gunshot fired by -year-old, court toldPM outlines £, ‘levelling up premium’ for teachers to work in areas of need,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Concern that phones were broken. Teenagers left alone at university in Belfast uncontactable.Why not just phone them  Sure they never pick up the phone these days. The art of talking is consigned to the s.Dr Sandra Scott-Hayward, a senior lecturer in Queen’s University’s Institute of Electronics, Communications and Information Technology, said the six-hour breakdown was a timely reminder of how vital to our lives internet services have become and how fragile they can be.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDr Sandra Scott-Hayward, senior lecturer at Queen#s University#s Institute of Electronics, Communications  Information Technology FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueDr Sandra Scott-Hayward, senior lecturer at Queen#s University#s Institute of Electronics, Communications  Information Technology“The Facebook outage gives personal and business users of these services an insight into our reliance on communication networks for all aspects of our day-to-day lives,” she said. “Most of the time, we’re oblivious to the background operation of Internet services.“Yesterday, the complexity of running global scale networks was brought to our attention with a “faulty configuration change” effectively disconnecting end users from the Facebook systems. This incident will raise questions for many organisations, not just Facebook.”For a brief moment in time, we were thrust into history. Perhaps  years from now, we’ll be watching a streaming service documentary, a television company making one of those back-in-time programmes. Living in the s. No social media. How did we all cope Perhaps, once a year, we should have an enforced social media holiday. A bank holiday style arrangement where the networks cease for  hours, a little reminder of what’s important in le. A little social contact for real, a visit to a friend for a chat and a coffee, a switch off from the bombardment of bullies, opinions and what other people had for dinner at that posh restaurant we can’t afford to go to.The business community might not agree. Millions of pounds could be lost, such has the importance of social media become.There seems no happy medium in the social media world. Either people cry out for help, or hit us with all that’s good in their lives, making us feel ever so slightly inadequate in our own existence.Perhaps, away from that quagmire, we can simply be content with our own lives for a bit  The reliance on internet facilities, though, means the days of a simpler live those of a certain age remember are no longer with us for more than the time it takes for the technical boffins to find a fix for a system failure,You can bet the first thing most teenagers did was go on to Twitter to complain about Facebook and WhatsApp not working, stare pleadingly at phone screens, tap the screen to seethat helped and try the old favourite, switch off and on to seethat helped. But maybe a step back into real le was the way to go to see how that fitted  Here’s five things we could have done.... Put the phone down and read a book instead.... Took a breath, relaxed and enjoyed the moments of freedom. Gone out, met a friend, or at least made a phone call rather than sending a message. It’s good to talk! Maybe even a newspaper!. Teenagers could have appeared from the undergrowth, back out in the open, away from the lairs of their rooms. Likely coming down the stairs to complain their phone wasn’t working, but at least there could have been interaction.. Offered to make someone a consoling cup of tea.

In circumstances like this, cash is king, but when you continue to stockpile cash long after you’ve reached your emergency fund number, that’s when it begins to hurt you financially.Excess savings sitting in accounts earning negative s mean the purchasing power of those savings are going down in value, and whilst that may not hurt your finances much in the short term, it’s the opportunity lost in not investing in accounts that are producing much better s that will.The opportunity cost for one client of mine who had €, sitting in a deposit account, that had no reason to be there, was €, over just one year.         I had a zoom call with her back in February and she told me she had savings of c. €, sitting in a deposit account earning .%. But when you factor in DIRT tax and inflation, her actualwas -.%.Anyway, she knew she was cash heavy, but was unsure how much of the €, she should ide up and what number should be assigned to her emergency fund and what could be set aside for investment and so on.So, what I suggested to her was very similar to what is primarily used when it comes to pension planning in retirement, and it’s known as The Bucket Strategy. I thought the concept is such a great one, it should be adapted and used when it comes to iding up the amounts people have accumulated in cash.The solution is iding up the amount you have in savings into three dferent accounts, and the amount you deposit into each account is based on:n When you need the moneyn How long you want it to last for, andn How much you need or can set asideWhen we applied this logic, the strategy for her looked something like this:Bucket Number  – Emergency FundAccount Type: CashRisk: ZeroPurpose: Covers emergency expenses for  monthsOptimum Balance in Account: €,We looked at what deficit would existthere was a loss of income, and we focused on the cost of funding those priority expenses that must be covered and paid. And we discovered that monthly cost was €,.We were happy that having  months of those expenses in an account dedicated for this eventuality was enough.So, she set up a separate account, called it her emergency fund and transferred €, into it. Next up was,Bucket Number  – Short Medium Term ExpensesAccount Type: Cash Fixed TermRisk: ZeroPurpose: Known, once off expenses, incurred in the next   monthsOptimum Balance in Account: €,This is an account you set funds aside for large once off expenses you know you’re going to incur in the next  months.The women I met was planning on changing her car next year and whilst she didn’t know exactly what car she was going to buy, €, was a good number to ring fence from her savings.But rather than leaving this amount sitting in a deposit account, she moved it to a fixed notice account for  months, earning .%. It’s still a terriblebut at least it was  times better than leaving it where it was.Bucket Number  – InvestmentAccount Type: EquityRisk: MediumPurpose: Make money beat inflationOptimum Balance in Account: €,Now more than ever, you need to be invested in equity-based accounts, you just have to.We set up this type of account up for the woman I met back in February where she deposited €, into it. And theon the account since then, has been +.%. The same account had s of +.% over  year and +.% over  years.Contrast them to the .% she was making by holding excess savings in cash.It meant her €, was going down in value by € every year.But had she set aside €, a year ago in an equity account, it would have gone up by €,.And eventhe equity s dropped in value by c. % from what they made last year, they’d still be % more than what she’d getshe left her money languishing in a deposit account.Whatever way you want to present it, the dference is staggering, and the reason I said from the outset, why holding too much cash is bad for your finances.One of the long-term financial effects, Covid could leave on people, is a fear that something like this could happen again, so people begin to hoard money and whilst there isn’t anything wrong with that, it’s where they leave this money accrue that’s the problem. And that’s in cash accounts that are earning nothing. Let me repeat again, those accounts are fine for your emergency fund, but once you’ve past that amount, you really need to consider other accounts that will yield higher s.And perhaps not everyone will have enough in savings to fill three buckets.They may not have enough to fill even one, and that’s okay as well becauseyou follow this very simple strategy, it will prevent you from using money that’s being invested but should really be assigned to your emergency fund or leaving money in an emergency fund that should be set aside for investment.So, you really need to know your numbers and the dficulty I find with people, is that they have one, maybe two accounts and the amount they’ve accumulated is used for everything i.e. emergency fund, investment and once off expenses.And this is one of the reasons people are not optimising their finances. They may have spare cash that could be used towards investment, but it’s getting lumped in with emergency funds and once off expenses and it stays there and earns nothing.Having a dedicated amount for specic purposes makes things much easier because you know, you have the optimum amount in place for each purpose and you know you’re not affecting other areas, either.And using the Bucket Strategy will help. It’s not time consuming to set up, but I assure you, it will be time well spent.Liam Croke is MD of Harmonics Financial Ltd, based in Plassey.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny.     The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the Hope Centre at Cornerstone City Church is Hope Centre team members Ryan Murphy and John Loughury along with Deputy Mayor, Cllr Christopher Jackson.Derry NewsDerry church launches new service in bid to tackle poverty overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick McEleney and Michael Duffy will play at Derry City next season.SportDerry City have signed the best player in Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  David Burkes book reveals how those detained by the army after Bloody Sunday were subjected to beatings from paratroopers Local NewsJust you wait, you pig, we’re going to kick you to death overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A whistleblower on Bloody Sunday was intimidated prior to testying at the Saville InquiryLocal NewsBloody Sunday whistleblower lucky to escape with warning overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsConsultation to be opened on County Derry Park and Ride overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Inspirational: Vicky Phelan National NewsVicky Phelan thanks public for their prayers and positive messages in heartbreaking post overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  David Burkes book, Kitsons Irish War tells of how General Kitsons approach to Ireland culminated into the massacre that took place in Derry on Bloody SundayLocal NewsThe wrong man in the wrong place at the wrong time overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia WATCH: New trailer for Game of Thrones prequel releasedWhats OnWATCH: New trailer for Game of Thrones prequel released overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Reporter: Michael McMullan Oct   addthis, In this weekends intermediate championship schedule, its all about getting eight teams down to four ahead of the quarter-finals later this month. Limavady v BallymaguiganThursday- OwenbegReferee: Kieran OConnor The first game of this this weekends action is a repeat of last years clash at the same stage when Limavady were convincing winners to knock Ballymaguigan out of the championship.When the sides met in last months group stages, it was a gripping contest won by Sheagh McLaughlins late thunderbolt to the top corner of the Quigan net, as a Cormac Quigley inspired Limavady came out winners again.Ballymaguigan lost out to Lissan and played second fiddle to Steelstowns blue wave in their final game.Daniel Bradley should be back this weekend after missing the game with illness.Michael Spiers made himself an outlet in attack and Shea Bradley battled well at midfield, but they will need another big performance this week.Limavady should have Oran Hartin back between the posts this weekend after John Deighans cameo in the last round. Karl Diamond and Fabian Muldoon will hope that Conor Boyd is fully fit to start after his substitute appearance against Lissan. His bravery, use of the ball and positional sense will bring stability to their defence. Not to mention his experience.Theyll have to keep an eye on Paudie Martin in attack after his three goals in as many games. It will be interesting to seeCiaran McIvor and Darren Conway are included from the start, or kept in reserve for when the game opens up.Limavady won the sweeper battle, with Kieran McGlinchey imposing himself on their counter-attacking game, with Tomaacutes Brady overworked and being the third marker Cormac Quigley went through on the night.Thursday will be about whoever can make the wide open spaces their friend and the Wolfhounds may be better equipped and their goal threat could see them into the last eight.VERDICT: Limavady googletag.cmd.push Glenullin v SlaughtmanusFriday- Celtic ParkReferee: Gregory McWilliams Glenullins inconsistent season arrives at the final fork in the road on Friday night at Owenbeg as Liam Bradleys side put their championship cards of the table. There are no more chances. This is championship as we know it and standing in their way is a Slaughtmanus side they defeatedfive weeks ago in the group stages.The Glens narrow defeat at the hands of Castledawson was followed by a disappointing performance at Faughanvale, a game they never got to grips with.In the absence of Eoin Bradley, their young guns of Fearghal Close and Michael Oacuteg McKeown asked a lot of Castledawsons defence, with Neil McNicholl also a welcome . They will be without Skinner who will be on duty with Coleraine.The Glen have found an excellent keeper in Sean McKinney, behind a defence backboned by the OKanes. Ronan Close, Traglach Bradley and Brian Mullan will provide their midfield spine.Slaughtmanus could again be without Conor McGee, Gavin McShane and Eoghan Cassidy, but the have still been able to create chances. All they need is a day when their threat clicks and the net is bulging rather than another day of regrets and head scratching. Their clash with the Vale wouldve been oh so dferent had they taken even one of their goal chances when they trailed - to -.Goalkeeper Conor Thornton has , but theyll nee to maximise their output from Caolan Hargan and Killian Thornton up front, with Kyle Gallagher pulling the pieces together.A tight game in prospect, with Bakers side to come through.VERDICT: Glenullin Lissan v GlackSaturday– GlenReferee: Dan Mullan Two years ago, Glack were in flying form on their way to the junior title, but have since lost their mojo and have trudged their way though the season in Division .Lissan, while playing in a higher ision, failed to win a game, but they gave plenty of teams trouble. Their one-point defeat early in the season to eventual champions Drumsurn showed the promise they have.Former Derry minor captain Iarlaith Donaghy has been their consisitent cog all season and he kicked four points in their defeat at the hands of Limavady.They will take confidence from their win over Ballymaguigan into Saturdays trip to Glen.Glack have good performances from Ryan OKane, Martin McGonigle, Ryan Morgan and Adam OKane for much of the season. Adrian McGilligans side had the league win over Ballerin, in which they denied the Sarsfields the title, as a sign of they can do. But with too much reliance on Niall McGOwan for scores, it leaves Lissan with a target – stop him and they could repeat their  season and nip a spot in the Quarter-FinalsVERDICT: Lissan     Castledawson v Doire TrasnaSaturday– DungivenReferee: TBCA team we know much about and will be contenders for the biggest prize on offer next month against Doire Trasna who havent got going. Literally.Their two concessions against Greenlough and Drumsurn raised a few eyebrows across the county. Covid, players away at college and injuries combined into their reasoning for not fielding. It leaves them totally undercooked for a game theyd have been facing an uphill battle with even their full compliment of players.Eoghan Quigg, Micheaacutel McNaught and Colin Murray have been their key men in attack in recent times, with Tomaacutes McCrossan their anchor in defence and Paul Quigley at midfield.In recent times their management duo have had to get the boots on and their lack of collective training doesnt bode well ahead or Saturdays encounter.Dawson manager Niall Jackman admits to using the league to blood new players, with the view of drawing up a side later in the season. Players like Niall Rafferty in their defence. And that time is now.They can count themselves unlucky not to get something out of their group game against the Vale at home and they dug deep to see off Glenullin.Theof Niall Keenan has been a welcome addition and Niall McNicholl is in the form of his le, having got himself into great nick. Jackman will have to guard against complacency, but its hard to make a case for anything other than a Castledawson win.

Their one-point defeat early in the season to eventual champions Drumsurn showed the promise they have.Former Derry minor captain Iarlaith Donaghy has been their consisitent cog all season and he kicked four points in their defeat at the hands of Limavady.They will take confidence from their win over Ballymaguigan into Saturdays trip to Glen.Glack have good performances from Ryan OKane, Martin McGonigle, Ryan Morgan and Adam OKane for much of the season. Adrian McGilligans side had the league win over Ballerin, in which they denied the Sarsfields the title, as a sign of they can do. But with too much reliance on Niall McGOwan for scores, it leaves Lissan with a target – stop him and they could repeat their  season and nip a spot in the Quarter-FinalsVERDICT: Lissan     Castledawson v Doire TrasnaSaturday– DungivenReferee: TBCA team we know much about and will be contenders for the biggest prize on offer next month against Doire Trasna who havent got going. Literally.Their two concessions against Greenlough and Drumsurn raised a few eyebrows across the county. Covid, players away at college and injuries combined into their reasoning for not fielding. It leaves them totally undercooked for a game theyd have been facing an uphill battle with even their full compliment of players.Eoghan Quigg, Micheaacutel McNaught and Colin Murray have been their key men in attack in recent times, with Tomaacutes McCrossan their anchor in defence and Paul Quigley at midfield.In recent times their management duo have had to get the boots on and their lack of collective training doesnt bode well ahead or Saturdays encounter.Dawson manager Niall Jackman admits to using the league to blood new players, with the view of drawing up a side later in the season. Players like Niall Rafferty in their defence. And that time is now.They can count themselves unlucky not to get something out of their group game against the Vale at home and they dug deep to see off Glenullin.Theof Niall Keenan has been a welcome addition and Niall McNicholl is in the form of his le, having got himself into great nick. Jackman will have to guard against complacency, but its hard to make a case for anything other than a Castledawson win.

The financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here are two examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available. googletag.cmd.push NORTHERN IRELAND IN NUMBERS , jobs furloughed through the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme up to May  , claims amounting to pound million through the Self- Employment Income Support Scheme up to May  Across the whole UK  per cent of those eligible for SEISS made a claim. The average value of a claim is pound, Source: Her Majesty’s Treasury CASE STUDY  SHNUGGLE  Planning, forward-thinking and invaluable help from the UK Government has enabled a Northern Ireland firm to ersy and remain solvent. When Covid- struck, Newtownards baby product manufacturer Shnuggle’s owners Sinead and Adam Murphy were prepared thanks to advice from their export colleagues in China. Sinead said: “We reduced our out-goings, put on pause our marketing spend in the business. We just tried to protect the cash that we had. “The first impact was our customers that we sell to in Asia. They all went into lockdown so our orders and sales to them stopped. But also a lot of our production happens out in Asia so our factories went into lockdown. “Luckily we had bought a lot of stock beforehand. We were so relieved that we had, at least we could carry on trading with our UK and European customers.” With around half of the company’s sales in the UK and Ireland and half in the export business, Shnuggle had to rely on their local retail-base. Sinead continued: “Baby items were classed as essential goods which was a huge relief to us. This meant as long as we could socially distance within the warehouse we could continue trading and selling online. All of our business is supplying other retailers like John Lewis, Mamas and Papas, Amazon. But our online sales actually grew because everyone was at home and maybe an element of panic buying.”      CASH HELP: The Shnuggle team Shnuggle took advantage of the furlough and Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Schemeschemes. Sinead said: “We furloughed five out of our  team, and were able to access the Business Interruption loan through Ulster Bank. “We were relieved to get the money in quickly, so we weren’t worrying about paying wages or our biggest overhead was our suppliers in China who were calling in all of their debts. “That was our biggest headache and stress, we owed signicant amounts of money to them and we didn’t have the cash as we needed time to sell our products.” Shnuggle also received a pound, Small Business Grant. Adam said: “Furloughing was brilliant, and the CBILS was the one that was the best for us because it meant that we could keep all our suppliers happy. “So even though we had a temporary dip in our sales, and obviously the inventory was sitting there ready to sell, it just kept us solvent and the cash flow moving. It’s really going to help us trade out of it, andall goes well, we should be able to get back into a reasonably strong cash position within the next six to  months. The loans coming in helped us to sleep at night.” The Government schemes also gave Sinead and Adam the freedom to ersy into the PPE market and the development of HeroShield Ltd, enabling local firms to unite to develop a protective face covering for key workers. This non-profit company designs, produces and distributes reusable visors.   ‘It’s surprisingly easy and money arrives quickly’ CASE STUDY  Q-MASS An unprecedented package of UK Government financial support has helped firms like Q-Mass in East Kilbride weather the coronavirus crisis. Director Ronnie Robertson said lockdown hit his company’s order book, but the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been vital to help them hang on to their valued staff. Ronnie said: “Before this, we had quite a good order book, with three to four months of work planned, so we were pretty worried where it was going to take us.” At first, he was worried how he would keep Q-Mass’  staff on the payroll, but then the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was announced. It offers UK Government support to pay  per cent of staff’s wages up to pound, a month, and the scheme has now been extended until the end of October. Q-Mass manufactures bespoke parts for the oil, gas and defence industry so staff training is important. Ronnie said: “Our staff are very highly skilled. We’ve gathered a bunch of people here and trained them up and taken on apprentices. We do a lot of training, we’ve got good people, we train them a lot and we want to hang on to them.” He found applying for the furlough scheme quick and straightforward. He said: “It was surprisingly easy and we were surprised that the money came through relatively quickly.” Now staff at the firm who’ve been furloughed are gradually ing to work, with strict safety measures in place. Ronnie said: “We’ve put a day sht back on and we’ve still got a few office people working at home, with quite a few still on furlough.  ‘SURPRISINGLY EASY’: Q-Mass director Ronnie Robertson praises the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme “We’re just ticking over. We’re trying to cover our costs every month, trying to break even, to stay still. We’re looking at it thatwe can stay still we’re doing very well.” And because of the size of the building, maintaining a two-metre distance hasn’t been a problem for ing staff. Ronnie said: “It’s been really easy. We’ve got a big workshop with wide corridors and we’ve got a lot of the doors propped open internally so no-one has to touch doors or handles. We’ve got a few toilet areas with restrictions on them and a couple of one-way corridors, but the offices are open plan, so there’s no real need for people to be near each other. The workshop’s a big, wide-open space and we have to keep cleaning things like photocopiers and touch screens, but it’s been quite straightforward.” Now Ronnie’s looking forward to a brighter future. He said: “I feel like we’re on the side of the valley and we’re looking across to the other side and it looks absolutely fantastic.” Money for business and staff Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers. middot The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has enabled businesses to put employees on a period of temporary leaveand apply for a UK Government grant to cover  per cent of those workers’ usual monthly wage costs, up to pound, a month. middot The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme will allow eligible self-employed iniduals to claim a taxable grant of  per cent of their average monthly profits, up to pound,. middot UK VAT-registered firms have been given the option to defer VAT payments until the end of June.

In it, Burke accuses Kitson of the following: “Had he set out to become a recruitment sergeant for the IRA, he could not have done a better job”. googletag.cmd.push A cynic might say that such an accusation can only be made in hindsight but voices at the time during the early s were saying it as well. One such voice was Stormont Parliament MP, Paddy Devlin of the SDLP, who wrote that Kitson “did more than any other inidual to sour relations between the Catholic community and the security forces”. Burkes book reveals how the tragic events of Bloody Sunday was not a case, of a few troops being out of control but the culmination of a number of poor, ill-formed decisions that had its roots in the British armys counter-insurgency techniques employed in their then-colonies of Malaya, Kenya and Aden. Such techniques also involved many incidences of torture used by the army – something that would visit Derry and the rest of the north of Ireland when Kitson arrived. The Savile Report of  vindicated the victims and those attending the Civil Rights march on that fateful Sunday in  but neither General Kitson or his elite troops were held accountable. Burke, a Dublin-based barrister who is also the son of Richard Burke – the Education Minister in Liam Cosgraves Fine Gael government, attempts to set the record straight regarding Kitsons involvement and how his tactics during his time in the north of Ireland spiralled into the murder of  civil rights marchers in Derry.     “I tried to write the book in a way thats not overly academic,” said Burke, but there are footnotes there to show my research and to back up what has been written. “It wasnt written for an audience who had not known anything previously about the subject matter but for people who are interested in what happened in the north in  and . “I wrote a book last year, which was called Deception and Lies: The Hidden History of the  Arms Crisis, One of the themes of that book was why The Troubles started. “In that I pointed out that in the mid-s, the IRA had all but laid down their guns. There was a rapprochement opportunity between the government in the Republic of Ireland and the Stormont Government in the North. “That had sparked militant responses from people like Ian Paisley and they had turned up the heat and they had created by  violence and inter-communal fighting. “In that context this book is a continuation of the previous one in that it looks as why did it go wrong, why did you have a situation where British soldiers came and they did a fantastic, really honourable job and they were rightly and correctly welcomed with cups of tea and sandwiches during the so-called honeymoon period. “You can imagine back in  being an  to -year-old soldier and being invited in on Christmas Day to join families. There was a good relationship there. “So this book looks at why all that went wrong. I quote Paddy Devlin in it where hes critical of the IRA – the Provisionals in particular – for turning up the heat. Then there was the rioting which was unfortunately part of the deterioration. And then there was the change of government . “One other factor was the arrived of Kitson and Kitsons career in the colonies had always been about counter-insurgency. He was, as I say in the book, the wrong man in the wrong place at the wrong time. “In fairness to him, he did try the hearts and minds approach at first but then the Provisional IRA didnt want that co-operation. So very quickly, Kitson reverts to his counter-insurgency technique. Documents from  show that they took the decision to take the war to the IRA. They decided not to try to suppress the violence of the Loyalists – later on, of course, there is collusion with those groups. “All of this is aggrevated by the Ballymurphy Massacre and then of course, Bloody Sunday. My conclusion is that Kitsons heavy-handed tactics and the heavy-handed behaviour of the paratroopers in particular, played into the hands of the IRA.” One such tactic was for Kitson and his staff to rely heavily on accounts given by so-called men-on-the-ground who came off as being in the know but turned out to be fantasists. Observer B was an agent of both British Military Intelligence and MI who had access to the no-go area of Derry back in . This character continually fabricated information that he constantly fed to his handlers – one included the report of an imaginary IRA battalion supposedly conducting a paramilitary drill in practice for a big operation on January , , the day of the Civil Rights march that was brutally ended by Bloody Sunday. Burke continued: “When I looked at Bloody Sunday, it was like being given the parts of a watch and having to put it altogether. I came to the only conclusion I could come to in that Observer Bs information was kept within a very tight circle and it wasnt tested. “Had it been given to the likes of RUC InspectorLagan then maybe he might have been able to point out the inaccuracies of some of Observer Bs ridiculous claims. “But this information from Observer B was going through his handlers who dont know what Derrys like and dont understand it and hes their source of information as theyre not relying on anyone . Its from there a catastrophe begins to unfold and becomes understandable.” The Saville Report has been presented as the final denouement on what happened on Bloody Sunday but Burke says questions still remain to be answered. He added: “Their activities have been hidden from the ordinary person in Britain. Theres a darkness in Whitehall which has a knee-jerk reaction, every time when something like this happens, to cover it up. “Im a barrister and I know thatSaville is entitled to come to the conclusion that the soldiers were out of control. I respectfully disagree with him. I think theres another interpretation of it. “The book points out that there is something much more deeper going on here.” “Kitsons Irish War: Mastermind Of The Dirty War In Ireland” by David Bourke is published by Mercier Press and is out now.

The motion was tabled by Cllr Shaun Harkinwho said that current legislation does not protect all workers who need compassionate leave for a bereavement with some having no guarantee at all of receiving paid leave. googletag.cmd.push Cllr Harkins motion also called for the Council itself to review its own bereavement policy which Councillors voted to undertake. In addressing Council, Cllr Harkin said: “Im calling on this weeks Derry and Strabane Council full meeting to back the Coalition for Bereaved Workers demand and to also incorporate this right to all Council workers. “Currently, Stormonts bereavement policies are harsh. As it stands, there is no automatic guarantee for anyone bereaved of a child, a partner or family member to paid leave. “Its welcome that Stormont is moving towards implementing legislation guaranteeing parents at least two weeks statutory paid leave during this very dficult time. “However, new legislation can and should go further. The Coalition for Bereaved Workers is urging for legislation to be extended to include two weeks paid leave for all people suffering the loss of a partner or family member. “The Coalition for Bereaved Workers is coordinated by the Marie Curie charity and members include Action Mental Health, Alzheimers Society, Carers NI, CIPD , Cruse Bereavement Care, NIPSA and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. The Executive shouldnt ignore this powerful coalition of voices.     “Stormont needs to update archaic workers rights legislation to make sure all everyone dealing with bereavement be afforded time to grieve without fear of losing their job or income.” After Councillors had voted for the motion to be passed, Cllr Harkin welcomed the result saying: “I was glad to be able to bring a motion to Council supporting the Coalition for Bereaved Workers demand for at least two weeks statutory leave and pay anyone faced with the loss of partner or family. “The Council unanimously backed the motion calling on Stormont to extend bereavement legislation currently under consideration. “Our Council can also lead on this important issue by implementing humane bereavement policies for our workforce. “Stormonts employment laws are outdated and need a complete overhaul. “Incorporating bereavement leave and pay into legislation can be a step towards creating a more caring society. “I want to commend the efforts of all the groups in the Coalition for Bereaved Workers and everyone who has campaigned for bereavement leave and pay to be put into legislation.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the Hope Centre at Cornerstone City Church is Hope Centre team members Ryan Murphy and John Loughury along with Deputy Mayor, Cllr Christopher Jackson.Derry NewsDerry church launches new service in bid to tackle poverty overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick McEleney and Michael Duffy will play at Derry City next season.SportDerry City have signed the best player in Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  David Burkes book reveals how those detained by the army after Bloody Sunday were subjected to beatings from paratroopers Local NewsJust you wait, you pig, we’re going to kick you to death overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A whistleblower on Bloody Sunday was intimidated prior to testying at the Saville InquiryLocal NewsBloody Sunday whistleblower lucky to escape with warning overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsConsultation to be opened on County Derry Park and Ride overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Inspirational: Vicky Phelan National NewsVicky Phelan thanks public for their prayers and positive messages in heartbreaking post overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  David Burkes book, Kitsons Irish War tells of how General Kitsons approach to Ireland culminated into the massacre that took place in Derry on Bloody SundayLocal NewsThe wrong man in the wrong place at the wrong time overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia WATCH: New trailer for Game of Thrones prequel releasedWhats OnWATCH: New trailer for Game of Thrones prequel released overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Concern has been growing with the build-up of motor vehicles in the area – especially on Marlborough Terrace, Beechwood Avenue and Laburnum Terrace. Cllr Logue, who represents The Moor ward, says the issue with traffic cannot continue and urged the Department to find a workable solution. googletag.cmd.push She said: “I felt it was important to have this onsite meeting with the Department for Infrastructure to highlight a number of road traffic issues affecting the area. “I have been receiving complaints about the constant gridlock of traffic at peak times of the day on Marlborough Terrace, Beechwood Avenue and Laburnum Terrace, with a particular problem for vehicles exiting and entering the junction at the bottom of Beechwood Avenue. “This is also causing problems for residents being able to park outside their homes, as well as air pollution. After lobbying we got a KEEP CLEAR box installed at the junction back in  but the problem continues. “Just this week residents have once again raised the issue of the introduction of a one-way system around Westland Avenue and Westland Terrace. “It must be nearly two years since a consultation process took place and local people again are asking for something to be done. “Like the residents just around the corner, they are faced with traffic gridlock throughout the day and trying to exit out onto Westland Street. “I have appealed to the Department for Infrastructure to try and find a workable solution to these issues.”     ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the Hope Centre at Cornerstone City Church is Hope Centre team members Ryan Murphy and John Loughury along with Deputy Mayor, Cllr Christopher Jackson.Derry NewsDerry church launches new service in bid to tackle poverty overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick McEleney and Michael Duffy will play at Derry City next season.SportDerry City have signed the best player in Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  David Burkes book reveals how those detained by the army after Bloody Sunday were subjected to beatings from paratroopers Local NewsJust you wait, you pig, we’re going to kick you to death overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A whistleblower on Bloody Sunday was intimidated prior to testying at the Saville InquiryLocal NewsBloody Sunday whistleblower lucky to escape with warning overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsConsultation to be opened on County Derry Park and Ride overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Inspirational: Vicky Phelan National NewsVicky Phelan thanks public for their prayers and positive messages in heartbreaking post overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  David Burkes book, Kitsons Irish War tells of how General Kitsons approach to Ireland culminated into the massacre that took place in Derry on Bloody SundayLocal NewsThe wrong man in the wrong place at the wrong time overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia WATCH: New trailer for Game of Thrones prequel releasedWhats OnWATCH: New trailer for Game of Thrones prequel released overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Draperstown Rural College was opened almost  years ago by then Minister for Agriculture and the Economy in Northern Ireland, Baroness Denton of Wakefield. googletag.cmd.push The th century manor house at Derrynoid Lodge had been repurposed as a centre for corporate events including conferences, seminars, presentations, training, team building and conventions.  A gym, library and IT suite were also available on site, as well as accommodation, as the facility was launched with Department of Agriculture and International Fund for Irelandfunding in . The building has been dormant since its sudden closure in March , with this year marking the th year of a -year lease taken by current tenants Workspace Ltd. Strangford MLA Kellie Armstrong tabled a question on September  to Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots, asking why the site was not being used, and how much money was being spent on its upkeep. Alliance MLA for Strangford, Kellie Armstrong. A Department response on September  indicated they took no responsibility for costs relating to the former Rural College. “The buildings you refer to at Derrynoid forest near Draperstown are the subject of a  year lease with Workspace Ltd which commenced in ,” they said. “Under this lease the buildings were in use as a Rural College until its closure in .     “The buildings have been vacant since , and from then Workspace has explored numerous options to secure a future use for the buildings. “Despite their best efforts, to date this has proved to be unsuccessful. “While the current lease with Workspace Ltd remains in place, they continue to have full responsibility, in line with the lease obligations, for all ongoing costs associated with the buildings.” The buildings interior is currently fenced off since its closure in . When contacted by the County Derry Post, Ms Armstrong said she was astounded that the building was not in use. “My question to the Department sought to clary the situation. The Department has confirmed the buildings are indeed sitting empty.” she said. “I am aware of many rural businesses, community organisations and interim asylum accommodation needs that this space could provide. “I am very disappointed such a great venue is sitting not being used and there appears to be no plans by DAERA or the current leaseholder to utilise the resource.” The premises were opened in  by Baroness Denton of Wakefield. A number of attempts have been made by Workspace Ltd to find a licensee or operator for the premises since its closure a decade ago. An open day event was held in February , which the social enterprises website says was attended by hundreds, but no serious interest was forthcoming. Further attempts to find an occupant for the building were also made. In September , a Business Opportunity document again sought a licensee or operator. It outlined facilities available in Derrynoid, including  en-suite bedrooms in accommodation blocks, a multimedia centre, eight fully equipped training rooms and a small leisure suite. A restaurant and five offices were also detailed in the document, which suggests accommodation, conference facilities, healthcare, outdoor activity and commercial uses would be available. An aerial shot of the site in Derrynoid Forest. Mid Ulster MLA Emma Sheerin said any plans to repurpose the centre needed to be sustainable. “The rural college site is maintained by Workspace and all costs are managed by them,” she said. “I know that work is ongoing around plans for a purpose for the centre, and of course these have to be sustainable so that this resource is used in a way that maximises its potential. “We support Workspace in their efforts and hope to see the Rural College being used again in the near future.” The County Derry Post contacted Workspace Ltd for comment on the future of the premises and the associated costs, but no response was available at the time of going to press.

Ballymoney-based Dowds Group are organising a K run and walk in memory of their late colleague, Gary McSorley. The dad-of-two, who lived in Gortnaghey, passed away on April  following a battle with lung cancer. googletag.cmd.push The K run and walk will take place on Saturday, October  in Garvagh Forest and is open to people of all ages. Aideen McMichael, of Dowds Group, said the company wanted to pay tribute to Gary, an experienced electrician, who she described as a real character who is sorely missed by all. “In his memory we have started a fundraising campaign and his we and two daughters have nominated the ‘Cancer Fund for Children’ as their chosen charity. Cancer Fund for Children offer support to children and young people diagnosed with cancer, or living with a parent diagnosed with cancer, whether in their home, community, on the hospital ward or at their residential centre, so that no family has to face cancer alone,” said Aideen. “Family was very important to Gary and we would like to raise as much money as possible to ensure that other families going through cancer can avail of the support and care they need.” Gerry McCrystal was one of Garys close colleagues and friends at Dowds Group and he has encouraged everyone to support the event. “Gary was a dedicated worker and a very close work mate to many of us working on sites. He never failed to complete any task he was asked to do and he always treated everyone on the site in the same way,” said Gerry. “I first got to know Gary when he was working on an electrical job in Monaghan and a few years later Dowds Group were starting to put in place the electrical installation at the new Omagh hospital complex.     Material was arriving to site on fully-laden forty foot long lorries and I asked Paul Molloy for someone to help put all the material into containers for storage. Paul said leave it with me, I know the man for the job. The next morning, help arrived in the form of Gary himself and he did not stop until he had the containers packed tight. Gary also helped out in stores at busy times as well as keeping material cleared up on site.” Following a stint working in Scotland and London for Dowds, Gary ed to the North to work at the beginning of . Gerry said he travelled to Belfast by bus every morning to work on the new Ulster University building. Gerry fondly recalls their walks back to the Europa bus depot every evening. “In the evening time we had to walk  minutes to the bus station to get home again. Sometimes we would be walking up through the city and Id look around and there was Gary stopped to chat to or have banter with someone he knew. “One evening we were walking up Royal Avenue and Gary says hows Jimmy to a guy standing looking up at the front of a building. He then said to me do you know that boy  I looked behind us and said I didnt know the chap only to be told by Gary thats Jimmy Nesbitt,” laughed Gerry. On Saturday, partipants are asked to assemble at Garvagh Forest at am for .am start. Registration costs pound per adult, pound per childwhile under fives go free. Goodie bags will be available for the children afterwards. Limited parking will be available at the entry to the forest but free parking is available at the nearby Bridge Street car park. All proceeds from the event will go to Northern Ireland Cancer Fund for Children and a donation will be made to Garys family.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the Hope Centre at Cornerstone City Church is Hope Centre team members Ryan Murphy and John Loughury along with Deputy Mayor, Cllr Christopher Jackson.Derry NewsDerry church launches new service in bid to tackle poverty overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick McEleney and Michael Duffy will play at Derry City next season.SportDerry City have signed the best player in Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  David Burkes book reveals how those detained by the army after Bloody Sunday were subjected to beatings from paratroopers Local NewsJust you wait, you pig, we’re going to kick you to death overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A whistleblower on Bloody Sunday was intimidated prior to testying at the Saville InquiryLocal NewsBloody Sunday whistleblower lucky to escape with warning overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsConsultation to be opened on County Derry Park and Ride overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Inspirational: Vicky Phelan National NewsVicky Phelan thanks public for their prayers and positive messages in heartbreaking post overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  David Burkes book, Kitsons Irish War tells of how General Kitsons approach to Ireland culminated into the massacre that took place in Derry on Bloody SundayLocal NewsThe wrong man in the wrong place at the wrong time overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia WATCH: New trailer for Game of Thrones prequel releasedWhats OnWATCH: New trailer for Game of Thrones prequel released overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

A report laying out the proposed dates for next years meetings was brought before the Corporate Policy and Resources Committee last week. DUP councillor Aaron Callan proposed the summer recess be extended for July and August, with the exception of the Planning Committee, as in recent years, the agenda had been light. googletag.cmd.push “Given the amount of people who werent at the meetings in August, I was wonderingwe could look at having the recess over August as well,” he said. “A lot of people take holidays in July and August, and Ive noticed this year there was very little business in August. “There wasnt much processed during those meetings and a lot of members were away, so Im wonderingwe should consider extending the recess through August as well.” Sinn Feacuteins Kathleen McGurk Cllr Kathleen McGurk said she would be concerned urgent business may not be dealt withthe recess was extended. “The only concern I would have is thatthere is any urgent business, that would be two months where it couldnt be signed off,” said the Sinn Feacutein representative. “We might need to have some consultation with senior management on whether it would have an impact on urgent business. “Maybe we could have a full council meeting solely for urgent business.” Cllr Darryl Wilson said that although the agenda tended to be light, there should be a minimum of a full council meeting in August.     “Consultation is important here, because we sit in here for a few hours, but the staff have to take the decisions away and work on them for weeks,” he told the Committee. After listening to the debate, Cllr Callan adapted his proposal to have a full council meeting and a Planning Committee meeting in August and the meeting schedule was approved by the Committee.

A report laying out the proposed dates for next years meetings was brought before the Corporate Policy and Resources Committee last week. DUP councillor Aaron Callan proposed the summer recess be extended for July and August, with the exception of the Planning Committee, as in recent years, the agenda had been light. googletag.cmd.push “Given the amount of people who werent at the meetings in August, I was wonderingwe could look at having the recess over August as well,” he said. “A lot of people take holidays in July and August, and Ive noticed this year there was very little business in August. “There wasnt much processed during those meetings and a lot of members were away, so Im wonderingwe should consider extending the recess through August as well.” Sinn Feacuteins Kathleen McGurk Cllr Kathleen McGurk said she would be concerned urgent business may not be dealt withthe recess was extended. “The only concern I would have is thatthere is any urgent business, that would be two months where it couldnt be signed off,” said the Sinn Feacutein representative. “We might need to have some consultation with senior management on whether it would have an impact on urgent business. “Maybe we could have a full council meeting solely for urgent business.” Cllr Darryl Wilson said that although the agenda tended to be light, there should be a minimum of a full council meeting in August.     “Consultation is important here, because we sit in here for a few hours, but the staff have to take the decisions away and work on them for weeks,” he told the Committee. After listening to the debate, Cllr Callan adapted his proposal to have a full council meeting and a Planning Committee meeting in August and the meeting schedule was approved by the Committee.

He said: “I know it sounds cliche that I was always interested in Art, but it’s true. What really interested me and got me thinking about studying Fashion in particular, is the conceptual aspect of collections and the future of fashion, in regard to heightening the human experience. “I never really considered art and design as a viable career path until I finished my A-Levels and started my Foundation Diploma at NWRC. I would massively recommend the course here. Being allowed to dabble in a range of specialisms and work out where my strengths lay was paramount in deciding what I was going to do next. “Ive just recently graduated and Im currently on the hunt for a menswear design role. Interning at McQueen really cemented my love for menswear and aspiration to work in such a fast-paced environment.     “This showcase, I hope, will be the next step on my career ladder and I would love for as many people as possible to show their support and vote.” You can view Conor’s Portfolio and vote for his work here.

He said: “I know it sounds cliche that I was always interested in Art, but it’s true. What really interested me and got me thinking about studying Fashion in particular, is the conceptual aspect of collections and the future of fashion, in regard to heightening the human experience. “I never really considered art and design as a viable career path until I finished my A-Levels and started my Foundation Diploma at NWRC.

Rail lobby group, Into The West, say the site,built, will halt rail expansion from DerryReporter: Matthew Leslie Oct Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, Campaign group, Into The West, have warned it will be game over for rail expansion from Derrythe Clanmil housing development on Victoria Street goes ahead. Earlier this year, Clanmil had successfully appealed the decision by Derry City  Strabane District Council not to grant them permission to build on the Victoria Street site. googletag.cmd.push That green-light to Clanmil came to the dismay of Into The West who saw the prospect of the dry rail line on the site being dug up to make way for the planned new flats thereby putting a spanner in the works of the rail lobby groups hopes of having passenger trains run from Derry to the south and west of Ireland. Steven Bradley met with the Councils Governance  Strategic Planning Committee to discuss rail expansion from Derry. Cllr Sean Mooneyraised the following point to him. He said: “There seems to a pressing matter that could prevent any progress on this is the one of Clanmil and the possible development on the Victoria Road.” He proceeded to ask Mr Bradley: “In your view,that goes ahead and is built, is that game over for any future prospects of a rail review. Because when you look at the map, Derry is the end of the rail line when it comes in from Belfast. How  would you address a rail line going from Derry to Donegal or Strabane ”     Mr Bradley replied: “Personally speaking, I suspect it will . “If you start with the principle of a single, central station for the city – the Waterside – andyou accept that you cant cross north of the river over the Craigavon Bridge, because the space and angles arent there, the only way youre going to get rail south to Tyrone and then west to Donegal, is to pass through the Clanmil site. “So the other options involve putting s over the River Foyle, Bearing in mind that rail is heavy, youll be getting into big engineering solutions that are very costly. The economic viability of doing this will be blown out of the water. “Thats why I cant see it being viableClanmil build their structure. “Weve met with Clanmil and had discussions with the DfI . “Everything is in Clanmils court. The have planning permission to build that structure. They could start work on it tomorrow and nothing could be done to strip them unless the will is there to compulsory purchase it – which isnt there from the DfI and I suspect is not there from the Council either. “What were trying to do is to negotiate a solution whereby one of two alternatives happen. Either Clanmil can re-design their building and leave a strip clear between that building and the river so that rail in the future could run along there. “The second alternative were pushing for is for Clanmil to find an alternative site that they could transfer their ambitions onto and wed be very keen for the Council to assist them in that. “Otherwise I cannot see how youre going to get rail going south from Waterside towards Tyrone, Fermanagh and Donegal without going through that Clanmil site.” Clonmil Housing have been approached for comment. Earlier in the meeting, Mr Bradley outlined the inequalities of the current rail network in Northern Ireland by illustrating how everything appears to be geared in favour towards rail stations east of the River Bann.  How the rail network west and south from Derry might look in the future  He said: “We have fty-four railway stations in Northern Ireland of which only three are west of the River Bann. Belfast in greatly rich in rail provision compared to what we have here. “An all-Ireland map of the rail network never fails to shock. Its like someone took a pair of scissors and cut out the railways of a very important corner of the island – the North West. We are lobbying to see that situation changed. “Theres a very clear east-west disparity in terms of rail provisions. We have a six to fix list and so far only one of those has been fixed – the option to buy a ticket online from Derry that will get you to a station in Dublin without having to buy two separate tickets and having to pay extra for that. “It used to be that every station east of Coleraine could do that but we in Derry couldnt. That was fixed in Spring of last year so were grateful for that. “However, were still in the situation whereby Northern Irelands second biggest city – Derry – has only one train that gets people to Belfast before nine am in the morning. “Whether it be for studying or working, there is only one train – leaving at twelve minutes past six in the morning – that will get you in on time. “Coleraine on the other hand, has four trains that get you to Belfast before nine am. Even Portrush, a seaside villagehas two services that do that – one more than Derry. “When you look at peak hours, between four and six pm, theres a half-hourly service that runs from Belfast all the way to Coleraine and then stops there. We in Derry only have hourly services compared to all stations east of Coleraine. “Another fix is the Saturday night service. If you want to go to a concert or an evening out in Belfast, you have to leave before nine o clock at night because the last train that will get you back to Derry on a Saturday evening leaves at ten past nine. “Which means you will have to leave your dinner table or get out of the gig around half past eight in order to catch the train on time. “However,you lived in Coleraine, your last train back from Belfast leaves at twenty to eleven which is plenty of time to fully enjoy at night out in Belfast. “Sundays are a particular bug-bear. There are only six trains on a Sunday between Derry and Belfast – thats one every two hours. If you miss one, youre snookered and have to wait two hours for the next train. “Whereas every other station from Coleraine and eastwards, has a train going to Belfast every hour and has thirteen services in total. “Theres no rationale to have a dferent quality of service on a Sunday because people still need to go and visit people, still need to go to university in Coleraine, Derry or Belfast and people need to catch flights – all things that are done on a Sunday. “Even with the network we currently have, Derry is very much the second-class relation in terms of rail provision.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the Hope Centre at Cornerstone City Church is Hope Centre team members Ryan Murphy and John Loughury along with Deputy Mayor, Cllr Christopher Jackson.Derry NewsDerry church launches new service in bid to tackle poverty overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick McEleney and Michael Duffy will play at Derry City next season.SportDerry City have signed the best player in Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  David Burkes book reveals how those detained by the army after Bloody Sunday were subjected to beatings from paratroopers Local NewsJust you wait, you pig, we’re going to kick you to death overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A whistleblower on Bloody Sunday was intimidated prior to testying at the Saville InquiryLocal NewsBloody Sunday whistleblower lucky to escape with warning overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsConsultation to be opened on County Derry Park and Ride overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Inspirational: Vicky Phelan National NewsVicky Phelan thanks public for their prayers and positive messages in heartbreaking post overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  David Burkes book, Kitsons Irish War tells of how General Kitsons approach to Ireland culminated into the massacre that took place in Derry on Bloody SundayLocal NewsThe wrong man in the wrong place at the wrong time overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia WATCH: New trailer for Game of Thrones prequel releasedWhats OnWATCH: New trailer for Game of Thrones prequel released overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

If you miss one, youre snookered and have to wait two hours for the next train. “Whereas every other station from Coleraine and eastwards, has a train going to Belfast every hour and has thirteen services in total. “Theres no rationale to have a dferent quality of service on a Sunday because people still need to go and visit people, still need to go to university in Coleraine, Derry or Belfast and people need to catch flights – all things that are done on a Sunday. “Even with the network we currently have, Derry is very much the second-class relation in terms of rail provision.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the Hope Centre at Cornerstone City Church is Hope Centre team members Ryan Murphy and John Loughury along with Deputy Mayor, Cllr Christopher Jackson.Derry NewsDerry church launches new service in bid to tackle poverty overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick McEleney and Michael Duffy will play at Derry City next season.SportDerry City have signed the best player in Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  David Burkes book reveals how those detained by the army after Bloody Sunday were subjected to beatings from paratroopers Local NewsJust you wait, you pig, we’re going to kick you to death overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A whistleblower on Bloody Sunday was intimidated prior to testying at the Saville InquiryLocal NewsBloody Sunday whistleblower lucky to escape with warning overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsConsultation to be opened on County Derry Park and Ride overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Inspirational: Vicky Phelan National NewsVicky Phelan thanks public for their prayers and positive messages in heartbreaking post overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  David Burkes book, Kitsons Irish War tells of how General Kitsons approach to Ireland culminated into the massacre that took place in Derry on Bloody SundayLocal NewsThe wrong man in the wrong place at the wrong time overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia WATCH: New trailer for Game of Thrones prequel releasedWhats OnWATCH: New trailer for Game of Thrones prequel released overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.         Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Additionally, a .-litre e-Hybrid powertrain is available with a choice of bhp or bhp, both of which are mated to a -speed DSG transmission with promised fuel consumption as low as .l km on a combined WLTP driving cycle.There is a choice of two trim levels in CUPRA’s new compact SUV — Formentor and Formentor VZ — with the latter being the Cupra Formentor’s most powerful trim, named in reference to the Spanish word ‘Veloz’, meaning ‘fast’.The Formentor VZ trim offers high-performance powertrain options. Coming with ” alloy wheels, a ” Navigation system, autonomous assistance technology and performance bucket seats as standard.         Test CarMy test car was a Cupra Formentor . TSiDSGwhich was finished in stylish Graphene Grey Premium metallic paint with optional ” Exclusive Aero Black and Copper alloy wheels for an added dose of visual drama. Producing bhp and Nm of torque, the ,cc engine propels the Formentor from a standing start to km h in just .-seconds, on its way to a top speed of km h .Key standard features include full LED headlamps and Daytime Running Lights, rear ‘coast to coast’ light with welcome ceremony, front fog lamps with cornering , heat-insulated and tinted rear windows, leather-wrapped multi- heated sports steering wheel, dark aluminium glossy interior package, textile sport seats, keyless unlocking and ignition system, .” Digital Cockpit, ” Media System with DAB radio, Connect Online infotainment , rain and light sensor, heated front seats, adaptive cruise control, park assist, rear view camera, Drive Profile Selection, and auto high-beam assist, along with a suite of advanced safety systems.Optional extras fitted to my test car included premium metallic paint, black leather bucket seats, ” alloy wheels, hands-free electric tailgate, Dynamic Chassis Control, and Safe  Drive “L” . The sweet-revving petrol engine in my test car produces bhp and Nm of torque, enabling the car to sprint from -km h in .-seconds, with claimed fuel consumption as low as .-l km .As in other VW Group models, the .-litre engine is commendably quick to drop onto two cylinders to save fuel when cruising, and the process of cutting out and back in again is hard to detect. Composed and predictable handling is admirable, as is the Formentor’s ability to soak up road imperfections with ease.Impressive Sporty InteriorTake a seat behind the wheel of the CUPRA Formentor and you could be forgiven for thinking that you are in a hatchback rather than a compact SUV. The seating position is low, as is the base of the windscreen, so you feel like you sit much closer to the road — as you would in a performance-focused car.Selectable driving modes in the Formentor consist of Comfort, Sport, Cupra and Inidual, with each mode bringing a greater degree of aggression and engine noise that gets pumped through the cars speakers.Cabin space in the Formentor is excellent, with adults over six foot tall still able to sit comfortably in the rear seats. You could even sit three abreast thanks to the shallow transmission tunnel. The use of quality materials, with a grainy metal finish in the middle of the fascia, makes the cabin of the Formentor a pleasant and comfortable place to be, while bronze Cupra highlights on the air vents add a sense of occasion to every journey. The boot capacity of -litres in the Formentor . TSI can be expanded by dropping the rear seatbacks, allowing for even greater practicality when called upon.The Formentor scored a full five star rating in its Euro NCAP crash test, thanks in part to standard safety systems such as lane-keep assist, forward collision warning, predictive cruise control and driver alert warning.The new Cupra Formentor offers a more exclusive, contemporary vision of sportiness, which is instilled into an exquisitely sleek and bold design.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.     Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.         Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall.

The news that the Dundalk man has signed a pre-contract agreement with his home town club, after  years away, has been met with great excitement by Derry City fans, with the -year-old agreeing a four-year deal at the Brandywell. googletag.cmd.push Now that excitement is being shared by McEleney, who has also agreed tohome next year, meaning he will reunite with his long-time friend and team mate in red and white. “He’s obviously an amazing player,” he said. “I’ve played with him now for six or seven seasons I think and I know what he’s capable of. It’s an amazing signing for Derry. A lot of credit has to go to Derry and to Ruaidhriand Philipfor getting it over the line. He has been the best probably in the league for two or three years running so hopefully he can continue that form.” The two Derry men have done it all at Dundalk in recent years, but McEleney admits that the two soon-to-be Derry City players have often wondered what it would be like to achieve similar success with the team they grew up with. “We have spoken about it before,” he admitted. “Down there I think we’ve won three league titles and FAI Cups and we’ve been in the Europa League and we’ve always said ‘Imagine doing it for Derry’. I think Mickey has said that it is what he wants to do. “We are Derry men and obviously supporters of the club. I used to go to the Brandywell to watch Derry and I had a season ticket for six years on the run. It won’t be weird, we’re just excited by it and really looking forward to it.”     These are exciting times for Derry City with Ruaidhri Higgins determined to bring success back to the Brandywell, and McEleney is adamant that he wants to be a part of it. “Ruaidhri was a big pull,” he added. “I’ve played long with him and he was my assistant at Dundalk and I know what he’s about. I’m just really looking forward to coming back. Mickey is one of my best mates so we speak about kit all the time and he’s the exact same. We just want to do really well and bring trophies back. We’re not coming up to put our feet up, we’re coming up to win trophies.”  ‘Better team won Meanwhile, City boss Ruaidhri Higgins has admitted that the better team won after watching his team fall to their first defeat in  league games with the - loss at Shamrock Rovers on Friday. City took an early lead through Danny Lafferty, but the champions hit back through goals from lee Grace and Danny Mandriou to claim the three points. “The best team won,” he said. “We got ourselves in front with a really good goal early on, but Rovers got a foothold in the game. We were probably a minute away from getting in at half time and regrouping but they have punished us. “Our players have been brilliant. They have had a lot of praise and pats on the back and rightly so but I think we didn’t reach the levels that we can get to. In key moments in the game we lacked a wee bit of belief and I think we showed naivety and we got punished for it. “We lost our composure and our first pass when we won the ball back let us down. We’ve had a couple of half chances Alan Mannus has made an unbelievable save from Ronan Boyce to stop us going - up, but I can’t have any complaints about the result.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the Hope Centre at Cornerstone City Church is Hope Centre team members Ryan Murphy and John Loughury along with Deputy Mayor, Cllr Christopher Jackson.Derry NewsDerry church launches new service in bid to tackle poverty overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick McEleney and Michael Duffy will play at Derry City next season.SportDerry City have signed the best player in Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  David Burkes book reveals how those detained by the army after Bloody Sunday were subjected to beatings from paratroopers Local NewsJust you wait, you pig, we’re going to kick you to death overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A whistleblower on Bloody Sunday was intimidated prior to testying at the Saville InquiryLocal NewsBloody Sunday whistleblower lucky to escape with warning overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsConsultation to be opened on County Derry Park and Ride overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Inspirational: Vicky Phelan National NewsVicky Phelan thanks public for their prayers and positive messages in heartbreaking post overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  David Burkes book, Kitsons Irish War tells of how General Kitsons approach to Ireland culminated into the massacre that took place in Derry on Bloody SundayLocal NewsThe wrong man in the wrong place at the wrong time overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia WATCH: New trailer for Game of Thrones prequel releasedWhats OnWATCH: New trailer for Game of Thrones prequel released overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The news that the Dundalk man has signed a pre-contract agreement with his home town club, after  years away, has been met with great excitement by Derry City fans, with the -year-old agreeing a four-year deal at the Brandywell. googletag.cmd.push Now that excitement is being shared by McEleney, who has also agreed tohome next year, meaning he will reunite with his long-time friend and team mate in red and white. “He’s obviously an amazing player,” he said. “I’ve played with him now for six or seven seasons I think and I know what he’s capable of. It’s an amazing signing for Derry. A lot of credit has to go to Derry and to Ruaidhriand Philipfor getting it over the line. He has been the best probably in the league for two or three years running so hopefully he can continue that form.” The two Derry men have done it all at Dundalk in recent years, but McEleney admits that the two soon-to-be Derry City players have often wondered what it would be like to achieve similar success with the team they grew up with. “We have spoken about it before,” he admitted. “Down there I think we’ve won three league titles and FAI Cups and we’ve been in the Europa League and we’ve always said ‘Imagine doing it for Derry’. I think Mickey has said that it is what he wants to do. “We are Derry men and obviously supporters of the club. I used to go to the Brandywell to watch Derry and I had a season ticket for six years on the run. It won’t be weird, we’re just excited by it and really looking forward to it.”     These are exciting times for Derry City with Ruaidhri Higgins determined to bring success back to the Brandywell, and McEleney is adamant that he wants to be a part of it. “Ruaidhri was a big pull,” he added. “I’ve played long with him and he was my assistant at Dundalk and I know what he’s about. I’m just really looking forward to coming back. Mickey is one of my best mates so we speak about kit all the time and he’s the exact same. We just want to do really well and bring trophies back. We’re not coming up to put our feet up, we’re coming up to win trophies.”  ‘Better team won Meanwhile, City boss Ruaidhri Higgins has admitted that the better team won after watching his team fall to their first defeat in  league games with the - loss at Shamrock Rovers on Friday. City took an early lead through Danny Lafferty, but the champions hit back through goals from lee Grace and Danny Mandriou to claim the three points. “The best team won,” he said. “We got ourselves in front with a really good goal early on, but Rovers got a foothold in the game. We were probably a minute away from getting in at half time and regrouping but they have punished us. “Our players have been brilliant. They have had a lot of praise and pats on the back and rightly so but I think we didn’t reach the levels that we can get to. In key moments in the game we lacked a wee bit of belief and I think we showed naivety and we got punished for it. “We lost our composure and our first pass when we won the ball back let us down. We’ve had a couple of half chances Alan Mannus has made an unbelievable save from Ronan Boyce to stop us going - up, but I can’t have any complaints about the result.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the Hope Centre at Cornerstone City Church is Hope Centre team members Ryan Murphy and John Loughury along with Deputy Mayor, Cllr Christopher Jackson.Derry NewsDerry church launches new service in bid to tackle poverty overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick McEleney and Michael Duffy will play at Derry City next season.SportDerry City have signed the best player in Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  David Burkes book reveals how those detained by the army after Bloody Sunday were subjected to beatings from paratroopers Local NewsJust you wait, you pig, we’re going to kick you to death overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A whistleblower on Bloody Sunday was intimidated prior to testying at the Saville InquiryLocal NewsBloody Sunday whistleblower lucky to escape with warning overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsConsultation to be opened on County Derry Park and Ride overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Inspirational: Vicky Phelan National NewsVicky Phelan thanks public for their prayers and positive messages in heartbreaking post overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  David Burkes book, Kitsons Irish War tells of how General Kitsons approach to Ireland culminated into the massacre that took place in Derry on Bloody SundayLocal NewsThe wrong man in the wrong place at the wrong time overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia WATCH: New trailer for Game of Thrones prequel releasedWhats OnWATCH: New trailer for Game of Thrones prequel released overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Ciara is bidding to be part of the Northern Ireland ladies squad who have been formed to attempt to qualy for the tournament which will be played in a unique three against three format. googletag.cmd.push Four years ago the Queens Psychology graduate, who is now studying for a Counselling and Therapeutic Communication Masters at UU Jordanstown, was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. Although she admits it was shocking news to receive, she was determined to make the best of the le changing news. My condition wont improve but there is work I can do to manage it and give myself the best quality of le, she explained. The lockdown restrictions made my situation more challenging, my treatment means I am considered high riskI contracted Covid and not being able to use the gym meant I lost a lot of fitness. My strength was so low after lockdown that I couldnt even do a press-up but through the Steps to Health Programme with Derry City and Strabane District Council GP Referral Co-ordinator Colleen Brown I have made signicant progress since I have come back.  Ciara is bidding to be part of the Northern Ireland ladies squad.  She has tailored my training for the skills required to play the game such as strength exercises that will aid ball throwing.     The Steps to Health programme is an eight week course where candidates are guided through a tailored training regime to improve their overall wellbeing and fitness. Ciara is an ideal candidate for the programme, she is very enthusiastic and always wants to push herself to reach the next level, explained Colleen. In her initial consultation we discussed ways that she could improve her overall fitness and strength and improve her confidence. The programme is about being smart so that you can take the gradual, slow steps towards better health. Some clients have slower progress than others but the most important thing is that they are developing consistency and improving at a pace that is right for them. Ciara intends to continue her gym work by herself when the programme ends and she had no hesitation in recommending it to others. I worked one on one with Colleen in the first four weeks and then I was able to do some of the sessions by myself to get confident in continuing my improvement when it ends, she continued. Ive seen a signicant change in my strength and overall fitness over the weeks of the programme, I think its important to always take the positives from situations and to believe in yourself. I couldnt recommend the programme highly enough, no matter what your condition we all have a potential that we can fulfil and its about giving yourself the best possible chance to do that. I have days when I get up and I dont want to leave the house but I get into the gym and get the workout done early and I feel good for the rest of the day. There are other days when I cant get off the sofa and I dont beat myself up about that, sometimes its your bodys way of telling you that you need a rest. My friends and family have noticed a change in my overall mood over the last  weeks and it has inspired many of my friends to get more active as well. Opportunities There are  wheelchair basketball clubs in Northern Ireland that provide opportunities to play both recreationally and competitively. Ciara was keen to stress that able bodied people can also take part in the sport. I always thought the sport was exclusively for people who were wheelchair bound but anyone can get into a chair and play.

Ciara is bidding to be part of the Northern Ireland ladies squad who have been formed to attempt to qualy for the tournament which will be played in a unique three against three format. googletag.cmd.push Four years ago the Queens Psychology graduate, who is now studying for a Counselling and Therapeutic Communication Masters at UU Jordanstown, was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. Although she admits it was shocking news to receive, she was determined to make the best of the le changing news. My condition wont improve but there is work I can do to manage it and give myself the best quality of le, she explained. The lockdown restrictions made my situation more challenging, my treatment means I am considered high riskI contracted Covid and not being able to use the gym meant I lost a lot of fitness. My strength was so low after lockdown that I couldnt even do a press-up but through the Steps to Health Programme with Derry City and Strabane District Council GP Referral Co-ordinator Colleen Brown I have made signicant progress since I have come back.  Ciara is bidding to be part of the Northern Ireland ladies squad.  She has tailored my training for the skills required to play the game such as strength exercises that will aid ball throwing.     The Steps to Health programme is an eight week course where candidates are guided through a tailored training regime to improve their overall wellbeing and fitness. Ciara is an ideal candidate for the programme, she is very enthusiastic and always wants to push herself to reach the next level, explained Colleen. In her initial consultation we discussed ways that she could improve her overall fitness and strength and improve her confidence. The programme is about being smart so that you can take the gradual, slow steps towards better health. Some clients have slower progress than others but the most important thing is that they are developing consistency and improving at a pace that is right for them. Ciara intends to continue her gym work by herself when the programme ends and she had no hesitation in recommending it to others. I worked one on one with Colleen in the first four weeks and then I was able to do some of the sessions by myself to get confident in continuing my improvement when it ends, she continued. Ive seen a signicant change in my strength and overall fitness over the weeks of the programme, I think its important to always take the positives from situations and to believe in yourself. I couldnt recommend the programme highly enough, no matter what your condition we all have a potential that we can fulfil and its about giving yourself the best possible chance to do that. I have days when I get up and I dont want to leave the house but I get into the gym and get the workout done early and I feel good for the rest of the day. There are other days when I cant get off the sofa and I dont beat myself up about that, sometimes its your bodys way of telling you that you need a rest. My friends and family have noticed a change in my overall mood over the last  weeks and it has inspired many of my friends to get more active as well. Opportunities There are  wheelchair basketball clubs in Northern Ireland that provide opportunities to play both recreationally and competitively. Ciara was keen to stress that able bodied people can also take part in the sport. I always thought the sport was exclusively for people who were wheelchair bound but anyone can get into a chair and play. Its a growing sport in Northern Ireland and a great, fast moving activity to get involved in so Id encourage anyone interest to get involved through their local club.

He is currently renovating a studio on his family land in Donegal, Ireland. He exhibits nationally and internationally, showing at the Dublin Castle, The London Art Fair and the Saatchi Gallery with Cynthia Corbett and the Young Masters Art Prize, the Victoria, and Albert Museum “What is Luxury” with Unknown Fields Division and Toby Smith. Other shows include “GLOBALE: Infosphere” ZKM Museum, Karlsruhe, Germany and Van Abbe-museum, Eindhoven. He was selected to represent Ireland in The Ceramic Context Biennale in Bornholm Art Museum in  He collaborated with Dublin architect Peter Carroll from A architects at The European Culture Centre in Venice May-Nov , participated in the Landmark series with Sky Arts representing Scotland, commissioned by Sky Arts to produce a piece of sculpture in  days. He also has a solo show in Dec-Jan at Stallan-Brand Gallery in Glasgow  Kevin completed a residency at The Irish Culture Centre in Paris in August . Are We Here , a site-based, .-meter-tall sculpture by Kevin Callaghan commissioned by Sky Arts on the occasion of the new series Landmark, explores the notion of utopia and our proximity to it      With an ongoing interest in geometry and the potential for multiple realities, Callaghan invites viewers into a future-minded meditation on hope and potentiality via Are We Here. “Are we here ” It’s a question that suggests we are on a journey, and, in addition to hunger for our destination, conjures hope—hope for real freedom and space to realize our multitude of potentialities. If “here” is not yet utopia, it is at least a space where we might imagine, hope for, and build our future. What local music are you into  “Jonny Delaney, Ryan Vail, Orla, And I got a listen To Kwa Daniels’ new radio show on my way to Belfast airport flying back to Glasgow” Inna Rhythm Apart from the obvious, how have you spent lockdown  “When lockdown started my plans to be in Paris on a residency had clearly changed so I began to work extensively on my brand Condie, so that kept me busy for the first lockdown, The second lockdown was crazy busy, after sky arts asked me to apply for the series Landmark, I was one of  in the UK and Ireland commissioned by them, I set about designing the piece Are We Here with my designer. The built-up to the making of the piece in April was intense, then the piece was made in  days from start to finish with the help of the fabricators Sculpture and Design in Glasgow. there was a slower period in May and June then I was finally off to Paris in July”. What groups or services have helped you  “I have had dferent support over the years, the arts council of Ireland, Business to Arts in Dublin, The Crafts Council of Ireland, The National Sculpture Factory in Cork, Donegal Council, and enterprise board to name a few. Its away a nice feeling to support locally”. How do you feel things will change for musicians in the coming year  “It’s been a really tough time for musicians the last  months. I think it’s still going to be a bit slow for artists to get their regular gigs coming back, but I would hope there will be some great new material coming out, from the complex time you all have just had. And I hope that the younger generation of musicians continue to make and put music out and dont get disheartened by the pandemic”. What are your long-term plans  “My long-term plans are to continue making work for exhibitions and larger commission work. I have been doing it since my time studying in Derry  and I dont intend to stop any time soon. I still like to do a residency somewhere every year, I really want to do one again in China, however, le is pretty busy. I am currently renovating a sheep shed in Barnesmore, Donegal in a new studio on the family land and we plan to develop a Bothy style Glamping site on the land in the near future”.

By the water-break, bizarrely, Kilcoo hadnrsquot registered a score with Clonduff leading - to -.However, on  minutes a Jerome Johnston free finally got his side off the mark and just three minutes later he did what he does best ndash found the net to send Kilcoo into the lead.After Jeromersquos brother Ryan had rattled the crossbar for a second time, Johnston was first to pounce to send the Magpies into the lead.Ceilum Doherty and Eugene Branagan put Kilcoo three clear before half time but Clonduff managed to reduce the deficit to one thanks to some good scoring from Arthur McConville and Eamon Brown.Clonduffrsquos Tom Close was black carded on the stroke of half time, leaving the yellows a man down for the first  minutes of the second half.This didnrsquot seem to matter as they caught Kilcoo out of position straight after the break, with Jayme Gribben finding the net for Clonduff.Mickey Moranrsquos team again responded and by the end of the third quarter it was - apiece with mistakes and turnovers aplenty in the game.Dylan Ward and Tiernan Fettes were introduced for the county champions for the closing stages and both made a dference to give their team much-needed energy.Going down the final stretch Kilcoo led by two, Shealan Johnston, Ceilum Doherty and the brilliant Ryan Johnston all on target.Aidan Carr and a Stephen McConville free kept the Hilltown men within range but it was their neighbours who finished stronger as Shealan Johnston and Miceal Rooney closed the scoring leaving the Magpies victorious.Despite Kilcoo playing nowhere near to their potential, they still managed to grind out a result and with Darryl Branagan, Niall McEvoy, Paul Devlin and a fully fit Dylan Ward set toto the starting lineup, they will fancy their chances of pushing on for a th county title.Ciaran McBride will rue the missed chances his team spurned, especially a late goal opportunity, in a game that was refereed excellently by Brendan Rice.Kilcoo: M McCourt, N Branagan, R McEvoy , A Morgan, A Branagan, A Branagan, M Rooney , P Greenan, A Morgan, C Doherty , S Johnston , E Branagan , C Laverty, R Johnston , J Johnston .Subs used: T Fettes, D Ward and J Clarke.Clonduff: P Gribben, L Branagan, D OrsquoHagan, T McEvoy, P Branagan, C Carr, J Gribben , R Carr , A Carr , T Close, P OrsquoHagan, B OrsquoHagan, A McConville , S McConville , E Brown .Subs used: J OrsquoHagan, P Wilson, S McGreevy and T McGreevy.Referee: Brendan Rice Kilcoo -Clonduff -SFC ND ROUND.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29September2021-Consultation.jpg","title":"Consultation to help boost Downpatrick  ","story":"THE business community in Downpatrick is to be consulted about what measures could be taken to support its continued regeneration and development at a time when there are  empty shop units across the town.Local council officials are behind the initiative after Newry, Mourne and Down Council recently debated potentially appointing a new town centre manager.While no final decision has been taken on appointing someone, the local authority wants to gauge the view of businesses on what they view as the priority moving forward post-Covid.The global pandemic hit a number of local businesses hard and while there are some politicians in favour of appointing a town centre manager to work in Downpatrick, others believe that the county town should not be given preferential treatment.Plans to speak with traders comes on the back of a recent proposal by Cllr Gareth Sharvin when the town centre manager issue was discussed at a meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee.Cllr Sharvin expressed concern about the number of empty business premises which includes three former banks which have been lying vacant for a number of years.The Downpatrick councillor said there are eight empty units at the Grove shopping centre in Market Street, three in Market Lane, alongside many others dotted around the town.ldquoLocal councillors recently met with Economic, Regeneration and Tourism officers to discuss theway forward in identying the best mechanism to support and move Downpatrick forward, revealed Cllr Sharvin.ldquoMy SDLP colleagues and I sees the revitalisation of Downpatrick as offering a unique opportunity to ensure that the town is ready to meet the opportunities of a post-Covid society. One of the most effective ways of identying how we meet these needs is consulting with our existing business stakeholders who have invested into our town and community.Cllr Sharvin said the proposed consultation will focus on the business communityrsquos view on what is positive about the work the local authority currently does.ldquoIt will also seek to find out what the organisation does not do so well, what businesses want to see in terms of support and what steps can be taken to attract additional investment, he continued.ldquoGiven Downpatrickrsquos rich and vibrant history, we have visitors coming from all over the world to visit St Patrickrsquos final resting place and complementing this is a fantastic array of attractions such as Inch Abbey, the St Patrick Centre, Downpatrick and Co Down Railway, Ballydugan medieval site, Struell Wells and Saul Church.ldquoHowever, the last thing I want is for those who visit the town and experience all this to then move on to Newry or Belfast.Cllr Sharvin said it is important that there are facilities for visitors to stay to have a meal and even remain in the town overnight.ldquoThis is something that I and my colleagues would like to see delivered which would have a positive,ripple effect on delivering a nightle that we can be proud of, he remarked.He said he believes that a town centre manager or a chamber of commerce could be the right mechanism to bring the town together and play a proactive role in attracting investment and new business to the area.He added: ldquoWe have to get the right blend of making Downpatrick attractive not only to tourists but, just as importantly, to residents who live and work in the area.ldquoI would urge all businesses to engage in the council survey and highlight what they would like to see in the Downpatrick area. It also important that they spell out how the local authority can support them to grow and make Downpatrick a top location for people to visit, stay and

national newspapers outlining the scale and potential of the sprawling complex.The Recorder understands the move has already attracted signicant interest among potential buyers, with no less than four firm bids already lodged.Last month, the Northern Bank changed the locks on the gates of the major complex after months of intense speculation surrounding its future and local planning officials announced they were considering taking legal action because the owners had exceeded the number of race meetings they were allowed to run.The current owner of the circuit, Mr David Beattie, confirmed yesterday afternoon that the complex is for sale, but he revealed he is currently working on a rescue package which he hopes will allow him to retain sole control.It has also emerged that he is due to meet shortly with Stormont Ministers Sam Foster and Michael McGimpsey to discuss his plans for the race circuit.DUNDRUM ndash Sectarian vandals caused thousands of pounds worth of damage to Dundrum Gaelic Football Club during a weekend arson attack.A UVF slogan was brandished on the near-completed building before it was set alight on Saturday evening.Damage to the building, which it is estimated will cost the club thousands of pounds to repair, included broken windows and burnt door frames.The fire had gone out before the incident was uncovered shortly before am on Sunday.Police this week confirmed that the fire had been started ldquomaliciously but said they were keeping an open mind about the perpetrators who they believe may have been youths.Club secretary Jarlath Carey said the

That being said, it is no wonder that our rural communities may feel isolated from our bigger towns and cities, where investment and opportunities are more obvious.Rural isolation is closer to all of us than we realise exploring this topic brought to light my own childhood memories of growing up in the countryside.While I loved my upbringing, I hadnrsquot considered how it was impacted by the fact that I grew up in a rural area. It was through exploring the topic of rural isolation that I realised the social effects it can have on our youth.My own children are growing up in the countryside as well and I can now see how this may impact them socially they are not playing with friends in the evenings like many would in housing developments and built up areas.They are playing with each other in their own garden, similar to my own experience. While I donrsquot think this is a negative thing for my children, due to the volume of social groups and clubs that they participate in, I am now consciously taking opportunities to expose them to a wider iety of social situations, so they do not feel the potential effects of rural isolation.It is clear to see the effects of rural isolation when just recently at a meeting with Translink, the cutting of rural bus routes and services was brought to light. This is another slap in the face to those living in rural areas without access to their own vehicle, especially when considering the climate crisis.I and my fellow councillors and party colleagues are encouraging constituents to use active travel and public transport.Meanwhile, those exact services are being cut removing the option for active travel. This is not good enough.I have conducted a range of investigative meetings to see how groups and organisations within South Down in particular are taking action to prevent rural isolation.I recently met with Nicholas McCrickard, manager of Co Down Rural Community Network, an organisation crucial in combatting rural isolation in South Down as itrsquos an umbrella body set up and managed by community groups in the area for more than  years.The aim of the organisation is to create an inclusive future where all citizens actively participate in local le which stimulates a vibrant society.Nicholas and his team, with the support of community groups, ensure regular outreach to all of the citizens in the area so that they can enhance their own lives through participation with ious organisations. This stimulation is a sure-fire way to combat rural isolation, but the resources need to be available to ensure no one is left behind.I recently visited the offices of Good Morning Down in Downpatrick mdash another vital service many in our community rely on. It is an organisation which regularly makes telephone calls to those facing isolation for a iety of reasons. These calls are a method of friendship building between volunteers and residents of a wide iety of ages.The youngest volunteer in Good Morning Down is in their late s, while the eldest is in their late s. Nearly  years worth of knowledge and experience will be exchanged through these conversations and I walked away from this meeting, feeling truly touched by the dedication of the staff and volunteers.In addition, having met with Womenrsquos Aid in recent days, fresh in my mind are the stories of the impact that living in a rural setting has on many women who are isolated from much of society.Not having that friendly neighbour close by can impact the severity of abusive relationships. Thankfully, we have organisations such as Womenrsquos Aid who recognise this and work every day with women in these situations, but funding, resourcing and legislation is always an issue.These are only a few of the fantastic initiatives that offer support to those in rural communities, however, there are many who are unaware of their operation.I would like to raise awareness of the services available to our rural constituents, to promote inclusivity and encourage a positive approach to mental health and wellbeing. It is extremely important to raise awareness and encourage our rural communities to stop and think about their mental health and to consider how rural isolation may affect them.I would encourage our rural communities to take time out to improve their mental health, normalise discussion around issues of isolation and avail of local mental health services.It is time that Newry, Mourne and Down Council took responsibility and recognise the vital work local groups within our community do for the residents of our district and remember that ratepayers donrsquot just live in our major towns like Downpatrick, but also in rural areas such as the wider Lecale countryside.There needs to be a serious refocusing on service provision in rural areas and a renewed approach to capital investment. We need to stand up for the safety of our rural communities, and protect them from the effects of isolation.

Therefore there wouldnrsquot be much point providing floating wheelchairsthe council did not have the facilities for these people to get into or access these wheelchairs.Independent councillor Jarlath Tinnelly said that the beach access issue had been raised with him throughout the summer and he called for other beaches to be included in the pilot.He said his only concern with the motion would be thata pilot project was being proposed, the councilrsquos blue flag beaches at Tyrella and Cranfield should be considered.ldquoThe experience of wheelchair users to get on to the beach and enjoy that same thrill is a priority and we should be doing whatever we can to facilitate that, he said.ldquoThese floating wheelchairs can be taken into the water and allow people to enjoy the same experiences as everybody , things that are taken for granted.The motion to improve beach access was initially tabled in August and was inspired by the campaigning work of local activist, Naomi Herron, who approached all her local councillors askingsomething could be done to give her better access to the beach.At the time, Cllr Brown said he understood that while a small scale trial of the idea has operated in Cranfield in the past, it was important that this was expanded out into other parts of the district and that he could ldquothink of no better place than Newcastle given the large number of visitors it gets every year.He continued: ldquoAs a council, it is important that we ensure all facilities are open and accessible to all residents. It is right that we look at the issue of beach access, with a view to providing provisions for wheelchair-bound residents and visitors who wish to also enjoy our wonderful coastline.ldquo I donrsquot want this issue to go around in circles with reports, meetings and investigations.

He been excoriated either for being too much like a traditional unionist or for being weak kneed over the need for a pan-unionism electoral pact.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Henry McDonald is a formerand Observer Ireland correspondent and author of books including a biography of David Trimble and INLA: Deadly DivisionsThe latter critique, articulated quite forcefully and lucidly by Peter Robinson in this newspaper on Friday, needs further objective examination. Because in a sense any possible pre-election deal between Beattie’s party, Jeffrey Donaldson’s DUP or even Jim Allister and the TUV would be rendered as irrelevant unless a far greater electoral issues is not addressed: turnout.According to recent studies of elections and public attitudes in Northern Ireland it is an objective fact that unionists are more inclined not to vote compared to nationalists.In the University of Liverpool Institute of Irish Studies’ comprehensive -page analysis of the  general election and its aftermath in Northern Ireland that gap was more than ten percentage points. Among those who said they prefer to remain within the UK .% admitted they were “non-voters”. The figure of “non-voters” among those who want to reuny with the rest of Ireland was .%. The overwhelming majority therefore of those not inclined to enter a polling station were unionists.The same study also broke down the percentages of those who didn’t vote by their normal party-political affiliations. The highest group who failed to turn up at the ballot box were those who said they supported the DUP. A whopping .% of DUP supporters said they didn’t vote this time around. This compares to Sinn Fein were only .% of their supporters failed to cast their vote. Perhaps surprisingly the next party to suffer from apathy among its supporters was the Alliance Party where .% Alliance minded citizens didn’t vote either.Other credible public surveys and opinion polls find a consistent dichotomy between strong majority backing across the board for the union and a declining support for the main unionist parties at election time. This cannot just be explained alone by a lack of co-operation between those parties and the shredding of the unionist ticket in ious constituencies, which is caused by too many pro-Union candidates standing. Political apathy of course plays a part especially in working class loyalist districts where all the social indices are negative and where a pervasive sense of hopelessness can take hold in communities. As an outside observer it has always struck me as a bewildering paradox as to why these communities can pour so much energy and time into building bonfires, forming bands, organising mass parades but many of them cannot be galvanised to even get onto the electoral register let alone bother to vote.Yet for many within loyalist areas where political apathy reigns there is also a sense of frustration over who to vote for. One of my closest personal friends who would not turn against meI described him as a true-blue loyalist who wears his unionismnot on his sleeve then at least on his Harrington jacket or parka coat. Although he has numerous nationalist and republican pals, as well as political agnostics like this one, my mate is unapologetic in his love of the Union. And yet he will openly admit that he hasn’t voted for years even though he has turned up at anti-protocol demonstrations and marches of late.When pressed as to why he is allergic to the ballot box, he explains that he has no one to vote for. He responds that the traditional unionist parties repel him given his social liberalism when it comes to issues like gay rights, abortion, mixed marriage etc. This man is under the age of  and his attitudes reflect those of a large proportion of younger pro-Union cohort of the population. They might get out and vote to remain within the UK in any future border poll but at present they are not fired up politically to cast a vote for the parties dedicated to preserving that Union.The haemorrhaging of the unionist vote of course cannot just be put down solely to voters like my liberal minded friend and many like him of his generation. However, the strategistswithin unionism should realise that it is not pacts or pre-election arrangements that will really reverse the trend of a declining vote for their parties. It is the failure to encourage pro-Union supporters especially in some of the staunchest loyalist areas across Northern Ireland to put their X or their ,,s on a ballot paper.

Stormont crises should never again be met with negotiation. Such negotiations lead to a slight gain for republican demands which, over time, accumulate to become large.You can bet that republican strategists are thinking of the next demands that they can use to topple Stormont.Asthe New Decade New Approach deal was not bad enough, SF threatened not to nominate a deputy first minister when the DUP changed leader. Edwin Poots and Brandon Lewis came up with a scheme to get republicans their cherished Irish language dream of a commissioner, who will be used to impose Irish in Northern Ireland, including in places where it is not wanted.The idea of legislating via Westminster to placate the SF nomination threat has, as Jim Allister says, left a “disastrous legacy” and set an appalling precedent.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

No unionist should be legislating for Irish language promotion. No unionist should be in office on the basis of a deal which, on a nod and a wink, sees London pass such legislation.”Mr Allister added: “Official recognition of the status of Irish will be enforced through an Irish Language Commissioner with statutory powers to ‘promote and facilitate’ the use of Irish throughout the public sector.“This zealot will set standards that every public body must meet in the use of Irish in the delivery of its services. Such will bring obvious recruitment advantage to Irish speakers across the public service.“If public bodies are required to promote and deliver their services in Irish, then, clearly staff fluent in the language will be required and preferred.”“There is no conceivable basis on which to warrant further endless squander on Irish for the sake of paying the Sinn Fein ransom to get a failed Stormont back”.The NIO had declined to comment at time of going to press.

There can also be pus and some may have the condition for weeks or even months.What are chilblains and how does this dfer from Covid toes Chilblains are small, itchy, red patches that can appear after you have been in the cold.Chilblains usually appear a few hours after you have been in the cold and you mostly get them on your fingers and toes, but can also get them on your face and legs.They usually clear up on their own in two to three weeks, but you may need to see a GPthey do not go away.What causes Covid toes A new study - published in the British Journal of Dermatology - has found that Covid toes could be a side effect of the immune systemrsquos response to coronavirusResearchers behind the study examined  participants with Covid toes and  with similar chilblains lesions that arose before the pandemic.The study found that one mechanism behind both types of the condition involved the body generating an immune response with high levels of certain autoantibodies, which mistakenly target and react with a personrsquos own cells and tissues as well as the invading virus.     Researchers also found an overlap with type I interferon, which is a key protein in the antiviral response.Cells lining blood vessels which supply the affected areas also appeared to play a critical role in the development of Covid toes and chilblains.Senior author of the study, Dr Charles Cassius, said the research provided a deeper understanding of the condition.He said: ldquoThe epidemiology and clinical features of chilblain-like lesions have been extensively studied and published, however, little is known about the pathophysiology involved.ldquoOur study provides new insights. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.

He also recognises the dire need for immediate action to tackle the climate crisis to safeguard this place for future generations. “Adam is part of an ambitious SDLP team in Fermanagh and South Tyrone delivering for local people. People want to see action to address waiting lists for housing and healthcare, but they won’t get it from the status quo. We need people to choose change and vote for candidates like Adam Gannon to build a better future for everyone across the North. Mr Gannon said: “It has been a real honour to represent my local community as a councillor over the past few years and I’m delighted to have been endorsed by the SDLP as our candidate for Fermanagh and South Tyrone in the Assembly election. Since being elected I have worked to help people on a wide range of issues, both big and small, and would love the opportunity to bring the voice of local people into the Assembly chamber. “I’ve lived in this area all my le and am proud to call it home. Unfortunately, local people have been badly let down by their politicians in recent years. We have seen businesses close, the decimation of our town centres and the abandonment of our rural communities. We deserve so much better than this. “The SDLP has a strategy to transform the North and I want to be part of it. The politics of ision may suit the DUP and Sinn Feacutein but it has delivered nothing for people here. We need real action to ensure that everyone can get the medical treatment they need without having to wait years for it, that everyone has a home that meets their needs, a radical overhaul of our crumbling education system and a real commitment to tackling the climate crisis. We can’t afford to do nothing, people have had enough and it’s time for change.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_eabacbdcbddff   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ebabdafacbbebe   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
