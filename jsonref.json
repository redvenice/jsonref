Regardless, the storm is expected to deal serious damage to both coastal and inland communities thanks to its strong winds and heavy rains.Even if it doesn’t intensify as much as forecast, the storm is still expected to be very dangerous, bringing hurricane-force winds greater than 74 miles per hour to the northeastern Gulf Coast by Wednesday, October 10 in the area currently under a hurricane warning.  This area currently s  from just north of Tampa Bay Area to the Alabama coastline, though tropical storm-force winds above 39 miles per hour are also expected to be felt in this area from the night of Tuesday, October 9 until the morning of Wednesday, October 10.Areas just outside the hurricane warning region currently under a tropical storm warning will likely see tropical storm-force winds on the night of Tuesday, October 9 and morning of Wednesday, October 10.    The powerful hurricane will bring torrential rains, strong winds and catastrophic storm surgeThe hurricane’s path is projected to bring widespread power outages to the Florida Panhandle region and even to southeastern Alabama and southwestern Georgia, potentially leaving up to two million people without power from Florida to southeastern Virginia.In addition, life-threatening storm surges as high as eight to 12 feet are possible from the western end of the Florida Panhandle all the way to the Tampa Bay Area.For rainfall, the storm is expected to dump four to eight inches in the Florida Panhandle and Big Bend region of Florida into southern Georgia and southeastern Alabama. Local rainfall of up to a foot is possible while life-threatening flash flooding cannot be ruled out either.Eastern Georgia, the Carolinas and southern Virginia could potentially see three to six inches of rain while parts of the Florida Peninsula, Mid-Atlantic and New England regions could possibly see one to three inches of rain.The storm could also bring some isolated tornadoes to the Florida Panhandle and southern Georgia.How wide is Hurricane Michael?The storm is threatening more than 300 miles of the Golf Coast and is expected to make landfall along a 150-mile stretch of the Florida coast.Hurricane Michael evacuation zonesAs the dangerous storm bears down on the Florida Panhandle and broader northeastern Gulf Coast region, mandatory evacuations have already been issued.Three Florida counties have ordered mandatory evacuations, including Gulf County, where the storm could potentially make a direct landfall hit.Wakulla County has ordered a mandatory evacuation for all residents in its Zone A evacuation zone as well as for residents living in weak structures and mobile homes. Bay County has also issued a mandatory evacuation for Zones A, B and C.When will Hurricane Michael make landfall?Though the exact landfall area of the monstrous storm isn’t yet known, officials have expressed increased confidence that it will ultimately be in the Florida Panhandle.Florida Governor Rick Scott didn’t mince words when warning residents about the storm, saying: ‘Hurricane Michael is forecast to be the most destructive storm to hit the Florida Panhandle in decades.’    The Florida Panhandle is in the crosshairs of Hurricane Michael as it barrels towards the coastAccording to FEMA official Jeff Byard, hurricane-force winds are expected to extend ‘well inland’ from where the storm makes landfall, noting that Florida’s power infrastructure could be hit even worse than North and South Carolina’s during Hurricane Florence.In preparation for the storm, President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency in 35 Florida counties and said that 2,000 National Guard members were mobilized to assist with the preparation and recovery efforts.Scott again issued a dire warning to his state’s residents as the hurricane took aim at the Florida Panhandle, saying: ‘Water will come miles inshore and could easily be over the roofs of houses.‘You cannot hide from storm surge so get prepared and get out if an evacuation is ordered.‘Remember, we can rebuild your house, but we cannot rebuild your life.’ What is Michael Bloomberg\u0027s net worth?

He said the information came from a British intelligence source. Investigators are confident they may yet discover Khashoggi\u0027s fate despite their ban from the consulate, using data collected from his Apple Watch - which was connected to a phone he left outside with his fiancee.\u0027We have determined that it was on him when he walked into the consulate,\u0027 the security official said.

Ten stayed at the five-star Mövenpick hotel, which boasts 249 luxury rooms and a ballroom. It is located just 650 yards from the Saudi embassy where Mr Khashoggi vanished.The remaining five checked in to the Wyndham Grand hotel, another five-star establishment 15 minutes\u0027 walk to the south, in the direction of the airport. The men, believed to hold Saudi passports, reportedly flew into Turkey on a number of different flights.

Officials said it was part of a convoy of six cars, several with diplomatic number plates, which left the consulate grounds two hours after Khashoggi went inside.Turkish police were allowed into the building on Tuesday, a week after Khashoggi vanished, and said that CCTV footage from inside has gone missing and Turkish staff were abruptly told to take a holiday on the day in question.Yesterday, a source close to the Saudi royal family told DailyMail.com that the Washington Post writer, and long-standing critic of Saudi Arabia, is alive and being held captive in his home country after being flown to Riyadh in a private jet.According to the source, after entering the embassy Khashoggi was taken in a black Mercedes S-500 and a white minivan with four Saudi officials to Istanbul airport, where he was flown on a private jet to Riyadh and is now being held.Flight records show that a Gulf Stream IV private jet, tail number HZ-SK2, landed in Istanbul at 3am on October 2, the day Khashoggi disappeared.

Khashoggi was driven from there to Riyadh, and was held there, the source said.The source was told Khashoggi is still alive, contradicting the claims he was murdered in the Istanbul embassy.Turkish police also revealed they are seeking information about a black Mercedes van on Monday in connection with Khashoggi\u0027s disappearance.  WhatsApp records show Khashoggi last viewed his messages on his US cell phone at 1.06pm on Tuesday, around the time he entered the embassy. On Monday President Trump said that he was \u0027concerned\u0027 about reports on Khashoggi\u0027s disappearance.\u0027I am concerned about that,\u0027 Trump said. \u0027I don\u0027t like hearing about it and hopefully that will sort itself out. Right now, nobody knows anything about it.\u0027\u0027There\u0027s some pretty bad stories about it. I do not like it,\u0027 he added.Saudi Arabia\u0027s ambassador to the US, Prince Khalid bin Salman bin Abdulaziz, said claims Khashoggi had been killed or detained by Saudi authorities were \u0027absolutely false, and baseless,\u0027 according to a statement provided to CNN.          CCTV footage obtained from Turkish news agency DHA shows a Saudi team suspected of involvement in Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi\u0027s disappearance on October 2          A security guard waits to enter Saudi Arabia\u0027s consulate in Istanbul today, a week after Khashoggi went missing after entering the building          A woman holds a portrait of missing journalist and Riyadh critic Jamal Khashoggi during a demonstration in front of the embassy yesterday\u0027There are many facts regarding his whereabouts that will hopefully be revealed through the ongoing investigation.\u0027Despite that, we have seen over the last few days various malicious leaks and grim rumors flying around about Jamal\u0027s whereabouts and fate,\u0027 the statement says.\u0027I assure you that the reports that suggest that Jamal Khashoggi went missing in the Consulate in Istanbul or that the Kingdom\u0027s authorities have detained him or killed him are absolutely false, and baseless.\u0027Earlier Monday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Saudi Arabia needs to prove that Khashoggi has, in fact, left the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.\u0027He entered the general consulate himself, and if he has entered by himself and if he did not exit it, of course this should be proven by the general consulate,\u0027 said Erdogan at a press conference in Budapest.According to the Washington Post, who Khashoggi worked for as a contributor, US intelligence had previously intercepted communications from Saudi officials discussing plans to capture him.According to the Post\u0027s source, the intercepted material featured a discussion for the potential capture of Khashoggi - a longstanding critic of the Saudi government.          Turkish TV channel TRT also revealed images of the private jet which allegedly ferried the men in and out of Turkey          Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt (pictured) warned Saudi Arabia over Khashoggi\u0027s disappearance on Wednesday afternoonThe source claimed US officials found out Saudi agents planned to lure Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia - although it was not clear whether they wanted to arrest and interrogate Khashoggi or to kill him from the information gathered.It is also not known whether the United States warned Khashoggi that he was a target, the source said.Saudi officials denied reports they sent a 15-man team to Istanbul on the day Khashoggi disappeared, saying that the only team they sent to Turkey consisted of investigators who arrived Saturday to help find the journalist.Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt issued a stark warning to Saudi Arabia over Khashoggi\u0027s disappearance on Wednesday afternoon.\u0027Just met the Saudi ambassador to seek urgent answers over Jamal Khashoggi,\u0027 he said in a tweet,\u0027 Violence against journalists worldwide is going up \u0026amp is a grave threat to freedom of expression.\u0027\u0027If media reports prove correct, we will treat the incident seriously - friendships depend on shared values.\u0027He discussed the episode with the permanent secretary to the Foreign Office, Sir Simon McDonald, on Monday.Hunt also spoke with the Saudi foreign minister Adel al-Jubeir, for the first time raising the issue at ministerial level.          The former government adviser, pictured outside the BBC in London, has lived in self-imposed exile in the United States since last year to avoid possible arrest.He interviewed Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan before al-Qaida was formed, then met him in Sudan in 1995. Following bin Laden\u0027s rise likely helped cement Khashoggi\u0027s ties with powerful former Saudi spy chief, Turki Al-Faisal.Khashoggi rubbed shoulders with the Saudi royal family and supported efforts to nudge the kingdom\u0027s entrenched ultra-conservative clerics to accept reforms. He served as an editor for nine years on the Islamist-leaning al-Madina newspaper and was frequently quoted in the Western media as an expert on Islamic radicals and a reformist voice.However, he was fired from his post as an editor at Al-Watan, a liberal paper founded after the 911 terror attacks, just two months after he took the job in 2003. The country\u0027s ultra-conservative clerics had pushed back against his criticism of the powerful religious police and Ibn Taymiyah, a medieval cleric viewed as the spiritual forefather of Wahhabism, the conservative interpretation of Islam that is the founding tenant of the kingdom.Khoshaggi then served as media adviser to Al-Faisal, the former spy chief, who was at the time the ambassador to the United States.Khashoggi returned to Al-Watan in 2007, where he continued his criticism of the clerics as the late King Abdullah implemented cautious reforms to try to shake their hold. Three years later, he was forced to resign again after a series of articles criticizing Salafism, the ultra-conservative Sunni Islam movement from which Wahhabism stems.In 2010, Saudi billionaire Alwaleed bin Talal tapped him to lead his new TV station, touted as a rival to Qatari-funded Al-Jazeera, a staunch critic of the kingdom. But the new Al-Arab station, based in Bahrain, was shut down hours after it launched, for hosting a Bahraini opposition figure.Khoshaggi\u0027s final break with the Saudi authorities followed the Arab Spring protests that swept through the region in 2011, shaking the power base of traditional leaders and giving rise to Islamists, only to be followed by unprecedented crackdowns on those calling for change. Siding with the opposition in Egypt and Syria, Khashoggi became a vocal critic of his own government\u0027s stance there and a defender of moderate Islamists, which Riyadh considered an existential threat.\u0027This was a critical period in Arab history. I had to take a position. The Arab world had waited for this moment of freedom for a thousand years,\u0027 Khashoggi told a Turkey-based Syrian opposition television station last month, just days before he disappeared.He also criticized his government\u0027s diplomatic break with Qatar and war on Yemen as well as Riyadh\u0027s policy toward its archenemy, Iran, whose influence has grown in neighboring Yemen and in Syria.In the Sept. 23 interview, he called Saudi Arabia\u0027s foreign policy \u0027narrow minded,\u0027 and ridiculed its crackdown on political Islam, urging the kingdom to realign its policy to partner with Turkey, a close Qatar ally.\u0027Saudi is the mother and father of political Islam. It is based on political Islam,\u0027 Khoshaggi said. \u0027The only recipe to get Iranians out of Syria - it is not Trump or anyone else- it is through the support of the Syrian revolution. ... Saudi Arabia must return to supporting the Syrian revolution and partnering with Turkey on this.\u0027Eight days later, on October 2, he disappeared while on a visit to the consulate in Istanbul for paperwork to marry his Turkish fiancee. The consulate insists the writer left its premises alive, contradicting Turkish officials.Before his disappearance, Khoshaggi had been living since last year in the U.S. in self-imposed exile, after he fled the kingdom amid a crackdown on intellectuals and activists who criticized policies of Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman.\u0027As of now, I would say Mohammed bin Salman is acting like Putin. He is imposing very selective justice,\u0027 Khashoggi wrote in the Post last year after he fled the kingdom, saying he feared returning home.He described \u0027dramatic\u0027 scenes of arrest of government critics accused of receiving Qatari funding. They included a friend of Khashoggi\u0027s who had just returned from a trip to the U.S. as part of an official Saudi delegation.\u0027That is how breathtakingly fast you can fall out of favor with Saudi Arabia,\u0027 he wrote.                                   Police CCTV video made available through Turkish Newspaper Sabah allegedly shows suspects wandering near the consulate on Tuesday          One of the black Mercedes vans at the center of the operation was shown on CCTV leaving the consulate on Tuesday afternoon          Tawakkol Karman, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate for 2011 holds a picture of missing Saudi writer Jamal KhashoggiEconomist and citizen-journalist Essam al-Zamel was put on trial this month for criticising the government\u0027s economic strategy in a series of tweets and reports.

But that is not what happened in this case.\u0027She went on: \u0027As to Mr Lee\u0027s claim based on sexual discrimination, the bakers did not refuse to fulfil his order because of his sexual orientation. They would have refused to make such a cake for any customer, irrespective of their sexual orientation.\u0027LGBTQ children and teens are at a three-fold higher risk of...Gay and transgender students and teachers could be turned...Share this articleThe court also said Mr Lee had no claim against Ashers on the grounds of religious belief or political opinion.Lady Hale added: \u0027The bakers could not refuse to supply their goods to Mr Lee because he was a gay man or supported gay marriage.    Ashers general manager Daniel McArthur said outside court: \u0027I want to start by thanking God. He has been with us during the challenges of the last four years. Through the Bible and the support of Christians, He has comforted us and sustained us. He is our rock and all His ways are just.\u0027We\u0027re delighted and relieved at today\u0027s ruling. We always knew we hadn\u0027t done anything wrong in turning down this order. After more than four years, the Supreme Court has now recognised that and we\u0027re very grateful. Grateful to the judges and especially grateful to God.\u0027We\u0027re particularly pleased the Supreme Court emphatically accepted what we\u0027ve said all along – we did not turn down this order because of the person who made it, but because of the message itself.\u0027The judges have given a clear signal today. In fact it couldn\u0027t be any clearer. Family businesses like ours are free to focus on giving all their customers the best service they can – without being forced to promote other people\u0027s campaigns.\u0027I know a lot of people will be glad to hear this ruling today, because this ruling protects freedom of speech and freedom of conscience for everyone.\u0027On behalf of my family can I say thank you to everyone who has supported us or prayed for us through all this.\u0027I do want to take this opportunity to thank our whole legal team for working so hard for us over the last four years. And also to thank the entire Christian Institute staff for their help and support from the very beginning.\u0027We want to move on from this now, and I\u0027m sure Mr Lee does too. And let me just finish by saying that he will always be welcome at any of our shops. Thank you\u0027.Mr Lee was also present for the latest ruling in a case which has attracted enormous attention.The bakery\u0027s appeal against the finding of discrimination was heard at the Supreme Court sitting in Belfast in May.During the hearing the justices were told that the owners were being forced to act against their religious beliefs.David Scoffield QC, for Ashers, argued that the state was penalising the baking firm, with the courts effectively compelling or forcing them to make a cake bearing a message with which they disagree as a matter of religious conscience.Speaking outside court, Mr McArthur said: \u0027We\u0027re delighted and relieved at today\u0027s ruling. We always knew we hadn\u0027t done anything wrong in turning down this order. \u0027After more than four years, the Supreme Court has now recognised that and we\u0027re very grateful.

Daniel McArthur said outside court that \u0027a lot of people will be glad to hear this ruling today\u0027Mounting an unsuccessful challenge at the Court of Appeal in Belfast in 2016, Ashers contended that it never had an issue with Mr Lee\u0027s sexuality, rather the message he was seeking to put on the cake.Now share your opinionMr Scoffield told the justices that the case, a simple transaction, raised an issue of principle since those with deeply-held religious or philosophical convictions could be compelled to act against their beliefs.Robin Allen QC, for Mr Lee, said: \u0027This was a relatively small incident in his life which has become enormously significant and continues to be so. That is a heavy burden to bear for one inidual.\u0027Speaking outside court, Mr Lee said: \u0027To me, this was never about a campaign or a statement. All I wanted was to order a cake in a shop that sold cakes to order.\u0027I paid my money, my money was taken and then a few days later it was refused. That made me feel like a second-class citizen.\u0027I\u0027m concerned not just for the implications for myself and other gay people, but for every single one of us.\u0027Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK or Ireland where same-sex marriage is outlawed, with Prime Minister Theresa May\u0027s DUP allies staunch opponents of changing the law.Following the ruling,  DUP leader Arlene Foster said the judgment was \u0027historic and seminal\u0027, adding: \u0027This has been a long journey for everyone involved in the case. \u0027I commend Amy \u0026amp Daniel McArthur for their grace and perseverance. This now provides clarity for people of all faiths and none.\u0027          The UK Supreme Court has today released its judgment regarding the widely-reported \u0027gay cake\u0027 case.In 2014, a gay man and activist, Gareth Lee, made an order to Ashers Bakery in Belfast for a cake to have a message \u0027Support Gay Marriage\u0027 in icing, together with an image of Sesame Street\u0027s Bert and Ernie. The bakery refused to fulfil Mr Lee\u0027s order, explaining that they were a Christian business and could not print the message, and a full refund was given.Mr Lee brought proceedings against Ashers for direct discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, and the Belfast County Court awarded £500 as damages. This decision was upheld by the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal.Ashers appealed, and the Supreme Court has ruled that the bakery did not commit direct discrimination against Mr Lee. In an important clarification of the concept of \u0027direct discrimination\u0027, it must be shown that an inidual has been treated less favourably because of a protected characteristic, which in this case was Mr Lee\u0027s sexual orientation. In this case, no evidence was shown that Mr Lee was treated less favourably because he was gay, and Ashers objected only to the message being requested. Had Mr Lee not been gay but requested the same message, Ashers would have again refused, so there was no less favourable treatment linked to Mr Lee\u0027s sexual orientation. Rather than the inidual messenger, it was the message Ashers was found to have discriminated against, which was not unlawful. Lady Hale stated that \u0027the bakers could not refuse to supply their goods to Mr Lee because he was a gay man or supported gay marriage, but that is quite different from obliging them to supply a cake iced with a message with which they profoundly disagreed.\u0027This judgment clarifies the narrow scope of direct discrimination.There must be evidence that an inidual\u0027s own protected characteristic was the reason for the less favourable treatment. Interestingly, had Mr Lee been a disabled person, and been refused a cake with a message supporting disability rights, it is arguably this would amount to \u0027discrimination arising from disability\u0027 and would be unlawful under the Equality Act, as it would be unfavourable treatment because of something arising in consequence of the inidual\u0027s disability. However, this broader concept of protection is only available to disabled persons. Other protected characteristics, like sexual orientation, gender, race and age can only rely on the narrower concept of direct discrimination, the limits of which have been starkly highlighted by the Supreme Court.Christian bakery wins appeal in Supreme Court \u0027gay cake\u0027 case"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/10/08/512DBB4700000578-0-image-a-10_1539154893629.jpg","title":"Mother two 50 paid 5 000 botched breast reduction surgery Harley Street practice","story":"    Samantha Sill, 50, (pictured before the surgery) from Worcester, went under the knife to reduce her breast size from a J-cup to a more comfortable C-cupAfter taking the bandages off, she noticed her nipples were much higher than they had been before and the stitching was coming loose.She also had heavy scarring on her breasts and she was still in agonising pain.Teenager’s hand is saved by tiny screw after the medical...Shocking moment Iraqi social media star was shot dead at the...Share this articleThe estate agent, who lives with husband Julian, 54, is now suing Harley Street plastic surgeon Alberto di Giuseppe.She said: \u0027I am completely devastated by everything I have been through and I just feel I deserve answers as to what went wrong. All I want to do now is stop him going ahead and doing it to other people.

Nick (right), 44, with similarly mind-boggling assets, owns a £1.1 million collection of watches. The Epsom-college educated Candy brothers, Nick and Christian, have risen to prominence in a near three-decade long assault on London\u0027s luxury property marketBy 2004 they were developing the landmark One Hyde Park apartments in Knightsbridge, dubbed the \u0027most expensive residential development ever built\u0027. The complex comprises some 86 apartments set over four pavilions with views over Knightsbridge to the south and Hyde Park to the north.  Meanwhile the pair, who both landed glamorous wives while solidifying their property empire with ambitious projects at home and abroad, also faced some high-profile resistance to their seemingly unstoppable growth.Namely, heir to the throne Prince Charles who objected in 2010 to their Chelsea Barracks development. It was reported at the time that a quiet word from the prince to the Qatari Diar real estate firm boss over the design plans cost the Candys £81 million.An out of court settlement allowed both sides to save face and Christian\u0027s own CPC Group - established in 2004 - issued an unreserved apology to both the Qatari royal family and Charles. In 2016 and 2017 they were involved in high-profile litigation in the High Court in London which put their reputations on the line. Former business associate Mark Holyoake claimed in the action that the brothers had used threats against him and his family to extort total repayments of £37m against a £12m loan.Mr Holyoake lost his appeal in the Court of Appeal and the Candys are now focused on recovering the substantial legal costs from Mr Holyoake On 29 September 2012, Nick wed the Australian actress-musician-TV presenter in Beverly Hills, California. Nick\u0027s spending power was revealed when he told the court he paid US popstar Katy Perry £1.2million to perform at his wedding to Australian actress Holly Valance - but insisted he didn\u0027t live a lavish lifestyle. Recently the pair\u0027s business dealings appear to have gone sour, amid suggestions of a rift between Christian, married to the blue-blooded Lady Emily Crompton-Candy, and Holly.The pair are reported to have never seen eye to eye with both Christian and his wife allegedly trying to halt the marriage suggesting Holly had a \u0027dubious\u0027 background. In June, Nick changed the business name from Candy \u0026amp Candy to Candy Property, putting the new firm entirely into his name. A source said: \u0027Christian instigated discussions – he has wanted out for a long while and they haven\u0027t worked together for some time.\u0027 A spokesman for Nick said that he had been running the firm solo since 2011, and added: \u0027The name change is designed to remove any confusion that there are still two parties involved.\u0027 Christian, 43, has assets reportedly valued at £1.2billion and his firm owns properties worth £900million.Nick, 44, with similarly mind-boggling assets, owns a £1.1 million collection of watches.Property tycoon Nick Candy takes out £80m mortgage on London flat | News | The Times"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/10/15/1CCE17A800000578-0-image-m-14_1539180043419.jpg","title":"What Michael Bloombergs net worth Ex NYC Mayors wealth revealed amid Presidential run rumors","story":"    Michael Bloomberg has re-registered as a Democrat amid rumors he\u0027s considering running for President in 2020      What is Michael Bloomberg\u0027s net worth?

So we\u0027ll have a crew that will roam around looking for locations,\u0027 San Francisco Public Works Director Mohammed Nuru told KGO. \u0027We actually have data for neighborhoods where we get frequent calls.\u0027               Some San Francisco streets are so covered in human feces that the city launched a \u0027Poop Patrol\u0027 to clean the mess          Mayor London Breed of San Francisco, who was elected in June, has made unannounced inspections of neighborhoods, sometimes carrying a broomSan Fran\u0027s mayor, London Breed, also says cleaning up the city\u0027s streets are a top priority. \u0027I\u0027ve had to deal with it myself in front of my home and it\u0027s not a pleasant feeling,\u0027 she told KGO. \u0027I want to change San Francisco for the better. I want to clean up the city.\u0027We have the data that shows where most of the complaints are for poop clean up,\u0027 Breed told KTVU. \u0027So, the goal is to make sure we have a dedicated team and they are focusing on those particular areas where we know it\u0027s most problematic.\u0027 The city receives about 65 complaints a day about feces on sidewalks, a number that has increased in the past year.Much of it comes from dogs whose owners don\u0027t clean up after them, but also from homeless people who simply relieve themselves on the street. Out of the 7,499 homeless people recorded last year, about 58 percent, or 4,353 people, were marked as unsheltered. The other 3,146 were designated sheltered. One resident even created a Poop Map for people to report messes as they come across them.  The poop patrol with consist of six dedicated employees and two trucks at a cost of $750,000.  The Department of Public Works says that the aim is to spot the mess and steam clean it away before complaints are even made.       \u0027So, what happens is we\u0027re going to take one of those crews out and try to get ahead of those calls and look for these locations so that hopefully we can get less numbers of calls coming in,\u0027 Nuru added.

Officials said it was part of a convoy of six cars, several with diplomatic number plates, which left the consulate grounds two hours after Khashoggi went inside.Turkish police were allowed into the building on Tuesday, a week after Khashoggi vanished, and said that CCTV footage from inside has gone missing and Turkish staff were abruptly told to take a holiday on the day in question.Yesterday, a source close to the Saudi royal family told DailyMail.com that the Washington Post writer, and long-standing critic of Saudi Arabia, is alive and being held captive in his home country after being flown to Riyadh in a private jet.According to the source, after entering the embassy Khashoggi was taken in a black Mercedes S-500 and a white minivan with four Saudi officials to Istanbul airport, where he was flown on a private jet to Riyadh and is now being held.Flight records show that a Gulf Stream IV private jet, tail number HZ-SK2, landed in Istanbul at 3am on October 2, the day Khashoggi disappeared.

Turkish TV channel TRT also revealed images of the private jet which allegedly ferried the men in and out of Turkey          Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt (pictured) warned Saudi Arabia over Khashoggi\u0027s disappearance on Wednesday afternoonThe source claimed US officials found out Saudi agents planned to lure Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia - although it was not clear whether they wanted to arrest and interrogate Khashoggi or to kill him from the information gathered.It is also not known whether the United States warned Khashoggi that he was a target, the source said.Saudi officials denied reports they sent a 15-man team to Istanbul on the day Khashoggi disappeared, saying that the only team they sent to Turkey consisted of investigators who arrived Saturday to help find the journalist.Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt issued a stark warning to Saudi Arabia over Khashoggi\u0027s disappearance on Wednesday afternoon.\u0027Just met the Saudi ambassador to seek urgent answers over Jamal Khashoggi,\u0027 he said in a tweet,\u0027 Violence against journalists worldwide is going up \u0026amp is a grave threat to freedom of expression.\u0027\u0027If media reports prove correct, we will treat the incident seriously - friendships depend on shared values.\u0027He discussed the episode with the permanent secretary to the Foreign Office, Sir Simon McDonald, on Monday.Hunt also spoke with the Saudi foreign minister Adel al-Jubeir, for the first time raising the issue at ministerial level.          The former government adviser, pictured outside the BBC in London, has lived in self-imposed exile in the United States since last year to avoid possible arrest.He interviewed Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan before al-Qaida was formed, then met him in Sudan in 1995. Following bin Laden\u0027s rise likely helped cement Khashoggi\u0027s ties with powerful former Saudi spy chief, Turki Al-Faisal.Khashoggi rubbed shoulders with the Saudi royal family and supported efforts to nudge the kingdom\u0027s entrenched ultra-conservative clerics to accept reforms. He served as an editor for nine years on the Islamist-leaning al-Madina newspaper and was frequently quoted in the Western media as an expert on Islamic radicals and a reformist voice.However, he was fired from his post as an editor at Al-Watan, a liberal paper founded after the 911 terror attacks, just two months after he took the job in 2003. The country\u0027s ultra-conservative clerics had pushed back against his criticism of the powerful religious police and Ibn Taymiyah, a medieval cleric viewed as the spiritual forefather of Wahhabism, the conservative interpretation of Islam that is the founding tenant of the kingdom.Khoshaggi then served as media adviser to Al-Faisal, the former spy chief, who was at the time the ambassador to the United States.Khashoggi returned to Al-Watan in 2007, where he continued his criticism of the clerics as the late King Abdullah implemented cautious reforms to try to shake their hold. Three years later, he was forced to resign again after a series of articles criticizing Salafism, the ultra-conservative Sunni Islam movement from which Wahhabism stems.In 2010, Saudi billionaire Alwaleed bin Talal tapped him to lead his new TV station, touted as a rival to Qatari-funded Al-Jazeera, a staunch critic of the kingdom. But the new Al-Arab station, based in Bahrain, was shut down hours after it launched, for hosting a Bahraini opposition figure.Khoshaggi\u0027s final break with the Saudi authorities followed the Arab Spring protests that swept through the region in 2011, shaking the power base of traditional leaders and giving rise to Islamists, only to be followed by unprecedented crackdowns on those calling for change. Siding with the opposition in Egypt and Syria, Khashoggi became a vocal critic of his own government\u0027s stance there and a defender of moderate Islamists, which Riyadh considered an existential threat.\u0027This was a critical period in Arab history. I had to take a position. The Arab world had waited for this moment of freedom for a thousand years,\u0027 Khashoggi told a Turkey-based Syrian opposition television station last month, just days before he disappeared.He also criticized his government\u0027s diplomatic break with Qatar and war on Yemen as well as Riyadh\u0027s policy toward its archenemy, Iran, whose influence has grown in neighboring Yemen and in Syria.In the Sept. 23 interview, he called Saudi Arabia\u0027s foreign policy \u0027narrow minded,\u0027 and ridiculed its crackdown on political Islam, urging the kingdom to realign its policy to partner with Turkey, a close Qatar ally.\u0027Saudi is the mother and father of political Islam. It is based on political Islam,\u0027 Khoshaggi said. \u0027The only recipe to get Iranians out of Syria - it is not Trump or anyone else- it is through the support of the Syrian revolution. ... Saudi Arabia must return to supporting the Syrian revolution and partnering with Turkey on this.\u0027Eight days later, on October 2, he disappeared while on a visit to the consulate in Istanbul for paperwork to marry his Turkish fiancee. The consulate insists the writer left its premises alive, contradicting Turkish officials.Before his disappearance, Khoshaggi had been living since last year in the U.S. in self-imposed exile, after he fled the kingdom amid a crackdown on intellectuals and activists who criticized policies of Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman.\u0027As of now, I would say Mohammed bin Salman is acting like Putin. He is imposing very selective justice,\u0027 Khashoggi wrote in the Post last year after he fled the kingdom, saying he feared returning home.He described \u0027dramatic\u0027 scenes of arrest of government critics accused of receiving Qatari funding. They included a friend of Khashoggi\u0027s who had just returned from a trip to the U.S. as part of an official Saudi delegation.\u0027That is how breathtakingly fast you can fall out of favor with Saudi Arabia,\u0027 he wrote.                                   Police CCTV video made available through Turkish Newspaper Sabah allegedly shows suspects wandering near the consulate on Tuesday          One of the black Mercedes vans at the center of the operation was shown on CCTV leaving the consulate on Tuesday afternoon          Tawakkol Karman, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate for 2011 holds a picture of missing Saudi writer Jamal KhashoggiEconomist and citizen-journalist Essam al-Zamel was put on trial this month for criticising the government\u0027s economic strategy in a series of tweets and reports.

The Belfast bakers refused to make a cake decorated with the words \u0027Support Gay Marriage\u0027\u0027It is deeply humiliating, and an affront to human dignity, to deny someone a service because of that person\u0027s race, gender, disability, sexual orientation, religion or belief. But that is not what happened in this case.\u0027She went on: \u0027As to Mr Lee\u0027s claim based on sexual discrimination, the bakers did not refuse to fulfil his order because of his sexual orientation. They would have refused to make such a cake for any customer, irrespective of their sexual orientation.\u0027LGBTQ children and teens are at a three-fold higher risk of...Gay and transgender students and teachers could be turned...Share this articleThe court also said Mr Lee had no claim against Ashers on the grounds of religious belief or political opinion.Lady Hale added: \u0027The bakers could not refuse to supply their goods to Mr Lee because he was a gay man or supported gay marriage.    Ashers general manager Daniel McArthur said outside court: \u0027I want to start by thanking God. He has been with us during the challenges of the last four years. Through the Bible and the support of Christians, He has comforted us and sustained us. He is our rock and all His ways are just.\u0027We\u0027re delighted and relieved at today\u0027s ruling. We always knew we hadn\u0027t done anything wrong in turning down this order. After more than four years, the Supreme Court has now recognised that and we\u0027re very grateful. Grateful to the judges and especially grateful to God.\u0027We\u0027re particularly pleased the Supreme Court emphatically accepted what we\u0027ve said all along – we did not turn down this order because of the person who made it, but because of the message itself.\u0027The judges have given a clear signal today. In fact it couldn\u0027t be any clearer. Family businesses like ours are free to focus on giving all their customers the best service they can – without being forced to promote other people\u0027s campaigns.\u0027I know a lot of people will be glad to hear this ruling today, because this ruling protects freedom of speech and freedom of conscience for everyone.\u0027On behalf of my family can I say thank you to everyone who has supported us or prayed for us through all this.\u0027I do want to take this opportunity to thank our whole legal team for working so hard for us over the last four years. And also to thank the entire Christian Institute staff for their help and support from the very beginning.\u0027We want to move on from this now, and I\u0027m sure Mr Lee does too. And let me just finish by saying that he will always be welcome at any of our shops. Thank you\u0027.Mr Lee was also present for the latest ruling in a case which has attracted enormous attention.The bakery\u0027s appeal against the finding of discrimination was heard at the Supreme Court sitting in Belfast in May.During the hearing the justices were told that the owners were being forced to act against their religious beliefs.David Scoffield QC, for Ashers, argued that the state was penalising the baking firm, with the courts effectively compelling or forcing them to make a cake bearing a message with which they disagree as a matter of religious conscience.Speaking outside court, Mr McArthur said: \u0027We\u0027re delighted and relieved at today\u0027s ruling. We always knew we hadn\u0027t done anything wrong in turning down this order. \u0027After more than four years, the Supreme Court has now recognised that and we\u0027re very grateful.

Daniel McArthur said outside court that \u0027a lot of people will be glad to hear this ruling today\u0027Mounting an unsuccessful challenge at the Court of Appeal in Belfast in 2016, Ashers contended that it never had an issue with Mr Lee\u0027s sexuality, rather the message he was seeking to put on the cake.Now share your opinionMr Scoffield told the justices that the case, a simple transaction, raised an issue of principle since those with deeply-held religious or philosophical convictions could be compelled to act against their beliefs.Robin Allen QC, for Mr Lee, said: \u0027This was a relatively small incident in his life which has become enormously significant and continues to be so. That is a heavy burden to bear for one inidual.\u0027Speaking outside court, Mr Lee said: \u0027To me, this was never about a campaign or a statement. All I wanted was to order a cake in a shop that sold cakes to order.\u0027I paid my money, my money was taken and then a few days later it was refused. That made me feel like a second-class citizen.\u0027I\u0027m concerned not just for the implications for myself and other gay people, but for every single one of us.\u0027Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK or Ireland where same-sex marriage is outlawed, with Prime Minister Theresa May\u0027s DUP allies staunch opponents of changing the law.Following the ruling,  DUP leader Arlene Foster said the judgment was \u0027historic and seminal\u0027, adding: \u0027This has been a long journey for everyone involved in the case. \u0027I commend Amy \u0026amp Daniel McArthur for their grace and perseverance. This now provides clarity for people of all faiths and none.\u0027          The UK Supreme Court has today released its judgment regarding the widely-reported \u0027gay cake\u0027 case.In 2014, a gay man and activist, Gareth Lee, made an order to Ashers Bakery in Belfast for a cake to have a message \u0027Support Gay Marriage\u0027 in icing, together with an image of Sesame Street\u0027s Bert and Ernie. The bakery refused to fulfil Mr Lee\u0027s order, explaining that they were a Christian business and could not print the message, and a full refund was given.Mr Lee brought proceedings against Ashers for direct discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, and the Belfast County Court awarded £500 as damages. This decision was upheld by the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal.Ashers appealed, and the Supreme Court has ruled that the bakery did not commit direct discrimination against Mr Lee. In an important clarification of the concept of \u0027direct discrimination\u0027, it must be shown that an inidual has been treated less favourably because of a protected characteristic, which in this case was Mr Lee\u0027s sexual orientation. In this case, no evidence was shown that Mr Lee was treated less favourably because he was gay, and Ashers objected only to the message being requested. Had Mr Lee not been gay but requested the same message, Ashers would have again refused, so there was no less favourable treatment linked to Mr Lee\u0027s sexual orientation. Rather than the inidual messenger, it was the message Ashers was found to have discriminated against, which was not unlawful. Lady Hale stated that \u0027the bakers could not refuse to supply their goods to Mr Lee because he was a gay man or supported gay marriage, but that is quite different from obliging them to supply a cake iced with a message with which they profoundly disagreed.\u0027This judgment clarifies the narrow scope of direct discrimination.There must be evidence that an inidual\u0027s own protected characteristic was the reason for the less favourable treatment. Interestingly, had Mr Lee been a disabled person, and been refused a cake with a message supporting disability rights, it is arguably this would amount to \u0027discrimination arising from disability\u0027 and would be unlawful under the Equality Act, as it would be unfavourable treatment because of something arising in consequence of the inidual\u0027s disability. However, this broader concept of protection is only available to disabled persons. Other protected characteristics, like sexual orientation, gender, race and age can only rely on the narrower concept of direct discrimination, the limits of which have been starkly highlighted by the Supreme Court.Christian bakery wins appeal in Supreme Court \u0027gay cake\u0027 case"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/10/10/4FA12A5500000578-0-image-a-10_1539163057165.jpg","title":"Bono urges artists celebrate romance Europe counter negative views","story":"    Bono (pictured in Brussels today with EU Council President Donald Tusk) said the European project is a \u0027thought that needs to become a feeling\u0027 and pledged to make music to heap praise on it          Bono (pictured in Brussels today with EU parliament President Antonio Tajani in Brussels) declared that musicians should romanticise the EU by writing songs about the projectSpeaking in the EU capital today, he said the bloc\u0027s institutions are a \u0027brain … working to improve the lives of Europeans\u0027 and a \u0027loudly beating heart\u0027 bringing them together.He added: \u0027As an artist, I think I probably have a role to play in romancing the idea of Europe and seeing it as something warm-blooded,\u0027 said Bono.\u0027Europe is a thought that needs to become a feeling and I am, as an artist, in service of that.\u0027Tory MP Michael Fabricant said that while Europe is bursting with culture the EU is not.UK economy FLATLINES with growth dipping to zero amid...May defends her under-fire Universal Credit scheme after...Share this articleHe said:  \u0027Bono is right!

They published their findings in the July edition of Nature Genetics.The researchers who published in NBER built upon that work by using the index to analyze the genomic data and educational attainment of roughly 20,000 people born from 1905-1964.To be clear, researchers aren\u0027t saying that one gene accounts for intelligence. Rather, geneticists sough correlations in the millions of building blocks on the DNA\u0027s double-helix \u0027ladder\u0027 to better understand what they may explain when a multitude of factors are taken together.And their independent tests consistently found that inidual scores on the genetic index can predict college graduation rates.When that understanding is coupled with other genetic findings (for instance, those related to fetal brain development), researchers believe they have found an explanation for an 11-13 percent variation in academic achievement between the rich and poor.One limitation of both studies is that data was predominately drawn from white people because the vast majority of genomic data that researchers have to work with comes from people of European descent.Genes, Education, and Labor Market Outcomes: Evidence from the Health and Retirement StudyGene discovery and polygenic prediction from a genome-wide association study of educational attainment in 1.1 million iniduals | Nature Genetics"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/10/01/512BA67300000578-0-image-a-1_1539133004435.jpg","title":"Property tycoon Nick Candy rents luxury Knightsbridge penthouse 7 8m year","story":"    Nick Candy (pictured with his wife, Holly Valance) has taken out a £80million mortgage           The billionaire also makes an income charting his custom-designed £26million yacht, named \u0027II.II.\u0027, when he is not using it          The owner used a mortgage from Credit Suisse UK Ltd to pay some £160 million for the penthouse at One Hyde Park          The apartment is listed as being worth £160million, which would make it the most expensive flat in the UK (pictured: a master bedroom in the luxury development) Mr Candy, 45, helped his 44-year-old brother Christian build the block.

Christian (left), 43, has assets reportedly valued at £1.2billion and his firm owns properties worth £900million.

Here, though, we needed someone jockey-light to mount the zebra and in 2014 when I made his image, I was quite a big boy, so we went with someone else. I come from a fashion background. Growing up, I used to buy a lot of magazines that I’d tear up, then stick the images on the wall. I always create everything from scratch – there is no digital post-production in my work.For this particular image I wanted to create a quasi-funereal procession, with pomp and fanfare. I decorated the zebra a bit like a holy cow in India, or a Spanish horse, or a dressage champion, giving it sabre teeth and custom-made accessories.At first we were looking to get a live zebra and then, in a studio where I was having my body cast for a sculpture, I found this taxidermied one. Sadly, I had to give him back after the shoot. I’ve since seen him in a TV advert, and once, at a beach party. He has a life all of his own!We sourced funeral wreaths from all over Cape Town – plastic flowers, porcelain flowers – that we then stitched on to nets. We turned the light down to make it cold and blue, and hung a large piece of chintzy fabric as the background. I liked that it looked like a cross between the galaxy and an English garden.As much as my utopia is inspired by my own black, queer story – and all of my work is in some way autobiographical – I like to remove both skin and faces. I think people presume that they understand a person’s story just from their skin.The phrase also refers to the paranoid rightwing conspiracy theory that Mandela’s death would precipitate a retaliation they called die nag van die lang messe. Of course, when Mandela did die, this didn’t happen. This scene is both a procession and a pantomime. I wanted camp and sarcasm: “This is us, we’re about to go do a purge, can you believe us?” It is a play on that unfounded settler panic, because we’re not killing each other. We are steamrolling ahead towards progress instead. This image has done wonders for both my studio’s bank account and for South African art. It’s part of the permanent collection at the Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa in Cape Town. Seeing black children standing in front of it, looking up in wonder at a person riding a zebra, is a beautiful thing. The image stands two metres tall – the kids are right there with the animal!

Looked down on at the Bauhaus and fleeing the Nazis, they fell in love, moved to America – and changed the course of art history On 5 December 1933, the Asheville Citizen ran a photograph over the lukewarm caption: “Germans to teach art near here.” The Germans in question – the couple in the photo – were Josef and Anni Albers. They had arrived in the United States from Berlin a week earlier. Six months before that, menaced by the Nazis, the Bauhaus had closed its doors. The Albers had spent more than a decade teaching there, he as Meister of the foundation course, she as head of the weaving workshop. Desperate to leave Germany – Anni’s family were Jewish – they had taken jobs in a place neither had heard of: poring over an atlas, the pair had searched in vain for North Carolina in maps of the Philippines. The Bauhaus had been the world’s most renowned design school. The school they were to teach at now had 30 students, was six months old, in the back of beyond and completely unknown. It had no art department. It was called Black Mountain College.What the Albers did there is still being felt. When the architect Philip Johnson recommended Josef Albers to Black Mountain’s founder and first rector as a teacher of art, he had added the caveat: “He has one defect.”“I thought, my God, there’s a cleft palate coming up,” John Andrew Rice recalled. “Because I knew a linguistic expert who had a cleft palate. Or he’s blind.” Johnson’s defect, in fact, was that Albers spoke no English. Rice, relieved, said: “What’s the matter with that?” and gave him the job.The gamble paid off. By the time the Albers arrived in Asheville, Josef had acquired enough English to answer the question of his ambitions at the school with the eloquently inarticulate line: “To make open the eyes.” He had turned 45 that March too old, as he said, to learn “another flexibility of the mouth”. When he died in Connecticut 43 years later, his speech was still famously hit-and-miss. As the wife of one Black Mountain colleague was to put it: “Albers had a wonderful inability with English.” This turned out to be a unexpected plus.Lacking words, Josef fell back on gestures. Photographs of his classes at the Bauhaus show students standing in a respectful circle while their professor talks them, theatrically, through their work. Photos at Black Mountain show him waving his arms and standing on chairs, pulling dramatic faces and tracing squares in the air with his forefinger. His students, like a happy corps de ballet, imitate him. Art became a matter not just of the eye, but of the body: “Art is performance!” Josef said. He had already broadened the idea of what it might be by having his students work with Coke bottles, bits of wire, Lucky Strike packets, moss. Now, their very movements were made a material.Willy-nilly, Black Mountain became the centre of what, long after it had shut in 1957, would at last be dubbed interdisciplinarity. By that time, the school’s alumni and staff had taken its message out into the world. Robert Rauschenberg’s Combines owe their ordered mess to the matière lessons their creator had with Josef at Black Mountain in 1949. The composer John Cage, whom Albers had invited to teach at the school, likened their ideas on performance to “peas in a pod”. In 1952, three years after the Albers had left Black Mountain for Yale, Cage and his partner, Merce Cunningham, staged a music-cum-dance piece in the college dining hall, using Rauschenberg’s White Paintings as decor. It has a good claim to having been the world’s first-ever “happening”.The roots of all this lay in the Bauhaus, although not in the way one might expect. As the fabled design school nears its centenary – it opened in Weimar on 1 April 1919 – the Bauhaus remains undyingly cool: the distant descendants of Marianne Brandt’s lamp can be found in any Ikea catalogue, of Marcel Breuer’s Wassily chair in most Conran shops. If the school’s design aesthetic was modern enough, though, its social attitudes were not always so.Masters at the early Bauhaus were to a man middle class. Paul Klee’s father was a musicologist, Kandinsky’s a vaguely aristocratic tea broker, Bauhaus founder Walter Gropius’s, like his son, a successful architect. Josef’s father was a painter and decorator from a coal-mining town in the Ruhr. The others had been educated at gymnasiums, Josef at a humble church school. He spoke, to his dying day, with a Ruhrpott accent. It took years for Gropius to make him a Meister, while younger men such as László Moholy-Nagy – a university-taught lawyer with nice vowels – were promoted over his head.Anni’s problem was more intractable. She was socially grand – her mother’s family owned Germany’s largest publishing house – but a woman. Female Bauhäusler – “the beautiful sex” – were barred from what Gropius called “the heavier craft areas”. No sculpture, no woodwork or metalwork no painting. Anni, like most women at the school, was pushed into weaving. “These limp threads,” she recalled, disgusted. A shared sense of ill treatment drew the 34-year-old ex-schoolteacher from Bottrop and the 23-year-old Berlin socialite together. At Black Mountain, dressed invariably in white, they would be known as “male and female of the same species”. It was the adversity they had faced at the Bauhaus that had made them so.Whatever their differences in background, as artists their reaction to maltreatment was the same. Directed by Gropius to serve an apprenticeship in the Bauhaus’s wall-painting workshop, Josef pointed out that his father was a painter and decorator and that he had been painting walls since he was a boy. When Gropius said that he would nonetheless have to attend the workshop or leave the Bauhaus, Albers became, as he said, “a freelance”. Doing the bare minimum of classwork, he took to the rubbish dumps of Weimar. There he found the bits of broken glass and wire that he turned into so-called “shard paintings” – works such as Gitterbild and Kaiserlich, which look like church windows but are made out of junk. Flicking two grimy fingers at authority, they are perhaps the most original artworks to come out of the early Bauhaus, and certainly the most bolshy. Gropius understood this. In March 1921, he saw one of the Glasbilder in a show of student work at the school’s gallery. On the strength of it, Albers was taken on as a journeyman that day.Anni, meanwhile, waged subtler war. At first glance, the work in her show at Tate Modern this autumn may look much as you’d expect of a nicely brought-up rich girl from Berlin – which is to say, refined and poised. It is both of those things, but a great deal more besides. Excluded, as a woman, from the beefier Bauhaus departments, Anni set about masculinising weaving.If her husband had discovered the modernist grid in the off-the-peg wire mesh of his shard paintings, Anni found it in the logic of the loom. Against the zaniness of the early Bauhaus – a place of vegans, Zoroastrians, spiritualists and Theosophists – the rationalism of warp and weft came, she said, as “a railing”. As the 20s progressed, her work became ever more complex. Noting Klee’s dictum about taking a line for a walk, she set out, she said, “to take thread everywhere”. The formal beauty of the results belies their difficulty: Albers had, said the architect Buckminster Fuller, a complete “realisation of the complex structure of fabrics”. If she acknowledged Klee as an influence, she mostly spoke of her work in terms not of art but of architecture and engineering.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.First up, some corrections. Tom Mooney has come to a new understanding of William Faulkner’s As I Lay Dying:When you’re wrong, you’re wrong. And I was completely wrong about William Faulkner. As I Lay Dying is a phenomenal book. I struggled like hell with Faulkner when I first tried him a few years ago but this time he sang to me and I heard every word. This tragic, rich, epic book is simply incredible.It’s been eight – nine years since I gave up on Thomas Mann’s The Magic Mountain – the only book other than The Power of Now (a rather bizarre choice of gift that I received) I’ve never finished. The fact The Magic Mountain is rated so highly by so many people only added to the sense of failure. I really couldn’t see how people had not only completed it, but enjoyed it.Then someone recommended John Woods’ translation to me and I cannot believe the contrast … it’s like reading a totally different book. The whole tone has changed – what was a dry and seemingly humourless book now has me sniggering away to myself. While still very wordy, it’s now a joy to read.Talking of wordy, sursumcorda has just “cracked open” A Small Boy and Others by Henry James:Well not exactly cracked open. I’ve put on my white gloves and reached for my lorgnette. This is a handsome volume from The Library of America, complete with silk bookmark, so serious face on here.James started writing this memoir at the behest of his sister-in-law, following the death of his beloved brother William. Wiilliam and Alice had travelled to England in some alarm at the state of Henry’s health but William died suddenly shortly after their return to Chocorua. (Don’t you love that place-name. I think Wallace Stevens loved it too.) Henry wrote to Alice in 1911: “The book I see \u0026amp feel will be difficult \u0026amp unprecedented \u0026amp perilous - but if I bring it off it will be exquisite and unique”.Henry’s health was still precarious - he died in 1916 - so this is a heartfelt labour of love.Sometimes, an immediate and “undemanding” read can be just as satisfying. Cookyhunter recommends Anthony Trollope’s Barchester Towers:I have been reading Trollope for months now (with forays into crime and children’s books every now and then). He’s just such a comfortable, undemanding, gentle read, and so funny, too! Right now I am deep in Barchester Towers. Everyone is convinced that Eleanor is keen on the hideous, unctuous Slope with his moist handshake and slithery cunning. Slope himself is battling Mrs Proudie over the control of the feeble bish. He’s also beguiled by the fascinating, amoral Madeleine and her sofa of sin. What a tonic!Ian Rankin’s Rebus novels have gripped BobHammond2:I’m going to an event with Ian Rankin in Manchester in a couple of weeks (my wife is a big fan) so have been working my way through the early Rebus novels in preparation. They are incredibly more-ish - I raced through the first three in a fortnight and am now gripped by the fourth, Strip Jack. Rebus seems like an irascible but endearing character with the obligatory troubled back story and home life.Meanwhile, Ellie Rose has found interesting parallels with Rebus in William McIlvanney’s Laidlaw trilogy:They are great reads, set in the seamy underbelly of 1970s Glasgow. Laidlaw is a policeman whose conscience won’t let him see the world in black and white, us and them, like some of his colleagues do, and you can see in him the template for some later obsessive cops (Rebus comes to mind). Unlike Rebus, though, his genuine affection for the drunks, down-and-outs and petty thieves of Glasgow is actually quite touching, and makes a change from the crime novel staple of the misanthropic detective.McIlvanney has a talent for a pithy sentence, too. Laidlaw hooked me on page nine with the sentence “His face was an argument you couldn’t win” and wouldn’t let me go until I finished the sequel, The Papers of Tony Veitch.The story of a DIY spy who plots to sell US secrets, if he can find any way to contact someone to sell them to. A man who creates secret messages using Renaissance-era cryptography, built up with tables of letters and keywords (the author’s explanation is most interesting), only to forget his own keywords from time to time.Sounds even tougher than online banking…Interesting links about books and readingIf you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us on : simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

We’re using it because we feel that it is important to create a spacevenue that includes erse perspectives. It was agreed during our conversations with collaborators as the programme developed.”But in a statement on Wednesday, the museum rowed back from its defence of the word and apologised for the use of the term. The decision to use it had come from a desire to be inclusive, and it was not used in other contexts by the museum, it said.“We should have put more thought into whether this was the right term to use when communicating about the event. We made a mistake, and we should not have used it. We’re sorry that we made the wrong call.“We invite challenges to our thinking and we listen to our audience, so we’re removing the word from the website and from our communications about the event.”The decision came after hundreds of Twitter users derided the use of “womxn”, calling for the Wellcome Collection to use the term “women”.The Labour MP Jess Phillips said: “I’ve never met a trans woman who was offended by the word woman being used, so I’m not sure why this keeps happening. As if internet dissent now replaces public policy. I get what they are trying to do but why is it only women not men where this applies.”The writer and columnist Tracy King said: “So your categories are Men miscellaneous other? You should have a serious think about what you’re actually trying to communicate here and to whom.”When the Twitter user Richard Ayres asked how the word was pronounced, another user, Suzie Leighton, responded: “Bullshixt.”The writer Gregory Norminton‏ wrote: “This is bonkers. Women aren’t even allowed to have an undisfigured word to denote them. Please be consistent and refer to men as mxn.”Online promotional material for the event uses the word womxn and links to a definition from the Urban Dictionary, which states that the word is more inclusive and shows “womxn are not the extension of men”. It adds that the word is “more intersectional than womyn because it includes trans-women and women of color”.But critics highlighted other definitions of woman used by the Urban Dictionary, which include “a manipulative human” and “extremely expensive, extremely time consuming”.The writer Claire King responded: “This is ridiculous. And you are supporting it by linking to Urban Dictionary? Seriously? As far as I know, the word ‘women’ has always included women of colour. Correct me if I’m wrong.”The Twitter user Sam Baxter asked: “Who exactly is this meant to include? Trans women call themselves women, non-binary people don’t call themselves women at all. The only thing that comes to mind is that this could be to include both ‘woman’ and ‘women’, which implies there are women who identify as plurals.”Other users suggested that the Wellcome Collection needed to have a long, hard think about its use of language. The TV executive Melanie Jappy‏ advised them: “Please. Just go and sit down and have a good think. And then consider apologising.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/812c27bb49a634d3b741eaea2db2724bb472a4f9/0_0_4064_2438/master/4064.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a0be9182c0b163cc8fc5ca621b13f88","title":"music disappearing school curriculum england survey gcse a level","story":"Fewer schools in England offering subject at A-level and fewer pupils taking it at GCSEMusic could disappear from the curriculum, as research shows the number of schools offering the subject at A-level is in sharp decline and fewer students are taking it at GCSE.The report’s author, Duncan Mackrill, a senior teaching fellow at Sussex University, said: “Music’s place in the secondary curriculum continues to be precariously balanced or disappearing in a significant number of schools. Without a change to require a balanced curriculum in all schools, we are in danger of music education becoming, in many cases, the preserve of those who can pay.”In a separate report, the Local Government Association, which represents 370 councils in England and Wales, said music lessons in schools would be under threat if the government failed to cover the cost of the teacher pay rise to centrally employed music teachers.Anntoinette Bramble, the chair of the LGA’s children and young people board, said: “Local government is already under massive financial pressure, with many services overstretched. If this additional cost is left for councils to pick up then they will be put in the very difficult position of being forced to reduce certain types of education provision including music teaching.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a71e1c0685b0576f7702dd6944cd04693a87e8e/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5ea1b51b9fec453b70e317181837a49","title":"be bold eight definitive autumn menswear trends oversized coats stompy shoes","story":"From oversized coats to stompy shoes, the autumn message for menswear is pump up the volumeWhat to do about Insta-fashion, clothes designed for your feed rather than for looking chic. There are signs of a shift brewing. Vogue Hommes Paris addressed this notion with the cover line: “Chic is back.” The Row, the women’s label by the Olsen twins, known for luxury minimalism, is launching menswear, while Riccardo Tisci’s first Burberry show last month featured a series of very restrained looks built around clean lines and tailoring. The concept of chic to me is the French actor Louis Garrel in an overcoat, vintage Jil Sander or an “easy suit” look. The latter is achievable via Arket (sizes come up small) and Cos, which both offer modern versions of tailored jackets that feel relaxed rather than stuffy. And after all, ease is surely the epitome of chic.I’ll keep this brief. There is nothing exciting to say about Chelsea boots or cult flashy sneakers. Instead, buy some shoes or boots that have a chunky sole – something that makes you walk as if you’re taking part in a Rick Owens show. The brand Marsèll is very good at this, as is Prada. My latest stompers are from Grenson’s collaboration with Craig Green. The high street is full of Dr Martens-inspired treads from Office to Asos. That’s all.More of a sidenote, as it’s not for everyone, but the talking point this season is the balaclava. Inspired by Calvin Klein’s version, it is admittedly niche, but will see you through a blizzard with full fashion reputation intact. Alternatively, you could go headscarf (Gucci), bucket hat (Prada) or even gimp mask (Moschino) – each claims to be runway-approved. But if I were to argue the case for a playful hat this season, it would the bobble beanie. See Acne Design for fancy, or River Island for a bargain. I’m sure there is an age limit on this, but age limits are always very last season.

A full shift occurs not just in tone, with suspense boiling over into scalding insanity, but in the narrative mode, as the established set of unspoken rules governing the universe get violently upended. As soon as the viewer believes they’ve got a grip on what sort of horror story they’re in for, Evans demonstrates that in the chaotic universe contained within his camera, anything can happen. And just about everything does Evans’s maximalist more-is-more ethic piles on one Grand Guignol spectacle after another, building to an operatic, hallucinatory climax that leaves our puny reason behind for a metaphysical nirvana. Polarizing yet undeniably fascinating, the bait-and-switch horror film lures its viewer into a false sense of terrified security before pouncing in an anything-goes frenzy, and Evans’s latest is a prime specimen.For the first hour, he’d like you to believe you’ve wandered into a particularly reverent Wicker Man homage, and he makes the legwork of setting this trap a ersion all its own. At the dawn of the 20th century, a wastrel by the name of Thomas Richardson (Dan Stevens) rouses himself from an opium stupor long enough to accept an assignment from the upper-crust family that’s finally found a purpose for their black sheep. He’s to set a course for the lush, faraway island where his sister Andrea (Lucy Boynton) has been taken captive by the mad prophet Malcolm (a vainglorious Michael Sheen) and his loyal followers. Relative even to his expectations for a secluded sect of zealots, Thomas immediately senses something’s amiss. Malcolm’s brood follows religious convictions, but Thomas can’t figure out what they actually worship. Naturally, their notions of the sacred and the profane commingle in blood.At first, Evans adheres to expectations, both of his genre and of himself as a stylist. This strain of period barbarity calls for fittingly baroque torture, and he doesn’t play it stingy with the grotesquerie. (Cracked craniums, snapped spines, and flensed fingers – oh my.) Stretching racks, crude forceps, and drills of every shape and size push the gloriously gratuitous set pieces to continue topping themselves, and from the looks of it, the Netflix bean-counters spared no expense on corn syrup. Evans works with gore the way Pollock worked with oil paints, slathering layer after layer until the hectic disorder emerges as the focal point. He keeps with that manic pitch in his shooting, which favors the whip pans and shaky handheld work that made the Raid movies into a sedentary cardio workout. Though the milieu and premise don’t allow for quite as much hand-to-hand combat, Evans can’t resist sneaking in a beatdown or two, nimbly handled by Stevens as he continues to prove and re-prove his potential as an action hero. In a just world, the James Bond tuxedo would await.He takes a circuitous path through a subplot involving a forbidden romance between villagers to get there, but when Evans does arrive at the changeover to complete lunacy, he lavishes the patient faithful with exquisite punishments. There’s going for it and then there’s going for it, and only a director in the latter camp would dare to attempt the back half’s unholy fusion of BDSM, gothic, and exploitation-blood-bucket aesthetics. He indulges every artistic whim, no matter how outré, a dicey strategy that only works when a director has technical skill and clarity of vision. Evans has the first in spades, working aerial and low-angle shots for all they’re worth, lacking only in the second. He starts to lose the thread as supernatural elements come into play, and yet any resultant confusion fits right in with the final act’s regression to primal savagery.Anyone not put off by the bodily mutilations and hefty run time of last year’s A Cure For Wellness, anyone who sees untethered ambition as a virtue even when it goes slightly awry, anyone with a habit of ordering their sandwiches “with everything on it” — they’ll be the ones to appreciate the wild abandon with which Evans yanks out all the stops. His is the cinema of “never enough”, of not saying “when”, of “no such thing as too much”. While a viewer requires a high threshold for the bizarre to stay with him through to the final glimpse of ine ecstasy, the devout disciples that remain will not go unrewarded. This is Evans’s truest act of transmogrification: turning one type of “cult movie” into the other."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a5d283bb9e14d029d120927fa4364d917633f20/40_0_2813_1688/master/2813.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9309bc3fcfdf1e82e9bc00e4de36fd95","title":"film industry london screen academy","story":"Harry Potter, Bond and Bridget Jones producers co-found sixth form academy aimed at making industry more erse and accessibleApplications have opened today for a new sixth-form academy for 16- to 19-year-olds that has been founded by some of the British film industry’s most successful figures, including the producers of the Bond and Harry Potter films.The London Screen Academy (LSA), a free school based in the London borough of Islington but open to applicants from across the English capital, will open in September 2019 and envisage providing a two-year course preparing students for a career in the film and TV industry. Its principal designate Nick Watkiss stressed, at the LSA’s prospective launch at the Everyman Screen on the Green on Wednesday, that it is not a school for the performing arts (such as the Brit school, in Croydon) but rather will concentrate on teaching all the behind-the-camera roles, ranging from costume design and production management to distribution and marketing.Speaking at the launch, LSA co-founder David Heyman, producer of all seven Harry Potter films as well as Gravity and Paddington, said: “It is a legitimate problem that the screen industries don’t in any way reflect modern Britain. The number of sets we have been on that lack social, ethnic and economic ersity – it’s very clear.”Heyman said the school can also help to end the “haphazard” nature of entry into the industry. “Many young people don’t believe it’s a possibility that they can work in film and TV,” he said. “They may not understand that being involved in film and TV is not just in front of the camera or as director. The screen industries are among the fastest growing sectors in the country, the amount of jobs are substantial. It makes so much sense to educate students and make them set-ready by the time they graduate.”The LSA’s first intake will be of 300 students, expanding eventually to a capacity of 800-1000, and applicants will face an assessment interview. On graduating, students will receive a UAL diploma, equivalent to three A-levels. The school will be based at Ladbroke House in Islington, a former factory that was the subject of controversy when the Department for Education spent £33.5m in 2016 to purchase the building from property developers.The original plans for an all-ages secondary school were greeted with considerable local opposition as it would have meant nearby schools would face increased competition for scant resources however, it was approved after the focus was switched to specialist teaching for 16-year-olds and older.Eric Fellner, co-chair of Working Title and producer of a string of hits including Les Misérables, Love Actually and the Bridget Jones films, said the change in direction was to the project’s advantage. “Once we stated to understand the world of education, we realised it was better to start at 16, as the likelihood of students knowing that this is a world they want to work in and bringing something positive to the table was much greater.”Another of the school’s co-founders, Bond producer Barbara Broccoli, has been one of  campaigners against harassment and bullying in the British entertainment industry, and Fellner says that the school will equip students to deal with any instances they may encounter once they have moved on to work. “All the studios we work with have rigorous anti-bullying and anti-harassment guidelines, with emergency helplines, and legal codes to deal with it. We will equip the students with all that knowledge and ability to protect themselves.”He added: “We are lucky and we have the resources to help. This is not a vanity project: it is designed to try and build a new world in the film industry. We want it to become a part of the film industry, and then we can hand it over. If we get the model right, it can then be replicated across the UK – in Liverpool, in Birmingham, in Edinburgh – and in any creative industry.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/660972eaaf9f19525117c13f75581125e0bde20f/0_0_2700_1620/master/2700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=874d5d44e060d0fad3738856f31757c2","title":"mandy review nicolas cage andrea riseborough panos cosmatos","story":"Cage is on magnificent, mind-boggling form as a chainsaw-wielding lumberjack hunting the gang who invaded his homeNow I need someone to kiss me and stop me from shaking. Mandy, starring Nicolas Cage, is a death-metal horror about a guy seeking revenge for the murder of his girlfriend … named Mandy. There is some serious vexation here. The displeasure is brought onstream. Granted, every YouTube consumer knows about “Cage rage”. But this time Cage really is as cross as two sticks.This outrageously over the top film is nothing if not uninhibited, often visually amazing, not to say barking mad. There has been some discussion about how Cage is revolutionising acting, challenging the naturalist consensus. And maybe he is – although it’s possible that Mandy is his tribute to how an American version of Sir Donald Wolfit might play Titus Andronicus. Cage certainly takes us way beyond the laugh withlaugh at debate. He’s absurd, or maybe absurdist, yet the question of how intentional this is doesn’t take away from the fact that he is sometimes weirdly magnificent. His character certainly has a great gag about Erik Estrada.The year is 1983 and Cage plays Red, a logging worker who is professionally pretty handy with a chainsaw. (Uh, oh.) At the end of a tough temporary gig chopping down trees, Red drives back to his remote cabin (while listening to Ronald Reagan on the radio) where his partner Mandy (Andrea Riseborough) is to be found, a sensitive soul who whiles away the days drawing intensely detailed comic-book-style figures. They are a blissfully happy couple, but the dread-filled electronic score from the late Jóhann Jóhannsson, like a gaunt church organ of doom, makes sure we realise no good can come of this.A Manson-esque hippy-weirdo gang shows up, led by one Jeremiah Sand, played by Linus Roache. Jeremiah and his goons tie them both up and exact various horrific tortures on her, which after their departure are to send Red off on his eye-for-an-eye odyssey. There really are some extraordinary scenes. The druggily distended moment when Jeremiah leans in close to Mandy to tell her about his vision becomes very grisly in the firelight as his face morphs into hers.And then of course there are the Cage fireworks, most mind-boggling when at the apex of his grief and ferocity he crashes into the bathroom, and chugs a bottle of vodka after sloshing it on his wounds, screaming horribly the while. It is utterly bizarre when, in shock, he stares at the TV in the corner, which is blaring an ad for something called “Cheddar Goblin”. Sadly, it is a fictional ad, created for this film.Mandy got an awful lot of laughs from a crowded theatre when I saw it, all of them deserved, I think, with explicit shots dropped in at the end of Cage doing some deliberately extreme mugging. Is director Panos Cosmatos hedging his bets? I don’t know. It’s an uncompromising midnight movie."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09d671685287f46250be04704a38215a1ba1c41a/1_0_3599_2159/master/3599.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2619089ae7ccb278b3ce7bfb51455a3f","title":"could you handle the worlds most long distance relationship","story":"The journey to becoming an astronaut requires extreme physical fitness and sky-high academic achievement. Much less documented, however, is the need for astronauts and their families to weather intense emotional strain. As Neil Armstrong biopic First Man explores, for those left at home, it is quite literally the world’s most long-distance relationshipIn 1966, three years before her husband, Neil, became the first person to walk on the moon, Janet Armstrong was pictured at home by Life magazine. Neil was in orbit in the Gemini 8 spacecraft, but it had started to spin dangerously out of control. Suddenly, his safe return was in doubt.At that moment, to protect Janet and the family from any bad news, Neil’s Nasa bosses restricted the family’s access to its live radio feed, known as the “squawk box”.Life magazine showed her kneeling in front of the device, as if praying for Neil’s safe return. In fact, she was furious. “I was on my knees there with my eyes closed trying to concentrate on what was being said,” she later explained. “But it came out that I was in a praying position and blah, blah, blah. Well, that’s not true.” Later, she would confront Nasa bosses and warn them not to pull a similar stunt again.It’s a small story, one of hundreds of tiny insights in the book First Man: The Life of Neil A Armstrong, which has now been adapted into a film. Small, but significant, as the psychological effects of being an astronaut, or the family of an astronaut, are rarely explored.In this instance, the mass media were camped in the living room of a mother of two living sons and one daughter, who died aged two from a brain tumour four years previously. The photographer is watching through the lens as Janet tries to establish whether she will ever see her husband again.While he’s certainly having a bad day at the office, it’s no picnic for the loved ones he left at home, either.“It can be harder for the ones left behind than the one doing it,” says psychotherapist Jennie Miller. “If you’re the one doing it, you have a sense of some control, of having been trained to do your level best to get back. With control we get a sense of being OK. It’s the difference between learning to drive a car and being a passenger. But if you’re the loved one, you have zero control.”Janet Armstrong was an intelligent, thoughtful woman whose frustration at her treatment by both Nasa and her husband occasionally pokes through even the sanitised Life magazine interviews conducted between 1966 and 1969.“People are always asking me what it is like to be married to an astronaut,” Janet told the magazine. “What it’s like for me to be the wife of Neil Armstrong is the more appropriate question.”In public, common with the other wives of astronauts, Janet maintained the wholesome picture-postcard image of the all-American family. In private, many of the wives felt like they didn’t have much say in what was going on. “We would meet over in the Nasa auditorium,” she is quoted as saying in First Man. “We would get all dressed up and we would have to put our gloves on to get, what I felt was, lectured: ‘Keep a stiff upper lip, girls.’”Why would Janet always be the one to confront authority? Perhaps, says psychotherapist Miller, the roots of her outspokenness lay in the premature death of her daughter, Karen Anne.“The impact of losing a child can sometimes affect people in remarkable ways. They think: ‘I’ve experienced the worst pain that life can throw at me, so I don’t give a damn what you think about me any more.’“I live and work near Portsmouth naval base, so I see couples who don’t see each other for 18 months, or even two years at a time. While they’re not going to the moon, it’s not that dissimilar. Even when an astronaut is home, with all the training and so on, I imagine their head is in a different place.”It’s a theory borne out by the recollections of astronaut Gene Cernan, the commander of Apollo 17, the last lunar mission.But could such problems be avoided, and how would an expert today prepare families for what lies ahead?“If you’re going to do work like that, you’d want to talk to someone before any training begins and prepare people for the impact on their lives,” Miller says. “If I were seeing a couple like this, I’d do empathy work with the pair of them, so they each get a sense of what it is like to be the other. In the case of the Armstrongs, he needs to realise that she’s lost a child, and she may now lose a husband in such a public way.”When a couple are facing a big challenge, what can happen is that each withdraws into themselves and they build up too solid a boundary in order to survive, in order not to be vulnerable. You need to make sure you let the right people in.”This one small step could be a giant leap.First Man is released nationwide on 12 October – book tickets here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bae30f616f41550d91d8cccd3ab4bf2abab730cc/0_825_4636_2782/master/4636.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54c04fc6fd4c000c0b27e558d5d63e7c","title":"why the moon landing was a giant leap for mankind","story":"Forty-nine years after Neil Armstrong made history by becoming the first man to walk on the moon, new film First Man proves the event is still one of the most significant achievements of humanityNeil Armstrong was the first man on the moon and the master of the understatement. “It, you know, was a pretty simple statement, talking about stepping off something,” he later said when asked about his legendary first words on the lunar surface. “It was what it was.”Shrewdly chosen by Nasa to make that mission work – to troubleshoot unpredictable life and death situations on the fly and to represent not just America but the world – Armstrong was unquestionably the man for the job. Flying to the moon, landing and walking on it, let alone getting home safely, was man conquering the impossible. The stuff of dreams. Science fiction author Arthur C Clarke wrote that, from then on, history and fiction had “become inexorably linked”.Despite his humility, Armstrong had spent some time thinking of what he might say when he stepped on to the moon – he knew what it meant. “Humankind has had some amazing journeys,” says James Hansen, professor of history at Alabama’s Auburn University and author of the book First Man: The Life of Neil A Armstrong, from which Damien Chazelle’s film First Man is adapted. “There have been major technological events. Splitting the atom. But going to the moon, it’s kind of like the Chinese stepping off the Formosa straits for the first time. The major movement of peoples. The Vikings making it all the way to Greenland. These amazing stories of humanity moving and seeking and exploring. If we just stay put in one place, we don’t learn. To have our species leaving our own planet and stepping on to another heavenly body for the first time, it’s a major event in the history of humankind. Neil certainly recognised that, and I think he built that into the words that he said when he walked off the lunar module on to the surface.”The world witnessed Armstrong’s great leap: nearly 600 million rapt people, a fifth of the planet’s population back then, were glued to their radios and televisions, all experiencing the event. John F Kennedy had, in 1961, promised that it would happen by the end of the decade: “The eyes of the world now look into space, to the moon and to the planets beyond,” he said. Nasa then raced to make that wild promise a reality, and not without loss of life along the way. But the world needed it.“It was a time of such incredibly high tension nationally and internationally, and I think everyone felt we were right on the brink of potential world war III,” said Armstrong in 2001. “I don’t think anybody, even the people in the backwoods of Montana, were unaware of this tension. I was very aware of it.” Getting to the moon, he thought, could transcend it all. Armstrong was a fighter pilot between 1950 and 1952, flying 78 missions in the Korean war before he was 22. “He never showed any fear in any of his close calls,” said his brother Dean. He became a research pilot for Nasa, flying more than 200 different aircraft before becoming an astronaut. “The unknowns were rampant,” he later said of the moon landing, but he batted off phantom computer alarms, enormous boulders and just 20 seconds of fuel remaining as he touched down. “The Eagle has landed,” he radioed to Houston. “You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue, we’re breathing again,” the controller responded.First Man is a soulful, sensitive portrayal of Armstrong’s personal journey, with Damien Chazelle focusing on Armstrong’s intimate thoughts and feelings, bringing one of history’s most iconic moments down to Earth. “This was a feat beyond imagination – it was truly a giant leap for mankind,” says Chazelle. “This film is about one of the most extraordinary accomplishments not only in American history, but in human history. My hope is that by digging under the surface and humanising the icon, we can better understand just how difficult, audacious and heroic this moment really was.”By concentrating on the man, Chazelle makes his film resonate for all of us – as the event itself did 49 years ago. “The plaque left on the leg of the lunar lander said: ‘Here, men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the moon. We came in peace for all mankind,’” says Hansen. “This was a human achievement that we all share. It was a moment of global commonality and consciousness, something we all participated in. It was a brief pause in all the disillusion of humankind – we all took a breath and stepped away and saw that we had something very much in common.”With men having set foot on the moon, anything seemed possible. The future had begun, and with it a world of opportunity. To experience it was to be inspired. “He changed the world. And, of course, he certainly changed me,” wrote science communicator Bill Nye after Armstrong died in 2012. “Neil Armstrong raised the expectations, the hopes and dreams of every human on Earth. Thanks to him, we all believe that humans can achieve great things, that we can learn about our place among the stars, that we can all reach up and out, that we can fly, and change the world.”First Man is released nationwide on 12 October – book tickets here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1d75bb5f2e633b3a1b44bbe5c94b2c6e9f83c71/681_0_3215_1930/master/3215.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026bm=normal\u0026ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly9hc3NldHMuZ3VpbS5jby51ay9pbWFnZXMvb3ZlcmxheXMvZDM1ODZhNWVmNTc4MTc1NmQyMWEzYjYzNWU1MTcxNDEvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=e7a782b89828ac0e7b127f121c42ce40","title":"ben thornley manchester united giggs scholes beckham drinking book","story":"It was a Sunday get-together that featured Manchester United royalty. Sir Matt Busby was there and so was Nobby Stiles, among others. It was the early 1990s the venue a wine bar in Sale, and the question was for Stiles, then in charge of the B team at Old Trafford. Who was the best up-and-coming youngster at the club?Stiles did not hesitate. “Ben Thornley,” he replied. What, even including Ryan Giggs? “Ben is the closest I’ve seen to George Best in all my time at the club,” Stiles said. Busby did not bat an eyelid.Thornley smiles. “Crazy, absolutely crazy,” he says. “There are very few footballers that have ever lived that would measure up to George Best and so to be compared to him, at whatever level, by somebody who has been a World Cup winner – well, you can’t ask for more than that.”Thornley was the Salford boy who lived the dream. Taken on to United’s books at 14, the winger made his first-team debut as a substitute at West Ham when he was 18 and he was in line to feature in the 1994 FA Cup semi-final against Oldham. Then, in practically the blink of an eye, it was snatched away from him.Playing for the reserves against Blackburn Rovers, he was the victim of a dreadful tackle from Nicky Marker, then a 28-year-old professional. It would be quicker to say which parts of Thornley’s knee were not in tatters. The medial collateral ligament was completely ruptured and so was the medial capsule. Both cruciate ligaments were ruptured while the medial meniscus was detached and the hamstring attachment partially torn.Rob Swire, the United physiotherapist at the time, says it was the worst knee injury he saw in 30 years. Sir Alex Ferguson, who was in the stands that night, was outraged and he insisted that Thornley, backed by United, pursue a civil action against Marker and Blackburn. After five years, he would secure a pay-out.The story of the wonderkid who fails to fulfil his potential for whatever reason is an old one, if invariably sad. Yet Thornley’s has come to resonate more deeply because of his time and place. Everybody knows about United’s Class of 92, the band of brothers who won the FA Youth Cup that year – the club’s first success in the tournament since 1964 – to launch stellar careers. But not everyone knows that Thornley was the best of the lot of them.“Ben would have outdone us all – that’s the sad part,” David Beckham says. “Without a doubt, he would have been one of the best for United and England.” Paul Scholes describes Thornley as “a step above all of us, he could do everything”, while Gary Neville says he was “one of the most outstanding talents I ever played with”.Thornley fought back after surgery and it is a testament to his ability and determination that he made 13 further appearances for United between 1995 and 1998. But he had to adjust to a new reality, one in which his best level was not as high, and his career as a full-time professional would end in November 2003 as a 28‑year‑old, after spells at Huddersfield, Aberdeen, Blackpool and Bury. He went on to play with Halifax, Bacup Borough, Salford City and Witton Albion.Meanwhile, he had to watch as his friends from United hit the heights. Thornley was closest to Gary Neville and Beckham but he was, and is, held in great esteem by all of the gang, including Giggs, Scholes, Nicky Butt and Phil Neville. The admiration is stamped across the pages of his soon-to-be-released autobiography.One of the things that shines through in Thornley is the absence of jealousy. “I am immensely proud of everything that they all went on to achieve and that extends beyond the lads that we know as the Class of 92 – to people like Keith Gillespie, Robbie Savage, Chris Casper and John O’Kane,” Thornley says. “Despite what happened to me, they were always going to make that level. I don’t know if I would have done but I know for a fact I would have been given the opportunity to try.”Thornley’s book is loaded with poignant moments but there is one that stands out. In the 65th minute of the reserve game against Blackburn the United coach, Jim Ryan – mindful of the looming FA Cup semi-final – asks Thornley whether he is OK to carry on. “Yeah, Jim, I’m fine,” he replies. Five minutes later, Marker jumps into his knee.What if Thornley had gone off? It is a haunting question. “People have always asked me that,” Thornley says. “It’s probably the worst decision that I’ve ever made in my life and something that completely changed my life.”Thornley is at peace, these days, with how his elite-level career was destroyed. But it has been a process, a struggle at times, and one line from his brother, Rod, who is a masseur at United, hits home strongly. “Ben wasn’t the same person after the injury,” he says. “If I’m brutally honest, since that day, he’s never been as happy as he was before.”Thornley pauses. “He’s probably got a point,” he says. “My brother notices things that only a brother would. Only really in the last four or five years have I come out of that cocoon, if you like.”Post-United, there were good times on the pitch, namely Thornley’s first seasons at Huddersfield and Aberdeen. But the frustration and, yes, the anger were difficult to suppress. Thornley’s professional focus drifted, which would have been unthinkable before the injury, and he took solace in alcohol.Thornley hit rock bottom in 2006. He separated from his wife, Claire – the mother of his 14-year-old son, Lucas – in the January and he went on a rampage. “I went from one pub to another, from one woman to another, from one stag do to another – not sleeping, not eating, just drinking and drinking,” Thornley says. “Somebody said: ‘Listen, if you are not careful you are going to kill yourself.’ All of a sudden, after eight or nine months, I just stopped. I said: ‘I can’t continue like this.’”Thornley has rediscovered a balance in his life, thanks mainly to Lesley, his girlfriend of 10 years, and his work for United’s in-house TV and radio station, MUTV, and in the Old Trafford hospitality suites. Previously, he had worked as a minicab driver, a restaurant manager and a tiler. It was not him.Talk to anybody who knows Thornley and the same descriptions recur: gobby, snappy, daft, so Salford. His former teammates rib him mercilessly about his crimes against fashion. “You look back at photos and think: ‘What am I wearing?’” Giggs says. “But then you look at Ben and think: ‘At least I didn’t look as bad as that.’”Above all, Thornley is sparkling company, the type of lad who people want to be around. I grew up on the next street to him and I was always struck by his infectiousness.Thornley passes unforgiving judgment on his career. “I will always have fallen short of what I thought I could achieve,” he says. On the other hand, he has the tales to tell from a life of rich experience, in which he has made his mark. Not many kids from the old neighbourhood are on first‑name terms with Bryan Robson, have seen the Fergie hairdryer and have been out on the pull with Beckham.“I used to say that something good would come out of my injury one day,” Thornley says. “And that something has been this book. It makes me feel so humble that the guys I grew up with have been willing to vouch for me 20-odd years later to possibly make people realise that I wasn’t some pie-in-the-sky kid who never made it. No matter how the book does, I will always remember that.”Tackled: The Class of 92 Star Who Never Got To Graduate (Pitch Publishing) by Ben Thornley and Dan Poole is out on Monday 15 October.

Sign up now! Sign up now? Sign up now!One of the best things about being a tycoon who has made a fortune from manufacturing action figures and such like is, The Fiver imagines, that you can fling toys out of prams with giddy abandon. Few people take advantage of that perk as vigorously as Enrico Preziosi, owner of Genoa and founder of the Giochi Preziosi toy-making behemoth. Whenever the 70-year-old is angry or has wind, he expresses his discomfort by throwing out one of his favourite playthings – a life-size football manager usually named Davide Ballardini, who has spent much of his career being hurled to and fro by Preziosi.Always a good bet to win the Serie A sack race, Ballardini became the first manager to be turfed out of a club in Italy’s top-flight this season despite the fact that Genoa are in a far-from-alarming 11th place in the table. “I consider him to be a terrible coach,” waaahed Preziosi by way of justification, adding: “He has been fired 13 times in 14 seasons. Only at Sambenedettese in Serie C did he manage to see out a season.”Thus ended Ballardini’s third stint as a manager under Preziosi. “Ballardini is a wonderful person but he doesn’t know how to put his players on the pitch, he can’t do anything,” screeched Preziosi, stamping his feet and convincing absolutely no one that he won’t be engaging Ballardini again in three months’ time. Before then, however, he has moved to hire Ivan Juric, the manager he sacked twice in the 2016-17 season before appointing Ballardini for a third stint. “Juric is a positive coach and it was my mistake to confirm Ballardini at the end of last season,” blubbed Preziosi, who is at least big enough to own up to errors. He has even admitted in the past that he goofed by getting involved in football at all, telling Il Foglio in August that “it was a sin of vanity – if I could go back, I wouldn’t do it again.”Genoa are not the only club that Preziosi has run. He used to be the mastermind at Como, where he at least demonstrated that he is no worse a judge of managers than he is of players. “We had Lionel Messi on trial when he was 15,” revealed Preziosi in 2010. “We rejected him. Sometimes you make errors, that’s what happens.” The Fiver knows, Enrico, The Fiver knows.“I lost the plot and I was saying to him: ‘Who are you talking to?’ and he went: ‘I’m talking to you, you’re the guy who gets the ball in the last minute and costs us the game.’ So I said: ‘It’s taken you a week to bring that up and now you’re choosing to bring it up before the Spurs game, when we’re just about to go out.’ Everyone has stopped getting changed and they’re all looking in. In the middle of the changing room is a physio table with a pair of scissors on it and I picked up this pair of scissors and went for him. The whole changing room just jumped up and wrestled me to the floor.

Nowhere is world football’s governing body more convincing than in its stated desire to grow the women’s game in the buildup to next year’s Women’s World Cup in France.Back in the summer, 19-year-old Venezuelan international Deyna Castellanos was permitted to interview Gianni Infantino, with the result posted on the Women’s World Cup social media channels. “Next year in France, we will see the greatest, greatest, greatest Women’s World Cup ever,” promised the Fifa president. “We will have a country that celebrates women’s football – and this virus of women’s football will spread from France, over the whole world.”Oh. Well, put like that, perhaps it is understandable that Fifa should be doing everything in its power to contain the outbreak of the virus. What else can explain the decision to schedule the Women’s World Cup final on the same day as not just the final of the Copa América, held in Brazil, but also the Concacaf Gold Cup, hosted in the United States?In fact, were the message not sufficiently rammed home by that timetabling, it has emerged that the Women’s World Cup final will be a morning game in the US, and an afternoon game in Europe. The later and evening games will go to the two men’s regional cup finals.Because really, nothing says “we are fully committed to growing the women’s game” like making the biggest match in its four-year cycle the undercard to some other stuff. When your scheduling suggests the Women’s World Cup final is not even the first or second most important match of the day, it is perhaps inevitable that people will draw conclusions about the level of your stated commitment.Naturally, Fifa resents any such implication. Last week, a spokesperson told Sports Illustrated’s Grant Wahl that “the scheduling of the different events has gone through a comprehensive consultancy process, which involved all key stakeholders” – a piece of what might be called mismanagement speak which fails to remotely convince that anyone in the women’s game would regard this as remotely desirable. If all the stakeholders were so involved, why are so many in the women’s game trying to drive their stakes through the idea? Alas, Fifa declined to be drawn any further.In the absence of further light-shedding, then, perhaps Infantino’s summer interview is worth a revisit. Castellanos’s first question to the Fifa president was: “Why do you think it is important for girls to play football?” The Fifa president made an expansive gesture. “I have four daughters myself,” he explained. And if the past year has taught us anything, it’s that guys who care about things because they have daughters are absolutely not sociopathic creeps who are effectively saying that if they didn’t, they would be total sexistsunprintables. No skin in the game, you see. And yet, any chap who begins a statement with “As a father of daughters” or “Well, I have a daughter now” has what I like to think of as the most unfortunate tell since Le Chiffre, the Bond villain who literally cries blood during poker games.Anyway, Infantino went on to explain the point of football to Castellanos in a loftily genial, finger-wagging way that I hope an international striker was able to dimly cotton on to. He chiefly seems to think that football teaches girls “values”, like a family does – a reminder that for girls, football is a sporting contest second, and an offshoot of domestic science lessons first.Still, never let it be said that Fifa limits his hand-waving or lip-service to one format. It was much in evidence in the rather more formal setting of Fifa’s 2016 blueprint for the future, called Fifa 2.0. This report devoted a full three out of 69 pages to how it planned to advance the women’s game. It pledged that by 2017, it would be “providing women with greater opportunities to showcase their talents at international and club levels” – and if popping the World Cup final on early doors before the regional finals doesn’t do that, then what do these people even want?As far as the rest of the pledges made in Fifa 2.0 go, on Tuesday Fifa finally snuck out its long-promised women’s football strategy. Or rather, its “strategy”. Despite the delay, this document contains barely any more detail than Fifa 2.0, and an awful lot of pictures and waffle about “vision”. The pledge to “raise the profile of the Fifa Women’s World Cup” seems self-satirising, in the circumstances. The clearest attempt to put their money where their mouths are would surely have been honouring the promise to create “a women’s football-specific commercial programme” by 2017 – the latest report kicks the ribbon-cutting date on to 2026.In some ways, the absence of this bit is the most telling. Indeed, given that we know from experience that all Fifa truly cares about is money, the failure to do everything to monetise the under-exploited potential market that women’s football offers them is baffling. It is almost as if there is some … ideological objection to building it up in order that more cash can be siphoned off it.And so with the scheduling of the World Cup final. The puzzle is that it really doesn’t have to be this way. Indeed, it hasn’t always been this way at all. The 2015 Copa América final wasn’t scheduled on the same day as the Women’s World Cup final that year. The 2015 Gold Cup hadn’t even kicked off when the WWC final was played – it began two days later. And as far as numbers go, meanwhile, a global audience of 750 million watched the last Women’s World Cup, with far more US viewers tuning in for its final than did for the men’s equivalent the year before.Yet here we are. Naturally, no one expects Fifa to do the things it says it is going to do in the timeframe it says it is going to do them. And no one expects it to see the potential of what it is notionally only the custodian of. But to actively reduce the focus on the women’s game by your actions is an achievement even by Fifa standards, and we must congratulate them yet again on confounding even the lowest expectations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/855ad0e13cd95de7fe8debbd042f284c4554a4f9/0_0_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e060b665961ad2e36a444d2723fc112","title":"next generation 2018 20 of the best talents at premier league clubs","story":" picks the best prospect from each club born between 1 September 2001 and 31 August 2002, an age band known as first-year scholars.

The time between the ball leaving his right boot, arcing 55 yards over a furiously back-pedalling Neil Sullivan, and nestling comfortably in the back of the Wimbledon net. Scoring from the halfway line had seemed possible until that moment but still tantalisingly out of reach. Pelé famously came close in 1970, Chris Waddle nearly managed it at Italia 90 (but the offside flag was up anyway) and when Everton’s John Bailey did it in 1982 he quickly admitted the whole thing had been a fluke.Beckham’s emphatic statement on the opening day of the 1996-97 season is one of the most iconic goals of the Premier League era, an anything-is-possible-now symbol of the game shifting through the gears on its way to becoming today’s multi-billion pound box office industry. But it’s also the ultimate example of how (and probably why) ultra-long-distance goals have become curiously overrated.In 2002, Beckham’s effort was voted the best goal of the first 10 years of the Premier League and, in a reminder of just how frenzied Beckham-mania was at its peak, the 18th greatest sporting moment of all time by Channel 4. It’s a great goal but is it technically better than Tony Yeboah’s crossbar-endangering howitzer for Leeds? Dennis Bergkamp’s mesmerising hip-swivel, feint and finish at Newcastle? Superior to everything from the glittering Matt Le Tissier canon?When a goal is judged by public vote there is always a nagging sense that Manchester United supporters can skew the results (Wayne Rooney’s overhead kick in the Manchester derby won best goal of the first 20 years of the Premier League in 2012) but even when the vote is closed the outcome is often the same. In April, guests at the EFL’s end-of-season awards were asked to vote for their goal of 2017. You couldn’t have wished for a better cross section of football insiders to act as an expert jury. And still they voted for Luton’s Olly Lee punting the ball 60 yards over hapless Cambridge goalkeeper David Forde.The sheer popularity of these goals is undeniable. But, as with all puzzlingly successful modern phenomena – from the broadcasting career of Jake Humphrey to the Stereophonics selling out Wembley Arena – it’s incumbent on us to probe deeper in the hope of gaining some sort of insight into our fractured society.There’s something appealingly transgressive about a goal from the halfway line – the idea that they are simply not supposed to happen, combined with the cruel joy of watching a goalkeeper desperately trying to prevent their impending humiliation. Accompanying this is a feeling that even attempting a shot from so far out is enough to place it on a higher plain. Having the confidence and ambition to try to beat a goalkeeper from inside your own half is laudable. But so is writing a ballet about Ukip and neither should be immune from critical judgement.Ranking goals is always a subjective process but there’s a definite whiff of emperor’s new clothes about the long-range punt. That when placed alongside the greatest swerving volleys, delicate chips and flowing team goals, it’s just someone kicking a ball quite a long way, quite accurately. And isn’t that something most professional footballers should be able to do? In fact, most of us can have a go at it, which is exactly why kicking a ball into the goal from the centre circle is the half-time entertainment at a lot of clubs, as opposed to making punters recreate a bicycle kick from 25 yards (although, thinking about it, that would be pretty entertaining).Football often conflates the biggest with the best and the sheer scale of these goals steamrollers all other considerations. It’s the longest novel automatically being awarded the Booker Prize Great Danes winning Crufts every year Torvill and Dean missing out on Olympic gold because the Russian skater brings the house down by launching his partner 30 feet into the crowd.Thank goodness for David Batty. In a rarely remembered footnote to Beckham’s goal, Wimbledon travelled to St James’ Park the following Wednesday. In the third minute, Sullivan raced out of his goal to make a clearance and, in one of football’s most chilling examples of deja vu, the Newcastle midfielder calmly fired the bouncing ball back over his head from 40 yards out. With hindsight, it’s clear this was Batty’s way of warning us that Beckham’s strike wasn’t quite as special as everyone thought.

Those forced to live in ever smaller spaces describe how this changes their livesJenny had run out of choices when she first walked into her basement studio flat last spring. The charity worker had been kicked out of her shared home in Bristol when her landlord sold it. She was on benefits, having been signed off sick with post-traumatic stress and anxiety after giving evidence as a victim of crime.While being put up on a friend’s sofa, Jenny, who is 35 but does not want to use her real name for fear of jeopardising her tenancy, scoured online sites for rooms within her budget. Housing benefit claimants in the city can generally receive up to £300 a month for shared accommodation. “Rooms here were going for anywhere from £400, but even if I had that money, I could be rejected because I’m on benefits,” Jenny says.Desperate and confined to private rented accommodation (Bristol has more than 11,000 families on the waiting list for social housing), Jenny learned that she just about qualified for the higher allowance for a one-bedroom flat, as a single occupant aged 35 or over. This pushed her budget above £500 a month. After finding her landlord on a Facebook community group, Jenny had a home. The payoff would be space. “What I didn’t know is how isolated and trapped it would make me feel,” she says.Jenny pays £475 a month, excluding bills, for one of the smallest of nine flats carved out of a Victorian terraced house on a busy road. One of them is not more than a glorified shed crammed into the garden. She doesn’t know the floor area, but planning documents show that her room, which includes a double bed, kitchen sink, hob, oven, washing machine and a clothes rail, covers 15 sq metres. The tiny, windowless bathroom adds 3 sq m. Her whole home is barely bigger than the average living room and would fit 14 times on to a tennis court.“When I come home I feel this sense of doom,” Jenny says. “I can’t have the window open because I’m on a noisy, polluted road, and I can’t have the blinds open because there’s a bus stop right there. I’ve had people weeing on my doorstep, doing crack outside my front door.” There are practical challenges. Jenny eats on her bed, which, like her clothes and everything else she owns, smells of whatever she cooks. Without proper storage, anything out of place can make the flat feel chaotic. The hum of the fridge keeps her awake at night.“I think that even if someone didn’t suffer from anxiety or depression, living in this flat would affect them mentally,” she says, wondering how she might start to recover in a house like this. “You feel it – oh my God, the air is so … heavy.”Britain’s housing crisis is pushing more of us into shoebox homes. Houses are shrinking, too. In 2014, the average new-build in the UK was 76 sq m, the smallest in Europe (Danish homes were almost double the size, research by the University of Cambridge showed). The average living room in a house built in the 1970s, meanwhile, was 25 sq m, compared to 17 today, according to LABC Warranty, which provides warranties for new-builds.But it is the slicing and dicing of houses – and, increasingly, office buildings – that is redefining the whole idea of home, recalling a dark era of tenements and rookeries. For some residents, it is a money-saving endurance test of the sort many of us consider a rite of passage. For others, it can feel like the walls are closing in and there is no way out. “I’m lucky I have a roof over my head but that’s about as far as it goes,” Jenny says.There have been attempts for more than a century to promote space standards for homes. In 1912, Raymond Unwin, the architect and planner best known for the garden city movement, wrote: Nothing Gained by Overcrowding!, a pamphlet on the subject. In the same year, the Local Government Board recommended that no house should be smaller than 79.4 sq m. Flats appeared in space guidelines in a 1961 report of the Parker Morris committee. One-person, single-storey flats should be at least 29.7 sq m, it said, with 2.6 sq m of storage – double the size of Jenny’s home.But standards and ideals can get blurred in a vicious economic cycle. Ministers relax planning rules to enable more building and development. Developers and landlords find profitable loopholes in those changes. Local authorities, desperate for alternatives to their own dwindling housing stock, direct residents to those landlords, fuelling further exploitation at a time when councils also lack resources for planning and building control. Residents, often faced with homelessness, endure the cramped results, until society notices and someone writes another report.“My concern is that people are becoming inured to something that they shouldn’t have to put up with,” says Julia Park, the head of housing research at architectural firm Levitt Bernstein. She has written a history of space standards and is surprised by how little we consider the effects of domestic confinement. “When you’re living in smaller and smaller flats, you reach a point where it makes sense to take out the walls because one big room feels nicer, but I think that implies a lot of compromise we’re not examining,” she says. “Some of these flats pose threats to physical health, but, in small spaces, it’s going to be mental health that is most affected.”Elsewhere in Bristol, Chris, 24, shares a tiny flat with his girlfriend. The couple have a separate bedroom, but there is barely space to move between the bed and walls. The kitchen and living area is equally small, and there is no chance of spending any time apart when they are both at home. Chris also suffers from anxiety, while his girlfriend has an eating disorder.“When I’m feeling stressed and anxious in the outside world, it’s important for me to have a base where I feel comfortable,” says Chris, who has just quit a job handling complaints for a train company. “If I come home to an uncomfortable sofa that has stuff on it so I have to walk around it, and navigate wires everywhere, it makes me more irritable and it’s harder to decompress.” Kitchen clutter can affect his girlfriend’s eating disorder: “She can end up avoiding eating or not eating at all for hours because, if it doesn’t feel right, there will be a reaction,” Chris says.Park, who advises local authorities, laments the way sleeping, cooking and washing are increasingly viewed as the only functions of a dwelling in a housing market where a living room is becoming a luxury. She is especially worried about the types of homes that have emerged in the gaps in policy. This summer she noticed a seven-floor former office block in Ilford, east London, which had been ided into flats. Planning records showed that each of the six upper floors in the building had been converted into 10 studios, including single flats of just 13 sq m.By current standards, these flats are barely a third of the recommended size. Park was instrumental in drawing up the “nationally described space standard”, a nationwide metric implemented by the government in 2015. It recommends 37 sq m for a one-person, one-bedroom flat a two-person, one-bedroom flat should be 50 sq m.Park was surprised that the government had agreed to the recommendations, given its austerity policies. “The compromise was that it is optional,” she adds, estimating that fewer than half of councils have adopted it. Even when they do, it only applies to new buildings or developments that go through the planning system, but not to a range of “permitted developments”. So, for a relatively small investment, the owner of an office building, for example, can convert it into self-contained flats with only “prior notification”.Ben Clifford led a team that visited more than 500 converted office buildings for a report published last May by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. “We were shocked by how many of these flats were of a very poor quality,” says Clifford, a senior lecturer in spatial planning and government at University College London’s Bartlett school of planning. In one, Clifford called the fire brigade after spotting walls iding flats made only of plywood. “We spoke to one resident who was in a tiny one-bed flat with two children and no balconies or open space,” he says. “Another woman, in an 80s office building, said it just wasn’t very nice to live in a flat with big tinted windows that don’t open.”In the so-called “lockdown” model, meanwhile, rogue landlords are converting family homes into tiny studio flats specifically to attract tenants aged 35 or over who, like Jenny, claim the higher housing allowance for a self-contained dwelling. By including a token shared facility, such as a tiny kitchen – or by ignoring rules altogether – these landlords also bypass planning permission by treating such developments as flat-shares (another permitted development). The rental income from six cheaply built studios is multiples of that for a three-bed flat share in the same house – and it is the taxpayer who lines the landlord’s pockets. “It’s basically the warehousing of homelessness,” says Jon Knowles, a computer analyst and campaigner who has recorded hundreds of such developments.Park accepts that homes smaller than 37 sq m can be a useful, short-term base for people in need, as part of the response to the housing crisis and high-quality “micro” apartments are increasingly marketed as aspirational. Park’s own son, Jack, this summer moved into a flat about the same size as Jenny’s. But, in his case, downsizing was a choice. The primary school teacher, who is 28, was paying £600 a month for a small room in a flat-share in south-east London. He wanted to work less as a supply teacher to free up time for his art and a possible masters degree and now pays £350 for a 13-15 sq m studio in Liverpool. His metal sink has a draining board that incorporates two electric hobs. There is no oven.“I’m not that fussy about where I live and if I wanted to work a bit less and save money, it was only possible in a place like this,” Jack says. “But if it was forced on me, I might resent all sorts of things about it.” He says he could not tolerate the space if he had a partner.Chris, who pays £625 a month for his flat in an old house, says enforced proximity makes arguments tough. “If you’re feeling distant from one another it’s blown out of proportion hugely because you’re in the same room because you have to be,” he says. A social life is challenging, too the couple have a small blow-up mattress for guests, but the only bathroom is accessed through the bedroom, around the bed. Hosting dinners is out of the question.For Jenny, this also fuels a sense of isolation. “I can’t even have someone for a cup of tea,” she says. “When people do come over I feel shame because of how small it is, and everything feels dirty because as soon as people come in they are instantly in my bedroom with their shoes.”Few housing campaigners have much hope that conditions might soon improve for the occupants of our shrinking homes. Clifford says there is a minor backlash against abuses of the permitted development rules, and several local authorities are moving against them. “We have to be much tougher on landlords and on standards,” Park says. “There are going to be compromises because we are desperately short of housing, but we cannot give people a free pass.”For Jenny, the future – near and far – feels uncertain. “I know I’ll never be able to afford to buy anywhere, or even to rent this place without help with benefits at the moment,” she says. “But I don’t want to be on benefits.” She has started doing volunteer work with a learning disabilities charity while she considers applying for jobs. She goes to the library and takes regular walks. “Or I’ll go to a friend’s place and instantly, when I’m out of the house or in a larger space, I’ll feel a hundred times better,” she adds. “But then I’ll have to go home.”• This article was amended on 10 October 2018 to change a reference to an “office block in Croydon” to Ilford."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41d50733a2b3316fe454d3991ee749db0af2c82a/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32004d2aff55add7c00df7cc39ea7741","title":"spotify at 10 drake ed sheeran and eminem lead streaming stats","story":"Sheeran’s single Shape of You is the music platform’s most-streamed song since it launchedSpotify has revealed the most-streamed artists in the platform’s 10-year history. Drake, followed by Ed Sheeran and Eminem lead its rankings – while Rihanna and Ariana Grande are the only women in its top 10 list.The streaming giant, which launched in Sweden, the UK, France, Spain and Norway in October 2008, has also listed its users’ favourite songs and albums. It named Sheeran’s 2017 single Shape of You as its most-played track. Sheeran’s 2014 single Thinking Out Loud also features, in fifth place. Drake’s 2016 single One Dance comes second, while the Chainsmokers’ Closer, also released in 2016, comes in third.Justin Bieber effectively has three tracks in the top 10. He features on Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee’s 2017 Despacito remix (coming in at 7), and as a solo artist with Love Yourself (8) and Sorry (9).No female artists have songs in the top 10, however Rihanna became the first artist to reach 1bn streams on Spotify, in 2013. She is the most-streamed female artist globally, followed by Ariana Grande and Sia. Adele and Taylor Swift’s initial resistance to putting their music on Spotify may have contributed to their respective placings at six and seven.Spotify’s survey of most-streamed albums likewise features no female artists. Sheeran’s 2017 album ÷ leads Justin Bieber’s Purpose and Drake’s Views. Sheeran’s  x (4) and Drake’s Scorpion (7), released this year, give them each a second appearance.The lack of women on Spotify’s 10-year streaming charts correlates with recent research by Baffler critic Liz Pelly, who found the platform’s “most popular and visible playlists to be staggeringly male-dominated”.Spotify’s high-profile editorial playlists are immensely powerful. A high placement on a playlist such as Rap Caviar or New Music Friday can change a song’s fortunes. Playlist culture has also changed song structure, with verses and choruses hitting sooner to avoid being skipped by listeners.Pelly concluded that the platform’s algorithmic recommendations meant that “when a user listens to mostly male-dominated playlists, what is produced are yet more male-dominated playlists”.When the service launched a decade ago, Coldplay’s Viva La Vida was the opening month’s most-streamed track and their album Viva La Vida or Death and All His Friends the most-streamed album.

This is no longer the case under the fixed-term parliament act, but such a defeat could fatally undermine May’s position and would bring calls for a vote on calling an election.The DUP, which has had a so-called confidence and supply agreement to support May’s government since last year’s election, has expressed regular alarm at the prospect of any Brexit deal avoiding the possibility of a hard Irish border by instead making Northern Ireland’s regulatory regime more closely allied to the EU, creating a de facto customs border in the Irish Sea.At the Conservative conference last week, Nigel Dodds, the leader of the DUP in the House of Commons, said the party would vote against May if she returned from Brussels with a deal that involved new checks on goods coming into Northern Ireland from Britain. “We will vote against it. We will vote for our red lines,” he said.The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, had earlier said the party’s confidence and supply arrangement with the Conservatives was “party to party” and not with May herself – prompting speculation the DUP might be willing to force May from No 10.Foster reiterated her party’s stance during meetings in Brussels on Tuesday. “I am the leader of the Democratic Unionist party. The clue is in the title,” Foster said after a meeting with the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier.“I am a unionist, I believe in the union of the United Kingdom, all four elements of the United Kingdom. We do not want Northern Ireland going off in a different direction from the rest of the UK.”The Treasury minister Mel Stride said: “The prime minister’s position has always been crystal clear on this issue of no border down the Irish Sea. We have said it many, many times.”The DUP has vowed to oppose any fresh barriers to trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Stride told BBC Radio 4’s World at One: “I’m not going to get into the specifics of what may or may not be going on in the negotiations at the moment, other than to say that I am extremely confident from all that I know and have seen, and all the discussions that I have had, that there will be a very, very firm position taken on this.“The prime minister made it very clear no UK prime minister is ever going to put him or herself in the position where they start to unpick the economic and sovereign integrity of the UK.”May has also faced the threat of parliamentary guerrilla tactics from Brexiters within her own party who are understood to be seeking an opportunity to stage a show of strength in protest at her Brexit plans.The former Brexit minister Steve Baker has claimed 40 of his colleagues were determined to vote against the Chequers proposal, whatever the consequences.Failing that, some members of the ERG have suggested they could vote down parts of the budget, although the tactic would be particularly controversial as it could precipitate the fall of the government.

It has also kept the Treasury coffers fuller.The red-carpet welcome for Mohammed bin Salman on his three-day visit to London in March was based on that longstanding relationship but also fortified by the hope that the crown prince was a reforming figure sidelining a conservative religious police. The visit led to 13 memoranda of understanding and the promise of £65bn of investment in the UK over the next decade.Privately, British diplomats have never harboured any illusions that Bin Salman’s social reforms, such as allowing women to drive, presage greater political liberty. But in aiming to ersify the Saudi economy through his Vision 2030 plan, the crown prince was at least giving post-Brexit Britain the chance to extend the relationship beyond military hardware into construction, transport and education.The Khashoggi episode threatens to make that idea less attractive and, incidentally, render the millions spent by Saudis on western PR agents largely wasted.Although it is hardly a secret that Saudi Arabia jails journalists, such a brazen state-endorsed act in a foreign country crosses a line. In the US and the UK, politicians and diplomats normally classed as friends of the Gulf kingdoms – such as Bob Corker, the Republican chair of the Senate foreign affairs committee – appear shocked.For the UK, in the middle of a démarche over extra-jurisdictional attempted killings by Russia in Salisbury, to turn a blind eye to reports of such a brutal act would be perceived as high hypocrisy.The dilemma is even more acute as Britain has chosen to support the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, since the failed military coup in Turkey in 2016. Turkey may not be a champion of press freedom but it will expect other foreign states to condemn this violation of its sovereignty.The Foreign Office has had its differences with the Saudis over the Iran nuclear deal but knows how little Saudi Arabia welcomes direct criticism. A single tweet in August by Global Affairs Canada, calling for the release of a female rights protester, led to the recall of the Saudi ambassador, 8,300 Saudi graduates being withdrawn from the country, a freeze on investment and the cancellation of all flights from Saudi to Canada.Adel al-Jubeir, the Saudi foreign minister, accused Canada of treating the kingdom like a banana republic. “You can talk to us about human rights anytime you want, we’d be happy to have that conversation like we do with all our allies. But lecturing us? No way. Not going to happen,” he said. Spain and Germany have also been warned.The big question is whether the episode will prompt a wider rethink about the value of the Saudi relationship to the UK. The UK argues proximity secures influence, a point it repeatedly makes in defending its support for the Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen. But it is reluctant to discuss the alliance more broadly. A British official due to defend the relationship at a Chatham House seminar last month withdrew at the last minute.Two recent external studies have urged the UK to rethink the relationship’s value. The Policy Institute at Kings College accepts that the Gulf remains the lifeblood of the UK arms export industry but argues that the overall value of the Saudi Arabia relationship is vastly overstated.A second study, Anglo-Arabia, published last month by Dr David Wearing, argues that the relationship is based largely on Britain’s role as a world leader in financial services, with Gulf petrodollars and sovereign wealth funds financing the UK current account deficit. It says such a deal is inherently unstable.Britain may yet be able to avert a rethink if the evidence of Saudi government involvement just falls short of overwhelming. A FBI investigation proposed by the US might sow enough doubt.Yet Theresa May’s self-declared task for “Global Britain” has been set high: “To defend the rules-based international order against irresponsible states that seek to erode it.” Global Britain is facing a first and exacting test."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29ca0711ace719665340d2cea0629a69601ff644/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b1fd3ccf7e81dd5555dce9edb981400","title":"pmqs verdict corbyn shreds mays breezy conference promises","story":"PM had little to say in response to Labour leader’s criticism of ongoing spending restraintJeremy Corbyn and Theresa May faced each other in the first PMQs since the party conferences. Corbyn’s first question was about mental health nurses and May’s statement that austerity was over. He said there were 5,000 fewer mental health nurses now than in 2010. When would austerity be over for them?May said the government was putting record levels of funding into mental health. She said more needed to be done she and would set out further steps later on Wednesday. She said her government was the first to have a minister for suicide prevention.Corbyn said mental health trusts’ income was lower than now than five years ago. Children were being sent 300 miles from home for treatment. He moved on to police cuts and asked when austerity would be over for officers.May said the government would be doing more on mental health. On the police, she said the government had made an extra £460m available for policing this year. Why had Labour opposed that?Corbyn said the police were taking the government to court over funding. He moved on to education and said the education secretary had been rebuked four times for making false claims about funding. Could May confirm that austerity was over for all teachers and they would now all get the recommended pay rise?May said the police pay award was the highest consolidated award since 2010. School funding was at a record high and the government had improved schools partly through the academies and free schools programme, which Labour opposed.Corbyn said the Tory leader of Northamptonshire council had complained that it could not cope with cuts. Would May end austerity as promised last week?May said there were more teachers in schools and she recognised their hard work. On Northamptonshire, she said an independent report had concluded the failures were not due to lack of funding. She said £200bn was available to help councils deliver their services. She said the government had had to take tough decisions. That was because of the state of the public finances left by Labour. People had made sacrifices. They needed to know it was worth it. She said better times were ahead – under a Conservative government.May said there were £2.4bn of unpaid benefits available under the legacy welfare system left by Labour that would be paid under universal credit. She said austerity was being brought to an end. What was not ending was fiscal responsibility.Corbyn said the poorest households would lose £754 a year if the cuts went ahead. Eight years of painful austerity had taken place, wages had been eroded, yet billions had been found for tax giveaways and for the super-rich. May had said she was ending austerity, but unless the budget ended the cuts, that claim would be seen as a great big Conservative con.May said wages were going up and fewer people were in absolute poverty. What about the £18bn in income tax cuts? And freezing fuel duty had saved people £46bn. She said Labour’s plans would cost £1tn and take the country back to square one.At exactly this moment a week ago May was in Birmingham delivering a conference speech that promised, among other things, an end to austerity. It got a very good reception in the hall and a fairly good reception from the commentariat generally. But it is increasingly likely that it will be added to the long list of political speeches that succeeded in the short term but failed dismally in the long term, because on Wednesday Corbyn shredded it and left it (metaphorically) in tatters on the floor of the Commons chamber.Repeatedly he challenged May to confirm that the government would end austerity, and repeatedly she was unable to say anything that implied there was any substance to her breezy conference rhetoric. David Cameron was able to win a political argument with Labour over austerity by saying spending was out of control and the books had to be balanced, but now that May has given up trying to defend austerity in principle, she was left with very little to say in response to the evidence Corbyn was able to produce about ongoing spending restraint.She fired out stats of her own quite forcefully, but they weren’t convincing. (Claims about “record spending” are always a bit bogus because inflation means actual spending is almost always going up it is real-terms spending that counts. And “absolute poverty” is poverty base-lined against income in a particular year over time, it always goes down.)Corbyn did not produce a zinger that would have made this one of the all-time memorable PMQs, but thoughtful Tories should be worried. If there was a general election soon, this exchange would serve as a good dress rehearsal for how the austerity debate would pan out. And the Tories are losing.People need to know their hard work is paying off. Yes, better times are ahead – under a Conservative government."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90c429cd5bf59a8d190bb611426450c3792d1adc/0_54_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e8499d76ba03ba14604490d0d846e44","title":"theresa may flails at pmqs after austerity question","story":"Bogus statistics, Maybot autopilot and feeble babbles left the PM looking incoherentTheresa May had a lot on her mind during her leader’s speech at the Tory party conference in Birmingham last week. Trying to avoid falling scenery. Not accepting a P45. Not losing her voice. A low bar, but one that required all her concentration. So much so that she made the basic error of failing to actually check what she was reading out.In hindsight, the prime minister will come to regret having declared that austerity was over. It might have gone down well enough with a conference audience that was willing her to get to the end of her hour-long dirge without toppling over, but it was never likely to survive wider scrutiny. With the International Monetary Fund having just declared the UK’s public finances to be in a more catatonic state than those of the Gambia, Kenya and Uganda, and with no guarantee of a Brexit deal that won’t make everyone even more worse off, telling the country it had never had it so good could be seen to be a little premature.Jeremy Corbyn may still not be a natural at parliamentary set pieces, but he is enough of a pro these days to spot an open goal when it is presented. So at the start of prime minister’s questions, he put the ball on the spot and did the business. Nothing fancy, just a straightforward tap in. There were 5,000 fewer mental health nurses than there had been in 2010. When was austerity going to end for mental health services?You’d have thought May might have had some inkling that the Labour leader would go in on austerity, but instead she seemed genuinely surprised. Um, er, she was sure everything was fine because she had recently appointed a minister to ask people not to commit suicide. Not sure this would be at the top of many mental health professionals’ priorities. Corbyn raised an eyebrow, pointed out that her own health secretary had said mental health services were hopeless, and moved on to policing. When would austerity be over for the police?May had no real idea. Soon, very soon, she hoped. Could we move on to something else? Corbyn obliged by switching to education. When would austerity end for teachers? The prime minister was now so panicky that she began using bogus statistics that had already been discredited when the education secretary had used them two days previously. Like many in government, she now seems to believe that repeating a lie often enough will turn it into the truth.Next up were the failures of the Conservative-led local councils of Northamptonshire and Somerset, both of which were near enough broke. Now May completely lost touch with reality and went into Maybot autopilot. The reason the councils had no money had nothing to do with them having no money. It was because of something else, though she couldn’t remember what.“There are better times ahead,” the prime minister ended feebly. Throughout the previous exchanges, the Tory benches had been unusually quiet, sensing their leader was flatlining her way to oblivion. Now they fell silent. Telling people things are going to get a bit better generally only serves to remind them of just how rubbish they currently are. And the prospect of taking a few weeks longer to starve to death isn’t always cause for celebration.Corbyn rather appeared to lose interest by the time he reached his final question – it was all just too easy – but Labour’s Caroline Flint kept up the pressure by quoting the government’s own predictions that most of the cuts had yet to come through and people on universal credit would be £200 worse off each month. Esther McVey, the work and pensions minister, appeared delighted by this but May looked hollow-eyed and broken. There was just enough sentience remaining for her to be aware of her own inadequacy.By the time Ken Clarke had pointed out there was no parliamentary majority for any kind of Brexit deal she looked capable of negotiating, May was left with nothing but her own incoherence. A binary babble of meaningless ones and zeros. Long before the end, the Commons had voted with its feet and there were huge gaps on the benches of both sides of the house. There’s only so much mediocrity anyone can take. Even Theresa May. For a brief moment, she appeared tempted to make for the exit herself. After all, silence could only have raised the tone of the proceedings. But then a flicker of doubt. Perhaps no one would even notice she had gone. Not even herself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9eaa70e283d0a866986253f6febac3691832e07/0_162_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=225372fa3c91b06b38b950e6a565f5af","title":"pmqs brexit theresa may jeremy corbyn question national audit office chief over brexit planning politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happen, including Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn at PMQsTweeting after Michel Barnier finished his speech, Boris Johnson, who resigned as foreign secretary because he was opposed to the Chequers plan, Labour anticipates that the principal vote on the budget - at which the DUP and any Tory rebels would have to stand up and be counted - will take place around 5pm on Thursday 1 November, three days after Philip Hammond’s speech. Losing a vote on a budget would normally be expected to lead to a vote of confidence given that the government’s authority rests on its ability to get finance bills through the Commons. But some Labour insiders wonder if the budget could be carefully constructed so that it had no substantive measures that required MPs’ authorisation, making it more in line with now abolished autumn statements. But that would leave Hammond with little to announce, and the technicality may be lost on the public. Another theoretical possibility is that rebels try to force a vote on budget day itself - by opposing the ways and means resolutions that authorise changes to excise on wines and beers and other similar duties that typically come into force on midnight of budget day itself. That, however, would require some quick decision making, because these resolutions are put to MPs shortly after Hammond sits down and rebels would not know what the changes in duties were until Hammond had told the house in the budget speech.Labour appears to have hardened its official position on universal credit, with Jeremy Corbyn’s spokesman telling lobby journalists after PMQs that it “needs to be scrapped’ and that the party’s review would look into “what should replace it.”A fortnight ago shadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood told the Daily Mirror that Labour was “sort of in the process of looking into” undoing the whole universal credit system. Asked if she ruled out scrapping UC in its entirety, she said:We’re not ruling anything out, because we think it’s important to be on top of all of the detail of it before making a decision.The party then announced at its party conference in Liverpool that it would review the system, which has left thousands of families struggling to afford food and rent. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell went further at the weekend, saying UC “will have to go” as the system was “just not sustainable”.Labour consolidated that position today, with Corbyn’s spokesman appearing to confirm that UC would be replaced after the party’s wide-ranging benefits review. He told reporters:The government is quite clearly unable to cope with the failure of its own benefit reforms. The universal credit system is not working. It is not delivering what it was intended to, and was advertised as doing. As John McDonnell said last weekend this is a system that is not delivering, that isn’t working ad needs to be scrapped and that’s why we’re committed to a review of the whole of its performance and what should replace it.This is from the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg,America’s ability to play a security role in Europe and influence its thinking will be diminished once UK is no longer totally integrated with Europe after Brexit, according to Joe Biden the former Democratic Vice-President and potential challenger for the Presidency in 2020.Speaking at Chatham House think tank Biden said, if he had had a vote as an MP or British citizen, he would have voted not to leave the EU, and said the country was now facing an intractable issue. He said: US interests are diminished with Great Britain not an integral part of Europe and being able to bring to bear influence well beyond the economy on European attitudes on a whole range of subjects. It seems to me there is a growing awareness in Europe as a whole, and around the world, that Britain played a role in Europe the last 30 years well beyond the notion of open borders and trade, being able to influence attitudes. Revealing he held talks with Theresa May on Tuesday he said Brexit was “an almost intractable problem for any political party”, observing the Labour party is not unified. He said:I do believe very strongly that the US ability to play a major role in the security of the west, and the prosperity of the transatlantic partnership, rests in part on British influence in Europe, and we lose the extent to which you lose influence.Here is my colleague Jennifer Rankin on the Barnier speech.This is from Politico Europe’s Charlie Cooper.And these are from the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg.That was a much more substantial speech from Michel Barnier than we had been led to expect. He did not announce anything new, and if you’ve followed EU arguments closely, you will have heard most of this before. But, rather than take refuge in platitudes, he did choose to set, with considerable clarity and detail, a) just what the Irish backstop might involve (which won’t please the DUP) b) the full extent of EU objections to the Chequers plan (which won’t please Theresa May) c) quite how provisional the future framework will be (which won’t please the many MPs worried about a “blind’ Brexit, who have now been told that, from April, Barnier envisages 10 negotiations running in parallel, finalising the future relationship - see 3.55pm.)Overall, it is hard to see this making life any easier for Number 10.I will post a summary soon.Barnier says he wants to end on a personal note.He says the first vote he cast was on the accession of the UK, Ireland, Denmark and Norway to join the EEC. He campaigned for yes. He has always thought that united, we stand strong, he says.The Brexit vote is a pity, a shame, he says.Brexit brings no added value. It is a negative negotiation. It is a lose, lose game.He says he is being as ambitious as he can be by defending the EU.He will continue to lead for the EU in accordance with the principles he has set out.He shall do so with serenity, with no spirit of revenge, and with respect for a country that will remain a major ally, he says.Barnier says the cost of a no deal would be very high. That is why it has never been what the EU wants, he says.Barnier says, on the economic partnership, there are things in the white paper that “do not tally” with his mandate.He says the EU is happy to base the future relationship on a tariff-free free trade area.But there are two problem areas, he says.He says the UK wants to negotiate trade deals with countries like the US, which would mean lower tariffs for the UK, while the UK was still effectively in the single market for goods.That would be problematic, he says.He says the UK must accept the EU wants to maintain control of its external borders and customs borders.Another problem if the UK proposal to stay in the single market for goods, he says. But the UK wants to opt out of regulations affecting production.This type of single market system a la carte would be tantamount to giving a “huge competitive edge” to the UK over EU companies.Barnier has reverted to French.He says the EU wants a good relationship with the UK.After Brexit there will be separate negotiations - 10 negotiations will run in parallel, deciding the future partnership, he says.He says the EU wants a “very ambitious” partnership with the UK.He says the EU is taking account of the white paper produced by the UK, the Chequers plan.All sections have been discussed at a technical and official level, he says.That is why the white paper is useful. There are lots of areas of convergence, he says.Barnier says all the transition is conditional on the withdrawal agreement being agreed.He hopes it will be ratified next year. He says the European parliament will have the last word.Barnier says all financial commitments made at the level of the EU28 must be honoured by the EU28.So the UK will be expected to keep contributing to programmes it has signed up to."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad1db17a458cf7f018b38cb4bc52a5d2039c6963/0_73_4134_2480/master/4134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d40887f0d0b3e70bd073e7ae71b55a1","title":"windsor asks rough sleepers clear out princess eugenie royal wedding","story":"Rough sleepers say council is advising them to clear out for Princess Eugenie’s nuptialsHomeless people in Windsor have said they are being moved off the streets to make way of Princess Eugenie’s wedding.Rough sleepers said that they had been advised by council wardens to move from the streets in preparation for the event, which will cost more than £2m in public money.James Pusey, one of those who claimed he had been told to stay away from the area, said in an interview with the Mirror: “She’s not a proper royal. She sits in the background and uses it to her advantage.”He added: “That money could be spent on housing. People that are actually homeless and vulnerable could become a priority. No one begrudges her a happy wedding day, but why go to such an expense?”Pusey said he had been told by police to move his belongings or they would be confiscated. He said: “They are saying … we’ve got to not be around when it’s taking place.”A spokesperson for the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead said that it had been advising homeless people the royal wedding was happening and “due to their vulnerability they may want to move to other locations within the town centre where they may not be impacted by the anticipated higher footfall”.They added that safe storage for certain possessions would be provided. “Homeless people will not be asked to remove themselves from the streets,” they said.Sunny Kumar, 40, another rough sleeper, said that at least with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s wedding their names brought something to Windsor, including money to the businesses. “But with Eugenie it’s not really going to happen.”The wedding on Friday will be held at St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle, the same venue where Prince Harry and Meghan were married.Criticism has been lodged against the estimated £250,000 in public money that will be spent on clean-up costs on top of £2m for police and security. A petition signed by 38,000 people has been handed to MPs in protest against taxpayers’ money being used to fund the event.A Windsor council spokeswoman said homeless people had been offered support of a safe haven on the day and a place to store belongings to ensure they were not inadvertently removed by the police as part of their security measures."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09297c44b75be156c871c0dd3879139a41a6e574/0_307_2853_1712/master/2853.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ea790785f3a80bb2556c054711cdb2a4 1240w","title":"michael bloomberg democrat party 2020 presidential run","story":"Former New York City mayor said in Instagram post he re-registered as a Democrat to ‘provide checks and balance’ Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg rejoined the Democratic party on Wednesday, going back to his political roots weeks before midterm elections and amid speculation that he might run for the White House in 2020.Bloomberg, the billionaire founder and chief executive of global media company Bloomberg LP, said in a post on social media he was re-registering as a Democrat, citing a potential constitutional crisis under Republican president Donald Trump, a fellow New York businessman.“At key points in U.S. history, one of the two parties has served as a bulwark against those who threaten our Constitution. Two years ago at the Democratic Convention, I warned of those threats,” Bloomberg wrote in post on Instagram.“Today, I have re-registered as a Democrat – I had been a member for most of my life – because we need Democrats to provide the checks and balance our nation so badly needs.”Bloomberg, 76, was a longtime Democrat who became a Republican before running for mayor of the largest US city in 2001. He left the Republican party to become an independent in 2007 and served three terms as New York’s mayor, stepping down in 2013.He has considered running for president in the past as an independent but never did.  reported in August that he was considering running in 2020 as a Democrat.Representatives for Bloomberg could not be immediately reached for comment on Wednesday.A frequent critic of Trump, Bloomberg has donated $80m to help Democrats gain control of the House of Representatives and $20m to help Democrats running for Senate, which Republicans now narrowly control 51 to 49.Democrats are aiming to pick up 23 seats in the House to win a majority in the lower chamber, something political analysts have said is more likely than gaining an edge in the Senate.Taking control of either chamber would give Democrats leverage to oversee Trump and his administration, including the ability hold hearings and subpoena officials.Bloomberg has used his fortune, which Forbes magazine has pegged at $51.8bn, to push a number of liberal causes including efforts to tackle global warming and gun deaths."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f2e663742bf257c95463fc6d75d5c5376f94529/0_2_1795_1077/master/1795.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8703bf0c4a1b2f7da687760943b1efdb","title":"hurricane category 6 this is how world ends book climate change","story":"There is no such thing as a category 6 hurricane or tropical storm - yet. But a combination of warmer oceans and more water in the atmosphere could make the devastation of 2017 pale in comparison  There is no such thing as a category 6 hurricane or tropical storm – yet. The highest level – the top of the scale for the most powerful, most devastating hurricane or tropical storm capable of destroying entire cities like New Orleans or New York – is a category 5 storm.Meteorologists and scientists never imagined that there would be a need for a category 6 storm, with winds that exceed 200 miles per hour on a sustained basis, sweeping away everything in its path. Until now, such a storm wasn’t possible, so there was no need for a new category above category 5.This combination of warmer oceans and more water in the earth’s atmosphere – whipsawed by sustained periods of drier and wetter conditions in regions of the world that create superstorms – is now starting to create storms with conditions that look precisely what a category 6 hurricane would look like.No one in America has ever experienced the wrath and fury of a category 6 hurricane, which now genuinely seems possible and realistic. We’ve been lucky. Unofficial category 6 hurricanes have appeared in other parts of the world, and we’re seeing much stronger storms on a regular basis. It’s only a matter of time before one hits the US.When it does, it will come as quite a shock. The devastation we saw in 2017 in Houston, several Caribbean islands, and Puerto Rico may actually pale in comparison.Jeff Masters, one of the most respected meteorologists in America, has begun to wonder publicly about the potential for a category 6 hurricane. He launched a lively debate among his colleagues with a provocative post in July of 2016 on the Weather Underground – a thought-provoking piece that prompted the Weather Channel and others to weigh in with their thoughts and theories as well.“A ‘black swan’ hurricane – a storm so extreme and wholly unprecedented that no one could have expected it – hit the Lesser Antilles Islands in October 1780,” Masters wrote to open the post. “Deservedly called The Great Hurricane of 1780, no Atlantic hurricane in history has matched its death toll of 22,000. So intense were the winds of the Great Hurricane that it peeled the bark off of trees – something only EF5 tornadoes with winds in excess of 200mph have been known to do.”Masters then made the startling claim that such a “black swan” hurricane was not only possible now but almost certain to occur more than once. He said that such storms should more properly be called “grey swan” hurricanes because the emerging science clearly showed that such “bark-stripping” mega-storms are nearly certain to start appearing.“Hurricanes even more extreme than the Great Hurricane of 1780 can occur in a warming climate, and can be anticipated by combining physical knowledge with historical data,” wrote Masters, who once flew into the strongest hurricane at the time as one of Noaa’s “Hurricane Hunters” in the 1980s. “Such storms, which have never occurred in the historical record, can be referred to as ‘grey swan’ hurricanes.”Masters based his bold prediction on research by two of the best hurricane scientists in the world – Kerry Emanuel of MIT and Ning Lin of Princeton – who published the most detailed hurricane model in history in August 2015. Emanuel and Lin’s hurricane model was embedded within six different worldwide climate models routinely run by supercomputers.“The term ‘black swan’ is a metaphor for a high-consequence event that comes as a surprise. Some high-consequence events that are unobserved and unanticipated may nevertheless be predictable,” they wrote in Nature Climate Change. “Such events may be referred to as ‘grey swans’ (or, sometimes, ‘perfect storms’). Unlike truly unpredicted and unavoidable black swans, which can be dealt with only by fast reaction and recovery, grey swans – although also novel and outside experience – can be better foreseen and systematically prepared for.”Lin and Emanuel said their research showed that not only were grey swan hurricanes now likely to occur, one such devastating hurricane would almost certainly hit the Persian Gulf region – a place where tropical cyclones have never even been seen in history. They identified a “potentially large risk in the Persian Gulf, where tropical cyclones have never been recorded, and larger-than-expected threats in Cairns, Australia, and Tampa, Florida”.Emanuel and Lin showed that the risk of such extreme grey swan hurricanes in Tampa, Cairns, and the Persian Gulf increased by up to a factor of 14 over time as Earth’s climate changed.In the event of such a storm, city officials may have no idea what they truly face. At least one city planning document (from 2010) anticipated that a category 5 hurricane could cause 2,000 deaths and $250bn in damage. But it could be far worse.“A storm surge of 5 meters is about 17 feet, which would put most of Tampa underwater, even before the sea level rises there,” Emanuel told reporters. “Tampa needs to have a good evacuation plan, and I don’t know if they’re really that aware of the risks they actually face.”A city like Dubai is even more unprepared, Emanuel said. Dubai, and the rest of the Persian Gulf, has never seen a hurricane in recorded history. Any hurricane, of any magnitude, would be an unprecedented event. But his models say that one is likely to occur there at some point.“Dubai is a city that’s undergone a really rapid expansion in recent years, and people who have been building it up have been completely unaware that that city might someday have a severe hurricane,” Emanuel said. “Now they may want to think about elevating buildings or houses, or building a seawall to somehow protect them, just in case.”Following Masters’s provocative post, many of his meteorologist colleagues weighed in. The Weather Channel predicted that a category 6 hurricane, and a change in the scale to accommodate it, may be on its way.“Jeff Masters got the entire weather community thinking: could there be a Category Six hurricane?” Brian Donegan wrote on the network’s site. “Last year, Hurricane Patricia reached maximum sustained winds of 215mph in the eastern Pacific Ocean. It was the most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere.”Whether we call them category 6 hurricanes – or simply category 5 hurricanes with really fast, violent winds that are up to 60mph above the upper end of the current scale that can appear literally overnight over warm oceans – we need to be ready for these superstorms capable of taking out cities like Dubai or Tampa. They are here, right now. The devastation we saw in Houston, Puerto Rico, and the Caribbean in the fall of 2017 is a clear warning.We ignore the implications at our peril.Adapted from This Is The Way The World Ends, copyright © 2018 by Jeff Nesbit.

For the majority of US households, cell reception is their only means of communication with the outside world when wired internet goes down, and their primary means of obtaining important safety information.What happens when the power that those cell phone rely on gets interrupted?Meet Christian Hall, James Risi and Kim Key who are set up at a mobile staging ground in Marianna, Florida to restore downed cell towers for AT\u0026ampT, one of the US’s two largest cell carriers. “We’ll sit here and wait the storm out and as soon as the storm passes we’ll just start slingin’ em out,” said Hall, and Event coordinator for Infinity Communications.We chat in a command trailer parked in the lot of a decomissioned fuel station. There are dozens of 4x4 trucks here and swarm of contractors huddled under the awning as the wind whips a light rain sideways at them. Hall says the crew have about 80 generators on hand to restore power to cell towers that lose power, and a boat is on the way.“Downed trees, down power lines and flooding are the biggest impediments,” Hall said.But mostly they make quick work of it. Last year during Hurricane Irma Hall said he was part of a team that got 500 of 1,200 downed sites back up on the first day alone.“It rolls once it starts going,” said Hall. Over the last few years, the trio say they’ve also been deployed to Hurricanes Harvey, Nate and Florence just a couple weeks ago.Hurricane Michael has gotten even stronger – with sustained winds now reaching 150mph, according to another update from the National Hurricane Center.And the National Weather Service in Tallahassee says it has issued its first-ever “extreme wind warning”.“Shelter in place IMMEDIATELY,” the agency warned. The town of Mexico Beach, Florida has lost power, its mayor said.The town of 1,200 people is now seeing sustained winds of 40-50mph with gusts over 60mph, Mayor Al Cathey told CNN. “It certainly is deteriorating rapidly here,” he said.Out of 1,200 residents, 280 are still in town and did not evacuate, Cathey said.“Not everyone left. We’re just hoping for the best here,” he said.The core of the “extremely dangerous” Hurricane Michael was closing in on the Florida Panhandle, the National Hurricane Center said in its 11am update. Life-threatening storm surge, hurricane force winds and heavy rainfall are “imminent”.The storm is now 60 miles south-west of Panama City, with sustained winds of 145mph. It’s moving toward the coast at 14mph.“Some strengthening is still possible before landfall,” the NHC said.Here’s an update from Richard Luscombe in Miami: Storm experts at AccuWeather are predicting that the bill for damages and the economic fall-out of Hurricane Michael could be close to $30bn.“The greatest impacts will be near and east of where the hurricane’s eye makes landfall and particularly along the coastline because of angry seas in a dangerous storm surge being driven inland by onshore winds,” said AccuWeather president Dr Joel Myers, warning that damage from the storm might change a portion of Florida’s Panhandle coast “for decades to come”.Among the economic fallout will be the rebuilding of properties destroyed or damaged by storm surge and high winds, including some that were already impacted in the Carolinas by Hurricane Florence last month. And increases in premiums for homeowners and auto insurance could cost consumers significantly in the years to come, AccuWeather says, as insurers reset rates based on claims experience.By contrast, the two costliest hurricanes in US history were Katrina in 2005, which devastated New Orleans, and last year’s Hurricane Harvey, which caused massive flooding in Texas and Lousiana, according to the National Hurricane Centre’s list of costliest tropical cyclones, which estimates both at $125bn. Hurricane Irma, a category 4 storm that ripped through the Florida Keys and along the state’s west coast last year, caused damage estimated at $50bn. Here’s a map showing the projected path of Hurricane Michael.Photos sent to the Tallahassee Democrat show flooded streets and falling tree branches in Apalachicola, Florida.Hurricane Michael’s first strong band is now rolling through Tallahassee and the surrounding areas, according to the National Weather Service, with gusts of wind at 60mph.Hathaway Bridge, the main bridge connecting Panama City to neighboring Panama City Beach, has been closed due to winds over 50mph.Here’s an image of rising waters in the area of the bridge.The Bay county sheriff says the bridge is too dangerous to cross.Tropical storm conditions are now spreading across the Florida Panhandle as Michael approaches, the National Hurricane Center says in its latest update issued at 10am eastern time. Water levels are rising quickly along the coast of the panhandle. A National Ocean Service water level station at Apalachicola recently reported over 4ft of inundation above ground level.The storm is now located about 65 miles south-west of Panama City, with sustained winds of 145mph.A private weather station in Bald Point, Florida, has already reported a sustained wind of 48mph and wind gust of 59mph, and the Apalachicola airport also reported a wind gust of 58mph.The storm has forced air traffic to re-route around the Gulf of Mexico.Water has begun to swamp some highways in Florida. The Florida department of transportation posted a video of storm surge topping a sea wall and flowing onto US 98 in Gulf county. Another photo shows flood waters encroaching on US 98 in Franklin county. Georgia is also expected to absorb a blow from Hurricane Michael, Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) administrator Brock Long warned at a press conference Wednesday morning.He said the storm will be one of the worst that southern Georgia has seen in decades, and people there should “wake up and pay attention”.In parts of Georgia, as in Florida, it’s likely power will be out for several weeks, he said.North and South Carolina are also expected to see rainfall from the storm, which is a concern because rivers there have not yet receded to their normal levels after flooding from Hurricane Florence. “Unfortunately it’s going to be a reality and it’s going to cause problems,” Long said.Water is rising in Rock Landing, Florida, according to the National Weather Service.There may be tornadoes embedded in the hurricane, the weather service says.With rain already drenching the area from the fast-moving storm, officials are warning residents Wednesday morning not to try to move if they haven’t already evacuated.“What we’re trying to communicate to our folks is: You’ve made your decision. It’s time to hunker down and ride out this storm,” Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum told CNN. Panama City Beach city manager Mario Gisbert said residents should take shelter in the least exposed room in their homes.“Find a good, safe room within the house – typically it’s a closet, it’s a bathroom, it’s a hallway. If you’ve got an area where you’ve got water rising, just play it safe – try not to travel in that water,” he told CNN. “Stay at home. Stay in a dry spot and just weather it out right now. It’s not the time to move.”Some reports suggested that many of those encouraged to evacuate had ignored the warnings and chosen to stay put. There were mandatory evacuation orders in place for Panama City Beach and Pensacola Beach, but not the city of Pensacola itself.“Communities are going to see unimaginable devastation,” Florida governor Rick Scott said at a storm press conference Wednesday morning.Medical teams are standing by, with 90 ambulances at the ready, Scott said. There are 19,000 workers stage to help restore power after the storm.There are not yet any major power outages or fuel shortages.“Hurricane Michael is forecast to be the most destructive storm to hit the panhandle in a century,” Scott said. Twelve inches of rain could fall in parts of the panhandle. “Flooding will be a major issue,” he said.The storm came on fast, unlike Hurricane Florence which lingered off the east coast for days, leaving less time for officials to prepare.Scott said he had visited Franklin county, where 50 people had decided to stay put on an island off the coast despite visits from law enforcement to encourage them to evacuate. “I’m scared to death for them,” Scott said.Florida governor Rick Scott says he has just spoken with Donald Trump, who offered federal aid to deal with the massive storm.Hurricane Michael strengthened overnight into a dangerous category 4 hurricane, and is headed for Florida – the strongest storm to ever hit the Florida Panhandle.“This storm can kill you,” Governor Rick Scott has warned.The hurricane is expected to make landfall Wednesday, with population centers like Panama City and Tallahassee sitting in its path. The “potentially catastrophic” storm has sustained winds of 145mph, the National Hurricane Center said in its latest update. Storm surge could reach up to 14ft in parts of the hurricane zone.The hurricane is 90 miles south-west of Panama City as of 8am eastern time. Half a million people were advised to evacuate, but officials said Wednesday morning that it was too late to flee and residents who haven’t already left should hunker down. “The time for evacuating along the coast has come and gone. First responders will not be able to come out in the middle of the storm. If you chose to stay in an evacuation zone, you must SEEK REFUGE IMMEDIATELY,” Scott tweeted.We will have live updates here throughout the day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28fe4eabe014d4aa3e8dc4030309825c00bf9195/0_291_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab39ce05d9d60b170f2adc79c354e210","title":"how to grapple with soaring world population an answer from down south","story":"Botswana has one of the fastest falling fertility rates. As global population expands, there are lessons to be learned At the end of a dusty road in the southern African hinterland sits a small concrete building with an orange door. It is a structure so modest and remote that it is hard to believe it could hold lessons for addressing one of the world’s biggest challenges.Outposts like these – offering family planning services, contraception, education – have helped bring about one of the world’s most remarkable demographic shifts. In a continent where fertility rates are the highest in the world and populations are soaring, Botswana has a different story to tell.Fifty years ago, Botswanan women would have seven children on average. Now they have fewer than three. It’s one of the fastest falling fertility rates anywhere in the world – a dramatic decline that merits scrutiny.The world’s population is on track to hit 8 billion in 2023, and almost 10 billion by 2050. Sub-Saharan Africa is set to grow faster than anywhere: there were 1 billion Africans in 2010, but that number will grow to 2.5 billion by 2050.Some have warned that this growth risks “driving civilisation over the edge”, a controversial view given that it is rich countries, not poor, that lead the way on consuming the world’s resources.But enabling women to control their fertility – a move that almost inevitably leads to them having fewer babies – is not just about a tussle over resources, or the environment: it brings enormous ramifications for women’s health, education and employment – with knock-on effects for society and the economy.So what did Botswana get right?In a ground floor office at the University of Botswana, in the country’s capital of Gaborone, Dr Chelsea Morroni considers the issue. “Everyone is always asking how did this happen?”An expert in international sexual and reproductive health at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, Morroni has lived in Botswana with her family for five years. As founder and director of the Botswana Sexual and Reproductive Health Initiative, she spends her days delving into issues around fertility and contraception.But Morroni says understanding Botswana’s dramatic fertility decline involves teasing apart a complex web of factors.“There’s been a huge amount of change in Botswana,” she says, pointing out that since Botswana became an independent country in 1966 the landscape developed quickly, with high levels of economic growth and development of both healthcare infrastructure and education infrastructure, enabling young women to become educated and have employment opportunities.“All of those things on the macro level are really important to fertility declines anywhere in the world,” says Morroni, whose work is part of the Botswana UPenn Partnership: a collaboration between the Botswana health ministry, the University of Botswana and the University of Pennsylvania.But the country made more direct strides, too. “Botswana also was very proactive in the early years in establishing a family planning programme, so in setting up a programme that was far-reaching in terms of its geographical reach, providing access to most people in the country to a range of contraceptive methods,” says Morroni.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theMaternal and child health and family planning services were integrated from the outset more than 40 years ago. A suite of contraceptives are now available through facilities ranging from the most rural health posts to urban hospitals. An NGO, the Botswana Family Welfare Association (Bofwa), works with the government to reach out to even the most rural of locations around the country to improve access to sexual and reproductive health services, particularly among young people.And there is another issue. “Botswana … has been very hard hit by HIV, one of the hardest hit countries in the world,” says Morroni. And as she points out, research suggests there is an association between HIV infection and reduced fertility, although how much of contribution that has made to the steep fertility decline is very difficult to say. “Luckily with the advent of universal access to antiretroviral therapy we are seeing a narrowing of the gap between fertility in HIV infected and uninfected people which is really, really a step in the right direction,” she says.All of which mean that women like Chyna are becoming statistically rarer. “I have seven children and all the time I was bearing these seven children, there was never a break in between eight years,” says the 30-year-old, sitting inside the Gasita room, the fabric around her hair bright with the colours of the Botswana flag.A single mother, Chyna found respite from multiple pregnancies through the work of Bofwa.“I eventually got to find out about the implant from Bofwa – I asked for help because the pregnancies were getting out of hand and, knowing myself, if it wasn’t for the implant I would still be pregnant now,” says Chyna, speaking through an interpreter.While the health post is government run, Bofwa makes a visit about once a quarter to Gasita and nine other settlements around Kanye, led by nurse and midwife Phenyo Ntoko. These outposts are replicated across rural Botswana, where women are increasingly keen to embrace contraception, including the implant which sits in the upper arm and lasts for years.Their priorities are as inidual as the women themselves. For some it is about preventing pregnancies at an early age, for others the main goal is to space children. Many women gathered at the health posts said they only want two, with many years between them to help them raise their first child well.Despite the complex range of factors behind the dramatic fertility decline, and the fact that different countries have different political histories and cultural and social influences that make comparisons difficult, Morroni believes other nations could take a leaf out of Botswana’s book.“From my perspective it is really about having the political will for the development and implementation of a high quality family planning programme with reach,” she says.A World Bank report on Botswana’s fertility revolution says myriad other factors contribute to a more measured approach to family planning: the education of girls, encouraging women to enter in the workforce, and reaching iniduals in their homes by means of visits by family welfare educators.Una Ngwenya, the chief executive of Bofwa, agrees that the family welfare educators were a key factor behind the fertility decline. But, she adds that national averages don’t tell the whole story.“Where I work, mothers still have six kids,” she says. “People tell you in Botswana you have an average of women having two kids – I ask you, where? I cannot see that.“We are one of the most unequal countries in the world – what happens here in the big villages and in the cities, does not necessarily happen in Lorolwane,” she adds, referring to a remote village beyond Gasita, as yet without electricity.A member association of the International Planned Parenthood Federation, Bofwa receives core funding from the organisation, as well as some government funding and contraceptive commodities and antiretroviral drugs from Botswana’s Ministry of Health and Wellness. Other partners include the Positive Action for Children Fund from private firm ViiV Healthcare.But Bofwa has had to close at least two centres because of Donald Trump’s reinstatement of the controversial “global gag rule” which prevents US federal funds going to any group that performs or even provides information about abortions.Among the Bofwa services suspended are projects specifically engaging with populations, including sex workers and men who have sex with men, as well as another working with vulnerable children.“Ah, that was such a blow,” says Ngwenya with a sigh. “The impact of the gag rule was so much on the clients, but also on Bofwa’s reputation. It really impacted our work in a very negative manner.”Bofwa does not provide abortions, but it does counsel women who might be seeking one – which is legal under certain conditions in Botswana – and those who have had an abortion.“For me, it is rewarding to see Bofwa help one girl to terminate a pregnancy that came from incest,” says Ngwenya, adding that improving understanding of when abortion is currently legal is important. “We want the community to know their rights,” she says, noting that the team see cases of young teenagers becoming pregnant. “Our research tells us there is a lot of need here. What has happened to these kids? Could it be rape, could it be defilement?”Nonetheless, Ngwenya is sanguine. “Bofwa is a very resilient organisation, we have been here for 30 years and we will go on for a good while to come.”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

The political infighting comes as the UN’s intergovernmental panel on climate change warned that drastic changes are needed to offset the impacts of global climate change.As part of a strategy to reduce Canada’s emissions, provinces are required to introduce a tax of at least $20 per tonne on emissions from January 2019, with increments of $10 each year until 2022.In provinces which fail to produce an adequate carbon pricing plan, the federal government would implement its own tax, or ‘backstop’–.Last week, Manitoba became fifth province to publicly opt out of carbon pricing, arguing that its own plans to combat climate change were sufficient.Saskatchewan, which still relies heavily on coal for its power, has called the carbon tax a “ransom note”.In Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, rightwing premier Doug Ford has vowed to rally opposition to the measure, which he described as “the worst tax ever”.Alberta, home to the country’s oil sands, announced it would leave the plan after the federal government failed to push through construction of the Trans Mountain expansion pipeline built – a project Alberta argued was critical to its economy.“Until the federal government gets its act together, Alberta is pulling out of the federal climate plan,” said Premier Rachel Notley in August. “And let’s be clear, without Alberta, that plan isn’t worth the paper it’s written on.”Only two provinces, British Columbia and Quebec, have signalled a willingness to remain in some form of carbon pricing agreement.When the original agreement was laid out, many of the provinces had Liberal politicians in power. Now, a conservative wave across the country has changed the party in power – and the political calculus.“This is a political move by the provinces. It’s conservatives wanting to give the Liberals a black eye,” said Nelson Wiseman, a professor of Canadian studies at the University of Toronto. “If you ask people, ‘Should the government do something about climate change?’ they’ll say yes. If you ask them, ‘Are you prepared to pay higher taxes?’ they’ll say no.”The recent stumbles, however, could end up being a benefit for Trudeau, argued Mark Cameron, director Clean Prosperity, an environmental thinktank.“If anything, this may end up making the carbon price backstop more effective,” he said. “Instead of one or two provinces that are going to be falling under it, there will be four or five. You’ll be getting a more coherent national carbon pricing system.”As he grapples with carbon pricing, Trudeau is also engaged in a delicate task of placating his environmental supporters over frustrations that oil development is detrimental to emissions reductions.Construction on the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, which the government purchased from Texas-based Kinder Morgan, was halted over the summer by a federal court order, largely the result of inadequate consultations with indigenous communities.The government remains committed to pushing the pipeline through – and recently hired a retired supreme court justice to buttress its consultations with First Nations. “The idea that the environment and the economy are not opposing goals, is a great framing,” said Hoffman. “But it’s tough to do when you’re framing the economy not as a transformed economy in a low-carbon world, but as further exploitation of fossil fuel resources.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3658938.1539188650!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"storm callum orange alert issued as storm set to batter ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA fallen tree on a car at Cuffe Street in Dublin during Storm Ali.

The warning is in place from 10pm on Thursday until 9am on Friday. A yellow wind warning is in place for Carlow, Kildare, Kilkenny, Laois, Longford, Offaly, Westmeath, Cavan, Monaghan, Leitrim, Roscommon, Limerick and Tipperary. Met Éireann meteorologist Siobhan Ryan said there is the potential for higher gusts locally. “The strongest winds will be all around the coast of Ireland but with a particular emphasis on Atlantic coastal counties and there will be rain accompanying it too,” she said. “An orange weather warning is not to be underrated, it is a severe weather warning. Late Thursday night until Friday, there is the possibility of localised flooding. You’re going to see some violent gusts up along the coast potentially. “All the obvious things apply - stay away from exposed coasts, drive slowly in the anticipated crosswinds. The trees are still heavily leafed at the moment so there is the potential for further trees to fall.” The Road Safety Authority (RSA) has asked road users to exercise caution during Storm Callum. Before the storm arrives Thursday will be cloudy and breezy with fresh and gusty winds. The rain in the southwest and west will become widespread during the morning with heavy falls in places and the risk of isolated thunderstorms. Brighter conditions with showers will follow from the southwest during the afternoon and evening. Highest temperatures will be between 13 and 16 degrees. Heavy rain and extremely windy conditions will sweep in off the Atlantic on Thursday night, possibly stormy in some west and northern coastal areas. There will be possibly thundery rain in many places overnight, with strong to gale force south easterly winds developing, giving way to squally showers and strong to gale force south or southwesterly winds by Friday morning. Coastal flooding is also likely, due to the combination of high seas, high tides, strong winds and low pressure. However, Met Éireann said conditions should abate fairly quickly on Friday afternoon with drier weather developing for a time. Another spell of very heavy, possibly thundery rain will push northwards later on Friday, and rain will be widespread on Friday night and for a time on Saturday but turning drier and fresher later in the day and overnight. Sunday is due to be a bright and fresh day with cooler conditions. There will be sunny spells and scattered showers, with some possibly heavy and prolonged showers in western areas later in the day. Galway City Council says it is installing its “aquadam” at Spanish Arch in the city centre, due to the risk of overtopping of the river Corrib in very high astronomical spring tides. It says its weather assessment team will continue to meet and monitor the potential impact of Storm Callum.During Storm Ali last month, which claimed two lives, wind speeds of over 140kmh were recorded at Mace Head in Connemara early on September 19th, with peak gusts between 7am and 8am.

File photograph: Dara Mac DonaillThe More women may be affected by the CervicalCheck controversy beyond the group of 221 people identified by the Health Service Executive, the Oireachtas health committee has been told.An increase in the number of women affected will “undoubtedly” be the outcome of a further review currently under way, according to Dr Gabriel Scally, who carried out the scoping inquiry into the controversy.Dr Scally and Dr Karin Denton, a UK consultant cytopathologist who also worked on the review, said they were still unclear what criteria the HSE used to select the group of 221 women.Dr Scally said the criteria used were flawed and that he and Dr Denton are still seeking clarification from the HSE.The issue relates to the cut-off point used by the HSE to determine the impact on women whose smear test was misread. In 2015, a decision was made that where more than 18 months had passed before the date of a woman’s cancer diagnosis, it was taken that this may have affected the management of the woman’s diagnosis and she was included in the group.Dr Scally said the 18-month cutoff point differed from practice elsewhere and was “undoubtedly flawed” and it was “hard to see the logic for it”.Dr Denton said they didn’t know whether the cutoff point was subsequently revised and what exact definition was used in deciding which women to write to.Asked to clarify the situation, a HSE spokeswoman said it was cooperating with Dr Scally and that further light on the issue would be shed by the Royal College of Obstetricians, which is examining the smears carried out under CervicalCheck.Health sources say the task of sourcing information about the approach taken by CervicalCheck became more difficult following the resignation of its clinical director, Dr Grainne Flannelly, last April. Dr Scally was appearing before the Oireachtas health committee for the first time since his report on the CervicalCheck controversy was published last month. The report dealt with the failure of the screening programme and doctors to tell women about a retrospective audit that showed smear tests were incorrectly interpreted, potentially preventing them from receiving earlier treatment. Of the group of 221 affected women, 20 have died.Earlier, Dr Scally told the committee a system for compensating people harmed in screening and immunisation programmes should be established.Dr Gabriel Scally said such a mechanism would remove the need for people to enter into adversarial court proceedings.In the United Kingdom, the government compensates people affected by adverse outcomes in immunisation programmes, in recognition of the overall benefit of such programmes outweighs any harms that might result, he pointed out.At the start of the meeting, members observed one minute’s silence for two of the women who died at the weekend, Emma Mhic Mhathúna and another, unnamed patient. Ms Mhic Mhathúna is being buried in Co Kildare today.Dr Scally said he was saddened by the deaths, adding they served as a timely reminder of how serious cervical cancer is and of the need to make the disease an increasingly rare event in the future.In any screening programme, there is a balance between benefit and disbenefit, he said. For example, breast-screening programmes can identify cancers early but may expose some women to a small amount of radiation.In a well-run programme, the benefits will outweigh the disbenefits, he said. A good cervical cancer screening programme should pick up 75 per cent of cancers.Apologising for the length of time it took to produce the report, Dr Scally said the delay was caused by the poor provision of information in response to queries he made. Information was still coming in from the health service within 10 days of him finalising the report.He also said he had been unable to get access to the original tender documents for the outsoucing of smear test analysis to US labs. The committee heard these were shredded by the HSE after 10 years. Dr Scally said he could not get these documents because “in an ususual exhibition of efficiency they were shredded in keeping with the policy to shred things after 10 years. In document management that’s about the only example of efficiency I came across but we will be hunting for those contracts and tenders from the organisations that submitted them”.Dr Scally repeated his view a commission of inquiry into the CervicalCheck controversy was not required. He said his report had succeeded in dealing with a substantial number of issues in depth and that setting up a commission might delay the implementation of its recommendations and distract the system from getting on with what it needed to do now.Ultimately, however, he said it was a decision for the Oireachtas."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3657656.1539107226!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"a student s take on budget 2019 complete inaction for young renters","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTrinity student Saul Kenny was left sleeping on a couch following a dispute with a landlord Photograph: Jack Power Saul Kenny (21) is a final year politics and sociology student in Trinity College Dublin, renting in the city centre.For him the Budget announced on Tuesday was a frustrating “continuation of the same policies” when it came to the housing market, he said.Measures represented a “complete inaction” from the Government towards the difficulties facing young students and workers currently renting.The main change in relation to the rental market was an increase to 100 per cent in the mortgage interest relief rate landlords can claim on loans to buy or refurbish property.“If you’re giving more tax breaks to landlords, is that going to translate into cheaper rent, I don’t know,” he said. What was needed were policies aimed at bringing down the cost of rent, and the Budget did not make any “sweeping changes” in that respect, Mr Kenny said.“From what I saw there was no mention of young people or first time buyers” he said. Commitments to build more social housing were welcome, he said. But the Government had to “try help those people that aren’t homeless, but can’t afford the houses that are being built,” he said.The lack of drastic housing policy changes was disappointing, as “we need something outside the box,” he said.Mr Kenny is living in a three-bed house on Camden Street, and paying €650 a month in rent. Recently he shared his room for several weeks with a friend who could not find accommodation, despite earning “decent money” working for a consulting firm, he said.Referencing recent housing protests and the Take Back the City campaign, which has occupied vacant Dublin city properties, Mr Kenny said the Government “don’t seem to have listened” to young people and protesters.“How many more houses need to be occupied to prove a point . . .

Photograph: Michael McHughPA Trembling with indignation, Nigel Dodds stabbed his finger towards the government benches as he purred with menace at Brexit secretary Dominic Raab. “He needs to understand that as far as we are concerned as the Democratic Unionist Party we will not tolerate anything that separates Northern Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom in terms of customs or single market as we leave the European Union. We’ve been clear about that from Day One! It’s why we had the debacle in December. Let’s not repeat that mistake,” he said.The debacle he was referring to was Theresa May’s trip to Brussels on Monday, December 4th, last year, when she had to rush home without agreeing to a backstop after Arlene Foster called to object. The incident reinforced the DUP’s image at Westminster as brutally tough negotiators, a reputation summed up by the endlessly repeated quote from a party figure during the confidence-and-supply negotiations with May: “This is a battle of who blinks first, and we’ve cut off our eyelids”.The DUP’s missing eyelids didn’t stop May from making a commitment to a backstop later the same week without their approval. Sammy Wilson acknowledged as much on Tuesday when he said the backstop was\u0026nbsp“foolishly agreed last December”.Although Raab looked a little shaken after Dodds’s intervention, he offered no commitments about the scope of the backstop beyond the government’s established position that there should be no customs border in the Irish Sea.As British and EU officials remain in their week-long negotiating “tunnel” in Brussels, Britain has accepted that the backstop will mean that Northern Ireland would remain aligned with the EU for the regulation of goods. The EU’s “de-dramatised” proposal would expand on existing checks on animals entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain.Goods would be regulated in the market as they are now under the EU’s market surveillance regime, which is administered by national and local agencies and is mostly unobtrusive and subject to the principle of proportionality. The DUP has thickened its red line in recent days to include a rejection of such a regime, arguing that regulation in Northern Ireland could erge from the rest of the UK over time.Britain’s demand that the backstop should be time-limited is unacceptable to the EU, which is also sceptical about the idea of the whole of the UK remaining in a temporary customs union.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspNegotiators on both sides believe that the key to resolving these disagreements lies in the relationship between the legally binding text of the withdrawal agreement and the non-binding political declaration about the future relationship. Each side wants its priorities to be enshrined in the withdrawal agreement but both acknowledge the role of the political declaration in providing a context for the legal text that could make it more politically palatable.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Take our test to find outDr Rob Jenkins, who led the research, said: “The ability to distinguish different iniduals is clearly important - it allows you to keep track of people\u0027s behaviour over time, and to modify your own behaviour accordingly.The range could be explained by some people having a natural aptitude for remembering faces.There are differences in how much attention people pay to faces, and how efficiently they process the information.Alternatively, it could reflect different social environments - some participants may have grown up in more densely populated places with more social input.Michel Barnier says Brexit deal \u0026#39within reach\u0026#39 but warns a customs union may be the only way forwardA vision for the developing world: free eye tests for all Facebook and Instagram should pay a \u0026#39mental health\u0026#39 levy to NHS for the damage they cause Princess Eugenie opts for an unconventional wedding cake Princess Eugenie \u0026#39profoundly moved\u0026#39 by her work with teenage cancer patientsCasino visited the home of a problem gambler only for him to lose £1m in 24-hours a year laterDonald Trump not to blame for fall in visitors to US, says tourism chiefHow to pick lottery numbers and win: 8 ways to increase your chances\u0026#39Womxn\u0026#39 row as companies worry the word \u0026#39women\u0026#39 excludes transgender peoplePope Francis compares having an abortion to \u0026#39hiring a contract killer\u0026#39Woman who spent £16 million in Harrods is wife of Azerbaijani banker jailed for £2.2 billion fraudArmy cadets face investigation by MoD after posing for picture with EDL founder Tommy RobinsonComment: If austerity is over, whatever happened to the deficit?DUP threatens to vote down Budget amid fears Theresa May is poised to cross its Brexit \u0026#39blood red line\u0026#39 Anti-mosquito paint: the latest weapon in the war against malariaComment: How spiralling rivalry between Turkey and Saudi Arabia could set alight the Middle East Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit plan will maroon Britain in EU customs territoryComment: Seann and Katya don\u0026#39t owe the public an apology – just one more dance of shameBritish Airways dethroned as top European airline in New YorkPrincess Eugenie\u0026#39s royal wedding: Date, time, details and latest newsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/10/09/TELEMMGLPICT000177288263_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpNzU8CJ-LEEGicl5_0K7GzT5LH4WfwMUwvtX2jlkEnk.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"britain afraid make stand against putins clownish cronies","story":"Despite its recent setbacks, the Russian intelligence agency remains a formidable and well-resourced adversaryVladimir Putin appears to be the only person on the planet who remains resolutely unamused by the clownish antics of Russia’s GRU.

These figures more closely resemble a company’s balance sheet.The IMF said the cost of bailing out banks had been a significant factor dragging the UK down the rankings. The UK also has one of the largest pension liabilities of any nation in the study but is towards the bottom of the pile when it comes to public assets.Using the public sector balance sheet method, countries such as Gambia, Uganda and Kenya rank above the UK because, while they have smaller assets and liabilities than Britain, they have a higher net wealth relative to GDP.The IMF’s report takes particular aim at the privatisation of public assets, the benefits of which it says are often merely an “illusion”.UK economy grows faster than expected in three months to AugustUK economy lost out on £4.5 trillion because of ‘too much finance’Does low-skilled immigration really hurt the UK economy?Remaining in EU better for UK economy than any kind of Brexit says IMFA decade after the financial crisis, the economy needs urgent reformThe UK has undergone one of the most drastic privatisations of any economy since the early 1980s.\u0026nbspUnder the Conservative government since 2015, policy has gone a stage further, incentivising departments and local authorities to sell off assets to fund day-to-day spending under the premise that such an approach is necessary to cut the deficit.But the IMF economists said the tendency of governments to focus on debt “misses large swaths of government activity and can fall victim to illusory fiscal practices”.When public assets are taken into account, selling a public utility,\u0026nbspfor example, may do nothing to improve the public finances, the IMF said.“For instance, privatisations increase revenue and lower deficits but also reduce the government’s asset holdings,” the report stated.\u0026nbsp“Similarly, cutting back maintenance expenditure reduces the deficit and lowers debt, but also reduces the value of infrastructure assets, which could cost more in the long term.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Scotland\u0027s First Minister and leader of the Scottish National Party, Nicola Sturgeon acknowledges the applause as she delivers her keynote speech to delegates on the final day of the SNP annual conference in Glasgow Anna Richardson and Alastair Campbell pose with their portraits at Let\u0027s Talk, a photography exhibition created in partnership with Mental Health UK at Regent\u0027s Place in London.

These figures more closely resemble a company’s balance sheet.The IMF said the cost of bailing out banks had been a significant factor dragging the UK down the rankings. The UK also has one of the largest pension liabilities of any nation in the study but is towards the bottom of the pile when it comes to public assets.Using the public sector balance sheet method, countries such as Gambia, Uganda and Kenya rank above the UK because, while they have smaller assets and liabilities than Britain, they have a higher net wealth relative to GDP.The IMF’s report takes particular aim at the privatisation of public assets, the benefits of which it says are often merely an “illusion”.UK economy grows faster than expected in three months to AugustUK economy lost out on £4.5 trillion because of ‘too much finance’Does low-skilled immigration really hurt the UK economy?Remaining in EU better for UK economy than any kind of Brexit says IMFA decade after the financial crisis, the economy needs urgent reformThe UK has undergone one of the most drastic privatisations of any economy since the early 1980s.\u0026nbspUnder the Conservative government since 2015, policy has gone a stage further, incentivising departments and local authorities to sell off assets to fund day-to-day spending under the premise that such an approach is necessary to cut the deficit.But the IMF economists said the tendency of governments to focus on debt “misses large swaths of government activity and can fall victim to illusory fiscal practices”.When public assets are taken into account, selling a public utility,\u0026nbspfor example, may do nothing to improve the public finances, the IMF said.“For instance, privatisations increase revenue and lower deficits but also reduce the government’s asset holdings,” the report stated.\u0026nbsp“Similarly, cutting back maintenance expenditure reduces the deficit and lowers debt, but also reduces the value of infrastructure assets, which could cost more in the long term.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Scotland\u0027s First Minister and leader of the Scottish National Party, Nicola Sturgeon acknowledges the applause as she delivers her keynote speech to delegates on the final day of the SNP annual conference in Glasgow Anna Richardson and Alastair Campbell pose with their portraits at Let\u0027s Talk, a photography exhibition created in partnership with Mental Health UK at Regent\u0027s Place in London.

Our forecast is for growth of 1.3 per cent, which would be the weakest annual expansion since the financial crisis.”The ONS reported that year-on-year, UK GDP growth slowed to 1.5 per cent in August, down from 1.7 per cent in July.In August itself the ONS estimates that manufacturing output fell 0.2 per cent and that construction slipped back by 0.7 per cent.Separately, it reported that the goods trade deficit was larger than expected by City analysts, at £11.2bn\u0026nbspup from £10.4bn in July.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

According to our estimates, that could suppress wage growth by over 0.25 percentage points each year,” he said.The remarks come at the end of the worst decade for inflation-adjusted average pay in almost 200 years (described by Mr Haldane\u0026nbspas a “lost decade”) and when the Labour Party is pledging to give trade unions a major boost in order to raise living standards.John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, told Labour’s conference last month that a future Labour government would extend union rights to part-time and temporary workers.Mr Haldane, in his speech at an ACAS conference in London, also echoed another Labour critique of the modern workplace, by suggesting that the rise of insecure work and zero hours contracts was holding back pay by acting as a disincentive for people to move jobs (or “twist”), something that has been traditionally associated with a pay rise.“One of the side-effects of structurally-higher job insecurity is a reduced willingness to add to that uncertainty by moving job,” he said.“If so, this would mean ‘twisters’\u0026nbspare fewer in number than in the past and that stickers are at an even greater pay disadvantage to twisters as their outside option has lost value. In short, job insecurity reduces workers’ pay power and weakens upward pressure on pay.”Mr Haldane\u0026nbspidentified other factors that have dragged on UK pay growth in recent years, including the growing market power of large firms and automation.However, he struck a more optimistic note about the immediate prospect for pay growth saying that we may be witnessing a “new dawn” for pay growth due to the exhaustion of slack in the economy, something that should compel employers to lift pay awards.According to the Office for National Statistics nominal annual average pay growth, excluding bonuses, was running at 2.9 per cent in July, still well below pre-financial crisis growth rates.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Our forecast is for growth of 1.3 per cent, which would be the weakest annual expansion since the financial crisis.”The ONS reported that year-on-year, UK GDP growth slowed to 1.5 per cent in August, down from 1.7 per cent in July.In August itself the ONS estimates that manufacturing output fell 0.2 per cent and that construction slipped back by 0.7 per cent.Separately, it reported that the goods trade deficit was larger than expected by City analysts, at £11.2bn\u0026nbspup from £10.4bn in July.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

As well as the two phones – the smaller and bigger version – there was\u0026nbspa new version of the Google Home voice assistant that has a screen, as well as a\u0026nbspnew tablet.Most of the new devices had already been leaked ahead of the official unveiling, but Google still managed a few surprises, especially with its exceptional camera.A full round-up of the event can be found below.As we wait for everything to get started, perhaps it\u0027s worth taking a trip down memory lane to where it all began: the original Pixel. I reviewed it in glowing terms all the way back in 2016, and I think the phone has kept up the promises it showed at that time.\u0026nbspHere\u0027s that original review.With the launch of Indy Minds, we\u0027re offering editors\u0027 letters, which offer a little peek behind the scenes here. And I\u0027ve written today\u0027s, which covers the Google launch as well as our preparations and thoughts. You can take a look at here if you like.Google has lots going on today, not all of it quite as fun or as exciting as the Pixel. For instance, it just disclosed there was a major hack of Google+, and that it\u0027s shutting down.\u0026nbspHere\u0027s why that\u0027s important, even if you don\u0027t consider yourself a Google+ user (which, well, who among us does).We\u0027re starting off with a bit of an unusual video about all of the leaks there have been relating to the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL. And there have been a lot.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe soundtrack\u0026nbspis\u0026nbsp\u0027Help\u0027 by The Beatles – a hint for things to come perhaps? Google Assistant anyone?Rick Osterloh comes on stage to tell us that 2018 marks the 20th anniversary of Google. It\u0027s fair to say the company has achieved a lot in that time, but Osterloh doesn\u0027t have time to tell us about all of that. He\u0027s here to talk about the Pixel.\u0026nbspMany of you in this room say last year\u0027s Pixel 2 still takes the best photos even after a year with so many amazing phones, he says, before moving on to the AI technology that makes this possible.From out of a pedestal in the middle of the room, appear three devices: The Pixel 3, Pixel Slate and Google Home Hub.\u0026nbspEager reporters are crowding around to get a picture, as Osterloh races through the announcements.\u0026nbspThe Pixel Slate apparently brings the power and productivity of a desktop to a tablet, according to Osterloh. Google definitely isn\u0027t the first to make that claim.\u0026nbspThe Google Home Hub, as you might imagine, is for the home. The smart home in 2018 is too complex, he says. I dunno if a brand new device is the way to make things any clearer.Diya Jolly, Google\u0027s vice president of product management, comes on stage to talk about the smart home, revealing that queries to Google Home has gone up 400 per cent in the past year.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspNow imagine not just hearing\u0026nbspa response, but being able to\u0026nbspsee\u0026nbspa response. That is the power of Google Home Hub, she says, referencing the screen that accompanies the hub, as she refers to it.It\u0027s a bit like the Portal device that Facebook unveiled this week, however there is one key difference.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWe\u0026nbspconsciously did not put a camera on the Hub so that is comfortable to use in private spaces like the bedroom, she says.\u0026nbspThere\u0027s\u0026nbsplots\u0026nbspof digital wellbeing here. It\u0027s been a major part of every announcement. The Hub, for instance, can be put into a special downtime mode so that it won\u0027t bother you the Slate will start to go to sleep at night time. Like Anthony said about the Hub\u0027s lack of cameras, it\u0027s hard to read Google and Apple\u0027s focus on this stuff as anything but a shot at people like Facebook, even if they aren\u0027t doing it consciously.Please allow a moment for the live blog to loadShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

By Patrick KingsleyClick to followThe IndependentAt the Morecambe Bay Foodbank, the number of children receiving at least one parcel of free food has almost doubled in the last yearIt’s half past eight, and the school day is just starting at Morecambe Bay Primary, a state-run\u0026nbspschool in northwest England. Siobhan Collingwood, the headteacher, points\u0026nbspto a cheerful boy munching his way through two slices of toast – his first meal of the day.Teachers, she says, sometimes find him sifting through trash cans for discarded fruit. “He’d eat his way through whatever we put in front of him.”Some students trickle\u0026nbspthrough without stopping they’ve\u0026nbspalready eaten. But a few dozen head\u0026nbspstraight to the food counter. Of 350 students, roughly one in three would not have breakfast unless the school provided it, Collingwood reckons.Brexit wasn’t caused by austerity, and here’s the proofDuring Collingwood’s 13 years as headteacher at Morecambe Bay Primary, there have\u0026nbspalways been a few hungry children. But two years ago, the staff noticed an increasing number of youngsters returning undernourished after spending school breaks at home.Initially, Collingwood and her staff were puzzled.\u0026nbspMany parents held jobs, even if they struggled to cover the bills. Then it dawned on them that the rising number of hungry children at Morecambe Bay coincided with sharp reductions in welfare benefits associated with the clumsy introduction of a new welfare programme.“As we spoke to parents,” Collingwood says, “it became clear that for many of them, it was caused by changes to the benefit system rolled out in recent years, which were forcing families into crisis.”Across Britain, the number of children living in poverty has jumped sharply in the past six years, a trend that critics blame in part on the\u0026nbspgovernment’s policy of austerity, the budget-slashing response to the 2008 financial crisis\u0026nbspsteadily reshaping British life.And there is no immediate relief on the horizon. The County Councils Network, a group of local governing bodies, warned recently of £1bn\u0026nbspin budget cuts nationwide next year, draining more money from social services, including some for children.To be clear, Britain is not Venezuela. Reports of hungry children showing up in Morecambe doctors’ offices with rickets have proved false. But that is cold comfort in one of the wealthiest countries in the world, one that over the years has made a strong commitment to child welfare.While hunger is not the only social pathology associated with childhood poverty, it is perhaps the hardest to conceal. In that respect, it is a flashing signal of a deepening problem.For children, the consequences of poverty can be severe. In the short term, poverty elevates the risk of illness, hunger and social stigma. In the long term, it can create a vicious cycle from which a child struggles to escape, especially in class-conscious Britain.British teenagers from disadvantaged backgrounds are roughly a third as likely to achieve good GCSE\u0026nbspgrades, according to government statistics.They are then roughly half as likely to go to university, according to a separate set of government data. Those who do make it are less likely to get a better paid job within six months of graduation than those from more privileged backgrounds. And they are less likely to make it into high status professions, such as finance, law or medicine.Even those who do crack the “class ceiling” earn an average of 16 per cent less than more privileged peers, researchers at the London School of Economics found.The government likes to focus attention on workless families, but there’s hardly any left. That’s a problem of the pastAnd those from poorer backgrounds are likely to die around five years earlier than those who are not, government data suggests.Before the financial crisis in 2008 and the subsequent budget squeeze, successive British governments, both Conservative and Labour, achieved progress on childhood poverty. The number of minors living in “relative poverty” – families with an annual household income less than 60 per cent of the national median, after housing costs – fell by roughly 800,000\u0026nbspto 3.5 million\u0026nbspbetween 1998 and 2012, or 27 per cent of all Britons aged 16 or younger.But the same year that parliament passed the Welfare Reform Act, a central plank of the austerity programme, the trend began to reverse.\u0026nbspSince 2012, about 600,000 children have fallen back into “relative poverty”. During the same period, the number of children requiring food handouts from the Trussell Trust, the country’s largest network of food banks, more than tripled, to over 484,000 from nearly 127,000.Overall, since returning to power in 2010, the Conservatives have announced more than £30bn\u0026nbspin benefit cuts and abandoned prior targets to substantially reduce child poverty by 2020.By 2021, roughly 35 per cent of all minors in Britain are predicted to be poor, according to forecasts by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. And the country’s pending departure from the European Union may deepen the problem, because of rising living costs and the sudden loss of funding from Brussels for young people, according to a joint assessment by seven leading children’s charities.In November, the United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty\u0026nbspPhilip Alston will make an official visit to Britain to research the connection between the austerity programme and the rise in poverty – the first such visit to Britain by a United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty.“It’s increasingly evident, particularly to people working with children, that we’re in a child poverty crisis,” says Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, a British charity. “And it is primarily to do with the massive cuts to benefits.”The Conservative Party leaders who pushed through the austerity programme\u0026nbspdispute that it is the cause of rising child poverty, or that child poverty is increasing. They argue that universal credit – the\u0026nbspnew system that bundles most payments into one –\u0026nbspis an improvement.The new system is “infinitely better than what it replaced”, says Iain Duncan Smith, the Conservative former cabinet minister who oversaw the changes. “The process of stepping into work is easier.”That rationale is being questioned. Though unemployment has been more than halved under the Conservatives, the overall child poverty rate has risen. And roughly two-thirds of poor children have at least one parent who works, the Institute for Fiscal Studies says.“We tell ourselves completely the wrong story about poverty in the UK,” Garnham says. “The government likes to focus attention on workless families, but there’s hardly any left. That’s a problem of the past.”Created with Sketch.Greeks slide deeper into poverty Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Retired teacher and volunteer Eva Agkisalaki clears tables at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensPeople eat at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensThe monthly food supplies that were given out in February by an Athens Municipality-run centre are pictured in AthensAn elderly man sells chestnuts in front of the parliament during a demonstration to demand tax reductions and compensation in AthensPeople make their way outside the main fish market of AthensA butcher waits for clients inside the main meat market of AthensAn elderly woman searches through donated clothes at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox churchChildren\u0027s clothes to be donated to impoverished Greeks are arranged in a stock room at an Athens Municipality-run centre A man waits to have his clothes washed by the Ithaca mobile laundry service for the homeless in central Athens, GreecePeople line up to apply for a social benefit from the Directorate of Social Welfare and Health of the Municipality of AthensFood is laid out on a table at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church Poverty stricken area of Perama Retired teacher and volunteer Eva Agkisalaki clears tables at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensPeople eat at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensThe monthly food supplies that were given out in February by an Athens Municipality-run centre are pictured in AthensAn elderly man sells chestnuts in front of the parliament during a demonstration to demand tax reductions and compensation in AthensPeople make their way outside the main fish market of AthensA butcher waits for clients inside the main meat market of AthensAn elderly woman searches through donated clothes at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox churchChildren\u0027s clothes to be donated to impoverished Greeks are arranged in a stock room at an Athens Municipality-run centre A man waits to have his clothes washed by the Ithaca mobile laundry service for the homeless in central Athens, GreecePeople line up to apply for a social benefit from the Directorate of Social Welfare and Health of the Municipality of AthensFood is laid out on a table at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church Poverty stricken area of Perama Working, but poorJust outside Morecambe, a tourist town that no longer draws so many tourists, George McCullough, a single parent to a six-year-old son, is\u0026nbspin financial meltdown. His rent has\u0026nbspfallen into arrears, and he can\u0026nbspno longer pay the family’s utility bills. He’s started\u0026nbspto dip into his overdraft, incurring further bank charges.He’s\u0026nbspstopped socialising and sometimes skips\u0026nbspmeals to ensure that his son eats\u0026nbspthree times a day. But he can\u0026nbspno longer afford to give the boy a balanced diet or a new school uniform, or take him to see friends.“He basically can’t go to any of his mates’ parties or houses,” McCullough says. “I literally can’t afford to pay for a gift, or even to take him there.”What\u0026nbspthrew\u0026nbsphis affairs into crisis was the transition to universal credit. Before the welfare changes, McCullough received around £685\u0026nbspevery month to supplement the roughly £500\u0026nbspa month he earns as a bus driver for disabled children.It’s\u0026nbspnot just that he now receives\u0026nbsproughly £40\u0026nbspless a month, though for a family that was already struggling to stay above the poverty line, the cut – the cost of a week’s groceries – was painful. (Others have experienced worse: the average working family has lost more than £75\u0026nbspa month, according to calculations by the Child Poverty Action Group.)What has really hurt McCullough\u0026nbspis\u0026nbsphow that loss is\u0026nbspcompounded, severely, by the problematic rollout of universal credit in 2016.Under the new system, all claimants have to wait at least five weeks for their first payment –\u0026nbspa dangerously long delay for families living hand-to-mouth. In McCullough’s case, the delay was long enough to throw him into a vicious cycle of debt.By this May, the family had almost climbed from the hole when they were hit by a second quirk of the universal credit system. After his employers paid him early, giving him two payments in one month, officials wrongly concluded that his salary had doubled and cut his benefits. For several weeks, they refused to admit their mistake, plunging him back into debt.In Morecambe, the problem is compounded by cuts to local children’s services. Before austerity, schools could quickly refer vulnerable families to a local state-funded children’s centre“If this is going to be a regular occurrence,” McCullough asked, “where is the incentive to work?”McCullough’s experiences are not unique. The government’s own research into the system found that nearly half of claimants needed help to fill out the application form, while four in 10 were still facing financial difficulties eight months into their time on universal credit.Duncan Smith, who was the secretary of state for work and pensions between 2010 and 2015, acknowledges\u0026nbspproblems with the way the system has been put into effect.\u0026nbspHe even resigned in 2015 because the finance minister at the time, George Osborne, cut an additional £4bn\u0026nbspfrom the welfare budget. “I thought that was too much,” Duncan Smith says.But “the system itself is the right system,” he adds. “Though a large number of working families are still in poverty, they were in deeper poverty when they were out of work. As they move into work, they’re better off.”Back at McCullough’s, the father’s eyes well\u0026nbspup as his phone buzzes\u0026nbspwith debt notices from the local water board, and he describes\u0026nbsphow he struggles\u0026nbspto provide his son with some of the basic things in life – like fresh vegetables, new clothes and haircuts.McCullough voted Conservative in past elections and says he would do so again if an election were held tomorrow. Despite his travails, he supports the party’s cautious approach to state spending, and he thinks there are too many people expecting handouts for nothing.But he no longer believes that restructuring benefits will get more people into work, or more children out of poverty.“Until you walk a mile in someone’s shoes, you can’t know,” McCullough says. “Until you’ve seen how it works, you don’t understand.”In Morecambe, the area’s Conservative MP\u0026nbspDavid Morris\u0026nbspsays in an email that child poverty had fallen in his constituency, and blames\u0026nbsp“left-wing political activists” for any suggestion to the contrary. In previous interviews, he has accused headteacher Collingwood of having political motivations for speaking out.But the demand for free breakfasts at Morecambe Bay Primary is not the only warning sign.The relative child poverty rate in Morris’s constituency rose to 25.9 per cent from 2013 to 2017, up from 24.2 per cent, according to research by the Centre\u0026nbspfor Research in Social Policy at Loughborough University. That may not sound like much, but the rise has produced marked changes on the ground.How social supermarkets are filling a gap in austerity BritainAt the Morecambe Bay Foodbank, for instance, the number of children who received at least one parcel of free food has almost doubled to 1,229 in 2017-18, from 656 in 2013-14. At the local branch of Citizens Advice the number of food vouchers distributed to children in the same period increased sixfold, to 1,336 from 222.In Morecambe, the problem is compounded by cuts to local children’s services. Before austerity, schools could quickly refer vulnerable families to a local state-funded children’s centre, where social workers would work with children and parents to solve their problems.Since 2010, however, roughly 1,000 of these centres have been closed across Britain after about £990m\u0026nbspin funding cuts. Those that remain – such as those in the Morecambe area – have substantially reduced their capacity.“The caseload is growing, and the system\u0026nbspby which we would have supported them is diminishing,” Collingwood says. “We feel much more like an island.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

That is certainly the case where me and Rupert Murdoch are concerned.I was a young, new journalist on The Sunday Times. I’d been charged with “gutting” an official report into a business deal – the buyer was thought to have covered up the source\u0026nbspof his money. It was a big story at the time. I was called to the editor’s office\u0026nbspand told, to my shock, that I was not only going to cover the findings, but I was writing that week’s leader.Just at that point, as the news sank in, the editor suddenly rose. Behind me, a familiar figure had walked, unannounced, into the room. It was Murdoch, the proprietor. He gestured to sit down, and asked what we were discussing.Rupert Murdoch may be revitalised by his exit from SkyThe editor told him, and explained that it was going to be the subject of an editorial\u0026nbspand that I was putting it together. Whereupon Murdoch turned to me, fixed me with a stare, and asked: “Why does it matter?”I stammered some sort of reply about the importance of knowing where people’s funding originated – this was well before money laundering became a hot topic. Murdoch wrinkled his face. I was on shaky ground, clearly he did not think it of any importance at all. Then, another man who was standing in the doorway, who was accompanying him, spoke. He reminded Murdoch that they’d done a deal with the subject of the official inquiry, which had gone sour. Murdoch listened, and nodded. “That’s right, I remember.” He looked at me. “Son, write it as hard as you like.”Down the years, the memory of that short encounter has stuck. Murdoch was not physically large, but he conveyed immense power. His energy was obvious. He was naturally combative, constantly seeking to challenge.Back then, the basement under The Sunday Times building in\u0026nbspWapping was a store room. It was full of satellite dishes. Sky TV was in its infancy, and it relied on the newfangled device of a dish rather than the traditional aerial. If I’m honest, I doubt if many of us gave the fledgling venture much of a chance. Terrestrial broadcasting, led by the BBC, was so entrenched in the UK, that the prospect of it being seriously taken on seemed fanciful. Not only that, Sky would have to rely on a pay-per-view model, while the BBC was funded by the government, and by what was effectively a tax in the form of the annual licence fee.The amount the Murdoch family is said to have made from selling their 39 per cent stake in Sky to ComcastSome 30 years later, Murdoch has sold his remaining 39 per cent stake in Sky to the US company Comcast, in a deal that valued the UK firm at £30bn, and which netted the founder and his family £12bn.The company statement which accompanied the deal showed I was not alone in my scepticism. “When we launched Sky in 1989 it was four channels produced from a prefab structure in an industrial park on the fringes of west London,” it said. “We bet – and almost lost –\u0026nbspthe farm on launching a business that many didn’t think was such a good idea. Today, Sky is Europe’s leading entertainment company and a world-class example of a customer-driven enterprise.”While that hints at the risk Murdoch took –\u0026nbspand gives some indication of his resulting emotional attachment to the company, and pride in his achievement\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspit does not say what Sky also did: transforming English football rivalling the mighty BBC for news coverage with Sky News and taking on broadband providers by offering internet services. And as it says, the company spread across Europe, in Italy and Germany. In the process, Sky also grew to become a central component in the Murdoch global empire.Rupert Murdoch may be revitalised by his exit from SkyComcast beats Rupert Murdoch’s Fox in Sky takeover battleMPs vow to defy ‘threatening’ newspaper headlines on Brexit voteTony Blair: closeness to the Murdoch press was a ‘necessary evil’Now, it’s gone. Not only that, Murdoch has previously sold much of 21st Century Fox’s film and TV production assets to Disney in a $70bn (£54bn) deal, leaving him and his family with the Fox sports and news channels, and the News Corp newspaper and publishing businesses in the UK, US and Australia.That’s still a massive undertaking, and one that would keep most people fully engaged. But Murdoch is not most people. Even at 87 years of age he exhibits the ambition and drive of someone much younger.There have been signs in recent years of Murdoch slowing down. But it would be wrong to suppose these latest developments\u0026nbspwill see him signal the end. When he gave evidence to the House of Commons select committee on phone hacking by his newspapers in 2012\u0026nbspthe slowness of his answers, containing numerous pauses, shocked many.Not those who know Murdoch. He’s always spoken like this, particularly in a situation where he is being confronted and put on the spot. His tactic is to buy time, to speak after a considered silence, to be drawn out, and careful.He is extremely happily ensconced\u0026nbspwith his new wife, Jerry Hall, 25 years his junior. At a recent party, attended by media and arts folk, their arrival drew the usual sarcastic whispers, along the lines of what does the tall, former supermodel see in the much older billionaire. My wife, who was observing, said it was obvious – they were very much in love, you only had to look at their body language, and their attentiveness towards each other, to realise that.She had a point: they did indeed appear infatuated, moving away from the crowd to sit,\u0026nbspchat and laugh together.These days, Murdoch is more likely to be found in suburban Richmond, in southwest London, where Jerry has long maintained a glorious home, than in one of the world’s business centres. Early mornings often find him taking a constitutional walk in nearby Richmond Park. But that does not mean the friendly old cove – several journalists have declared their astonishment at seeing the feared media titan strolling along, smiling and relaxed – is not pondering as he goes.It’s too easy to suppose the phrase “clogs to clogs in three generations” applies to Rupert and his offspring. On the face of it that might appear so – he spends three decades building up Sky, longer where his newspapers are concerned\u0026nbsphis progeny are not up to the task of grabbing the steering wheel and pushing the businesses on to even greater heights.It’s true that they might lack their father’s hunger and clarity of vision. It’s impossible for instance to imagine James, Lachlan or Elisabeth (Prudence, their elder half-sister, is not so business-oriented) having the courage to buy a fading paper like The Sun, and to turn it into the self-styled “People’s Paper”, challenging the orthodoxy every inch of the way. Or being prepared to tilt at BBC News. Or\u0026nbspdisrupting the established order by forcing up the price of live sports rights.Neither, though, are any of the three exactly business schmucks. Each has proved themselves to be successful, capable of guiding and leading. They are however very different characters, with specific interests and qualities. Broadly, James is into distribution and technology, Lachlan loves news, Elisabeth is adept at developing new TV content. Ideally, possibly, Murdoch might have hoped for one of them to emerge as a Rupert Mk2, but that has not materialised.According to Murdoch’s biographer, Michael Wolff, he was desperate for his children to take over –\u0026nbsp“taking pride of place even over profits.”It was not to be.The fact is that with the sales, Murdoch has seen the threat posed by the digital juggernauts, realised he was embedded predominantly in legacy media, as it’s somewhat disparagingly referred to by the onliners, decided it was going to be tough\u0026nbsp(and get even tougher)\u0026nbspto compete – so stayed in the game, but readied to sell up if the price was right.Murdoch’s passion is in power, in the nexus of politics and business – and that is in newsThat moment has been reached, but while it must rankle that his interests have shrunk, he can take satisfaction from the realisation that the price paid is far higher than anyone foresaw. He may be emotionally attached, but price will always win out. Indeed, he can allow himself a wry smile that Comcast may turn out to have overpaid.Meanwhile, the pressure of combatting the tech behemoths is off, and all he has to do is count his winnings. Murdoch’s situation is akin to that of a poker player getting out while on top. Yes, he may have gone on to chalk up yet more brilliant hands, but equally he may not have been dealt any more. Better, surely, to duck out now, and leave the agony of battle, and watch how the cards fall to the other players in future.There were opponents –\u0026nbspJames, in particular, is believed to have been resistant (as he should have been, since it was James’s part of the Murdoch business mass that was being offloaded).In the end, says Wolff:\u0026nbsp“It is Hall who is said to have given voice to the obvious: just sell and be done.”But it’s not as if the Murdochs are quitting completely. Not only do they retain Fox News and their other sports channels and Fox assets\u0026nbsp(now repackaged in New Fox, to be run by Lachlan), but they have some of the world’s leading print titles with their attendant websites, to be going on with. And bags of cash.They’re now able to pick and choose what they want to buy, where they want to go. One assumption is that they will bolster New Fox’s presence in sports by purchasing more live TV rights. Another is that they will seek to get back into content creation by making their own programmes for the Fox TV networks. Already, names like Sony Pictures Entertainment and Lionsgate are being mentioned as possible acquisition targets. Or, New Fox might decide to start from scratch and develop its own version of Netflix.Tony Blair: closeness to the Murdoch press was a ‘necessary evil’Lachlan takes the tiller at New Fox, answerable to his father. James is going off to pursue other interests – he is a director of Tesla, and a close friend of Matthew Vaughn, the film producer and director, and the possibility of James and Matthew hooking up in business together has been rumoured.Of course, it won’t be the same, but consider: New Fox alone should generate more than $2bn a year in cash, and that’s without dipping into the proceeds from the sales of Fox’s entertainment and production arms, and Sky. Murdoch and the younger Murdochs, in short, are not leaving the global media stage. Not yet.It may just be that the sell-offs allow Murdoch to return to his first love: newspapers. He was never that much interested in producing entertainment shows and films. His passion is in power, in the nexus of politics and business – and that is\u0026nbspin news. And that means Fox, but it also means newspapers, where he began, in Australia, all those years ago.In Australia, his newspapers played a pivotal role in the\u0026nbsprecent putsch against the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, criticising his energy policy. In the UK, his company has moved into news and current affairs radio, adding Talk Radio. Meanwhile, his News UK newspapers continue to enjoy prominence and influence, setting the agenda for TV and radio newscasts.Gove and Rupert Murdoch’s relationship should be investigated, says Private Eye editor Ian HislopIn the US, Murdoch finds himself in a curious position. He’s not thought to have much regard for Donald Trump, although he is close to Ivanka, Trump’s daughter, and her husband, Jared Kushner.Trump, though, is a Republican, and a maverick, someone who likes to shake up the established way. In that sense, he is just like the head of the Fox channel –\u0026nbspTrump’s favourite and, in turn, a strident supporter of the president –\u0026nbspand the newspapers, The Wall Street Journal and New York Post.Murdoch may have little time for Trump. For all his directness, and for all the cheekiness of some of his titles, notably The Sun, Murdoch remains a serious man at heart, reserving his favour for conviction politicians. But even if Trump does not qualify for praise\u0026nbspin Murdoch’s eyes,\u0026nbspthe media chief still remains a hugely vital figure, right at the centre of the daily cut and thrust surrounding the president.There is much, then, for Murdoch to relish. A chapter or two has been brought to a close, but the story of Murdoch and the Murdochs is far from over.Chris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns and strategic communications advisory firmShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Today, little has changed on the islandsClick to followThe IndependentIn the 1950s, transportation on the islands was by a pony-drawn cart and even today there are few carsThe last time I saw Bridin Concannon, she was walking towards me along the narrow road on the westernmost edge of the island of Inishmaan, off the west coast of Ireland.“Were you out at Synge’s Chair?” I called out as she approached.The sun behind her hung, unmasked by clouds, low and long in the Irish early summer sky.“I was,” she said. Her voice was strong, clear – the way one’s voice can be when exhilarated. “I’ll start writing a play soon.”Trump cancels trip to Ireland after massive protests plannedWe both laughed loudly, and strode past one another. She was headed back towards the village and I towards the cliffs over the North Atlantic, to a perch of limestone that the author frequented during his time here, a spot known locally as Synge’s Chair.The Irish playwright JM\u0026nbspSynge (1871-1909) first came to the Aran Islands in the summer of 1898 looking for inspiration and to learn the Irish language. Over the next several years he would return again and again, growing more connected to the people and the wind-and-sea-battered land they inhabited.Synge’s most famous work\u0026nbspPlayboy of the Western World\u0026nbspwas inspired by a story he heard while on the islands, and caused riots in Dublin when it was first staged in 1906. The foremost playwright of the Irish Renaissance – a movement inspired by strong political nationalism and a revival of Celtic traditions – Synge was co-founder of The Abbey Theatre, also known as the National Theatre of Ireland. All six of his plays are either set in or heavily influenced by his time in Aran.The three remote Aran Islands of Inishmore, Inishmaan and Inisheer hide in plain sight in the mouth of Galway Bay. They are still predominantly Irish-speaking, insular and, as even in Synge’s era, considered a place lost in time.It was the poet William Butler Yeats who suggested that Synge come to these islands. “Go to Aran,” Yeats told his friend. “Live there as if you were one of the people themselves express a life that has never found expression.”Synge grew more attached to the islands over time, and I had a notion that repeat trips might similarly enhance my appreciation of Aran’s more subtle charms. I decided to visit the islands over a period of several months, from early spring to high summer. I hoped that my repeated act of return and departure would elicit in me the sense of investment, as well as illuminate details and patterns of day-to-day local life that are the deep appeal of such places as Aran, places not needy of a traveller’s attention.Synge took a steamer from Galway that sailed at the mercy of the tides, on the rolling sea, and transferred into a currach, a small canvas-covered fishing boat, to make it to shore. These days things are slightly easier, with a daily ferry schedule as well as light aircraft service.My initial impression of the largest island of Inishmore from the ferry was not dissimilar to Synge’s:.\u0026nbsp“A dreary rock appeared at first sloping up from the sea and into the fog,” the author wrote in The Aran Islands –\u0026nbsphis classic account of his time here, first published in 1907. “The place looked hardly fit for habitation. There was no green to be seen, and no sign of the people.”Part of the considerable allure of Aran lies in what it lacks. There are no cinemas and few cars electricity only arrived in the 1970s. Seventeen-year-old Thomas Kennedy summed it up for me within minutes of my arrival when he said:\u0026nbsp“There’s no facilities here – you rely on the people.” And while much has remained unchanged since Synge’s time, society has reached the islands. Synge wasn’t confronted with the dozen or so glamping structures visible on arrival, for one. And the pierside Atlantic Hotel, where Synge resided while on Inishmore, has been transformed into the Aran Sweater Market.But beside the shop, three pubs, one food shop, a restaurant and a handful of bed and breakfasts, there is little else in the way of commerce. The 12 square mile island is home to roughly 760 people, most clustered around the main settlement of Kilronan, with the vast majority of terrain given over to small parcels of grazing and farmland, delineated by Aran’s most dominant feature, its dry-stone walls.“You have to be OK within yourself to live here,” Melissa Gillian told me as I stood eavesdropping on a wedding reception outside the Aran Island Hotel. A Maine native, she married a local man and has lived on Inishmore for 10 years. Gillian was one of only a handful of outsiders I met over the months – all are married to locals her sentiment was one I heard often, on all three islands.Most visitors stay only a few hours, travel a well-worn circuit and hustle back onto the boats for the comparative metropolis of Galway or the pubs of Doolin. But it is during the early morning hours, and again later in the afternoon once the last ferry of the day has gone, that the island’s deeper appeal emerges.If you’ve seen one image of the Aran Islands, it is likely to be an aerial shot of Inishmore’s Dun Aengus, semicircular stone walls that abut a 300-foot sheer cliff above the Atlantic. The initial walls of this ring fort – one of seven to be found on the islands – date back to 1100BC, and it is next to impossible not to gravitate to the site while on Inishmore. A visit at daybreak was rewarded by absolute solitude, as the wind whistled over the stones. Birds caught thermals below the cliffs. Clouds raced across the sun. Time stretched.As I was leaving, the buses began to arrive. I sat on a wall eating a Nutella crêpe\u0026nbspand watched coach after coach deposit people with fanny packs and (unneeded) sun hats. Though watching the human drama of group tourism from a slight remove has its own rewards, I had a date with a magic well.Early on during Synge’s first visit to Inishmore, he met a man who told him a story. A Sligo woman, it seems, had a dream that her blind son might be made to see if she travelled to a particular well out on the Aran Islands. She did so, and upon touching the well’s water to her sightless child’s eye, he exclaimed, “O mother, look at the pretty flowers!” Synge would use this story and his visit to the site as the inspiration for his play\u0026nbspThe Well of the Saints.My local map indicated the well as a tiny dot not far off the road, yet I’d cycled past it twice without luck. Finally I caught sight of an old sign that directed me over one stone fence and then another, through several fields, until I came upon the ruin of a tiny building:\u0026nbspThe Church of the Four Beautiful Persons\u0026nbsp(no one I met on the island could explain the origins of the name). I stepped over cow pats and entered. The sun emerged and the grey stones brightened. At that moment, a cow poked her head inside to see who was on her turf.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis visits Ireland – in pictures Show all 55Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis celebrates the Holy Mass at the Phoenix Park, in Dublin Pope Francis arrives at Phoenix Park for a Papal Mass of the World Meeting of Families in DublinA vigil takes place at the site of the mass grave which contained the remains of 796 named babies from the Bon Secours Mother and Baby home in Tuam.

A tin cup had been left beside it, and someone had tossed in a small crucifix. A small pile of stones, similar to the ones that covered the well’s floor, sat next to it, apparently meant to be thrown in the well. As a long-ago lapsed Catholic, this ritual seemed to me somehow more pagan than Christian. I tossed a few in, thinking of my children.Back in town, the crowds were converging for the afternoon ferry to the mainland. On impulse, I grabbed my bag, deciding again to follow Synge’s lead – this time to another of the islands.After only a brief stay on Inishmore, the playwright headed for Inishmaan, of which he noted:\u0026nbsp“Gaelic is more generally used, and the life is perhaps the most primitive that is left in Europe.”I wondered how much things had changed, and as I headed to the ferry for the short crossing to the middle island, Loraine Conneely, an Inishmore native, read my mind. “You’ll see,” she said. “It’s still the same over there. It hasn’t moved.”If the traveller is greeted with a (relatively) bustling arrival on the big island, no such welcome – in fact, no welcome at all – awaits the visitor in Inishmaan, which is less than four square miles. The ferry dock is a half-hour walk to what passes for a village (there is one shop and one bar). Life, as it did in Synge’s time, revolves around the caprices of weather and the ties of community.Little energy is spent looking outward – exactly how the 160 inhabitants prefer things.Over my months of coming and going, I encountered many of the same people again and again on Inishmaan: Ciaran O’Ceallaigh, who was raising his son on the island because he wanted him “to grow up in a true Irish-speaking environment” Bartley Conneely, who owned 21 acres and six cows, and could easily be persuaded to give a visitor a lift to the ferry and the pair of ladies I often saw when out walking, who cautioned me against staying too late up at the ring fort of Dun Fearbhai, lest the fairies interfere with me.Synge noted many stories of strange happenings on the island. “These people make no distinction between the natural and the supernatural,” he wrote. But he also eloquently described a people living a hard-scrabble life very close to the elements: “Of beings who feel their isolation in the face of a universe that wars on them with winds and sea.” Synge encountered people who carried themselves with workaday dignity and offered a humble, sincere welcome – exactly what I found on Inishmaan 120 years later.“We’re ambivalent about tourists on this island,” the restaurateur Ruairi de Blacam told me. “You’re left to go about your business. Get a map – you’ve got shoes – and off you go.” De Blacam is a local boy who made (extremely) good. In 2007 he and his wife, Marie-Therese, opened Inis Meáin, the singular high-end restaurant and inn on the islands.“It’s unlikely, if not impossible, we could have done this if I wasn’t from the island,” he said as I sipped some of his delicious lobster bisque and watched a setting fireball sun slash light across the limestone just outside the restaurant’s picture window. “You need the people’s support.”He continued: “We’re on a precarious perch out here in the ocean. People lean on each other in all sorts of ways. When I was a kid, I went around with a candle and people still dressed in traditional clothes. Ireland was 20, 30 years behind the rest of the world, and Aran was 20, 30 years behind Ireland.”The sun dropped, as Synge wrote of a similar sunset a century earlier, “like a lozenge of gold flame into the sea” and the ocean was cast in a purple hue.“But things are moving fast we’re catching up a bit,” de Blacam smiled and placed a dish of scallop ceviche with toasted almonds in front of me.“What you have to understand is that the people here live a very simple life. And we’re here by choice. There’s an understated pride, and the legacy of Synge is certainly a part of that.”Very much so: The cottage to which the playwright returned each year – a small, whitewashed, thatch-roof affair – has been preserved as a museum of sorts. Though it’s technically open to the public, hours vary, and it took some doing, to track down Ciaran O’Faherty, whose great-grandparents had offered Synge a bedroom in what was then their home. Once I finally cornered him in the pub, O’Faherty was happy to oblige me with a look. On this island that insists on existing out of time, the cottage’s green front door was a portal through the century things inside remain as Synge had described: “My room is at one end of the cottage … There is a kitchen with earth floor and open rafters … It is full of beauty and distinction.”As much as Synge relished his island home, he spent most of his days out walking the land. Over on the far western side, atop high cliffs, he found a stand of rock looking out over Galway Bay and Inishmore that he would return to again and again. “As I lay here hour after hour, I seem to enter into the wild pastimes of the cliff,” he wrote.This was when I found myself headed out to Synge’s Chair. The semicircle cluster of limestone created a natural barrier against the elements, cradled the visitor and invited lingering. Each of my visits was similar time slipped the way time can when there is nowhere to go: at first excruciatingly slowly, then in a blink, the day would be gone.With just the one pub for action, nights on Inishmaan are quiet and even a loner can yearn for society. As Synge did, I made the short crossing to the smallest island of Inisheer (on two occasions I was the only ferry passenger from Inishmaan). Upon coming ashore, Synge was confronted with a man –\u0026nbsp“a drunkard and shebeener” – who lived “with the restlessness of a man who has no sympathy with his companions.” Upon my arrival I was met with an only slightly less distressing social challenge.As on Inishmore, the day tourist trade had taken hold. There were horse and trap rides, coffee carts and stands selling local fudge. But just beyond the flurry of town, Inisheer, with its 250 residents, is perhaps the most physically picturesque of the three Aran Islands, and its three square miles make it easy to navigate on bicycle. (Bikes were readily available directly off the ferry on both Inishmore and Inisheer. Not surprisingly, there was no bike rental on Inishmaan.)Atop the island’s highest hill, beside the ruin of O’Brien’s Castle, Aine O’Graiofa had put a few tables out in front of her home and called it a restaurant. I took a seat in the driveway and settled in for one of Ireland’s staple country lunches – ham and cheese on toasted white bread – while looking down across Galway Bay to Connemara in the distance.Inisheer boasts three pubs, one shop and a church.“The priest died four years ago and they haven’t sent another,” O’Graiofa told me. “We’re left to our own devices.”We chatted of the decline in the church’s dominance over the people throughout Ireland.“Sure it’s their own fault,” she said. “We have the old schoolteacher who goes up and leads folks in the rosary that’s all we need.”Watching a ferry cross the bay down below, I asked if it was heading for Inishmaan.Businesses call for gay marriage to be legalised in Northern IrelandHIV rates rise in Northern Ireland – despite falling across rest of UKThe motley crew lining up to contest the Irish presidential election“I doubt it. You go over there and you don’t see a soul they’re all hiding behind the stones.”We laughed, but soon enough I made my way down to the dock.Back on Inishmaan I walked past the old graveyard from which Synge took inspiration for his play Riders to the Sea, and continued up the hill, across from Synge’s cottage and up over five stone fences and through five small fields to the ring fort of Dun Chonchuir. Synge would “often stroll up there after a dinner of eggs or salt pork, to smoke drowsily on the stones.”Like Synge, I had sat on these walls and viewed the sea in nearly every direction, but on this evening, a fog rolled in. The air became moist. Summer changed to autumn in a matter of minutes. I could barely make out the far end of the small fort enclosure. With no wind, a heavy silence hung in the mist. The century that separated me from Synge seemed suddenly trivial, and a world beyond these dry stone walls didn’t matter at all.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

disarray’\u0026nbspas British project leaders have their positions handed to European partnersClick to followThe IndependentProfessor Peter Coveney is concerned about the fate of medical research in the country following BrexitA top British scientist has called the government “totally chaotic” as he stands to lose\u0026nbsphis leadership of major European projects after Brexit.\u0026nbspProfessor Peter Coveney heads up three EU projects with a total value of around £15m, and he says work like his will be compromised if a deal is not agreed before March.His research, which aims to create a “forecasting system” that predicts disease, involves scientists working across Europe but is led from University College London.A no-deal Brexit would be a disaster for the UK science communityWhile the government said\u0026nbspit will fund British scientists participating in European projects if they lose out on money post-Brexit, it has not promised to support entire projects with UK scientists at the helm.The EU currently hands British project leaders millions of euros to distribute among their partners, but it will not do this if the UK is relegated to a so-called “third country” after Brexit.“The big thing that is unclear is that there is no agreement from the government here to continue to support projects that are led by the UK,” said Professor Coveney.“So leadership of projects – big ones that are influential – is thrown completely into disarray.”Created with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit deal Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with

simulate human bodies and plan people’s medical treatments and surgeries in advance.Due to limited British capacity to undertake such projects, he said this kind of research is totally dependent on European collaboration.His criticism comes after Royal Society president Venki Ramakrishnan\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspTV particle physicist Professor Brian Cox voiced their concerns about the impact of Brexit – particularly a no-deal outcome – on British science.Many leading scientists, including two Nobel prize winners, have backed The Independent‘s campaign for a Final Say on the Brexit vote.Leading scientists back call for Brexit deal voteThe UK is currently positioned as a European leader, home to many of the EU’s most prestigious research institutions and receiving 15 per cent of the funding from the flagship European funding programme Horizon 2020.However, this status will be threatened if the nation’s top scientists are forced to hand over the reins of their research to partners.Such an outcome now seems likely, as the government expects the UK to become a third country without a deal, and the prospect of a no-deal Brexit now looks more plausible than ever before.He wants reassurances that his projects and the livelihoods of lab members who are paid with this funding are not jeopardised.Professor Coveney contacted Mr Gyimah to voice his concerns, and received an assurance that the government was “seeking discussion” with the European Commission concerning a no-deal scenario.“This would need to include projects where the UK participant is responsible for coordinating funding,” Mr Gyimah wrote.Scientists fear loss of half a billion pounds of funding after no-dealDismissing this response as “merely regurgitating” information from the government’s official no-deal planning documents “that was unhelpful in the first place”, Professor Coveney said he needs the government to guarantee it will replace any lost funding in its entirety. He has laid out his case in a blog post for the campaign group Scientists for EU.“The picture is as follows: if you were to be a third country following midnight on 29\u0026nbspMarch and you wanted to continue to run these big projects, it would be incumbent on you to fund the entire thing,” he said.This would mean committing to funding not only the British scientist in charge of the project, but also the international team working with them.Despite the expense, he said this was a price worth paying to maintain UK leadership in science and protect the health of its citizens by funding medical research.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

According to our estimates, that could suppress wage growth by over 0.25 percentage points each year,” he said.The remarks come at the end of the worst decade for inflation-adjusted average pay in almost 200 years (described by Mr Haldane\u0026nbspas a “lost decade”) and when the Labour Party is pledging to give trade unions a major boost in order to raise living standards.John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, told Labour’s conference last month that a future Labour government would extend union rights to part-time and temporary workers.Mr Haldane, in his speech at an ACAS conference in London, also echoed another Labour critique of the modern workplace, by suggesting that the rise of insecure work and zero hours contracts was holding back pay by acting as a disincentive for people to move jobs (or “twist”), something that has been traditionally associated with a pay rise.“One of the side-effects of structurally-higher job insecurity is a reduced willingness to add to that uncertainty by moving job,” he said.“If so, this would mean ‘twisters’\u0026nbspare fewer in number than in the past and that stickers are at an even greater pay disadvantage to twisters as their outside option has lost value. In short, job insecurity reduces workers’ pay power and weakens upward pressure on pay.”Mr Haldane\u0026nbspidentified other factors that have dragged on UK pay growth in recent years, including the growing market power of large firms and automation.However, he struck a more optimistic note about the immediate prospect for pay growth saying that we may be witnessing a “new dawn” for pay growth due to the exhaustion of slack in the economy, something that should compel employers to lift pay awards.According to the Office for National Statistics nominal annual average pay growth, excluding bonuses, was running at 2.9 per cent in July, still well below pre-financial crisis growth rates.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

On top of this, government’s own research shows that sanctioning under universal credit has no effect in encouraging people to progress in work.\u0026nbsp“With the next stage of universal\u0026nbspcredit about to rollout to three million people, it is vital that we learn from evidence on the ground and avoid the mistakes of the past.”\u0026nbspMargaret Greenwood, Labour’s shadow work and pensions secretary, said it was “shocking” that the government was sanctioning working people who are “just trying to do the right thing”.She said: “This report shows that there is no evidence that sanctioning helps people increase their earnings. Meanwhile, wages are still below 2008 levels and millions of people are stuck in insecure work.“Universal credit is clearly failing in its current form. Labour is committed to a root-and-branch review of the social security system to ensure it tackles poverty and provides support when people need it.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Scotland\u0027s First Minister and leader of the Scottish National Party, Nicola Sturgeon acknowledges the applause as she delivers her keynote speech to delegates on the final day of the SNP annual conference in Glasgow Anna Richardson and Alastair Campbell pose with their portraits at Let\u0027s Talk, a photography exhibition created in partnership with Mental Health UK at Regent\u0027s Place in London.

He said such checks “already exist in many EU member states – such as between mainland Spain and the Canary islands”.The negotiator also said the EU believed regulatory compliance checks for industrial goods could be carried out at the premises of businesses.But Mr Barnier warned that so-called phytosanitary checks on live animals and other agricultural products had to be carried out at the border, and would have to apply to 100 per cent of all imports. Some of these checks already exist, but they are only conducted as spot-checks and applied to just 10 per cent of imports.“EU rules are very clear: such checks must happen at the border because of food safety and animal health reasons,” he told business leaders.EU rules are very clear: such checks must happen at the border because of food safety and animal health reasons“Obviously in the future the island of Ireland will remain and must remain a simple epidemiologic area, obviously.\u0026nbsp“Such checks already exist in the port of Larne and Belfast. However they would have to cover 100 per cent rather than 10 per cent of live animals and animals derived products, which would involve a significant change in terms of scale.”He added that there would have to be “administrative procedures that do not exist today” but that “the EU proposes to carry out these checks in the least intrusive way possible”.“The UK wants to leave and will leave the single market and customs union. This means that there must be checks on goods travelling between the EU and the UK and checks that do not exist today,” he warned.Business cannot plan for Brexit \u0027because of government secrecy\u0027Government recruits emergency staff to help tackle Brexit \u0027disruption\u0027Brexit paves way for Scottish independence, Sturgeon saysDUP leader Arlene Foster meets EU officials for extensive Brexit talksMr Barnier said such checks could be reduced in scope in the future if the UK and EU signed a veterinary agreement down the line as part of a trade deal.Brussels is currently in an information lockdown for the final stages of talks, with officials tighter-lipped than usual about progress coming towards a solution.\u0026nbspThe British government has indicated that it would accept regulatory checks proposed by Mr Barnier and that it does not see them as a breach of the UK’s sovereignty in the same way as it sees customs checks.\u0026nbspBut the DUP has made clear that it does not see things the same way – meaning a deal could be agreed between the Government and EU and then voted down by Ms May’s allies in the Commons.Created with Sketch.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.John Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

Thank you for standing with the truth without fear.Meanwhile, the country\u0027s education minister Naftali Bennett, who is also head of the far-right Jewish Home party, echoed the sentiment.On behalf of the Israeli people: Thank you for what you\u0027ve done for Israel. We will not forget, he tweeted.Israeli commentators noted\u0026nbspthat it was unlikely that Ms Haley’s successor would be able to “match her zeal” for Israel and bemoaned that the country had lost a major ally.Trump says Ivanka could be the next UN AmbassadorAfter Nikki Haley\u0027s resignation, the Democrats should be very worriedNikki Haley resigns as US Ambassador to UN amid expenses controversyNikki Haley claims UN laughed at ‘Trump’s honesty’ at UNHaley tells UN \u0027no country would act with more restraint than Israel\u0027Nikki Haley tells Palestinian leadership ‘I will not shut up’However, the Palestinian leadership said that the US\u0026nbsppolitician\u0027s\u0026nbsppro-Israel agenda was horrible and that “no one would cry for her departure”.We don\u0027t interfere in the appointment of American positions, however Haley isolated the US in speaking on behalf of Israel, Nabil Abu Rudeina, a spokesman for the Palestinian Authority and Palestinian President\u0026nbspMahmoud\u0026nbspAbbas\u0026nbsptold The Independent.\u0026nbspWe hope for a better person and policy\u0026nbspfrom the White House according to international law ... We would like to hear an American representative, not an Israeli one, he added.\u0026nbspPalestinian commenters, meanwhile, welcomed her departure, saying her term in office had been a “nightmare” for the Palestinian cause.“Today, as Ambassador Haley leaves office, she ends a two-year-long nightmare for the Palestinians and for those hopeful to reach a peaceful settlement in the Israeli Palestinians conflict,” wrote Mohamed Shehada, a commentator and analyst based in Gaza.She repeatedly pledged to shield Israel from any criticism, further empowering Netanyahu’s fanatical cabinet and leaving their dangerous ambitions unchecked,” he added.Ms Haley spearheaded the US administration’s efforts to combat what it alleged were unacceptable anti-American and anti-Israel actions by the UN. That included leading the US decision to leave the Human Rights Council and to\u0026nbspstop funding UNRWA,\u0026nbspthe UN agency for Palestinian refugees.Riyad\u0026nbspMansour, observer to the UN for the Palestinians, has in the past\u0026nbspaccused\u0026nbspMs Haley of becoming more Israeli than the Israelis themselves.Netanyahu (Timothy ClaryAFPGetty)She had controversially dismissed as “off the table” the Palestinian claim to “right of return” to lands they fled or were forced from during the conflict surrounding the creation of Israel, as well as subsequent conflicts.The so-called right of return is one of the sticking points of the peace process.Last month Ms Haley also defended the US decision to cut its funding to UNRWA, saying the Palestinians had done nothing but beg and “badmouth” Washington. She also refused to listen to a Palestinian delegation speak during a UN Security council chamber meeting in May and blocked the appointment of Salam Fayyad as UN envoy to Libya because he is Palestinian.Meanwhile she was met with rapturous applause in 2017 when she first spoke before the American Israel Public Affairs Committee’s (AIPAC) annual conference and told the crowds “there’s a new sheriff in town” and that the\u0026nbspUS had no greater friend than Israel.As she announced her resignation on Tuesday she said she had given “everything” she had to the job.“I do think it\u0027s good to rotate in other people who can put that same energy and power into it, she added.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

And they will only agree if we keep our rules in lockstep with theirs.                David Davis issues chilling Brexit warning to Theresa MayMr Johnson claimed the backstop \u0026ldquocloses off our options and once again urged the Government to \u0026ldquochuck Chequers now.\u0026nbspHe added: It means we cannot have no deal  WTO or SuperCanada. Under either our rules could differ from the EU\u0026rsquos \u0026ndash so they will keep us in the backstop instead. It means, in fact, that the only possible deal is Chequers.\u0026ldquoThis is far from #TakeBackControl. In the referendum both sides said Leave meant leaving the customs union \u0026amp single market.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoYet this backstop inevitably means chequers, staying in both, no say in either, and no right to escape.

admits these are politically difficultMichel Barnier said Brexit would trigger the need for customs, VAT and compliance checks with EU standards between Ireland and Northern Ireland, but admitted these are politically difficult.\u0026nbspHe added customs declarations could be filled in advance online and the\u0026nbsponly visible systematic checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK would involve scanning the bar codes on lorries or containers, which should be done on ferries or in transit ports.For industrial goods, this could be done by market surveillance authorities in company premises but checks on animals and animal-derived products would still have to take place on the border.\u0026nbspMr Barnier said: Our challenge is to make sure that these procedures are as easy as possible and not burdensome, particularly for small and medium business.He admitted such cheks were politically difficult but said it was a consequence of Britons voting to leave the EU.4.10pm update: EU and UK have agreed checks cannot be performed at the borderMichel Barnier set out details of the EU\u0027s proposals for arrangements to prevent a hard border in Ireland.\u0026nbspHe said: The UK wants to leave and will leave the single market and the customs union.This means that there must be checks on goods travelling between the EU and the UK, checks that do not exist today - customs and VAT checks and compliance checks with our standards to protect our consumers, our economic traders and to protect your businesses.Mr Barnier said the EU and UK have agreed these checks cannot be performed at the border and the EU proposes to carry them out in the least intrusive way possible.He added under the European Commission\u0027s backstop plan for the Irish border, customs and VAT checks would be carried out using existing customs transit procedures, to avoid the need for physical inspections at the border.4pm update: Deal \u0027within reach\u0027 by October 17 summit - Barnier\u0026nbspMichel Barnier provided a huge boost in Brexit negotiations after saying a deal with the UK is within reach by next Wednesday.EU leaders will meet in Brussels on October 17 to discuss a possible Brexit deal with Britain.\u0026nbspOfficials and diplomats have said they hope to be able to agree a final withdrawal treaty offer which Theresa May can accept in principle.\u0026nbspThis would then pave the way for a special summit on November 17-18 to complete the terms for a political declaration on thew future trading relationship.Providing an update on negotiations in the European Parliament, Mr Barnier said: \u0026ldquoWe have objectives that have been set by the 27 member states and an agreement is within reach by October 17 at the next European Council meeting.That is why we are interested in maximising an orderly withdrawal and minimising the cost of withdrawal.Keep up to date with all of today\u0027s Brexit news with Express\u0027s live blog below:2:50pm update: Barack Obama\u0026rsquos deputy Joe Biden has said Brexit threatens to undermine the US role in western securityThe former US vice president said Brexit is an intractable problem, and one that threatens to undermine America\u0027s role as a major player in the security of the west.Mr Biden said: \u0026ldquoUS interests are diminished with Great Britain not an integral part of Europe and bringing to bear influence well beyond the economy, on the European attitudes towards a whole range of subjects.It seems to me that there is a growing awareness in Europe as a whole and around the world that Britain played a role in Europe over the last 30 years that went well beyond the notion of open borders, trade and all these other things - being able to influence attitudes about things that have nothing to do with the elements of the EU state.2pm update: DUP vows to oppose any new barriers to trade between Great Britain and Northern IrelandTreasury minister Mel Stride said: The Prime Minister\u0027s position has always been crystal clear on this issue of no border down the Irish Sea, we have said it many, many times.Tory MP, Mr Stride added: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not going to get into the specifics of what may or may not be going on in the negotiations at the moment, other than to say that I am extremely confident from all that I know, that I have seen and all the discussions that I

that having given the decision as to whether we stay in the European Union or not to the British people - the British people having voted to leave - it is our duty to ensure that we leave.What we are working to is to ensure we have a good agreement for the UK an agreement that delivers on the vote people took in the referendum to leave the EU to bring an end to the jurisdiction of the European Court, to bring an end to free movement, to being an end to the vast amounts of money we send to the EU.But that does it in a way that protects jobs that ensures there is no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.When we come back with a deal I would hope everybody across this whole house would put the national interest first.I would hope everybody across this whole house will look not only at a good deal for the future of the United Kingdom but also remember that having given the decision to the British people and the British people voting to leave it is our duty to ensure that

Questions.\u0026nbspMr Clarke said that the maths makes it obvious that Mr May\u0027s final Brexit deal will have to be supported by pro-EU MPs from both sides of the house and not those with hardline views, including right-wing nationalists in our party.But Mrs May said she hoped she could come back with a deal both sides would be happy with.\u0026nbspMay defends her Brexit negotiations in PMQs

her.He told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: We are entering the end phase of these negotiations, we all know that EU negotiations tend to run up to the last minute and the person to make the judgments on getting the best deal in the national interest is the Prime Minister.Theresa May has made it clear that the Irish Border issue needs a solution  (Image: )9am update: Imperial College in

national debt and it is an important issue to raise.We are ensuring that the debt is going to fall.We have seen a reduction in our deficit of three quarters under this government.The honourable

first obtain a compromising agreement with the EU27 on the terms of our withdrawal and then to win the approval of this house, the majority in this house, for that same agreement.Does she equally accept that, the maths makes it obvious, that the majority can be obtained only if the agreement retains the support of the pro-eu Tory backbenchers and also win the support of a significant number of labour backbenchers, which will reveal that the hard-line eurosceptic view of the labour frontbench and the right wing nationalist in our party are a minority in this partyWill she therefore proceed courageously in the formidable task that lays ahead of her.In response, Mrs May said: What we are working to is to get a good agreement which delivers on the vote that the people took in the referendum, to bring an end to the jurisdiction of the EU court, to bring an end to the free movement and to sending vast sum of money to the EU, but that it also protect jobs and prevent from creating a hard border between NI and Ireland.I would hope that when we come back with a deal i would hope that everybody across this house will put a national interest first, everybody will look not only at a good deal for the future of the UK, but will also remember that having given the decision to whether staying in the EU or not, the British people voted to leave and it is our duty to ensure

They are everywhere!!A third also reported: Hundreds of #adybirds crawling all over the greenstone walls in Shaftesbury today.Harlequin ladybirds, scientic name Harmonia axyridis, are ladybirds that are not native to Britain.Experts have previously said the ladybirds reach Britain by hitching a lt on the warm southerly winds.The foreign creepy-crawlies are said to pose a threat to the domestic species because they carry a sexually-transmitted disease, called Laboulbeniales fungal disease.They are sometimes called the “Halloween ladybird” in the US because of the time of the year they flock.But there are actually , dferent species of ladybirds across the globe, with  dfernet types in the UK.The Harlequin ladybird is one of the newest insects to the block, appearing in Britain in .The beetles were introduced into mainland Europe from Asia, with it hoped they would help to control plant pests.Thriving here, they have even outcompeted some native ladybird species - even known to eat other ladybird larvae.To recognise the Harlequin ladybird from other British species, there are some telltale signs including:- Harlequin ladybirds are generally large, measuring about -mm- Their wing colour can be pale yellow-orange, orange-red, red or black highly iable- The pattern on their backs generally have zero to  orange-red or black spots* According to the Harlequin Ladybird SurveyThe deluge normally comes around this time of year, with a woman filming the insects pelting her countryside home as they sought shelter.Margaret, who lives just outside of Ickleton, Cambridgeshire, said the three-day pelting was like something out of Hitchcocks The Birds.Margaret said: I was lucky I noticed it was happening as they just came out of nowhere and started hitting the window and streaming in.It was a struggle to close the window as I didnt want to squash any of them and by then they were already all over the window frame.Its not the first time the loveliness of ladybirds have swarmed homes.Residents in the town of Lipova, in western Romania, were forced to seal up their homes after the beetles descended in .Locals said they were so many it was like a living carpet, and that they had to shovel them out."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000433197202.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"jean claude juncker everything wrong with eu","story":"He is everything that’s wrong with the European project — and why it’s so vital that we leave.In his latest rant, he demanded “respect” and delivered a warning that “Press freedom has its limits”.

But this is the reality of trying to save up for a house.They work hard each month. They’d love to put something aside to save up for a home.But to live where there are good jobs, they have to spend so much on high rents that there’s nothing left over.So they can never save enough to break out of the cycle. No wonder they are frustrated.New figures show how bad things have got. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says four out of ten people in the  to -year-old age bracket couldn’t afford the mortgage on even the cheapest house in their area, eventhey had a deposit.The gap between prices and normal people’s earnings is just too big, because since  house prices in Britain have gone up more than in any other developed country.Expensive housing has meant that the proportion of young people on middle incomes who own their own home has collapsed: down from nearly two thirds  years ago, to just over a quarter today.We have to turn this round and restore home ownership.Many people feel they can’t get on and start a family until they have a nest of their own. Their lives are on hold.Politically it’s vital too. If young people don’t feel they’ve got a chance to get on in le, they are more likely to gamble and vote for extreme, disastrous politicians like Jeremy Corbyn.Even younger people who are earning decent wages feel squeezed, because they face a combination of high house prices and chunky repayments on their student loans.The Prime Minister is acutely aware of this. That’s why she’s set up a review of student fees, and moved to make housing her Number  priority other than Brexit.Hence her announcement of massive funding to build more affordable housing for people on lower incomes. But there’s much more to do.Building more homes for people to buy is a big part of the answer. Since  we have built only half as many houses as France each year, and so house prices have gone up twice as fast.Some people say building more means we must tear up the planning system and concrete over the countryside.But we know that approach won’t work. When Gordon Brown was PM we tried setting each area massive housing targets. All those targets built was resentment. We need a smarter approach to tackle the reasons people often oppose new housing.We build in the wrong places. Instead of tacking on new estates to existing towns and villages without enough new school places or parking places, let’s get back into the business of building planned new cities and towns.Let’s build upwards in our city centres with taller buildings, rather than just sprawling cities outwards.What drives people mad is seeing developers make massive windfall profits when they get planning permission, but then not sharing those benefits with local residents.Imagine instead,new houses being built next door always paid for people in neighbouring streets to get cheap homes for their children to buy. People would feel much better about development.Restoring the dream of home ownership isn’t just about building more houses though.We need to think about the balance of rented properties and home ownership. Over the last ten years we’ve built many new homes each year, but the number of homeowners fell. How come The reason is that the number of properties being snapped up by buy-to-let landlords has grown faster than we have built new ones.Don’t get me wrong. Landlords, who have themselves worked hard, weren’t doing anything wrong.Butwe want to get home ownership growing again we need to encourage savers to put their money into shares and into growing businesses rather than just bidding up the price of houses. The think tank Onward proposed this week that we should offer a tax break to landlords who sell their homes to their tenants.This “Chance to Buy” would be a bit like the Right to Buy Margaret Thatcher introduced for council tenants. It could be paid for by tax changes which would discourage people from buying up new buy-to-let properties.So fewer landlords, more homeowners.Young people just want the same chances previous generations enjoyed.

Many are never taking it up in the first place.The study found that the number of young adult who had never been drinkers rose from nine per cent in  to  per cent in .There was also a signicant drop in the number of binge drinkers.The number of young people who drank above the recommended number of units recommended by the Government has dropped from  to  per cent and binge drinkers fell from  to  per cent.Dr Linda Ng Fat, author of the study, said: These trends are to be welcomed from a public health standpoint. Factors influencing the sht away from drinking should be capitalised on going forward to ensure that healthier drinking behaviours in young people continue to be encouraged.The increase in young people who choose not to drink alcohol suggests that this behaviour maybe becoming more acceptable, whereas risky behaviours such as binge drinking may be becoming less normalised.The researchers examined data on , people aged  to  collected as part of the Health Survey for England  to .The study, published in BMC Public Health, found that young adults from many dferent groups were choosing not to drink alcohol, including those living in the north and the south, those in full-time education, in employment, among the white population and across all social classes.However, rates had not fallen among ethnic minorities, those with poor mental health and smokers.Dr Ng Fat added: That the increase in non-drinking was found across many dferent groups suggests that non-drinking may be becoming more mainstream among young people which could be caused by cultural factors.Dr Richard Piper, CEO of Alcohol Concern, said: “The proportion of young people not drinking in the UK is certainly increasing. This is not a new trend, and it’s not just true in the UK: it started in the mid-s and is happening across most developed countries.“But we mustn’t get complacent: alcohol misuse remains the biggest risk factor for ill health, disability and death for people aged - in the UK, and the alcohol industry continues to plough spending into shoring up young people’s drinking through advertising.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The ‘average’ survival time would be a matter of days.Leave your house behind and head for isolation and make your first destination a camping shop for warm clothing, waterproofs and some sturdy hiking boots.Rely on a car GPS device instead of smart phone maps – you’ll soon be losing phone signal when power grids go down.Dartnell, who is a professor of science communication at the University of Westminster, and wrote The Knowledge: How to Rebuild our World from Scratch, added: Chapstick, Vaseline and hairspray are all great for helping get a fire started in dficult conditionsWith regard to weapons I suggest relying on your own ingenuity and resourcefulness, fashioning what you need from metal pipes or nails.”The study of , Brits also found the average adult believes they could evade a zombie bite for just over nine weeks,  hours and  minutes.Even NOW TV’s The Walking Dead could double up as a survival tool, as  per cent said they would scour Zombie TV shows for tips on how to stay alive.Make your first destination a camping shop for warm clothing, waterproofs and hiking boots. You’ll be spending a lot of time outdoors, and when you’re running away you don’t want to slip and break an ankle.Buy iodine tablets to pury water once the taps run dry. There’s no point in surviving a zombie attackyou’re just going to die from a waterborne disease.Rely on a car GPS device instead of smart phone maps to find minor roads.  You’ll lose phone signal when power grids go down.A plastic bottle must become your new best friend. If it’s summer, disinfecting drinking water by simply leaving it in the sun for a day can become a regular part of your routine An unraveled tampon makes an ideal dressing to stop a wound bleeding, and it’s perfect kindling for starting a fire.A condom can hold over a gallon of water. Don’t let it rupture in your bag.Chapstick, Vaseline and hairspray - all great for helping get a fire started in dficult conditions.Once the refined fuels have disappeared, cars can actually be run using wood as fuel. The process is called ‘gasication’ and was common in WWII. Leave your house behind and head for isolation.Get out of the city. Not only will they have the highest concentrations of roamers, but urban areas simply won’t be habitable once technology disappears.Head into the countryside and find traditional buildings with fireplaces and wells. A seaside region near a large wood is your ideal new home, offering you access to a wide range of natural resources.Ideally, a secluded spot with high walls or fences will help keep the swarms of walkers out when you’re settling down more permanently.Stick together - youll never survive the apocalypse as a lone wolf. Theres safety in numbers, but be careful who you pick as friends.Send scouting parties to find other pockets of survivors, or rig-up a radio transmitter.In the early stages of a zombie attack you can scavenge food from abandoned supermarkets or distribution centres. Prioritise canned food that will keep for years.If you forget your tin opener grind the top of the can in flat circles pushing down onto a paving slab. You’ll quickly wear away the thin metal lip and get that lid off.The power grid is out: but don’t worry, you can stay connected. Scavenge a mobile generator from roadworks.When the diesel runs out, you will need renewables: scavenge solar  or small wind turbines.The best kind of rechargeable battery is a deep-cycle lead acid battery. Scavenge these from things like golf buggies. Surprisingly, a golf course is one of the most practical places to head for after an apocalypse.Always dig your DIY loos at least  meters away from your water source and downhill, for obvious reasons.Washing your hands. Soap can be made from scratch by soaking water through the ashes of burned seaweed to extract soda, and then reacting this with slaked limeto make caustic soda. Boil this with lard, or any other animal fat or plant oil, to make soap.If you injure yourself, attend to the wound immediately. You can disinfect with alcohol and then close the wound with superglue.Stream season  of The Walking Dead now on NOW TV with a contract-free Entertainment Pass.

The party, whose MPs prop-up the Tory Government, have privately admitted the radical move is one of the optionsattempts to nail down a deal with Brussels mean Northern Ireland being treated dferently to the rest of the UK. Losing the partys support in the Commons would mean possible defeat on the budget and a no-confidence vote. DUP leader Arlene Foster insisted on Tuesday that her party would not accept customs or regulatory checks on goods travelling in either direction between Northern Ireland and Great Britain after meeting EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels. A DUP spokesman said: The Government is well aware of our position on this issue. Our position hasnt changed and we dont expect the Government will change its position. The DUP has  MPs, although Ian Paisley will not be able to vote in the Commons until November  after being suspended for failing to declare two family holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government.  Mrs May, meanwhile, urged MPs across the Commons to act in the national interest and back a Brexit deal amid warnings that decisive progress is needed in the negotiations before a crunch Brussels summit next week. Downing Street insisted that defeat on the budget would not amount to a vote of no confidence in the Government under the terms of the legislation which provides for fixed-term, five-year parliaments. The Fixed-Term Parliaments Act sets out the circumstances for a confidence vote, the Prime Ministers official spokesman said.  Mr Barnier briefed top EU officials behind closed doors at a regular meeting of the College of Commissioners on Wednesday, which also heard European Commission secretary-general Martin Selmayr warn of the need to be prepared for all outcomes from Brexit. In Westminster, the Prime Minister urged MPs to do their duty to implement the result of the Brexit referendum as she struggled to maintain discipline within the Tory ranks. It was Mrs Mays first appearance in the Commons since last months Salzburg summit, when EU leaders told her that her Chequers blueprint for Brexit would not work.  She has come under growing pressure from Brexit-backing Tories to drop the plan agreed by the Cabinet at her country residence in July and instead seek a Canada-style free trade deal.  But veteran Europhile Tory Kenneth Clarke urged her to ignore hardline Brexiteers and bring forward a deal acceptable to pro-EU MPs on both sides of the Commons. The former chancellor said that would reveal the hardline Eurosceptic views of the Bennites in the Labour leadership and the right-wing nationalists on the Tory benches were in the minority in the Commons. Treasury minister Mel Stride said: The Prime Ministers position has always been crystal clear on this issue of no border down the Irish Sea, we have said it many, many times.The DUP has vowed to oppose any new barriers to trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Mr Stride told BBC Radio s World At One: Im not going to get into the specics of what may or may not be going on in the negotiations at the moment, other than to say that I am extremely confident from all that I know, that I have seen and all the discussions that I have had, that there will be a very, very firm position taken on this. The Prime Minister made it very clear no UK prime minister is ever going to put him or herself in the position where they start to unpick the economic and sovereign integrity of the UK. Labour has indicated it will oppose a deal based on the Prime Ministers Chequers plan and will push for a general election or, possibly, a second referendum. Eurosceptic Tories claim dozens of Conservatives are also prepared to vote against a Chequers-style deal. The Prime Minister said: I would hope that everybody across this whole House will put the national interest first. She added they should also remember that Parliament gave the British people the decision over Brexit, and following the  referendum result it is our duty to ensure that we leave.  The negotiations are reaching a critical stage ahead of next weeks European Council summit.  The October  meeting was initially framed as the deadline for agreement on the terms of UK withdrawal from the EU, as well as the publication of a political declaration on future relations in areas such as trade and security. But with both sides confirming that dferences remain on issues such as the status of the Irish border, expectations are growing that the final moment of decision will be put back to a special summit in November. Following the College of Commissioners meeting, two commissioners stressed the importance of continued UK EU co-operation on security after Brexit.

Call a halt to this experiment - cruel and vindictive far beyond austerity - that is pushing child poverty among millions of hard-working British families to record levels. From next July when three million more families begin to be herded on to Universal Credit, our country will face the kind of chaos we have not seen since the days of the hated Poll Tax. With the convulsions of Brexit in March and the Universal Credit four months later we face a summer of ision and despair. From July each family on tax credits today will have to submit a wholly new form for Universal Credit – a policy Ministers have been warned will risk a breakdown in the system. Instead the Government should order a review into what is going wrong – and give emergency help to those families now in despair because of benefit cuts. With child poverty rising inexorably from three million in  to four million now and to more than five million by , October  should bring a Budget for children. And to halt the rising epidemic, Child Benefit should be raised and child tax credits should be improved - as the one way, alongside a decent living wage, that we can get low-paid families out of poverty.  Today’s poverty explodes the myth that children are in poverty because their parents are work-shy and indolent. Two thirds of the children in poverty have a parent in work - but earning too little to lt them out of poverty. In fact, nearly half - % - of households are in poverty where there is one breadwinner only in work and no other adult working. The majority of the rest who are in poverty have disability in the family. Savage Cuts are pushing them on to the breadline. And after freezing Child Benefit and children’s tax credits for years Universal Credit is taking pound-billion out of the social security budget as it is introduced. Almost .-million working families will, according to the Resolution Foundation, stand to lose an average of pound a week.  For poor people the safety net is becoming not the welfare state - it is instead becoming food banks and charities. We have seen what has happened in the Highlands where Universal Credit was first introduced. The UK Government has been asked to reimburse the local authority for the big increase in council rent arrears. Right now, in my own home area food banks are running out of food as requests for help double as a result of Universal Credit. Charities struggle to cope when giros which used to run out a few days before the next one now run out after a few days into the last one. Having served  years in public le I am now seeing poverty and hardship that I never thought I would witness and that I honestly thought we had escaped from for ever decades ago. Recently I have visited families that don’t have a cooker - and that means no hot food for the children. I have seen over the summer, when schools were out, girls and boys going for a whole day without a square meal – with charities struggling to improvise breakfast clubs and lunch clubs. I have met parents who, no matter how many hours they work, cannot put enough food on the table for their children after they’ve paid the rent the heating and for other basic essentials. The fact is that there is now more child poverty than under Margaret Thatcher and John Major. The income ide between rich and poor is bigger than in living memory. SIGN THE PETITION  Theresa May says her mission is to address burning injustice. Well the greatest burning injustice of all time is children going to school ill-clad and hungry. It is the poverty of the innocent – of children far too young to know they are not to blame. But the Government have lit the torch of this burning injustice and they have fanned the flames, with their pound-billion of cuts. Ato poll tax style chaos in a summer of discontent lies ahead...more rent arrears, more dependence on food banks and endless real-le stories of the infirm driven into desolation. As one of the architects of tax credits I remind people It was dficult enough to introduce tax credits even when we were spending billions more. But to impose universal credit and to force three million to reapply for their benefits next year when on top of a child benefits freeze they’re spending pound-billion less is chaotic, cruel and vindictive far beyond austerity.  So I am calling today for the Government to abandon the  national roll out of Universal Credit and end this harsh, harmful and hated experiment. We need an urgent review on the lines suggested by the Child Poverty Action Group to be instigated and we must hear the voices of those who know what it’s like to have help cut short I join iniduals and organisations who have called for a rethink including The Archbishop of Canterbury, The Church of Scotland, The Mayor of London, Disabled Against The Cuts, The Mayor of Liverpool, Mind, The Trussell Trust, Unison, Unite and Citizens Advice Bureau as well as the Child Poverty Action Group and most disabled charities. The review should look closely at three options: redesign Universal Credit to make it fit for purpose axing it in favour of reverting to the old systemUC is unfixable or introduce a brand new system altogether. And many good people have plenty of ideas about how this could be done Yes, right now, the issue of Brexit - our exit from Europe - is critical to our country. But millions of our fellow citizens are facing an equally big nightmare - anxious and insecure because they have no exit from poverty.

The remarks - hours after the Mirror launched a petition to halt UCs rollout - appear to show John McDonnells warning that the Tories flagship benefit has got to go is now official policy. It is a big change to the partys previous aim to pause and fix the benefit, which has thrown families into rent arrears and turned them to food banks.It also means Labours language has hardened signicantly since two weeks ago, when the Mirror revealed the party could scrap UC.At the time, shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Margaret Greenwood said Labour was in the process of looking into whether UC could be ditched.  But she said she was not ruling anything out during a year-long review because Labour wanted to be on top of all the detail. After that interview, it emerged Tory welfare chief Esther McVey had privately warned many families could lose pound a month. That prompted Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell to say on Sunday: The reforms havent worked. He added: I think we are moving to a position now where it is just not sustainable. It will have to go. Today, in a briefing for journalists in Westminster, the spokesman appeared to back Mr McDonnells comments - and added the current review will look at what should replace UC.  The spokesman said: The government is quite clearly unable to cope with the failure of its own benefit reforms. The Universal Credit system is not working. It is not delivering what it was intended to, and was advertised as doing. As John McDonnell said last weekend this is a system that is not delivering, that isnt working and needs to be scrapped. And thats why were committed to a review of the whole of its performance and what should replace it. We say there are three options:Redesign UC to be fit for purpose Axe it in favour of the old systemUC is unfixable Introduce a brand new systemSign our petition to stop the rollout of Universal Credit across Britain and to replace it with a fairer system by signing our petition. Last month Tory ministers warned ditching UC and reverting to the old system would cause massive disruption and be “complex and expensive - because the changes have become increasingly embedded.

The second Jeremy Corbyn is unfocused, flitting from one topic to another without landing a decent hit on any of them. These scattergun sessions usually end up with either a win for the Prime Minister, or a no-score draw.Today’s PMQs was dferent.Corbyn’s scattergun finally found his target.  He didn’t stick to one policy area - bouncing from mental health to policing to education. But today there was an underlying theme tying each question together: Theresa May’s baffling claim that the British people can breathe easy, because austerity is over. The Labour leader opened with a question about mental health provision, reminding the PM there are a shocking , fewer mental health nurses than there were in . “The Prime Minister said last week that austerity was over,” he said. “When will austerity be over for mental health services ” Mrs May, flanked by health secretary Matt Hancock, and sporting a huge green ribbon for Mental Health Awareness Week, insisted her Government had “ensured there will be parity of esteem” for mental health services.  There was an almost audible sigh of relief from the Tory benches when Corbyn moved onto a dferent subject without poking too much at the PM’s claim. But Corbyn’s strategy soon became clear. When will austerity be over for the police, whose union are taking the government to court to get a decent pay rise  When will austerity be over for teachers, who have had years of measly, capped pay increases or freezes, and many of whom are leaving the profession they love   When will austerity be over for local councils - including Tory Northamptonshire and Somerset councils, both of whom are complaining they can’t make ends meet after savage cuts to their funding  And perhaps most importantly, when will austerity be over for the poorest and most vulnerable - considering % of social security cuts haven’t bitten yet  It became clear that what first appeared to be a scattergun approach was a relentless assault on the austerity project, and the Conservative ideology behind it. After every change of subject, Mrs May was still scrambling for answers to the previous question. And none of them stuck. In the face of it, all she could do was insist: “Better times are ahead under a Conservative government.” The Prime Minister can pat the British people on the back for their hard work, and assure them their sacrices have paid off. But for many people watching PMQs, it won’t feel like austerity is over. Not for a long, long time.

Being tailgated is the biggest cause of anxiety among those polled, while bad weather is top for a further  per cent of drivers. Another one in three admit to getting wound up by cyclists on the road. And almost four in  drivers say their biggest stress trigger is driving on a winding lane with blind bends while  per cent can’t deal with passing tractors. The research was conducted by insurers Swinton Group, which has teamed up with road safety charity IAM RoadSmart on a campaign to remind drivers of their road manners in a bid to reduce stress on Britain’s roads this winter. Anne Kirk of Swinton said: “We see a sharp increase in calls to our customer service team each year from October and throughout the winter period as drivers navigate tougher driving conditions and busier roads.  We know that stressed drivers can contribute to accidents, and we want to play our part in helping reduce the likelihood of incidents on the road.” Rebecca Ashton, head of driving behaviours at IAM RoadSmart added: “The behaviour of others on the road has a signicant impact on the stress levels felt by motorists, so we’re encouraging drivers to remember their road manners. “Stress can affect how we feel physically and emotionally and, as a result, can impair our judgement and our reactions. “Courtesy costs nothing, and tailgating or making sudden decisions, like braking and swerving, will frustrate other drivers and distract you. “Aggressive driving is not safe, soyou feel agitated, you should always stop driving.” The study, of more than , adults, found women are more likely than men to let something on the road stress them out. And London drivers feel more stress than those living anywhere . In comparison, drivers in the South East find themselves the most relaxed while driving.  To demonstrate how easily stress can build up on the road, TV and radio presenter Gethin Jones was tested by IAM RoadSmart on six top driving stressors to see how he’d cope. Gethin said: “I like to think of myself as a good driver, but my ability to stay safe was completely compromised when I was distracted by things like tailgating. “I’ve experienced a fair bit of road rage in my time, as most people have.

One of the stumbling blocks with autonomous cars has been their inability to interpret visual cues from pedestrians, making them overly cautious. So when a person begins to cross the street but changes their mind a driverless car might just just stop and wait. But engineers at Perceptive Automata have developed articial intelligence software which enables driverless vehicles to understand the state-of-mind of people, including pedestrians, cyclists and other motorists. With the software installed, autonomous vehicles can anticipate what pedestrians, cyclists and motorists might do next. Automated vehicles need this capability to drive safely, smoothly, and predictably in a human-dominated road environment.  The predictive technology lets self-driving vehicles make rapid judgments about the intentions and awareness of people on the street - giving machines unprecedented human-like intuition. Perceptive Automata’s software comes into its own when a pedestrian begins to cross the street but sees the approaching autonomous car and decides to stop and ‘wave’ it on. In this situation, an autonomous vehicle without the software would stop and wait, even though the pedestrian has no intention to cross. However, the new software will read the pedestrian’s intent and passes this information to the autonomous system’s decision-making module, allowing the car to continue safely on its route.  Perceptive Automata, which is based in Boston, USA, has now been backed by Hyundai CRADLE, the car firm’s technology investment arm. John Suh, vice president of Hyundai CRADLE, said: “One of the biggest hurdles facing autonomous vehicles is the inability to interpret the critical visual cues about human behaviour that human drivers can effortlessly process. “Perceptive Automata is giving the AV industry the tools to deploy autonomous vehicles that understand more like humans, creating a safer and smoother driving experience.”  Perceptive Automata’s core technology takes sensor data from vehicles that show interactions with people. This is used to train deep learning models to interpret human behaviour the way people do. The end result is sophisticated articial intelligence software that can be integrated into autonomous driving systems. With the software installed, autonomous vehicles can anticipate what pedestrians, cyclists and motorists might do next. Hyundai has been one of the leading car manufacturers in the development of autonomous driving technology. Earlier this year, a fleet of Hyundai Nexos self-drove  miles from Seoul to Pyeongchang , reaching speeds of almost mph on a route which included built up areas and open roads.Sid Misran, co-founder and CEO of Perceptive Automata, added: “We are ecstatic to have an investor on board like Hyundai that understands the importance of the problem we are solving for self-driving cars and next-generation driver assistance systems. “Hyundai is one of the biggest automakers in the world and having them back our technology is incredibly validating.” "},{"url":null,"title":"eugenie royal wedding george charlottes","story":"NewsEugenie Royal Wedding: George and Charlottes starring roles revealed - and Robbie Williams daughter is bridesmaidGroom Jack Brooksbank has asked his brother, Thomas Brooksbank, to be his best man, while Eugenies older sister Princess Beatrice will be her maid of honourShareCommentsByZoe ForseyActing Audience Editor:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsThe cute kids have a strict dress code as part of their royal obligations \"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPrinces George and Princess Charlotte have been given starring roles at Princess Eugenies wedding to Jack Brooksbank .

Mum-of-two Lucy Gosling went to Oriental Touch in Torquay, Devon, with family and friends when they discovered that the chicken they were eating from the buffet was pink inside.The -year-old said she felt sick to her stomach when she made the grim discovery, DevonLive reported .As my partner went to tuck into the chicken from the buffet he said at the time that it didnt taste right and when he opened it up, it was pink inside, she said.  I then went up to get a chicken ball for my son and as I was cutting it up for him I was disgusted to find that it was raw and bloody inside. We then cut open all of the chicken we had on our plates only to discover it was all uncooked. I was absolutely horried. Lucy said she and her family often enjoy a meal out at Oriental Touch and have never had any problems before. She added: We have been going there for more than eight years and we have never experienced anything like this before, I still cant believe that something like this has happened. I will never go there ever again. When we realised the chicken wasnt cooked we notied the manager straight away and he then went to check on the rest of the chicken at the buffet and he agreed that the chicken wasnt cooked properly. At first we thought he had removed all of the uncooked chicken so about half an hour later I went back up as they had brought fresh food out and when I cut it open, it was pink again inside. We tried calling the manager over again but he just completely ignored us, so my boyfriend went up to the bar and told them again and they still didnt remove the chicken.  I think the reason I am so angry about it, is because I have young children and there were more than  other people dining in the restaurant at the time and it seemed like the manager didnt care. Lucy described the whole incident as a complete nightmare and vows to never step foot in the restaurant again. She said: The manager admitted that the chicken was uncooked but he didnt seem to care. I am absolutely appalled that there was no customer service at all. Myself, my partner and my friends have all been extremely ill as a result of this and I just dont want them to think they can get away with doing something like this.

They buyer used a mortgage from Credit Suisse Group AG to buy the lavish pad, which is believed to be Britains most expensive ever home. One Hyde Park was designed by Richard Rogers at Rogers, Stirk, Harbour and Partners. It opened in  and is made up of  apartments with the interior designed by Candy and Candy.  Residents get -hour SAS-trained security, an in-house maid service, same day laundry and dry cleaning, room service from the five-star Mandarin hotel and a private temperature controlled wine store. The development also has unmatched leisure and entertainment facilities, which includes swimming pools and saunas, steam rooms, a squash court and cinema. Simon Barnes, an independent property consultant, has been inside One Hyde Park and deals in the super-prime market.  He said: It is an amazing place and is not be like buying a one-bedroom flat. It is a very modern, high quality build, you have the Mandarin next door and the ultimate concierge. The sort of person who will look at it is likely to be the sort of person who spends a lot of time in a hotel. But for pound million you could get quite a few nights in the finest hotel suite. The bar in residential development keeps being raised. What you lack in London are the locations to build on which is why they can charge such a price at One Hyde Park.

Helen Wood, , was devastated when the  had to be added to the pale green satin gown just weeks before her best friends big day.Manchester Evening News reports that the business support officer, who works in the city, had to have the dress altered from a size  to  to ensure it fit her.Previously weighing  stone lb, the mum-of-two from Blackburn, said she stuck out like a sore thumb in every picture. When she saw the photos, Helen vowed never again to be a fat bridesmaid and slimmed down to an incredible size , now weighing just  stone.  It was horrendously embarrassing for me, watching my best friend get married and feeling like the fat bridesmaid, Helen said. “I stood out like a sore thumb in all the pictures, and when I actually saw the images taken I cried and cried.” Despite previously shting eight stone in  thanks to diet and exercise, Helen relapsed after meeting her husband, Matt and having two children. Admitting that she squeezed into size  clothes at her biggest, she recalled: “Matt was working in Manchester when we met, so I would stay over a lot and we’d go out for dinners, have drinks and le became really comfortable. “I’d lost the weight before by cutting out the rubbish and exercising every day, but I gave all that up when I met Matt and we fell in love.” Skipping breakfast, Helen would snack on crisps, before having a cheese and ham sandwich with a chocolate bar for pudding at lunch and a double portioned pasta meal, slathered in creamy tomato sauce for dinner. But her real downfall was her nightly ritual of a family-size bar of chocolate with a cup of tea in bed. Gorging on , calories a day and never exercising, after giving birth to Jack in  she made no effort to sht the “baby weight. Then, after having Emilie in July , Helen soared to a hefty size . But with her best friend, Kelly, , due to marry that October and with a size  dress bought for the occasion, Helen panicked.  “I was so touched when my childhood friend Kelly asked me to be her maid of honour, and with just three months to go until the big day, I was determined to get into the gown, but deep down knew I wouldn’t,” she said. “With a new baby and a toddler, I struggled to find the time to concentrate on my weight so, before I knew it, the wedding was weeks away and I was still fat.” Knowing the dress would never fit, she visited a tailor, asking her to make it bigger by adding  into the sides, so she could wear it. She said: “I looked dferent to everyone  and really stood out. Another bridesmaid was pregnant at the time and I actually looked bigger than she did. “The dress wasn’t the same as everyone ’s because of the alterations and I felt larger than I ever had. “I made Matt delete all the photos he took of me and cried my eyes out.” Vowing to change, it took Helen seven months to summon the courage to contact the weight loss company, Cambridge Weight Plan. “My mum suggested I gave it a go, as they offer one to-one support and create a personalised plan,” she said.  “I couldn’t face going to slimming classes and being with lots of people I didn’t know.” In her first two weeks, Helen lost lb by eating and drinking only the Cambridge Weight Plan products, before slowly incorporating exercise into her regime, too. Now,  months on, she has even become a Cambridge Weight Plan consultant and has never felt better. “I’ve got a split-picture on my phone background - one photo is of me now and one is me at my largest. When I showed my little boy, he didn’t know who the larger woman was,” she smiled.

Maarten Barmentlo of Signia, which commissioned the study, said: “As we get older it is natural for our health to become more fragile, and it’s a lucky few who make it into old age without acquiring something to worry about. “What is important to remember is a problem shared is a problem halved, and sometimes carrying the worries of a health issue can do more harm than good. “ Of the  per cent of those who were keeping an illness secret from loved ones, two thirds were, however, happy to disclose the nature of their illness for research purposes.

A danger to le warning for wind has been extended and new warnings for rain are in place over Friday and Saturday. The weather is likely to be so severe the Met Office has named it Storm Callum to encourage people to take the warnings seriously. The Atlantic storm threatens to disrupt travel for commuters and holidaymakers, cut power, flood roads and put lives at risk due to flying debris and falling trees.  Strong winds with mph gusts are expected to lash Northern Ireland, western parts of Scotland and north-west England all day on Friday. It will be a two-day rain event, with up to mm possible across some places in Wales, western Scotland, northern England and the Yorkshire and Humber regions by midnight Saturday. The storm is due to hit just days after Britain basks in what could be the hottest October day in years on Wednesday. Where will the storm hit  The wind warning is in place from am to .pm on Friday for the following areas: Northern Ireland: All counties. Scotland: Central, Tayside and Fe, Highlands and Eilean Siar, South West and Lothian Borders, Strathclyde.  England: North West England. The Met Office warned: Gusts  to mph are likely in some places, with potential for gusts of  to mph around exposed coasts and hills. High tides are also near their peak, heightening the risk of coastal impacts due to large waves. There is a chance of gusts over mph in the Western Isles during the afternoon and evening. The strongest winds are expected across eastern areas of Northern Ireland during the early morning followed by Scotland from late morning onward. Where will heavy rain fall   There are two separate warnings for rain - one covering Friday and one for Saturday. Fridays warning covers Wales, North West England and Yorkshire and Humber from am to .pm. The Met Office says: A zone of heavy rain associated with an intense weather system affecting western parts of the UK will become slow moving for a time, bringing prolonged rainfall and the potential for surface water flooding. Areas of high ground exposed to the south and south west will be most affected, with the potential for over mm of rain in  hours in the most exposed locations, and over  mm by the end of the day. The rain is expected to be accompanied by strong winds, which when combined with high tides may lead to some coastal impacts due to large waves. In addition, these winds may increase autumnal leaf fall, which would increase the potential for blocked drains and culverts, heightening the flooding risk.  Saturdays rain warning affects the following areas all day long: Wales: Entire country. Scotland: Central, Tayside and Fe, Grampian, Highlands and Eilean Siar, SW and Lothian Borders, Strathclyde. England: North East and North West. The Met Office said: The zone of heavy rain affecting England and Wales on Friday is expected to slowly move northwards on Saturday, with the focus of heaviest rainfall slowly moving away from south Wales but increasingly into parts of Scotland. Areas of high ground exposed to the south and south west will be most affected, with the potential for -mm in  hours, and a chance of over  mm in a few spots by the end of the event.

It will be fairly breezy, but feeling warm in the sunshine. Temperatures will be in the low to mid s in the south. Wednesday night: Some heavy showers are expected in the southwest during the evening, affecting other areas through the night. Otherwise a mainly dry night with some cloud and hill fog.

Confused  Let me explain. The word womxn has been used instead of women by two organisations this week. One is a museum promoting a four-day event and the other a campaign group advertising their charity auction. The word womyn was adopted by feminists in the seventies because the word woman comes from the phrase of man. For some, this implied a womans identity was inherently reliant on man, and so replacing the a with a y was an expression of female independence. But, according to ious forums, including the Urban Dictionary, the word womyn is often associated with the white, cisgender sector of the feminist movement. And so womxn - denoting gender fluidity and inclusivity - began to be used. This week, a feminist organisation sponsored by fashion brand HM sparked outrage after using the term  times in a promotional email.  In an email to supporters and journalists, Her Stories announced its first womxn art auction to support Londons refugee and migrant womxn. The term was immediately slammed as ridiculous by feminists and racist by women of colour. And some shoppers claimed they were boycotting HM for allowing the bizarre term to be used. The word has been called racist because it has been defined as including trans women and women of colour on ious websites, including the Urban Dictionary.  Objectors argue trans women and women of colour do not need a new word as women does not only refer to white, cis women. While clothes retailer HM is Her Stories title sponsor, the organisation is also backed by UK-registered charities Maternity Action, Women for Refugee Women and Ellas Home, which will each receive a cut of the donations raised at the art auction. You have lost me as a customer, one social media user tweeted to HMs official account. Do you really agree with this nonsense  said another.  A museum in Euston, London, has been also been ridiculed after using the word womxn to plug its latest event. The word was used to advertise its four-day Daylighting programme.Describing the event on Twitter , the museum and library tweeted: Typeset women back into history with Daylighting our four-day programme of letter printing presses, zine workshops, discussions on how womxn can challenge existing archives, wikipedia   more.It was met with a backlash from angry Twitter users and even an MP, who hit out at staff for using the offensive word and questioned why the term mxn wasnt used. Sunday Times columnist India Knight tweeted: Womxn! Honestly, f*** off. And the s Suzanne Moore wrote: How do you pronounce womxn  The same way you pronounce bo*****  While the alternate spellings are said by some to achieve female independence from patriarchal linguistic norms, many feel it is a step too far. Jess Phillips, MP for Birmingham Yardley, said on Wednesday: Ive never met a trans woman who was offended by the word woman being used, so Im not sure why this keeps happening. Asinternet dissent now replaces public policy. I get what they are trying to do but why is it only women not men where this applies. Tracy King also tweeted the museum: So your categories are Men miscellaneous other  You should have a serious think about what youre actually trying to communicate here and to whom.  Twitter user Fran argued the word women means something to people. Mxn too  No, thought not, she tweeted. Women is a word. It means something. Refusing to use it really means something to many many women. Another Twitter user added: Nobody outside of a very narrow circle of narcissists and misogynists will even begin to understand what you mean by womxn. The word woman doesnt need to be edited or to apologise for itself. Please compare with your approach to speaking about men and amend.  The Wellcome Collection defended its decision to use the word before removing it, saying it was agreed during conversations with collaborators. Weve had some questions about why were using the word womxn for this event, it tweeted on Tuesday. Were using it because we feel that it is important to create a space venue that includes erse perspectives. It was agreed during our conversations with collaborators as the programme developed. It later added: We invite challenges to our thinking and we listen to our audience, so were removing the word from the website and from our communications about the event. The Wellcome Museum is a museum and library which displays an unusual mixture of medical artacts and original artworks exploring ideas about the connections between medicine, le and art.

Weather expects expect more than  million power outages will hit homes and rainfall will cause flooding in several states including as far north as the Carolinas. The outskirts of the storm are already being felt on the coast of Florida.  What are the effects of Hurricane Michael  Among the concerns: Flash-flooding with heavy rain le-threatening storm surges up to  feet high and devastating winds, not just in the Panhandle, but southern Alabama and Georgia, reports CNN. Up to a footof rainfall was forecast for some areas. The storms center had maximum sustained winds of mph Wednesday morning. CNN meteorologist Chad Myers saidthe eyewall hits the coast with winds of that speed, it would deliver damage like a strong tornado. But instead of lasting  seconds, it lasts for one hour, Myers said.  There will be hundreds of thousands,not millions, without power for a very long time. The region should brace for major infrastructure damage, specically to electricity distribution, wastewater treatment systems and transportation networks, Jeff Byard, associate administrator for FEMA, told reporters on a conference call. Michaels menace was compounded by its relatively quick development, growing from a tropical storm to Category  hurricane in about  hours.  When will Hurricane Michael hit  The storm will hit Florida at roughly pm local time. Locals have been warned that it is now too late to evacuate.Florida Governor Rick Scott wrote on Twitter : The time for evacuating along the coast has come and gone.He has also activated hundreds of Florida National Guard members and waived tolls to encourage those near the coast to evacuate inland.  Where will Hurricane Michael hit  The coastal Panama City is directly in the predicted path of the hurricane and is expected to be worst hit. Tallahassee is also in danger along with Albany as the system heads inland and up the east coast of the United States. After hitting land, the storm is expected to diminish in strength while moving up the East Coast, where it will hit North and South Carolina, which are still recovering from Hurricane Florence last month. More than . million residents of at least  Florida counties were under mandatory or voluntary evacuation orders.  Hurricane Michael is forecast to be the most destructive hurricane to hit the Florida Panhandle in a century, Governor Scott told reporters, speaking about seven hours before Michael was expected to make landfall. President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency for the entire state of Florida, freeing up federal assistance to supplement state and local disaster responses. Apalachicola Mayor Van Johnson said the city, which could suffer some of the worst of the storm surge, was under mandatory evacuation orders.

Ruad Island off the coast of Syira in the Mediterranean was once protected on all sides by an incredible megalith wall but very little of it is still in tact. Its not knownthe wall was built out of fear of the sea or foreign invaders but scholars largely agree it was the product of Roman architecture.  However, an investigation by the YouTube channel Mystery History questions this narrative and suggests the walls are substantially older, with the society that built them wiped out by a catastrophic flood, perhaps proving the historical accuracy of Genesis Noahs Ark story.

The footage was uploaded in September and has seen , views on YouTube and hundreds of comments.

The North Korean leader travelled in style to a meeting with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

Experts believe the Rolls-Royce Phantom, complete with the car makers distinctive R insignia on the wheel hubs, was a bullet-proof model. To transform it into a fortress is believed to cost around pound,. The bodywork can fend off . mm bullets from automatic weapons. In the past, Kim has always favoured Pullman Guard Mercedes limousines, based on the S.  The Drive magazine said: Despite extreme sanctions..and a rickety economy...Kim was able to get his hands on the most luxurious of luxury cars.” US news outlet CNN claimed the purchase was almost certainly a violation of United Nations sanctions against North Korea. They prohibit the sale of luxury goods and automobiles to the North Korean government, the station added. The Trump administration has insisted that the international community must strictly enforce the UN sanctions levied against North Korea until Pyongyang denuclearises.  Food supplies remain low in North Korea, where nearly  percent of the population is still suffering from malnutrition. This week, the UN World Food Programme said m North Koreans are undernourished and need humanitarian aid. But the WFP, which provides fortied cereals and enriched biscuits to , women and children in North Korea each month, may have to cut aid due to a lack of funding. Some donors and companies have been reluctant to get involved in aid for North Korea, although humanitarian work is excluded from sanctions imposed by the UN Security Council.

Fears fuel leaking from the Russian passenger jet could explode led to an emergency evacuation of all  people on board. Passengers and crew members used four emergency slides to escape the Sukhoi Superjet- belonging to Yakutia Airlines. The plane, which had taken off from the eastern Siberian city of Ulan-Ude, overshot the main runaway at Yakutsk - skidding out of control on ice as the pilot tried to stop the plane. As it finally stopped, the landing gear under the wings collapsed. The rear of the plane lurched back leaving the nose in the air.  Despite fuel leaks there was no fire as emergency crews sprayed the stricken Russian-made aircraft. Wet snow had frozen on the runway causing the treacherous conditions, officials said. The icy runway was not ready for landing, a source from the rescue service told YakutiaMedia news website. “The runway was probably covered with ice, that’s why the plane skidded off the runway during landing, said an aviation source. As a result, the landing gear was damaged.  The temperature in Yakutsk at the time was only slightly below freezing. According to the Siberian Times, the jet is believed to be beyond repair. The airport was closed in the wake of the accident with  flights delayed and three sent to an emergency airport in the village of Chulman.

I have a little lightbox with ‘Ask Alec’ on it,” he adds, “sosomeone has a question – and it can be anything from how to pay a cheque in at the Post Office to how to set up internet banking – I can help.”Alec is one of nearly  community bankers appointed by the bank to help bring it even closer to the people it serves.Along with  mobile branches which travel between towns and villages, internet banking, the bank’s market leading app and, of course, its high street branches, the community bankers are a key component in ensuring customers have a wide range of options covering how and where they do their banking.And with many transactions now carried out online, Alec and his fellow community bankers are bringing a particularly personal touch, helping to steer customers – and even non-Royal Bank customers – through the modern banking landscape at one-to-one sessions in locations that are close to home for most people.As the community banker for Perth, Alec’s ‘beat’ covers some of Scotland’s most picturesque towns and villages. “I’m lucky, it is an absolutely stunning part of the country – and I get to travel around it,” says Alec.“Although I have a set pattern of places to be throughout the week, every day is dferent. And there’s such a erse range of customers they might be looking for a financial health check, or want to know how to deal with scams and online security. vw, px\"  “It’s good to meet them face-to-face, particularly those who might not be able to travel to a branch, or might not be confident when it comes to ringing the bank’s customer service line or using other options such as the Post Office – where all Royal Bank customers can go for banking transactions.”Community bankers can be found across the country – including some of Scotland’s larger towns and cities – often in public spots like coffee shops, local post offices, community centres and libraries. All have timetables and location maps which can be accessed online.As well as offering support and advice to customers, they can arrange a meeting with a specialist advisor, or provide a financial ‘health check’ to ensure customers are getting the most from their money.In many cases, they can provide a little extra help for customers who need a guiding hand through the new banking landscape or have worries over internet security.Although they are in public places, the community bankers ensure that conversations are discreet and private, enabling them to cover a wide range of issues.“I get a lot of enjoyment out of helping vulnerable customers who may be housebound or not as active,” says Alec. “I can help get them set up with dferent ways of doing their banking which means they can retain control of their own finances and, in turn, remain independent.“They can do their banking from their armchair and that’s something that brings a lot of comfort and peace of mind.”Being available to customers is key, adds Alec, who encourages his customers to call his mobile or drop him an emailthey can’t manage to his drop-in sessions. vw, px\"  “While online banking means so much can be done from home, people still want that personal touch when it comes to banking,” he adds.“I aim to reach as many customers as possible, whether by being out with the mobile banking vans, in the branches or on the ‘streets’ at drop-in clinics.”His role, he adds, is all part of a growing service which is designed to ensure Royal Bank customers have their banking needs covered – wherever they are.“When you go through all the options that are available to customers – mobile, online, telephone, Post Office, mobile branches and community bankers – you can find a suitable scenario for just about every customers’ needs,” he adds.Community bankers are just one of the many options available to Royal Bank of Scotland customers.

Goals give them that added confidence and there is also that perception that strikers, and rightly so, should be more responsible for scoring.“I loved how Sam took the ball in, linked the play and he was between the posts at the right time.“His two goals were good finishes.“Those goals should do Sam no harm.”Prior to his double against St Mirren, Cosgrove’s only other senior competitive goal came in a - League Two defeat of Crewe for Carlisle in January this year.He netted in a - friendly draw with Championship West Brom at Pittodrie in July.When McInnes signed Cosgrove in the winter transfer window he admitted the striker was one for this season.However, he pitched him in for a debut against Celtic less than a month later. It was a nightmare first Reds appearances as Cosgrove was red carded after just eight minutes of the - loss for a challenge on Hoops skipper Scott Brown.However, McInnes was always confident the striker would come good and is adamant he had already proven his worth before scoring the brace against the Buddies.McInnes said: “In the games that Sam has started we have not lost in  minutes so he has been effective for us. Sam can bring us that bit of size and he should be very pleased with his two goals.”The dismissal of a sorry St Mirren side also marked debut Aberdeen goals for Pittodrie Youth Graduate Connor McLennan and on loan Derby County left-back Max Lowe.McLennan was given the nod for his first Dons start just hours before kick-off, the day after celebrating his th birthday.Unfortunately the teen was taken off in the second half having suffered a dislocated shoulder. It is hoped McLennan will be fit to be considered for selection for the Premiership game against Hearts at Tynecastle following the international break.McInnes said: “When you play St Mirren you have to have ball carriers in the side.“In our own half of the pitch Connor was asked to cover his width but in the final third come into those goalscoring areas.“Connor did that brilliantly.

So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

It means the state-of-the-art school is well on track for opening its doors to pupils and staff in October . Built in the grounds of the existing academy, the new school is keenly anticipated as it’s set to not only transform learning and teaching, but will also signicantly enhance facilities for the local community. The new building will have space for up to  young people, with modern classrooms, massive games hall, two all-weather pitches, games courts and a host of other exciting facilities which are sure to impress pupils, staff and the wider public. Kier Construction is building the school, which is being delivered by South Ayrshire Council in partnership with hub South West. The project is part of a poundmillion programme of works delivered across South Ayrshire with the aim of boosting education standards through targeted investment in schools and communities. Councillor Peter Henderson, the council’s resources and performance portfolio holder, said: “Our new, extended and refurbished schools are completely transforming learning across South Ayrshire and the new Queen Margaret Academy is shaping up to do more of the same. We’re committed to creating modern learning environments that not only inspire children and young people, but provide an important hub and network for the local community. “We want those attending our schools to achieve their full potential when they move on from school and our focus on providing the best education possible, with the best facilities, means we are on our way to achieving this ambition. “Our schools always play a key role in local le so we’re ensuring that their excellent sports facilities can be accessed by the wider public. We also ensure there are areas of our schools that can be used by community groups and the new Queen Margaret Academy will be no dferent.” Michael McBrearty, chief executive of delivery partner, hub South West Scotland, said: “The new school will be a fantastic contemporary and innovative learning environment that will create an abundance of opportunities and benefits to the entire community.” Brian McQuade, managing director of Kier Construction Scotland  north-east England, said: “Up to  people have been on site during peak periods of activity and to date we have created one apprenticeship, seven work placements and three student summer intern placements. This has provided young local talent the opportunity to gain valuable experience working on a state-of-the-art building and a unique insight into the built environment and the erse range of roles available.” Oonagh Browne headteacher at Queen Margaret Academy said: “It’s exciting to see our new school taking shape. Parents, young people and staff were crucial in planning the facilities for our new school, so it’s very much their project and this only increases their anticipation”. The Bishop of Galloway, Right Reverend William Nolan said: “While the ground works were taking place little seemed to be happening on site but in recent months the structure of the building has sprung up, giving a sense of excitement and anticipation as we look forward to the completion next year of a centre of learning that will inspire our young people.” When the new school opens, the old building will be demolished and the site fully landscaped.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilEducationSchoolsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"60k christmas lights up grabs","story":"Alexandra McCready switches on the lights with the help of the cast of the Ayr Gaiety pantomime Cinderella.\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA pound, Christmas lights fund is up for grabs in villages and towns needing an illumination boost. But where the cash goes will be decided by South Ayrshire council officials depending on the needs of dferent areas. The move was approved at the full council meeting last week after a heated clash between rival councillors. Councillor Hugh Hunter put forward a motion for pound, cash to be distributed with a maximum of pound going to each town and pound for villages. He said communities faced a major challenge to raise money for lights. He said the council’s “huge” underspend should be used to pay for the festive displays. But his seasonal gesture was snubbed by ruling councillors who backed an amendment from Councillor Alec Clark to make pound, available instead. Independent Councillor Clark said: “We will try and bring some joy into people’s lives.” His amendment said: “With this fund it is important that the funding does not supplant or compete with the work that has been taking place over a number of years.” Conservative Councillor Hunter questioned how communities were supposed to apply for the cash but was told there wouldn’t be an application process. Labour Councillor Brian McGinley said: “There has been an issue with Christmas lights over a number of years.” He added: “We don’t want to undo the good work already going on in the community.” Responding to probes from the conservative opposition, he said: “We will talk to people about the current arrangements and do what we can.” Councillor Hunter said: “I can’t support the amendment. I ask councillors to support the clear motion.” Speaking after the meeting, Councillor Hunter said: “It wasn’t clear how communities could access it. It is really foggy and disappointing that we couldn’t get to the bottom of it.” Councillor Bob Pollock said he is concerned “some areas may miss out.” He said there was “no coherent explanation” on how the money would be “decided or managed” with only six weeks left until switch on. In a press release Councillor McGinley said: “We obviously have a finite amount of resources, so we know that we won’t be able to do everything that communities want right away, but it’s a terric starting point that will support people and places right across South Ayrshire at this special time of year.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnLabour PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilChristmasAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayrshire student launches campaign against","story":"NewsAyrshire student launches campaign against spikingCara’s drive to keep young women safer when they’re out on the town.ShareByPippa Smith:,  OCT NewsCara Taven has launched a Facebook page named Girls Against Spiking. \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA campaign has been set up to raise awareness of people having their drinks spiked.

Cara, , told the Post about her campaign. She said: “I have heard a lot about people getting spiked recently, in my local area and in the Glasgow region, and I know that a lot of people in Ayr do go out in Glasgow. “It tends to be younger girls about my age that get affected by spiking and that was something I have really started to think about. “This is something that could happen to anyone. “I’m a law student and the reason why I wanted to study law was to represent people who maybe don’t have the confidence to represent themselves and to make a dference that way and I think that is where getting the idea to make the page has come from. “I honestly thought it would be a page where the girls at my work could like – I am surprised by the response. “I remember saying to someone at work ‘If you like the page it’ll take me to  likes’ – then when I woke up in the morning and it was . “I haven’t been affected by spiking – it’s not really about me or anyone that I know. It is about the community of girls my age. “ I just felt like the answer was there and no one has done anything about it until now.” The Post reported how Cleo Smillie, , from Ayr, was on a night out in Madrid with her friend, Marc Davies, when she blacked out after one sip of her pink gin and lemonade. It was later learned that she had a high level of GHB in her blood – the date-rape drug. Strathclyde Union is among the nightclubs and bars that were prompted by the campaign and have gone on to order  lids on a trial basis as they work on ways to keep students as safe as possible on nights out.

Arnold Clark took the decision to shut the twin showrooms and workshops in the town’s Lochside. The big transporters moved in to clear the stock and the famous yellow signage was quickly taken down. The old premises in Galloway Avenue sold cars for generations and was probably best known as the home of Robert McCall Fiat and Alfa Romeo. But being stuck in the middle of housing, the old showroom has now outlived its time.. Arnold bought the dealership from Robert McCall and latterly operated a Fiat franchise. It also had the Jeep franchise for Ayr before it moved to Border Cars. The McCall family ran it for decades and built a reputation for fine service. Bob McCall began selling cars in  and had a series of franchises including Jaguar. His son Robert then took over the running of the business and was very successful selling Fiats and Alfas. Robert’s cousin Peter McCall was actually born in the house on the site that was converted into part of the garage. Customers in Galloway Avenue have been told all servicing work is going to the Ford workshop in Prestwick Road. Arnold Clark also runs separate Toyota, Vauxhall and Peugeot franchises in the town as well as a car and van hire centre. A long-time customer in Galloway Avenue said: “It is a real shame, but I guess dealerships want to be on busy roads in more modern buildings. Sadly Galloway Avenue would have needed a lot of investment and a member of staff said it simply was not in the right location any more. “Staff think the site could be flattened or put to another vehicle use.” Arnold Clark was unavailable for comment as we reached our deadline.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsMotoring NewsAlfa RomeoFiatJaguarJeepPeugeotFishingPrestwickGalloway"},{"url":null,"title":"gymnastics club tries takeover council","story":"NewsGymnastics club tries to takeover council activity centre in TroonMuirhead Activity Centre is the target of Dundonald Gymnastics ClubShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA plan by a gymnastics club to take over Muirhead Activity Centre has met hostility. Secret talks have been taking place since the summer but have only just surfaced. Dundonald Gymnastics Club is ready to take control and turn the popular sports hall into a specialist centre. It would mean no more sports lets of the main hall for football, badminton and handball, the squash court would shut and the property would be shted from South Ayrshire Council ownership. Muirhead Residents and Tenants Association fired the first warning shot over the takeover. Chairman Frances Carson said: “The answer is no. If the council have pulled a fly one over this then they will never hear the end of it from this community.” Scott Telford, head coach of the gymnastics club, promised this week he will speak to the community about his ambitious plans. But Tory councillor Peter Convery slammed the secrecy, saying: “This came out of the blue to all the councillors and community and is an utter disgrace. “People at a meeting on Friday night were flabbergasted the hall could be taken out of council ownership. “The acid on the cake is the council has been speaking to the group without anyone knowing. “The council should not be treating its citizens this way.” Scott Telford said he has a full business plan for the centre and believes it can work. The club has  members and a waiting list of  more. He said the club have restricted facilities at their present base Dundonald Activity Centre, where five adults spend hours setting out and dismantling equipment. As a result they cannot develop youngsters to elite performance level and lose talented performers at an early age. Former top gymnast Scott, who lives in Muirhead, said: “The community will still get use of the centre for things like meetings and birthday parties and we would look to develop that. “There will also be the chance for the community to take part in gymnastics. “I appreciate people don’t like change but we can make this work. We could even look at parkour gymnastic sessions with teenagers on Friday night. “There is also a lot of outdoor space which we could change for other activities, depending on what the community want.” The dad first started helping at Dundonald when there were only  kids and ten mats. He added: “At the moment we get about  inquiries a week and just cannot cope. “I want to work with the Muirhead Residents and Tenants Association and want to hear all views. “We will be running a seven-day-a-week facility but it has to be financially sustainable and work with the community.” Councillor Craig Mackay said he wants full transparency when consultation starts. He said: “The onus will be on the gymnastics club to demonstrate the wider support of the community. “I am relaxed about the process and will very much wish to take on board the community’s views on this once we know the details of what is proposed. “I am concerned about how any potential transfer would impact on the use of the centre by the wide range of groups who currently use it. “The centre currently runs at a small but manageable loss and in my view any decision must be made on what is best for the community and not on the very minimal cost savings.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsGymnasticsSouth Ayrshire CouncilBadmintonTroonDundonald"},{"url":null,"title":"shops replace homes new ayr","story":"NewsShops to replace homes in new Ayr town centre regeneration plansPeople to have their say on radical proposalsShareBySarah Hilley:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailShops are to be replaced with homes in Ayr town centreradical new plans get the go-ahead. Proposals also include the High Street being coated with a new easy clean surface and bins being kept out of site. A great shop clearance has been proposed to regenerate the ailing shopping strip. South Ayrshire Council wants empty retail units to become homes at the bottom of the town. Council leader Douglas Campbell said: “Internet shopping has signicantly altered the landscape in the town. “We need people back staying in the towns.” SNP Councillor Campbell took to his feet at week’s full council meeting to talk through the complete overhaul of the town centre. Conservative Councillor Ian Davis askedshop owners would be consultedthey are forced to move. He said: “This could mean some businesses will have to move. I want reassurances for businesses thatan area is to be reused for a dferent purpose that they are well consulted.” The meeting heard businesses would be consulted. The cleared Riverside block, which included Woolworths, would become a public square. The original proposal for a huge office block has been shelved. Commenting on the cleared site, Councillor Campbell said: “None of us expected the vista.” But he conceded how homes of some description could be erected on the site. He said: “Some sort of building on the site will be necessary.” A report submitted to council said: “There will also be the potential for a small number of residential units on the Riverside sitethis proves desirable through the public consultation exercise.” Council staff from soon-to-be demolished Burns House are likely to move into the Clydesdale Bank Building, the Town Hall and County Buildings instead. The Citadel is to be replaced with a brand new state-of-the art leisure centre on the High Street. A new streetscape surface could also be on the way. Councillor Campbell said: “If we are going to revamp the High Street we need to do it in a signicant way to keep it tidy. “During the main shopping times all the bins should be off the street. We need to present the High Street well. “We need to move the bus stops away from the Clydesdale Bank building.” Conservative opposition councillor Hugh Hunter got to his feet to “welcome” the report. He said: “It would be spectacular for the administrationthey could pull it off.” He called for a park like Belleisle to be built at the Riverside. SNP councillor Siobhian Brown said she welcomed the report but said morale of the community was “on its knees.” All plans will be issued for public consultation.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnClydesdale BankScottish National PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"slow progress new troon mega","story":"NewsSlow progress for new Troon mega surgeryBut work on Templehill expansion should start next yearShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailNational Health top brass have been summoned to Troon to explain what is happening to expansion plans at the town’s mega surgery. Members of the public spoke at last week’s Troon Community Council –asking why there has been no obvious progress at the Templehill Surgery in nearly six month. The surgery swallowed most of the collapsed  Medical Practice, re-opening with , patients at the end of April. The Community Council has asked an NHS representative to attend their meeting next month. When Templehill took over they were to be handed around pound, by NHS Ayrshire  Arran for an extension. And partner Robbie Cumming said then it was still to be agreed wether to use a ready-made modular building or a traditional build at the back. At the time he said: “We intend to expand and develop our current premises with the addition of two or three consulting rooms, disabled access doors and a larger reception area.” A planning application has been lodged but it has not even been “validated” yet by South Ayrshire Council. Councillor Craig Mckay has quizzed Pamela Milliken, head of primary care, on the extension which had been a central plank of the transfer. Councillor Mckay said: “I welcome the Health Board’s comments which suggest that there have been no major issues following the transfers. “This is consistent with my own experience as I’ve received no recent complaints from patients. “It is also reassuring that both recipient practices have been reviewing patient records and inviting patients to attend for review appointments. “I hope this will ensure that those who were moved will continue to receive the level of care they deserve. “On the extension to the Templehill surgery, the planning application has recently been submitted but not yet validated. ““Clearly it is in the interests of all patients of that practice that the required expansion takes place, and I note that subject to there being no planning issues, work is expected to begin on site in the new year. “The extension was central to the arguments made when  Medical Practice closed, and the ball is now firmly in the Surgery’s court to deliver on this commitment.” Councillor Bob Pollock agreed the actual transition process seemed to have gone well and said: “None of the Troon Councillors have received any complaints following the merger of the surgeries, butthere are any, they should get in touch.” Ms Milliken said: “Planning permission for the work was submitted to South Ayrshire Council on Friday September . The practice is optimistic that works will commence in early Januaryplanning permission is granted.” In other NHS news, it is understood community midwives have had to change their base from the Barassie Street clinic to Prestwick. One source said: “All that is left at Barassie Street seems to be podiatry. “The community nurses have to start their sht in Prestwick before coming to Troon for their first appointment.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnTroonNHS ScotlandAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"borders-cab-calls-for-your-food-for-thought","story":"PEEBLES Citizens Advice Bureau wants locals to raise any concerns they have relating to food in Tweeddale.Bosses have created a survey to gauge public opinion on cost, choice, access and quality in the region.

in both the concrete sections and steel reinforcements beneath the surface was much greater than initially anticipated.Amey announced that full night-time closures would be required to finish the deck repairs, waterproofing and resurfacing by the scheduled October .But with just over a week until the planned completion date they have extended the timescales through to November.And bosses have also announced that engineers willto complete the extensive repairs in February.Ameys bridges manager Stuart Wallace said: ldquoThese refurbishment works were originally intended to prevent the further deterioration of the bridge structure by repairing defects at an early stage.\"This work has subsequently uncovered several previously hidden defects that far exceeded expectations and this is the reason for the increase to the construction programme.Since the introduction of a one-way system for west-bound traffic across the bridge with east-bound vehicles having to use the winding B near Abbotsford, there have been many reports of drivers ignoring temporary road signs.And many other drivers are using Melrose Road and Lowood Bridge, which causes tailbacks at rush hour.Rather than

and heard directly about their concerns.I have also contacted Argyll and Bute Council#s planning department numerous times, and, on September , I spoke with James Macintyre of Macleod Construction and made my views very clear on this matter.The potential new G pitch and footpath are much needed and more than welcome.That said there have clearly been large failings in the consultation process and this must not happen in future.In order to find the best way forward MacLeods will need to move rugby posts to new positions, using new sleeves and with an Islay Rugby presence during the operation.Leveling off of the west side of the pitch must be carried out using good soil with a view to extending the level pitch by several meters.Material for a ryelock fence should be provided by MacLeods and or others, and permissions given for construction of a standard fence.This fence should run between the timber fence at the rear of the housing estate and the timber fence at the car park, in a line running along the pitch side edge of the new path across the rugby pitch.This should make the extended area as near dog-free as possible and solve the serious fouling problem which unfortunately continues to exist.Regardless of how many of my fellow Ileachs feel, about where this pathway has been built and the lack of proper communication, the hard working front line workers, of Macleods are only following orders and any hostility directed towards them is unhelpful and unfair.If these changes and additions to the building works are made all parties will be happy and Islay will have a terric rugby pitch.Bowmore locals will have a new foot path and Islay can hopefully look forward to the prospect of a wonderful new G pitch in the future.Despite the upset caused by this

It was a lovely calm and sunny day, perfect for filming,I was halfway through the story when a group of local teenage lads approached. It seemed they were drinking and I anticipated them disrupting the filming.But I continued telling the story as it had been a perfect take up until that moment.The lads paused for a moment then all sat on the concrete walkway watching me and the film makers. They said nothing and seemed to be listening.I was able to complete my story uninterrupted.And as I walked away in the final shot I made eye contact with the lads and they respectfully waited until the filming had stopped before shouting, ldquoJohnny Moat forever! Then they got up and walked away.It was an unexpected and powerful moment for me.My assumptions about the lads had been utterly challenged as well.This was more than six years ago but I was reminded of it when I visited Johnny Moat this week with my wee boy Lewis.We were having our weekly storytelling walk in the Pans, a three-hour period between his nursery pick up and when I have to pick up his sister Skye from the Infant School.We just walk together visiting dferent places, and I tell him stories and he does the same.Most of his stories this day involved a T Rex or Raptor, which in his imagination wander about Prestonpans.So our respective tales were a bit dferent in content and style, but what is vital at this age is that he hears stories and is allowed to tell them freely.I told him the story of Johnny Moat and he said it looks like a whale.As we wandered from Johnny Moat up to Preston Tower, we stopped at what we call the lsquoStory Stonesrsquo.Here a small circle of stones sit underneath a cherry tree, with the tower looming behind. It is a perfect place to tell stories.Lewis gave me a new version of his T Rex tale here. I couldnrsquot understand all his story, but I got most of it.Then he said it was my turn so I told him a child-friendly version of the tale of the Green Lady. It made him want to go and look in the windows of the tower, which we did.The final story began at the old doorsquocot in the gardens by the tower. I explained it was a house for pigeons, but Lewis was having none of that.ldquoNo daddy, he said with a serious face, ldquoa lion lives there.ldquoReally  Can you tell me the story of the lion  I asked. And so he obliged.It was a great story, and we tracked the lion to the ancient Mercat Cross, where the unicorn sits on top of the pole ldquolooking for the lion.Then he spotted the lion on the  bus coming from Tranent.ldquoWill it eat the people  I asked.ldquoNo, he said asIrsquod asked an inappropriate question, ldquoitrsquos a nice lion.And so with the lion having left town, we headed for the Infant School to pick up his sister, but still keeping a look out for the T Rex.On the surface this may all seem a bit unusual, wandering about telling random stories that often didnrsquot make huge sense.But I value this time with my son, and as a storyteller I know the importance of it.Storytelling in this way when our kids are young helps develop what is called oral narrative ability, which gives a child the skills to explain and describe things, and develop their understanding of words and language.It fires their imagination and research shows that this can help with the enjoyment of reading and writing later on, and of telling and hearing stories.That night my son unexpectedly ed to the story of Johnny Moat.I had earlier told him it had fallen down and is lying face down in the sand and itrsquos too heavy to put back, but hopefully one day there will be a way.Like all kids his age, he took a while to process his thoughts on this. And these thoughts came out at bedtime.ldquoThe T Rex can put the big stone back, he said. I admired his total faith in the abilities of the T Rex.ldquoYes, maybe, I said. He fell asleep holding his T Rex which, for him, symbolises so much more than just an extinct dinosaur.As I headed downstairs, I thought about the connection between this day and the day over six years ago when I unexpectedly told the story of Johnny Moat to some teenage lads.Stories weave through us and bind us in a shared identity. But it made me sad that Johnny Moat still lies forgotten with his face in the sand.So Irsquom going to start looking for the T Rex of the Pans, whoever that may be, who can help. He or she must be out there somewhere. Or perhaps there is a crowd of them.The hope is that once my son is a teenage lad himself, he will be able to sit on the Girdle Rocks with Johnny Moat and tell the legend."},{"url":null,"title":"group-objects-to-750-new-homes-at-windygoul-south","story":"A planning application for the site was submitted last month by Walker Group Ltd.The site plan extends Windygoul South to the Charles River Research Institute and Carlaverock Farm.But at a TECC meeting, members voiced their concerns over the proposals.Robert McNeill, community councillor, told the meeting: ldquoIn all my years on the community council, I canrsquot recall us making a formal objection about any developments in Tranent.ldquoWe try to be very proactive to any problems and find a solution.

Enough is enough.

On top of that, most of the additional cases in Scotland are equal pay and we are right down the middle of that - rooting out discrimination.\"The rise in equal pay cases is particularly appropriate since it was equal pay in Dumfries  Galloway that the Supreme Court used as an example of how free access to justice for one worker seeking pay equality brings benefit for many thousands.\"The judges were right in their analysis back in  and this data shows how big landmark cases reverberate in workplaces across the entire country.\"When the fees were introduced in July , The Herald reported a drop in cases of almost  per cent year on year.This prompted claims from employment experts that thousands of workers, especially women, who had been unfairly sacked or discriminated against, were being denied access to justice.The current figures from the UK Government show a complete turnaround, with equal pay cases - including a large scale claim against Glasgow City Council - accounting for the bulk of the cases with an increase of  per cent.Unfair dismissal claims also increased by  per cent over the period, while sex discrimination claims went up by almost  per cent and disability discrimination claims almost doubled.Brian McLaughlin, an employment lawyer with Unionline Scotland, which represents members of the GMB and Communications Workers Union, said: \"This is a signicant increase which is obviously welcomed by Unionline Scotland and the GMB and CWU trade unions.\"These fees were a barrier to justice which created a signicant problem for unfairly treated employees for the best part of four years.\"This upsurge in cases shows that the fees were a clear denial of access to justice.\"Jim Stephenson, convener of the Law Society of Scotlandrsquos Access to Justice committee, added that the increase showed \"a very real need for an accessible, impartial system to resolve workplace disputes\".While David Martyn, an employment specialist with Thompsons solicitors, claimed that the fees proved to be a \"massive disincentive\" for workers.\"For someone who was only claiming say pound, and having to pay out pound in upfront fees, the risk to reward ratio really didnt make any economic sense,\" he said.He also claimed that the scrapping of the fees has had a \"signicant impact\" on the employment tribunal service in Scotland, which he described as \"stretched\".A total of  new judges have been appointed in Scotland to meet the increased demand for hearings, while several tribunal rooms at the main hearing centre in Glasgow, which were converted into office space while the fee regime was in place, have had to be reinstated.Mr Martyn said: \"The tribunal service is struggling to cope, it was almost inevitable when the fees were stopped. The staff are doing their very best but theyre certainly stretched.\"These concerns were echoed by employment specialist Stephen Miller, of Clyde  Co, who claimed the tribunal service \"has been overwhelmed by the numbers\".He added that the increase in claims would also result in businesses and organisations facing signicant costs in defending the actions."},{"url":null,"title":"scots-councils-invest-20m-to-modernise-library-service","story":"The Scottish Library and Information Councilsaid the investment showed the strong commitment of councils to public library services.Earlier this month, figures showed a dramatic increase in the number of libraries being shut - with  closed in the past two years alone.However, the latest figures show council investment has led to the building or refurbishment of  libraries since March last year.Additional funding has also been provided to modernise library services with the introduction of free public wi, D printing resources and a film education programme.Fiona Hyslop, Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs, welcomed the investment - announced in Libraries Week.She said: ldquoThis week celebrates the vital role of our libraries in Scotland and the fantastic service provided by staff and volunteers.ldquoI welcome this yearrsquos focus on wellbeing, which fits in well with the Scottish Governmentrsquos commitment to promoting social wellbeing and tackling social isolation and inequality through increased access to library services.ldquoSince , we have invested more than pound million to help re-invigorate the role of public libraries, providing funds to support local and national activity.ldquoI encourage local communities throughout Scotland to continue to use and benefit from the wide range of services that our local libraries provide.Pamela Tulloch, chief executive of SLIC, said a national libraries strategy had provided a framework for the ldquotransformation of services in the st century.She said: ldquoIn some areas, this has led to some venue closures to make way for a more relevant and flexible model of delivery.ldquoHowever, local government has continued to invest in the estate, demonstrated by the signicant capital spend.ldquoPublic libraries have faced a challenging time in recent years amidst public spending cuts.ldquoHowever, they have shown tremendous resilience and are adapting services to meet the needs of modern users.The latest figures show there is still a strong commitment to public libraries from the public with premise and virtual visits increasing from .m to over m since .Earlier this month, there was concern that the service was under threat with figures showing  libraries have been closed in the past two years.Figures form SLIC showed said  libraries closed last year, up from  the previous year.Closures have remained in single figures for most of the previous decade.There are fears libraries are seen as a ldquosoft touch for councils looking to make cuts in a climate of falling budgets.The former Scots-based Gruffalo author Julia Donaldson hit out at the scale of the closures, saying libraries served a vital role as community centres.A spokesman for the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals in Scotland said: ldquoWe recognise that recent years have seen huge local authority budgetary cuts.ldquoThe fact the number of people using libraries has increased in the same period highlights their popularity, the changing ways people access services and the vital contribution they make to community cohesion, social and economic wellbeing, digital skills, literacy and more.ldquoWe urge local authorities to think very carefully and consult residents fully before closing any libraries."},{"url":null,"title":"neil-mackay-let-us-stand-together-against-the-scourge-of-toxic-masculinity","story":"Thatrsquos not to say no woman has ever committed a violent or sexual offence ndash an infinitesimally small proportion of women have ndash but to compare such offences by women to offences by men, is to weigh a gnat against a mammoth.Irsquom not even going to rehearse the lsquonot all menrsquo argument ndash that lsquonot all menrsquo are abusive or predatory.

One mother told of police humiliating her teenage daughter during an interview after she was the victim of an offence ndash in the end there was no prosecution either.The dreadful truth, though, is that none of this is new. It wasnrsquot new last year when a predatory president walked into the Oval Office with a string of sexual assault claims hanging around his neck, and it wasnrsquot new millennia ago either. Women are the historic victims of men.Sure, there is change in the air across the world ndash womenrsquos marches, the rise of MeToo, the shaming of corporations over pay inequality ndash but dear God, this is . Humanity has had its time on earth for , years ndash scientists are contemplating a mission to Mars ndash but still one sex rides roughshod over the other. As long as women fear walking alone at night and men donrsquot, we are a failure as a species.There is change afoot at home as well. I was heartened to hear our Justice Secretary, Humza Yousaf, say that the Government is considering making misogyny a hate crime. Well done. About time. A clear message needs to be sent to men thatyou offend against a woman, simply because shersquos a woman, then the justice system will come down on you like a ton of bricks. Only yesterday this paperrsquos front page revealed that one in three schoolgirls has been sexually harassed by a man in public ndash with children as young as eight being victims. Herersquos a suggestion: start putting these men, who are little better than paedophiles, in cuffs and chuck them in prison. Ruin a few of their lives for a change."},{"url":null,"title":"sturgeons-message-of-hope-bids-to-heal-rift-on-indyref2","story":"The First Minister will tell the SNP conference in Glasgow it is up to the party to offer hope in the midst of the unfolding calamity engulfing Westminster.Under pressure from the Yes movement to accelerate the push for independence, she said she might use her mandate to demand a new vote before the  Holyrood election.She told ITV: ldquoIrsquod like there to be a second independence referendum yesterday and failing yesterday, tomorrow ndash but itrsquos not just down to what I want.But critics insisted there was nothing optimistic about breaking up the UK and called on Ms Sturgeon to take a ldquoisive and unnecessary second referendum off the table.Ms Sturgeonrsquos dficulties in balancing the cautious and gung-ho factions in her party were highlighted by one of her senior MPs suggesting independence could be achieved without a repeat of rsquos referendum ndash flying in the face of party policy.Angus Brendan MacNeil, who has been the MP for the Western Isles since , said the SNP must not ldquodither and instead act on independence here and now.He told conference delegates that ldquoanother way would have to be foundthe UK Government refused to allow a legally binding vote through a so-called Section  order.Meanwhile, SNP Brexit Secretary Mike Russell told a fringe meeting that there would have to be discussions about what happened nextunionist parties blocked a fresh referendum.It comes after Joanna Cherry QC, the SNPrsquos justice spokeswoman at Westminster, said Scotland could break off from the UK without a second vote.She insisted a ldquodemocratic event such as a general election would be enough, but critics branded her comments dangerous and ill-judged. The SNPrsquos official position is that a referendum is necessary. Ms Sturgeon has argued a fresh independence push can only be made once the outcome of the Brexit negotiations becomes clear.But yesterday she said a second referendum before  was ldquostill possible, stressing the Scottish Parliament has a mandate to push ahead with a new vote.Deputy leader Keith Brown told SNP delegates the party was ldquostepping up the campaign for independence. But the cautious approach favoured by the leadership provoked unhappiness among some delegates. One told a Brexit fringe meeting that members were ldquovery frustrated with constantly being told to just wait and suggested time was ldquoslipping away.Addressing the SNP conference, Ms Sturgeon will insist an independent Scotland would offer an escape from the chaos engulfing Westminster. She will say: ldquoThe Westminster Government stumbles from day to day and disaster to disaster. Itrsquos hard to watch that unfolding calamity and feel anything other than despair.ldquoSo it is up to us ndash now more than ever ndash to offer optimism and hope.ldquoJust think how much more hope will be possible when we take Scotlandrsquos future into Scotlandrsquos hands and become an independent country.ldquoAn independent Scotland, just as Scotland is now, will be a beacon for progressive values ndash equality, opportunity, ersity and fairness.ldquoIndeed those values feel more important today than ever before in my letime.The First Minister will insist the SNP Government is working ldquoday in, day out, step by step, to change lives for the better.She will announce a new default position ndash dubbed ldquoFair Work First ndash which will see firms receiving Government contracts and grants required to pay the living wage, ditch zero-hours contracts and take action on gender pay gaps.Scottish Tory chief whip Maurice Golden said Ms Sturgeon had ldquoled the SNP troops half way into battle, and then called halt.He said: ldquoWhen it comes to Scotlandrsquos future, everyone in the SNP has an opinion but nobody has a plan.ldquoAll the while, Scotlandrsquos schools are going backwards, waiting times are being missed, and the economy is in the slow lane.ldquoNicola Sturgeon can show leadership today by doing the right thing: and taking a second referendum off the table.

The reason, Sir Howard is reported as saying, is that as the bank has staged ldquoone of the biggest corporate turnarounds in history it is now ldquofully focused on building a much better bank for our customers.It is not the first time that the bank has tried to distance itself from the RBS moniker, with a  decision seeing it drop the name from  branches across the UK in favour of Royal Bank of Scotland north of the Border and NatWest south of it. The plan now is to stop using it in a corporate context, which essentially means when trying to find institutions interested in buying its shares.The thing is, RBS has come a long way in the past  years. Having grown into an unwieldy international behemoth under the leadership of former boss Fred ldquothe shred Goodwin, the business has slimmed down into something far more recognisable as a mainstream British bank. It has also taken some steps to right past wrongdoings by paying compensation to certain shareholders and customers who were affected by its actions.Signs that RBS was finally starting to emerge from the wilderness came earlier this year when the institution made a profit then paid a idend for the first time in a decade. When, in August, it agreed to pay pound. billion to settle a US Department of Justice investigation that had hung over it for the same period of time, RBS was able finally to draw a faint line under its past misdemeanours.To rebrand now, just when City analysts think the bank is starting to look investable again, would seem almost as wacky as taking part in the poundbn take-over of a Dutch bank on which limited due diligence had been done. Indeed, while RBS may have been well advised to reinvent itself in the immediate aftermath of its bailout, it would seem there is no pressing need for it to do so now.Sure RBS continues to be dogged by problems, as evidenced by it being labelled Britainrsquos worst bank for customer service by the Competition and Markets Authority and the worst for handling PPI claims by consumer group Which .Its decision to plough ahead with branch closures in the face of a signicant public backlash has also done its reputation no favours, with the fact that other banks are doing exactly the same thing having no truck with a public that feels it has a vested interest in RBS thanks to the Treasury retaining a signicant shareholding in it.But these issues are small fry compared to what RBS has been through over the past  years, and as it is facing them from a position of relative corporate strength they are hardly worth reinventing itself for now. As brand expert Marc Cloosterman wrote in US publication Branding Strategy Insider in June, a business with a bad reputation may use a rebranding exercise to ldquoameliorate or dispel negative associationsthat reputation is ldquohaving a serious impact on its operating results.But with RBS seemingly well on the road to recovery the pressure on its brand has eased and, with investors liking nothing better than a company that is clearly on the up, surely it is only a matter of time before its brand is rehabilitated too.That it is given the chance to do this is important not just for the bank but for Scotland as well. Like brand identity, national identity is a tricky concept to pin down, but it essentially revolves around how disparate groups of people use symbols and ideas to bind themselves to one another in an image of togetherness.Being measured in our financial dealings has long been seen as an essential part of what it is to be Scottish, with the way we behave as iniduals shaping our institutions and informing the way we are viewed by others. It is fair to say that RBS has been a huge embarrassment to Scotland, and rightly so, but that is because the country helped shape the bankrsquos reputation for canniness in the first place.Planning to get rid of the RBS brand may be more about a bank that is now run from London wanting to distance itself from the nation whose image it helped to tarnish. But to obliterate a name we were once so proud of just when the institution behind it is starting to emerge as something better would be to do a disservice to all of us."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-minister-likens-brexit-to-the-highland-clearances","story":"Christina McKelvie, minister for older people and equalities, said both involved wealthy elites telling people what to do.She told a fringe meeting at the SNPs conference in Glasgow:\"Rich, privileged, entitled people, shting people to the clf edge  years ago,  years ago, now.

Karla visited CLAN for one-to-one support and complementary therapies which aim to reduce the pain and stress that can accompany a diagnosis and treatment.CLAN was also there to support Karla’s mother and her young daughter, Olivia, received specialist support through CLAN’s dedicated Children  Families team who helped her to understand her mother’s condition.

In fact, with a greater number of people living with and after a cancer diagnosis, the need for wellbeing support and information services is likely to continue to rise.“Thanks to the support of Hydrasun, we aim to reach even more people who can benefit from our support.

I am grateful to Andy Moir once again for making himself available and to all those we met in Stronsay, who engaged constructively and put forward a number of issues for further consideration.“The key issue raised at the public meeting was undoubtedly the decision by NHS Orkney not to include a helipad on the site of the new Balfour hospital. Concerns were expressed about apparent delays in transferring Isles patients, brought in by air ambulance, from Kirkwall airport to the current Balfour due to a lack of land ambulance capacity.“While it is unlikely that NHS Orkney will reopen the decision on a helipad, ious suggestions were made about how delays in transfer to the hospital might be avoided in future.

This includes travel costs to attend training or to compete on the Scottish mainland, which he believes can be prohibitive.#Grants and sponsorship are available and invaluable, but finding ways to reduce costs remains a challenge,# he explained.“I was also told that for some girls and women, the macho image associated with certain sports can be a disincentive to get involved. In that respect, having good female role models is important and in Orkney we are fortunate to have a great many.#The success of Anna Tait and Rachael Sutherland at the last two Orkney Sportsperson of the Year Awards illustrates this perfectly, with Anna winning from an all-female shortlist that also included Sarah MacPhail and Hannah Beavan, and Amy Golder taking the top junior award. Meanwhile, Orkney Dragons go from strength to strength, attracting more girls and women into playing rugby.Increasing participation is something that Mr McArthur feels we should all be able to support.#Role models are part of that, but we need to look at ways of removing obstacles, whether that be to do with funding, facilities or even, as Anna Tait suggested, making the image of a sportswoman more acceptable to young girls.“When you see those inspirational people within your own community, it’s so much easier to say ‘well why not me #copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This consultation is a great opportunity for older Orcadians’ comments and experiences to help shape future planning for more inclusive, affordable and accessible transport on our islands.”Speaking about the workshop, Age Scotland’s Policy Engagement  Campaigns Officer Simon Ritchie said: “We know that a lack of transport options can be a huge barrier for many older people in the Highlands and Islands living the le they want to live. Around , older people in Scotland don’t see anyone  for at least half a week so easy access to good transport options is vital to older people allowing them to run errands, meet friends and family, make medical appointments and improve their quality of le.#This is a brilliant opportunity for older people in Orkney to share their views on transport and shape the new National Transport Strategy.  Age Scotland and Transport Scotland want to hear how transport works for older Orcadians so that decision-makers can ensure older Orcadians can access the services they need in order to enjoy later le.#“We invite any and all older people in Orkney to come along and share their views with us.”The transport workshop will take place in Finstown on Thursday October  at the Orkney Men#s Shed.

The other sites being considered for the initial roll-out include Glasgow, Ayr, Dumfries, Dunfermline, Fort William, Milngavie, Oban, Inverness and Aberdeen.The units will be fitted with technology that will enable them to digitally track water usage at each Top-up point, transmitting the data via cloud technology to specialists managing Scotland’s water networks. The resulting data will be used to calculate cost and plastic savings, along with the volume of water being consumed.Douglas Millican, Scottish Water chief executive, said: “Our research shows that people feel very positively towards the quality of Scotland’s tap water — now these state-of-the-art taps can provide access to enable water drinkers to enjoy it while on the go by carrying and using refillable bottles.”The Your Water, Your Le campaign aims to make tap the first choice for water drinkers wherever they are, and encourages businesses to make it readily available for staff and customers. Zero Waste Scotland, Keep Scotland Beautul and Scottish Natural Heritage, have also voiced their support.On average, a litre bottle of water costs about p, so topping up daily from the tap, could save £. a day, nearly £ a year.For further information, visit yourwateryourle vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

She called for the creation of prearranged collections for businesses seeking to deposit large amounts of cash, after the review recognised that such arrangements could be improved.The MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch said: \"As the MSP for Beauly and Kyle, I am of course disappointed that the RBS branches in both towns are to close.\"While I recognise branch use has been declining in both of these areas, there are still well-documented and legitimate questions regarding security and disabled access in the alternative banking provision.\"The review plainly states that the branch closure in Beauly will cause dficulties for vulnerable customers and so as the constituency MSP I am calling on RBS to work with me to put measures in place to provide specic support for them. I hope RBS will work with me to listen to the views of the community council to ensure there are better routes and provision in the Beauly area.\"The union Unite slated the announcement by RBS, arguing that the bank had simply gone through the motions of reviewing the cases before pushing ahead with its original plans.The unionrsquos regional officer, Lyn Turner, said: \"The Johnston Carmichael review was entirely predictable and nothing but a rubber-stamp of RBS management decisions. Sixty communities out of an original  with branches earmarked for closure will now be marginalised by this so-called review. Unite will request to meet RBS urgently to discuss the impact.\"Simon Watson, managing director of personal banking at RBS pledged to provide banking alternatives in Kyle and Beauly. He said: \"We know branches are important to many communities, but equally we know that fewer people are using them as more people bank online. In every case of a branch closing we are committed to providing the best possible range of alternatives.\"Wednesday  Oct  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the th anniversary of the Milne Cup.Sadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.Many supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.While it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.But despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

Given these turbines will be placed on high ground, to suggest they will dominate the landscape is an understatement # just what the tourists come to Shetland to see.As long as they#re not in Bressay or Sandness.Only one and a half times the size of big ben# just little things# pfffffff.Absolutely ridiculous!I’ve seen wind turbines with these extra large blades between Stirling and Edinburgh. They are enormous and look awful.Worth recalling that the perceived size of the blade sweepincreases as the square of the radiuse.g. increasing the bladeby . times doubles the perceived size of the blade sweep, or, increasing bladeby % increases perceived size by %John, the longer blades will increase the electrical power that each turbine can generate, giving VE more revenue.That’s as may be, but revenue does not equal profit, and by the time the unsustainable level of subsidy has been removed, the SCT have been suckered in to paying for the export cable, and SSE have ensured their pound of flesh is as great as they can get away with,Shetland will never see its money back.More of nothing is still only nothing.If they are increasing the height of the turbines,does this mean that they would need to increase the size and depth of the anchor points at what extra cost and who will pay Presumably, these are the latest models with towers and foundations redesigned, accordingly The changes should improve cost-effectiveness and presumably, VE’s intention is to improve competitiveness for the auction, which requires cutting costs to the bone and squeezing every last drop of revenue from the project to keep it viable.Given that the last round of auctions produced winning ‘strike prices’ of £. MWh, exactly half what VE insisted they needed for viability , it makes you wonder, would winning an auction capture their fabled “pot of gold at Rainbow’s End” or would it be merely a poisoned chalice that provides little or no# or worse# William, the size and cost of the foundations must be increased to accommodate more powerful wind turbines.Larger Turbines require loads more concrete poured into the blanket bog all previous calculations EIA are out the window.If turbine technology has #advanced considerably# why can#t they make them smaller, considerably The “technology advance” is to produce turbines with increased electrical capacity, requiring longer blades and larger fondations. The thought is that one MW turbine will cost less to install, own, and maintain than two MW turbines.Mr Innes, Project Director for Viking Energy, is quoted where as saying #Viking is now competing against a new generation of wind farms, including those offshore, where tip heights of m or more are now available.#In that case why doesn#t he just put these turbines offshore as well.Kay. Just a thought.Aircraft technology has advanced too and ‘planes get bigger and bigger. I suspect that miniaturisation , so beloved of the Japanese, whose watches, cameras , radios and a host of other products lead one to believe that for items to improve in performance , they need to get smaller. True in many instances but not all. That said, Japanese wind driven turbines might solve a few problems.A point of interest regarding Japan andCO free energy . Japan is planning on using nuclear, not wind power, as a major source of electricity production. One may understand that Japan has greater first-hand knowledge of nuclear atomic contamination than any other country on Earth having being subjected two atomic bombs and the Fukushima accident. Using that real information on real nuclear contamination, not the Green lunacy crank disinformation, so prevalent in Scotland. Japan has a knowledge-led, intelligent energy policy. As ofMay , there are  operable reactors in Japan. Of these, nine reactors in  power plants Additionally, five reactors have been approved for a start, and further  have start applications under review. It never ceases to amaze me how ignorance and fear shape energy policy. Japan is fully aware of the risks of nuclear I reference “the Liberal Democratic Party cabinet in April , calls nuclear power #the country#s most important power source#.[Japan is now aiming for #a realistic and balanced energy structure#. The Japanese Government targets for wind power deployment are set at only .% of electricity production by  . That is a total figure, onshore and offshore.What a huge shame The Scottish Government is unwilling to do the same, it would save our countryside from so much uglly devastation. Why #..Well you don`t need a rocket scientist to figure that one out.Ifthis horrendous project does go ahead it`ll be past its sell by the time it is finished and will be made obsolete by newer, more efficient and cleaner technology.When is the plug going to be pulled on this nonsense before any more money is lost to it If Viking want to increase the turbine size, it is not unreasonable to anticipate that the other windfarm developers will do the same.The floodgates are being opened and, instead of being a world-class destination for wildle  scenery, Shetland will become a world-class example of crass development without regard to the obvious damage to environment, health and wellbeing, not to mention income from tourism.Renewable energy should be pursued, but in Shetland’s case the cost of the VE project has already been far higher – in every sense – than the imagined benefits.I maybe wrong, but wind farm technology appears to be the cheapest form of producing electricityin regard to other alternative sources of producing electricity.I am pretty sure wave and tidal energy could also be tapped into within Shetland, but economics seem to be based on the cheapest alternative compared to wave or tidal resources being the better, possibly, and signicantly less intrusive than the massive wind turbines scaring the Shetland landscape and more than likely tourists remembering the islands not for its beauty but#.well, it is self explanatory.The potential economic damage caused by the wind turbines I am pretty sure would outweigh any positive contribution the islands may have in regard to tourism or other positive attributes the islands may have.Time, no doubt, will be the final answer#.. watch this space, as they say.David. Just to be a bit more optimistic about wind farms , there is every likelihood that visitors to Shetland will already be familiar with rotating blades .It is a fast growing energy generation procedure so would not come as a shock.The other thing is ,such equipment would almost certainly not be visible from all corners of Shetland.People would get used to them just as they are used to the island hopping planes.It’s a bit unfortunate that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions.I take onboard your points, Haydn, but I think what is putting people off the VEP, is the shear cost of what it could possibly be. I have heard a figure not far short of kicking on the door of £. Billion, and possibly more, and how many decades would this take to bring VEP into the black in terms of revenue One should also look into the potential running and maintenance costs per year for such a project  Would the revenue created be enough to off-set such costs or would VE require more funding from the SCT, to balance its books It seems very evident, the more information people in Shetland know about VEP, the more people are put off the whole idea in terms of economics and what little benefit the islands may reap from it  I have heard a figure of around £ million a year###.poor investmentthe projected costs are to be believed. Aof around. of % does not bode well.I have to take issue with you here Haydn, The proposed VE turbines will now be meres high and constructed on hills. The high point some meters plus above sea level. That would be the line of sight from sea level of about  miles. Precious little of Shetland would not see the VE turbines!! I note you claim #that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions#. I would respectfully point out wind turbines are hardly a new idea! Many consider them at the point of being an obsolete technologyNow for cutting-edge ideas, look to tidal generation and modular nuclear reactors. The latter , I believe you are openly condemning, something about us all glowing in the dark was your comment!!! Now that was Scaremongering nonsense. Rosatom,Russias vehicle for nuclear expansion,has about % of new nuclear plant contracts in the bag,mainly in emerging and third world countries .If Chernobyl is anything to go by and what Russia the culprit did in rectyingthe mess,novichok is going to be a piddle in the ocean in comparison.Read an article this morning.Wish I could remember which paper that said Germany#s  year old wind turbines are coming to the end of their usefulness and no longer qualy for subsidies. No recycling as the blades are made from fibre glass.Their plan is to dump them on third world nations so creating more waste rather than cleaning the mess up themselves. Viking energy should sit up and take not it but will have cloth ears when it comes to profit. Remember, as you sow,so shall ye reap.Germany, by nature of its fragmented political system with government by weak coalitions only resulted in the Green Partyexercising much influence beyond their electoral mandate. Nuclear power was cut back as a political gesture to the Greens, that had nothing to do with the science of the matter. The result was a massive increase in coal-fired electrical generation and also the importation of Natural Gas. Germany is now the worlds largest importer of Natural Gas! and the German motor industries disingenuous diesel emission data is almost legendary!!!.Deaths from atmospheric pollution in Germany are massive and this year the EU is taking Germany to court for breaking all EU guidelines. It is indeed very ironic that the Scotish Government does so much to praise the use of Wind power and exploit all its rural communities to that end while it does all in its ability to expandGas Exportation from the North Sea,.

The logic escapes me, perhaps you could explain Grahm,!!!Billy , I understand where you are coming from when stating that  year old turbines in Germany are coming to the end of their lives , but is this surprising   Since technological advances in vast areas of activity are so rapid it would be most unlikely for things to suddenly stand still.Try selling a  year old car , TV. washing machine ,vacuum cleaner , racing bike etc etc. Virtually worthless .

All very whimsical but I’m sure you get the drt.Interesting comment Haydn. I am unable to find any substantive advance in Wind Turbines as technology over the last  years. They are larger yes, but no less polluting and even more damaging to the environment. The most recent research would indicate that disturbance in airflow patterns and friction around the rotating blades not only creates more noise pollution but results in substantive heat creation. That heat creation in itself would and does contribute to global warming new research has shown. Reference #Hard University’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences# would indicate wind power in theU.S. with wind alone would warm the planet a quarter-degree Celsius! If this research is proved correct, we will be decommissioning and scrapping wind turbines far sooner than the protagonist advocate. There are already far better ways of generating clean electricity than  meter high turbines, sadly too many have staked their reputations on the wind myth and will resist accepting they have been wrongFair enough Ian. I must confess that I was unaware of the likely height of the proposed turbine blades.I’m not so sure about Japan and others having a reducing intention to set up more turbines though. As for the comment I made about nuclear radiation causing people to glow in the dark —— you surely cannot be serious !!!!That was no more than a figure of speech.I hope you are merely poking fun at such a prospect.I know that glow worms emit light as do other creatures in the sea but it’s silly to think that the effects on iniduals who have been subjected to radiation for medical reasons would then walk about looking like Beacons.Give me a break Ian!Ian.—- Your comments on October th at -.Plenty of food for thought in your missive .Thanks.It is a balance between providing energy safely and economically, but our conventional methods of using fossil fuels has brought to the fore due to the impact such energy has had on the environment.However, whilst we are being side-tracked about the impact of fossil fuels, nobody has every mentioned the impact on the planet caused by agriculture. Agriculture, I believe, causes  times more green house gases than all of transportation put together Not only does agriculture produce more green houses gases than transportation, it is the greatest cause of environmental destruction than any other industry. As our population grows, this will become more evident, as we see species upon species being put on the # endangered species list # or # become extinct #. This man-made catastrophe will impact on other species and it will eventually impact the very existence of humans on the planet as nature takes revenge through disease, drought and other natural impacts.Progress in providing alternative energy may be a positive start, but at what price will this be to the planet and le,this progress is purely based on the man-made concept of monetary value and this of profit David Spence, the single most signicant threats to humanity are overpopulation and our leaders, scientic, religious and political leader#s, utter cowardice to dare to mention such an undeniable fact. World population is set to double in  years. Energy needs, food supply, pollution are all driven by human population density. It makes no odds how many windmills we build whatever their size! Atmospheric pollution, global warming or starvation awaits and will kill all our children#s children as long as human overbreeding continues. It is hard to take the Greens cranks, politicians and doom-mongers of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change seriously when their reports fail to state, or take into account the blindingly obvious.David. Your warning shots make me feel that I should grabfew bottles of whisky 🥃 go back to bed and snooze my way through the day even though there’s a hot Indian summer outside.!!Seriously , weare facing a dire situation which will impact on my grandsons far more than on me —— or you. When you say ‘Agriculture’ I’m assuming that you are including livestock.The greenhouse gas emissions from the planet’s animal le must be enormous and that’s whether or not they are raised for their meat .Also, to take your point, such vast amounts of money are tied into food production , it’s hard to seeany measures at all, however well intentioned, , will enable us to eradicate the decline of le in its widest sense.Time to grab that whisky bottle I think 🤔. Cheers.Is there going to be a remake of #Dad#s Army#  Only, a number of contributors seem to be vying for the part of Private Fraser: #Wur do-oO-MM-ED!# LOL 🙂I take your points Haydn and Ian, but according to predicted human population expansion, it is estimated the global population will be around  billion by the year  Other dynamics affecting population growth, as you know, is requiring more land not only for agriculture but for accommodation and expanded space for for other amenities related.Not doubt, I think, there may come a critical point where demand for the expansion of the population, not including technological advancement, will determine how we live and finding a balance between our own demands to this of the natural world and other le The driving force for this expansion is predominantly based on economics and technological advances, and as long as this is the precedent, this could bring into conflict what we want and what nature will will allow In the food chain, I suspect we will become more use to # processed food # as technological progress will find better ways of growing alternative foods, whether biologically or chemically, as an answer to keep a balance between our demands and this of a coexisting relationship with the natural laws which govern le itself, including humans..."},{"url":null,"title":"5 back charlotte lane lerwick ze1 0jd ","story":"Offers over £,.A lovely cosy, quirky  bedroomed cottage with storage heaters and an open fire in the sitting room.

The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"team leader at shetland home cope ltd ","story":"Are you just the right person to join our dynamic social enterprise, which promotes skill development for people with learning disabilities  We are looking for someone with the following to lead our busy team:Strong leadership and Retail Management experienceA passion for re-use and recycling..COPE Ltd is a charity and social enterprise."},{"url":null,"title":"windrush laxo vidlin ","story":"Offers over £,Originally used as a fishing lodge the property comprises two reception rooms , kitchen   diner, modern shower room, cloak room  store   utility area , on the ground floor, plus three double bedrooms  shower room on the first floor.

Added to this, a further four football pitches worth of the reserve land would be temporarily lost to the construction site to accommodate the construction activities and the associated diggers, cranes and other heavy machinery.\"But the effects of the road scheme on the reserves wildle will extend far beyond the extent of roadworks activities.\"The noise and activity associated with the A construction works, and the increased traffic flows and the imposing road structure once the road is completed, will cause many birds to keep their distance and not attempt to nest or feed within several hundred metres of the road site.\"Transport Scotland has bought land at Dellmore near Insh Marshes and proposes to convert some of this to wet grassland to accommodate the homeless wader bird species from Insh. While RSPB Scotland has welcomed this, the charity said it will be hard to convert this land for the waders, and maintain it as such over the long-term.The spokeswoman said: \"It is far from guaranteed it will provide suitable habitat, and evenit does, the new habitat will not be big enough or suitable to rehome all of the waders that would be made homeless.

They said it will impact on the popular Milton Woods.Ms Birkby said: \"We have continually made the case for protecting the exceptional wildle of Insh Marshes, minimising harmful impacts, and maximising environmental benefits such as enhancing or providing suitable new habitat nearby.\"While we welcome the intention of converting some land at Dellmore to wet grassland, it is far from guaranteed that it will provide suitable habitat for all the wildle affected.\"We understand the need for the A dualling but believe that it can be built in a way which minimises its impact.\"We have suggested several ways in which Transport Scotland could do this but disappointingly, they are not proposing these measures in the latest plans, so there is a real risk that the road scheme will result in long-term harm to a iety of wildle.\"We encourage local people to view the proposals online or attend the public exhibition and raise their concerns before the deadline of October .\"The proposals for Crubenmore to Kincraig went on show yesterday in Newtonmore Village Hall.

He could not understand why locals should not be able to access the pool facilities at this time.He said: \"I work with sustainable tourism myself. This does not sound like sustainable tourism to me. In my opinion tourism should benefit local communities. The best reason to have tourism in the first place is so that it can benefit local residents in a dferent way.\"It can increase services locally, create job opportunities and more vibrant communities. To me it is almost impossible to imagine that we should have a situation like this happening here.\"David Butterworth, chief executive of the Yorkshire Dales National Park, told the Strathy: \"In smaller rural communities you have to have facilities like this shared with the local population.\"I think in many instances local authorities when giving planning permissions for ventures like this have a condition in there that the facilities must be made available to local people.\"That to me seems the right thing to do. If Macdonald Hotels have come up with a reason not to do that then it has to be pretty good reason to change it.\"Its a nonsense. Surely they want the best in terms of future sustainability of the area they want this area to attract people and families in particular and facilities such as this are part of that, so I am more than happy to support the cause.\"Italian delegate Stefano Sardi, from Udine in the north-east of the country, said: \"Children have the right to practise this type of activity and recreation as it is very important for them to have this skill. To grant them the chance to learn to swim is very important for any community in Scotland, Italy and anywhere  in the world.\"Organisers were delighted with the response they received from delegates.Janet Lowin, of Aviemore, said: \"I have spent a lot of time at the pool with my grandson Riley. These children have been explaining things to the resort visitors and they have actually got lots of people to sign the petition as well.\"The kids are saying We cant go swimming anymore.

Afterward, I travelled back home and got out the car and I don’t remember anything about the three weeks after that – but apparently I ‘died’ a couple of times, according to reports!“I was told that I dropped like a stone on the pavement outside my house, and my neighbour ran across to the community centre to get the defibrillator and used it on me. After that, the doctor and the air ambulance arrived.”Cherill spent three weeks in Raigmore Hospital in Inverness but was then admitted to hospital in Edinburgh where she went through open heart surgery and was fitted with a pacemaker. After three weeks out of the hospital, she was readmitted to Raigmore for a further two weeks but is now back home recovering.Having battled her way back from the brink, Cherill was informed that her husband Russell had died at home in Gairloch two weeks to the day of her suffering cardiac arrest. “It’s heart-breaking,” she said. “I think what happened to me must have been terrying for poor Russell.”Despite enduring such serious illness and personal tragedy, Cherill remains positive about the future and was quick to pay tribute to the role of LuckyBhere. She said: “I am so pleased to see a small organisation like LuckyBhere is doing so well. I wouldn’t be hereit wasn’t for the defibrillator at the community centre and someone being able to use it on me.”Three days after Cherill’s collapse, on Tuesday th June, -year-old father-of-three Ian MacLeod was out at Dores beach when he too suffered a cardiac arrest.“I’m a cub scout leader and was doing the register with another leader when I hit the dirt,” he said.“A couple of Spanish tourists who were on the beach at the time performed CPR on me and got the defib from the Dores Inn and kept on going until the ambulance arrived. It took  to  minutes to get me to Raigmore Hospital.”After being admitted on Tuesday evening, Ian was fitted with a ‘stent’the next day and was out of the hospital on Thursday to pick his children up from school.Having served in the forces and kept himself in good psychical the condition, Ian believed there was no rhyme nor reason for his illness: “I have never been overweight and I’m in decent shape, so it just shows you it could happen to anyone.”During his  years as a security guard in the Eastgate Shopping Centre in Inverness, Ian was on the other end of a defibrillator — having used one at work — and was keen to stress that when it comes to using the device there shouldn’t be anything to fear. “You can’t do any more harm to a person by using a defib, as they are in effect already dead. “I am forever grateful. All things considered, I could have died and there would be three kids left without a dad.”On Wednesday th June, in Port of Ness in Lewis, -year-old John Burgis wasn’t feeling his usual self and his we Carol soon became concerned about his wellbeing.“John hadn’t been  per cent the day before, which rang alarm bells for me,” she said. “He had been a bit breathless, and we went to the surgery. They took his blood pressure and said he was fine but — given he was  — to take it easy, so we came home# We went to bed about  o’clock.”“I don’t remember anything apart from waking up in the hospital,” said John. “Carol apparently found me making funny noises at about one o’clock in the morning and then realised I was unconscious.”Carol quickly called for an ambulance: “I dialled  and when I was on the phone he stopped breathing. Then I did what I was told to do – I got him off the bed and on to the floor and did CPR until the responder arrived.“Fiona, the responder alongside whom I had trained about  years earlier came from Cross with the defibrillator – it was lucky she was the one on call and didn’t live far away. She got the kit out straight away. I put the stickers on his chest, she shocked him, and he started breathing again.”John was admitted to hospital in Stornoway before being transferred by helicopter to Queen Elizabeth ICU in Glasgow. He was then admitted to the Golden Jubilee Hospital in Clydebank where he was fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator . He was back home just over a week later.“One reason for my quick recovery was that I actually went into hospital quite fit,” said John. “Even though I was unconscious, my body itself was in a fit state. We had regularly been going to the gym near our house here which has a scheme free for pensioners that is great – it encourages some of the old folk to go. We regularly go out on our bikes or walk up to the Butt of Lewis, so we do lead quite active lestyles.”Carol added: “It was our wedding anniversary recently which was very poignant as I could have been sitting here by myself – I wasn’t, and it’s all good.“We have a very strong faith and that has helped us accept what has happened and be extremely grateful that John is still here.”Dr. Steve Leslie, consultant cardiologist and clinical lead for heart failure at Raigmore Hospital, believes the work undertaken by LuckyBhere is “truly le-saving”.“Without defibrillation, a cardiac arrest is almost always fatal,” Dr. Leslie said. “For every  seconds in which defibrillation is delayed the chance of success is reduced by  per cent. This means that for defibrillation to be successful it needs to be delivered as soon as possible. CPR prior to defibrillation can buy time.#The approach taken by LuckyBhere to encourage communities not only to provide community-based defibrillators but also to engage with training is lesaving.”Established in , LuckyBhere was set-up by Skye resident Ross Cowie who suffered a cardiac arrest in  but was saved due to the presence nearby of an ambulance which had lesaving equipment.In view of his own experience, Ross decided to raise funds to purchase a defibrillator for the Skye Camanachd shinty clubhouse in Portree which was where he fell ill. What began as a small local gesture has since blossomed into a national charity – LuckyBhere and its team of volunteers have provided training to thousands of people in communities across theand breadth of Scotland, from Cullivoe Hall in Shetland to Burrowhead Holiday Village near the Mull of Galloway.Last year the charity linked up with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar to provide ELS training — including how to operate a defibrillator — as part of the curriculum in all  primary and secondary schools across the Western Isles. In total, there are currently  public access defibrillators in the Western Isles from the Butt of Lewis to Barra, and more than  across Skye.Ross Cowie said: “We always said at LuckyBhere thatwe could help to save one le that would make all efforts worthwhile. Several people have survived but, for three to be saved in five days, is extraordinary.“Much of this success is due to the trainers who give their time freely to train thousands of people across Scotland in lesaving skills. Training takes only two hours and what better skill could be learned than the ability potentially to save someone’s le.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_20180804_190022_01.jpg","title":"mallaig and kyleakin prepare for championship","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLeague newcomers Mallaig face reigning champions Kyleakin in Broadford on Saturdaywith the  Skye and Lochalsh Football League Championship at stake.This season#s champions will be determined by virtue of a winner-takes-all, title-deciding playoff after both sides finished neck-a-neck on  points in the table # as goal dference isn#t factored in.Mallaig secured their place in tomorrow#s showdown after recording a fantastic - away victory against Sleat and Strath in the final game of the campaign in which their goalkeeper Mark Johnston pulled off a late penalty save to seal the victory.Kyleakin, meanwhile, took the spoils with a well-deserved - home win in their crunch match against fellow title contenders Portree Juniors thanks in part to a splendid showing by goalkeeper Craig Wilson.With the teams having scored  goals between them in the league this season # *including  in their three encounters so far, Saturday#s match-up promises to be a fitting finale to what has been a thrilling and unpredictable campaign.Having gone from - up to - down, the Blues rallied with goals from substitute Brett MacMillan, who drew his side level and then from Andy Cunningham who struck a late winner to seal the points.Mallaig led twice, first through Marc MacLean, and then Angus MacNaughton but were pegged by Graham Campbell#s side.Just as it appeared a vital three points would slip through the net, Jamie MacGregor# side struck a third in injury time as Ryan MacDonald set up Andy Cunningham for the winner.With only a win guaranteed to keep them in the hunt, Mallaig stepped up when the pressure was on to put in an excellent away performance against DL MacKinnon#s men.Ross Douglas scored a brace to help fire his side - ahead but Connaire Yoxon found the back of the net with a fine finish to halve their advantage.With less than ten minutes remaining Sleat were awarded a penalty and the chance to equalise. However, despite having been beaten from the spot earlier in the match, Mark Johnston ed to his left to thwart Ben Yoxon#s effort and with it seal his side#s playoff berth.After succumbing to a - defeat at the hands of their rivals the week before in the Ross Cup, Kyleakin came storming back with a confidence-boosting - win which brought them right back into contention, while also ending the hosts# unbeaten run in the league in the process. Gordy Mccarroll opened the scoring with a well-taken effort from a freekick, with Cameron Thompson scoring the second from close range.In stark contrast to his display in the cup game the week before # which saw him earn a red card # Mccarroll put in a man of the match performance with a tireless showing and a goal to boot.The south Skye side churned out an important win as they overcame a tough nut in Northwest.Kyleakin were far from their best in the first period but a Stewart Johnston goal before the break gave them a  to build on. Clinical second-half strikes from Innis Thompson and Gordy Mccarroll sealed a victory which had looked far from certain for large periods of the game.With Mallaig having finished the season on  points, and Juniors holding a one-point advantage over the Reds going into the match, David Butcher#s side knew it was win or bust in terms of their title defence.What followed was a fine team performance by the  winners with goals from Cameron Thompson, Stuart Gillies, and a brace from Gordy Mccarroll. Their victory was punctuated by some outstanding goalkeeping by Craig Wilson # including an incredible stop to deny Juniors as they threatened to turn the tide early in the second half. #I feel our team have performed very well this year and are still learning in every game we play in this league. I’ve been impressed with the dedication shown by everyone to make sure this season went as smoothly as possible.##The team has certainly had its ups and downs this year, we have been caught napping in a couple of games that most people would expect us to win, but on the flip side we have stepped up in all the big games and have onlyone defeat in the league so far, so I can’t be too critical.# #It was great to see a four-way battle for the title but our lads needed no motivation. To be in that position was fantastic and we knew how hard the task would be against a Sleat team who themselves have had a great season this year. I have to say, it’s the most focused I’ve seen the lads and that’s including the two finals we’ve missed out on this year.#I don’t really think it gave me the extra motivation as I don’t really look at what other teams are doing, I knew after we beat Sleat that we were in pretty good shape to at least get a playoff but I didn’t think it would be against Mallaig # so credit to them for a great run-in. Whoever comes out on top on Saturday will be worthy winners.# #This might sound silly, but no, I was fully confident with the boys at the start of the season. Our aim was the title, although we liked keeping it too ourselves, so we could get our heads down and show what we can do on the pitch. I’ve been surprised by the ersity of the league. Every club has a completely dferent style and it’s not a case of setting up the same each week. We#re still learning and hopefully improving.# #It’s definitely a dferent challenge trying to defend the title as you are the team everyone wants to beat, so teams probably lt their game a wee bit against you and you have the added pressure of people#s expectations of you.# #I have always used the same approach to every game since I’ve started managing Kyleakin and I don’t see why that should change. Doing anything dferent could just add pressure to the boys and you’re disrupting what they are used to.# #No dferent than usual for us, everyone is happy to have had a weekend to prepare for the game. We really need to work out a game plan to unlock the Kyleakin code, they are the only team we haven’t managed to beat this year.#########################################-Article by Adam GordonAll images by Willie Urquhart."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/advert_whfp.jpg","title":"council wants scotrail to help ease disruption on stromeferry","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineScotrail are currently considering a proposal to terminate rail journeys at Strathcarron to allow road traffic to flow more freely through the ersion on the Stromeferry bypass.At a meeting in Lochcarron last week, Colin Howell , Highland Council’s head of infrastructure, said that the ‘road to rail’ ersion on the bypass, where important stabilisation work to the rockface is being carried out, could stay open to traffic for an extra  minutes each dayScotrail would agree to do this.

He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.The correct decision by British Secretary of State Karen Bradley to reduce MLA wages cannot be allowed to mask the true nature of the undemocratic and politically damaging measures she announced in recent days.By her own staggering admission, Karen Bradley did not understand the voting motivations of the electorate here when she first took up the post.Clearly that is no longer the case. But unfortunately for anyone in this society who is interested in the rights of citizens, equality or the implementation of previous agreements, there is only one set of votes that Karen Bradley is interested in – and that is the DUP’s.Her government is reliant on the DUP for its own survival and is clearly determined not to upset that applecart, no matter how rotten its contents may be.She had an opportunity this week to take tangible measures that would have helped pave the way for a restoration of the power-sharing institutions by confronting the ongoing denial of rights by the DUP.But despite championing rights and equality in her own constituency and country, she failed to do so on behalf of citizens here.Instead what she announced was a suite of measures which subvert the democratic process and previous agreements.Faced with the prospect of a court-ordered Assembly poll, she moved to suspend her powers to call an election as set out in the legislation. That is a hugely retrograde step and a move away from the Good Friday Agreement.It also begs the question, what kind of self-declared democratic government, suspends the right of the people to have their say at the polls And while we all accept that officials require clarity on their roles in the current climate, any move to replace democratic accountability with greater authority for unelected civil servants or Direct Rule Ministers is entirely unacceptable.The aim of Karen Bradley’s intervention this week, setting aside the convenient timing of distracting from explosive evidence at the RHI Inquiry, was to buy time. To announce a flurry of supposed activity but, in reality, doing nothing but continuing to facilitate the denial of rights which is preventing a restoration of the power-sharing institutions.Her government is prepared to allow the political process to continue to drt with no strategy and no plan for a resolution rather than challenge their confidence and supply partners.This reliance on the DUP remains the central problem andany process around restoring the institutions is to be credible, Karen Bradley must begin prioritising the rights of citizens over Tory party self-interest.The Dublin Government must also assert its full role as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.The Taoiseach has pledged not to abandon northern citizens in the context of Brexit. He also has responsibilities to them in terms of rights and his government and must now show leader-ship in securing and defending rights which are routinely delivered everywhere  on this is-land.Leo Varadkar would not tolerate discrimination against the LGBT community, women, victims and Irish speakers in Dublin. He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.There can be no ambivalence or equivocation on rights, equality and integrity in government.These are basic building blocks of any democratic society. They are not republican demands and it is long past that the British Government stopped prioritising its own selfish interests over what should be birth-rights of people they claim to represent.What is certain is that Direct Rule failed in the past and is not and never will be acceptable again.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27474  ","story":" Mark MoloneyMartin said that while a decision on a merger with the SDLP or contesting elections in the North has not yet been reached, there were no circumstances under which Fianna Fáil candidates would not take their seats.FIANNA Fáil leader Mícheál Martin TD has confirmed that successful Fianna Fáil candidates standing in the North would take their seats in Westminster.

We are elected as MPs who vote for Sinn Féin not to take seats at Westminster.”Meanwhile, a poll by LucidTalk in June  showed that % of Sinn Féin voters backed their abstentionist stance, with only % opposed.  When supporters were asked how they would reactSinn Féin judged that it strategically suited the party to take seats in Westminster, more than half of their supporterssaid they would oppose such a move.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27475  ","story":" Michael McMonagleWe believe there is now an urgent need for an inclusive, constructive debate on the future, including how a united Ireland might be brought about and what it might look like.- Matt Carthy MEPSinn Féin will host a United Ireland conference in Letterkenny tomorrow featuring a range of speakers discussing what Irish unity would look like and how it can be achieved. The Towards A United Ireland conference will be hosted by Matt Carthy MEP and will be held in the An Grianan Theatre in Letterkenny from am tomorrow. It will feature two  discussions with contributors discussing whether an agreed Ireland is possible anda unity referendum could be won. Panellists will include journalist and unionist commentator, Alex Kane, economist Paul Gosling, founder of Equate, Michael Barron, Jonathan Shafi from the Scottish independence movement, commentator Patricia MacBride and Gillian Hamill, journalist and homelessness campaigner. The  discussions will be chaired by Damien Dowds, editor of the Inishowen Independent. Speakers from Sinn Féin will include Elisha McCallion MP, Martina Anderson MEP, Pearse Doherty TD, Matt Carthy MEP and Senator Padraig MacLochlainn. It is the fth in a series of Towards A United Ireland conferences to be held recently. Speaking ahead of the event, Matt Carthy encouraged as many people as possible to attend. \"We believe there is now an urgent need for an inclusive, constructive debate on the future, including how a united Ireland might be brought about and what it might look like. \"As part of this process Sinn Féin has organised a series of successful conferences on this theme in Dublin, Belfast, Cork and London. \"The event will give a range of perspectives on whether a new Ireland is possible and whether or not we can win a referendum on Irish unity. \"This is an important discussion and there is a place for everyone in it so I would encourage as many people as possible to come along and join us in Letterkenny,\" he said. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27476  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonBrexit means that change in the political relations between Britain and Ireland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democratic legitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.- Declan KearneyTheannual British-Irish Associationconference convened last weekend inOxford, England.At thesame time the British government was taking its latest step away from the Good FridayAgreement by changing legislation on calling elections in the north, the DUPleader pulled out from attending the BIA conference at the last minute to hostthe Tory defence minister at another DUP gala dinner in Fermanagh.OnWednesday, speaking after meeting the British Prime Minister in London sheprovided the latest evidence that the DUP has no commitment to restoring thepolitical institutions.  TheBrexit catastrophe is unfolding relentlessly.TheTory party civil war has become even more visceral since the Chequersannouncement.The RHIinquiry continues to reveal a DUP party which was clearly dysal ingovernment, providing insights which make a mockery of that partys purportedadherence to good governance’.IanPaisleys misconduct  discredited behaviour arising from the Sri Lankaepisode is yet another reminder of the recurring financial scandals associatedwith the DUP.The DUPjust does not get it!Thatparty has been in turmoil since it walked away from the draft agreement andaccommodation with Sinn Féin on th February which would have restoreding political institutions by the following week.Yet inall these circumstances the DUP feels no pressure to change its position.Andeventhe British government was so inclined, the Tories have no incentive todo so in the midst of their own governmental and party crises.Inreality some within the DUP have turned away from the political institutions.They have already decided the party should notcontest the  local council elections against the back ground of anagreement on Acht Gaeilge and Irish language rights. Its increasingly obviousthat continued political impasse is a DUP default position in the absence ofgiving political leadership and making political progress.LastMonday in a new destabilising development the Boundary Commission reaffirmedrecommendations which resemble an electoral and political gerrymander of thenorth as a counter to irreversible demographic changes.Thefact is that the Good Friday Agreement and political process are now being heldto ransom by the political self interests and unionist priorities of the DUPand the Tories.TheBritish government and DUP alliance has become a mutually reinforcing wrecker’scharter. Democratic norms are being thrown to the side and violated.In myown speech to the BIA conference I said there is now a real risk that years of progress could be squandered.Irepeated that the absence of ing political institutions is bad forsociety.Thefailure to fully implement and defend the Good Friday Agreement damagesboth the peace and political processes.And thecatastrophe of Brexit has been torpedoed into the midst of these dficulties.Thereis an imperative for us all to look beyond the scale of existing crises and to provide hope and positive vision.Sinn Féin is absolutely dedicated and authenticin our commitment to opening a new phase of the peace process whichsecures a permanent reconciliation and healing process throughout theisland of Ireland.Partitionis the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society.It hasbeen an abject failure from its imposition. Thesectarian structure of the northern state post partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.TheCivil Rights Movement  years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.This belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards implementation of theGood Friday Agreement since . Therefusal of political unionism to embrace a rights-based society and equalityhas culminated in the collapse of the political institutionsand associated crisis in the north for thelast  months.Thegreater majority of citizens in the north are committed to the Good FridayAgreement.They wantrights to be guaranteed which are already enjoyed by others inDublin, London, Edinburgh and Cardf.The politicalearthquake of Brexit has again exposed the negative rolethat partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentallyanti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.Over  years into the Irish peace process, Irish citizens inthe north now face the very real and frightening potential of partition,as the main source of ision and conflict in Ireland, being reinforced.Verysignicantly, a seismic sht has also occurred in the ambitionand expectation of republicans, nationalists and other citizens inthe north.A newgeneration is questioning partition.Therepublican and nationalist constituency is now looking beyondBrexit and towards the prospect of accelerated Irish reunication.Brexithas become a defining moment for these islands.Ithas introduced a new political discourse about the future ofIreland north and south, and the relationship with Britain and Europe.Thedebate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have now movedcentre stage.Thesenew unprecedented realities in turn present new strategic challenges for all ofus in political leadership.Theydemand that we act as pioneers of the future not prisoners of the past.Thereforeit is time for a paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.Negativemismanagement of the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince , must be replaced with a recognition that the transitiontowards Irish unity should begin.Initially thatshould take the form of preparing for a unity referendumand by engaging in a new political discussion with the Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.Formany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.Forthose in the Tory party leadership who have tied their electoral survival to analliance with the DUP this prospect will be unthinkable.However, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.It istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the Britishstate.In parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity. Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.A GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.TheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.Politicalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. Toomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.Societalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.Demographicshts in the north are irreversible.It isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.Somevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.However,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.Unionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.No onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.The %which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.Aminority should be cherished because it enriches society.Diversityshould be celebrated and respected.Thispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.Politicaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.Republicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.Thiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.Theopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.Sinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.Butfundamental change can not be left to happenstance. It must be planned andresourced.Whocould have imagined  years ago that Germany would be reunited sosuccessfully, or that the edice of South African apartheid would fallfive years later.Themodern precedents exist for successful political and economictransformation and transition.Mandelawas right: “It only seems impossible until it is done.”Irishunity is both reasonable and achievable.Irelandtoday is a multi-cultural society, north and south.We arestronger as a people for that.Sinn Féin’s vision is of a new inclusive,constitutional, rights-based democracy on the island of Ireland.Thereis so much to be excited about the rainbow ersity of modern Ireland.This isa time for us all to become pioneers for the future to be visionary with ourpolitics and to make the decisions now about planning for a new Ireland.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27477  ","story":" Michael McMonagleUachtarán na hÉireann must be a beacon of hope for all our people – North, South, East, and West.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone.

They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past.

While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future. It is time to lay the foundations for reconciliation andhealing, and to open up a new phase of the peace

Although Rubys short le was filled with complex medical needs, it was a le filled with love from her parents Lisa and Andy, little brother Ezra and her wider family. Rubys mum Lisa told the : Ruby had the most precious personality. Anyone that met her - she took a piece of their heart straight away and they never forgot her. Ruby had to battle a lot day to day, but she done it with huge strength, she was fully depended on us   for all of her care. This was huge for us as a family. Ruby did not sleep at night. She had a lot of cerebral irritation and suffered from frequent seizures daily We, as her parents, were the only ones able to provide this care. This is where the Hospice played a huge part in our lives, Ruby attended the hospice for respite from the age of six months. The hospice is a home away from home that provides the most amazing care and love to the children and their families with full : medical care  . We, as a family, felt completely comfortable that Ruby was being cared for to the highest standard, in a place filled with love and joy. This gave us time to refuel to keep going that bit longer.The Hospice were also there for us in Ruby’s end of le care, we spent our final two days with her there, in the comfort of a home setting with the support of the nursing staff around us. This gave us precious time that we would never have got anywhere .We made memories that we will cherish forever and we are truly indebted to the Hospice for having such a signicant impact in our final days with Ruby. So, to remember Ruby on her birthday we are holding a birthday party fundraiser, with all money raised going to the Northern Ireland Childrens Hospice.The NI Childrens Hospice is the only one of its kind in Northern Ireland providing care to  children with le limiting conditions. The annual running cost of the Hospice is pound.million, that is for four rooms of the  the hospice has - the hope would be to get all  rooms funded and running.The government support is only % of this, thats why the Hospice relies so heavily on fundraising events to keep this facility running for families like ourselves.Lisa is also planning to launch a blogging website called chasingladybirds in October. This will help Lisa to share her own journey, Rubys le and in turn provide support for other families going through similar experiences.A face book page called Ruby Powells Journey and an instagram page ChasingLadybirds was the prelude to this, giving family and friends the opportunity to be updated throughout Rubys treatments and milestones.Lisa said: Everyone that knew Ruby knew that ladybirds was her wee thing.When she was only a few months old a ladybird landed on her toes one summer day and thats where it all started. In my journey of grief I decided that blogging might be a good outlet and a good way to share my story and journey of grief. Chasing ladybirds came from our connection of ladybirds with Ruby, and Chasing was down to we will always chase Ruby’s memory.We will never forget our memories and love for her - we will always chase every moment we had with her.Lisa and her family would love ityou can make it to Rubys Birthday Fundraiser.There will bouncing castles, soft play, face painting, nail painting, cake sale and a raffle with an array of great prizes. There will even be a live male wax at pm!The fun kicks off at pm until pm and most importantly all money raised goes towards this vital cause - a poignant and fitting way to remember little Rubys legacy.

EasyJet pilot Alex Hawthorne who is originally from Waringstown Now the proud pilot of an Easyjet airbus , Alex, , graduated from Oxford Aviation Academy earlier this year and is based in Venice.She lives with her Italian boyfriend Edgar, whom she met during her pilot training.It has been  years since Alex left her home in Waringstown at the age of  to start a new le in Canada.The move came about after her mum Alison – a flight attendant for many years – married a Canadian pilot whom she met on her travels.    Alex began to pursue a career as a pilot when she moved to Canada They married in  and the family now live in Kitchener, Ontario, roughly an hour outside Toronto. Inspired by her step-dad Doug Glussich, Alex gained her full private pilot’s licence, her first step towards her dream of becoming a commercial pilot.She said: “Mum was a flight attendant so I was kind of exposed to flying from an early age, but it was when I met my step-dad that I first thought that maybe I could be a pilot.”She admitted that having realised her dream, it was not all plain sailing given that her profession is male-dominated: “I’m based in Venice with EasyJet. I’m the only female first officer and there’s also a female captain.    Alex with her grandparents in the cockpit “There’s just the two females out of -strong flight crew.” She said: “I do think things are going in the right direction, especially with EasyJet. They have a scholarship called the Amy Johnson initiative which offers fully paid flight training to females who they pick. “They are trying to drive more females into it, but it is a slow process.”\"  \"  Northern Irelands best fish and chip shop has been revealed Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"She added: “It can sometimes be challenging. You feel you have to prove your worth.   Alex giving her valedictorian speech at Oxford “A lot of the males, the captains, are very good. They take the sex out of it. If you’re a good pilot, your a good pilot – end of story.“Through training I felt that I had to be a little bit better than the boys because I’m a girl.“I have unfortunately encountered a few negative comments, not from any co-workers, but from passengers. It’s been especially from older male passengers when they see a female pilot sitting in the cockpit they things like, ‘maybe I’d be safer getting a dferent flight’. It’s said in jokey way, they’re from a dferent time, but I don’t like hearing it because to me being a pilot is not a joke.“I’ve only had two or three of those comments, it’s not a regular thing.”Talking about the longevity of a career as a pilot, Alex said: “Pilot retirement age is  simply for medical reasons. You have medicals once a year until you get to over , then your medicals come once every six months.”She said: “I’m very settled where I am for now. EasyJet is a fantactic company, they really look after their employees, the money is good, the benefits are good. “To start your career flying an Airbus  is fabulous – it’s one of the best jets around.“However I’ve always had my sights on going long haul. I’d love to try the Boeing ‘triple sevens’, or the s or even the Airbus s, because the bigger the better, right “Before my career ends I would definitely like to try a bigger jet.”She continued@ “The longest flight I’m doing now is from Venice to Edinburgh. It’s two and half hours but from October we’ll be doing Lanzarote and Tel Aviv – those will be three and half hours each.“The Airbus that I fly now simply wouldn’t have the mileage to do more than seven hours. To do that I’d have to go to a bigger airbus – a , or to the Boeing .”Going back to her first time on board an airplane, Alex said: “The first time I was on a commercial aircraft was when I was four years old. I was going to Lanzarote with my parents and brother. “I was really excited. The noise was a bit frightening, but I loved the speed of the take off. “Back in those days you were still allowed to visit the pilots in the flight deck, so my brother and I went up with a flight attendant and I remember wondering what all the buttons were for.”Alex is now pleased to offer the same opportunities to children: “After we land we’ll have young boys and girls coming in to the cockpit. They give you so much respect, and are so interested. “If I could give any advice to the girls out there thinking of becoming a pilot, I’d say go for it.”The reassuring tone of a pilot is something that goes hand-in-hand with air travel, but are the men and women in the cockpit putting on a special voice to talk to passengers or is it their actual demeanour Alex explained: “They say everybody has a PA voice, they just want to sound as professional as they can. When I speak on board, I don’t want to come on with a really thick Northern Irish accent because nobody will understand me. It’s about clarity and getting the message across.”She added: “Pilots don’t only do medical testing. We do psychoanalysis testing. Pilots are calm. It’s in our nature. If a bad situation occurs we need to be able to handle it quickly and efficiently.“They’re not faking the voice, that’s their personality and how they are. That’s why they’re pilots.”Of her own journey she said: “Training was loads of hard work. My programme with Oxford was  months. It’s non-stop.“You have to say goodbye to your social le, but what’s  months in the grand scheme of things.“As a pilot, I’m quite happy to be a passenger. We work hard so it’s nice for me to let someone  fly. I’m completely as ease because I know the training the pilots have been through.”Talking of the most challenging manoeuvres she has had to carry out, Alex said: “When we went to Oxford we had to do upset recovery training. “We went into an aerobatic aircraft which is designed to be able to do all sorts of manoeuvres. “They put us into barrel rolls, spiral es. “Because we’re flying the big jets it’s very unlikely they will be able to get into a spiral e because computer systems have protection it wouldn’t let you. “However we always have to think of worst case scenariothese protections failed.”She commented: “In high school my strong subjects were maths and physics, when it comes to the theory behind flying I didn’t find it too overwhelming.“To get to spin an aircraft is a lot of fun. I feel like I’m in the red arrows.“I’ve been in planes from a young age. “It’s second nature to me, I don’t even flinch at it.”But what of those people who more than flinch at the prospect of air travel Alex said: “EasyJet actually do have a programme from Luton once a year where they take nervous fliers up on a free flight. “They have two pilots up front and two pilots in the cabin with the passengers explaining to them step-by-step from the take off to the landing what is happening and what are the noises you hear.“I can promise you this,it was completely dangerous I wouldn’t be doing it every day. “I think it’s fear of the unknown that makes people afraid.”Askedthere was training in place to deal with terrorist attacks, Alex said: “We do hijack training. We’re trainedanything were to happen we’re able to send out a squawk code which sends a message directly to Air Traffic Control.“Even everyday stuff – before we push back for the taxi until we get to the gate – the cockpit door is closed and will only be open for examplewe need to go to the bathroom. “We need to call cabin crew and they need to come to guard the doorwe have to leave the cockpit. “We take measures to ensure the cockpit door will not be breached. It’s also bulletproof. They’ve changed everything since  .”She explained how she came to be stationed in Italy: “The reason why I’m in Venice is because I met an Italian called Edgar during the training.”Alex and Edgar, , who is from Milan, soon became an item.She said: “Towards the end of our course we were able to say where we wanted to go. Edgar and I said we don’t mind where we’re placed but we’d like to be together. They put us both in Venice.“I’m still struggling a bit with the language – Italian has a lot of grammar in it. To get by I know the basics. It’s great to have an Italian speaker with me, in Italy a lot of places are remote and they don’t speak English.”Asked how much they see of each other, Alex said: “For the first year with EasyJet you’re on a flexi-roster so you can be working for three days then have two days off. “Sometimes we’re on completely opposite shts. He could be starting at am and I can be on lates working pm to midnight. Sometimes we’ll just see each other in the crew room, say hello and that’s it. “Some weeks you pass each other but others we get time off together when we can do whatever we want. It’s part of the job.”Alex said she also tried to go back to Waringstown as much as possible to visit relatives."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8658944.1538772078!/image/image.jpg","title":"northern

Cindy Greer Her son Aaron Greersaid: “My mum was the rock of the family. We all depended on her. “I think we all feel a bit lost right now. To have the person you have always depended upon taken away from you so suddenly, it is dficult to deal with. “She was the most amazing, inspirational person in my le. It is so hard to put into words what she meant to us. “This was always a happy house. I have such good memories because of mum. She brought all of us together. She has two grandchildren and loved them to pieces. The family was mum’s big love. Any excuse for a family gathering to bring us all together. Christmas dinner was always here with everyone around the table.”Her mum Joan Newell is simply heartbroken. She said she couldn’t imagine never seeing her eldest daughter Cindy again. “I just love her so much. She was always there for me and did whatever she could to make my le better.“She was such a rock in this family. She phoned me last Wednesday after she had been talking to Alan. I asked herwe would see her that night but she had a client coming and she would see me on Thursday afternoon. That was the last we spoke.“I was at a meeting in church on Wednesday night and a couple of people came in late and said there had been a terrible accident. I said ‘God help whoever it is’. Little did I know it was Cindy. I couldn’t take it in when I heard the news.”Her partner of  years Alan McIvor said she was coming from work last Wednesday and phoned him on her hands-free around pm to say she was leaving. “She asked how my day was and she was her usual cheery self.“She said to put the tea on, and I reckoned she would be home about .pm. Sadly she didn’t make it.”Her red Honda Civic had been involved in a collision with a van at around .pm.“Someone stopped at the scene and started CPR then Cindy was resuscitated by paramedics. We are so grateful to them, as this allowed us as a family to spend more time with Cindy.Kneed teenager in head and kicked him on ground Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“We were all there as a family at her beside - everyone had a hand on her as she passed away at .pm on Thursday afternoon,” said Alan.Cindy’s daughter Rachel said: “Mum always said the worst thing a parent could watch was a child go before them. But the worst thing for a child is to lose a mother. There are no words good enough to describe the person my Mummy is or how I feel at this present moment. Even though her fabulous personality shone throughout every part of her and her le, I am going to miss the simple things like goodnight kisses, the constant ‘I love you millions my special girl’ and the hour long chats about our dreams. I am so so privileged to call her my mother and she made sure she gave all of us the most heart-warming special memories that will stay with us a letime.“Her smile, her laugh, her humour, her love will always be with me. I love you millions forever Mum.”Cindy’s sister Julie Newell said she was  years younger than her and for many years took on a motherly role. “That grew into a friendship, sister relationship which was amazing. She was my biggest support. She is the heart of this family. She was the boss as the oldest sister. She took all the decisions for mum and dad as their health isn’t great.”Cindy and her partner Alan had been together for  loving years. Alan firmly believes Cindy made him a better man. “She was a total and utter inspiration and has improved my le. She was just what I needed.“We met when we both worked for the First Trust Bank, although in dferent departments. We enjoyed such brilliant times together - so many things, holidays and weekends away that I have great memories of.“Over the last few days people have said to me that Cindy and I did more in the last  years than a lot of people have done in a letime.“We had outline plans for Cindy’s th birthday in a year and a half and that is something I will have to deal with.“It is absolutely devastating. She was my rock and inspiration to be a better person.” Cindy grew up in Gilford’s Barrack Hill and went to Craigavon Primary School in the town and on to Tandragee Junior High School. She then went to Banbridge Tech.Straight after school she joined the TSB Bank in Lisburn in  later moving to the Lurgan branch. She was in the Banbridge branch for a while but she spent the longest time in the TSB, or First Trust as it became known, in Portadown where she was a Mortgage Sales Advisor.In Lisburn she was a business advisor for the Wallace High School Young Enterprise Team which won the NI Heat of the competition one year.She took early retirement in  and retrained as a professional make-up artist later working for Clarins initially at Debenhams in Rushmere and most recently Boots at Sprucefield.In Cindy’s younger years she was very involved in her local Church of Ireland at Tullylish in the Girls Brigade and as a Sunday School teacher.Her partner Alan said Cindy held strong religious beliefs. Her other sister Tracy McConnell is involved in with a children’s missionary charity called Abaana based in Bangor. Through that charity, Cindy sponsored a little boy called George in Uganda.Cindy’s partner Alan said some of the family will be taking over this sponsorship and that is why the family feel it is appropriate that donations in lieu of flowers are to the Abaana charity c o Milne Funeral Services.The family have been overwhelmed by the huge support and love since Cindy passed away.Her son Aaron said the kindness of everyone has been ‘unbelievable’ with so many gts of flowers, food and cards.“We always knew mum was popular but didn’t realise just how many lives she had touched.“We now know how much she was loved by everyone around her and how much she loved us... we will always love her.”The family also want to thank the wider family circle and friends for their support and kindness, those who attended the accident scene for their assistance and medical intervention, the PSNI Liaison Officer who has been a tower of strength and support to them the ‘absolutely amazing’ hospital staff and consultants at the Royal Victoria Hospital and the funeral director for his compassion and professionalism. Cindy is the dearest partner of Alan, devoted mum of Aaron and Rachel, the cherished daughter of Joan and Richard Newell, treasured sister of Tracy and Julie, mother in law of Hannah, much loved Nanny C of Alfie and Alice. Her funeral is todayat pm in Tullylish Parish Church with committal following in the adjoining graveyard.The funeral dress code is not strictly black.

A second officer with responsibility for Ulster-Scots, sign language and other languages has also been appointed.The posts are jointly funded by Belfast City Council and Foras Na Gaeilge.The announcement was made during an event in City Hall presenting research by Conradh Na Gaeilge and the Committee on the Administration of Justice into how the north’s  councils are complying with their obligations with regard to the Irish language.Speaking at the launch Chief Executive of Belfast City Council Suzanne Wylie said: “I am absolutely delighted to be here today to celebrate the Irish language officers scheme and to welcome our Irish Language Officer Colm Mag Uiginn.“We also have our Irish Language Pfficers from Fermanagh, Omagh, Derry and Strabane here as well. It’s also great to see representatives from the Irish language community here today.“This council, earlier on this year under a dferent Mayor, launcheda five-year language strategy and we are now seeing the practical out-workings of that strategy including the appointment of the Irish Language Officer.“On behalf of myself and the other councils who have benefited from this scheme we thank Foras Na Gaeilge for this initiative.”Ms Wylie added: “Languages are something to be celebrated. Belfast has a close association with the Irish language, many of our place names are taken from Irish language whether it’s Béal Feirste, Bóthar na bhFál or Bóthar na Seanchille, Belfast heritage has got an enduring relationship with the Irish language going down centuries.“I think in many ways Irish speakers in Belfast were pioneers.

On the one side are those who think that an orgy of union jack-waving to the strains of Land of Hope and Glory is an excellent idea on the other side are those with a titter of wit.Squinter can recall two similar Ulsterfests in his letime, both of them when he was a youngster. The most recent one was the queen’s  silver jubilee, when Britain vos celebratink der th anniversary von der coronation von Elizabeth Saxe-Coburg und Gotha. Loyal Ulster being loyal Ulster, it ended up cheering loudest and, West Belfast being West Belfast, we decided to celebrate the auspicious occasion with a non-stop summer of rioting as a result of which Squinter’s right arm remains sore to this day.The earlier one was the rather creepy and sinister ‘Ulster ’’ – a celebration of  years of partition that was held on land between Botanic Park and the Stranmillis Embankment. The idea was hatched in December  by Prime Minister Terence O’Neill: “In that yearNorthern Ireland will celebrate its th anniversary –  years of challenge and dficulty and occasional disappointment, but also  years of splendid achievement, of growing prosperity, of expanding opportunity.”By the summer of , though, when the gates opened to the public, Terry was out on his ear, having been done for by a combination of opposition by UUP hardliners to his limited programme of civil rights reforms and a series of UVF bomb attacks on Belfast’s water supply. He jacked it in in April  and in an interview a month later he revealed the depth of his passion for reform: “It is frightfully hard to explain to Protestants thatyou give Roman Catholics a good job and a good house they will live like Protestants because they will see neighbours with cars and television sets they will refuse to have eighteen children. Buta Roman Catholic is jobless and lives in the most ghastly hovel he will rear eighteen children on National Assistance. If you treat Roman Catholics with due consideration and kindness they will live like Protestants in spite of the authoritative nature of their Church.”Ulster ’ cracked on regardless, although the loss of a man so imbued with the spirit of egalitarianism must have been a crushing blow. An expectant public surged through the gates when the exhibition opened in May for a five month .Looking back at the photographic and filmic evidence that survives, it’s clear that the attractions on the site were, ah, modest, to say the least. Let’s see now… there was a big, multi-coloured plastic model of the Giant’s Causeway over the door of the main indoor space there was, um, a model of a Shorts plane hanging overhead there were fairground ridesthere was a disco with go-go girls a £m satellite was launched containing a message of peace from Ulster to any le forms who may happen across it. .By far the most exciting thing to happen during Ulster ’ was the introduction of internment, which wasn’t technically part of the show although doubtless it was wildly popular with a fair percentage of Ulster ’ attendees and organisers.The last bit of air went out of the balloon when it was finally decided that there would be no royal visit because the safety of the afore-mentioned Saxe-Coburg von Gothas could not be guaranteed.As for posterity, the BBC – normally an enthusiastic booster of Our Wee Country – reported in an article in : “The official government report did not describe it as a success and ultimately it is remembered as a bland effort in self-promotion for a state that was teetering on the brink of implosion.”Which brings us back to Gammonfest – sorry, the Festival of GB and THP. What’s that going to look like on this side of the Irish Sea border in four years time  Well, flags, of course – there’ll be plenty of those. But then there always is, so Ulster’s going to have to do a bit of thinking outside the box here. Marches – ditto. Bonfires – ditto. What about a festival, then  One with a funfair and the Giant’s Causeway and.. and.. never mind, you get the idea. We could call it Ulster ’. Or Catch . Which might make a bit more sense."},{"url":null,"title":"3k for northern ireland man told he was too old for","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitTechJobsAgriBalmoral ShowAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSeptember June CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

In his evidence, which the tribunal accepted, Mr Matier recalled that when he was giving his details to a man at the premises he was asked to state his age. When he replied that he was , he was told: \"I was looking for a younger person who I could train and move upstairs.\" Mr Matier askedthere was any point in continuing the conversation, and was told: \"No, not really.\"He said: \"I had been keen to get this job, and to be told I was too old to even apply for it really shook me. \"I had been off work for a while and I was trying to get back in to work.

It added: \"This had been caused entirely by the behaviour of the respondent and this behaviour was motivated by age discrimination.\"Mr Matiers claim was supported by the Equality Commission.Mary Kitson, senior legal officer at the Equality Commission, said: \"This case is an important reminder to all employers not to make generalised assumptions about people on grounds such as age, which are protected by anti-discrimination law.\"It is unlawful under the Employment Equality Age Regulations of  for any employer to discriminate on grounds of age in the arrangements they make when offering employment.\"The tribunal in its finding noted that Mr Matier \"was, in effect, given no opportunity on the grounds of his age\".

Protectionism and Economic Nationalism’s Impact on the Markets.I know Boris, I don’t think he needs adviceSteve Bannon on Boris JohnsonFacebookTwitterThe US right-winger, who worked on Donald Trump’s successful  presidential election bid but resigned from the White House last year, gave a brief answer when asked about Mr Johnson, someone he is understood to have had contact with during a previous trip to the UK.He said: “I know Boris, I don’t think he needs advice.”Mr Bannon discussed his plans to set up a foundation called The Movement, which he said will have “sophisticated” polling and help to target voters.He said: “I think what the movement and the association is is leaders, parties and countries that want an EU that’s a collection of sovereign nations.”Next year’s European elections will be equivalent in their intensity to an American presidential election, he predicted.“It will be what people are talking about in cafes, it will be what people are talking about at dinner parties,” he said.He also addressed comments made earlier this week by French far-right politician Marine Le Pen who distanced herself from Mr Bannon when she said only Europeans will save the continent from taking orders from the EU, not Americans.Mr Bannon said he is in agreement with Ms Le Pen.“As an American I’m not over here to tell anybody how to run their elections,” he said.Steve

and Europeans have to make the decisions along with the political parties and they also know how to run their own elections.“I think the world of Le Pen, I think the world of the Front National and I think she’s absolutely correct and we discussed this many, many times.“I’m not there to kind of impose some sort of American solution on this.”In March Bannon spoke at Ms Le Pen’s then-named National Front – now National Rally – party congress, which had been aimed at rebranding the far-right group’s image.On Wednesday he also brushed off suggestions of any second Brexit vote, saying such an idea is an example of the “nullication project”.“Democracy works until the global elite start to lose an election and all of a sudden the little guy doesn’t know what he’s voting for,” he said.“This is the perfect example of the real resistance and the nullication project.“You’ve got Brexit and Trump, they’re inexplicably linked, and you’ve had the nullication project from day one, that people didn’t really understand what they were going for.”"},{"url":null,"title":"marcus rashford was a bit sad his mate jesse lingard had to miss england duty","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

Authorities say extremists have ties to foreign terror groups but have given little evidence to support that.Members of Uighur, Kazakh and other Muslim minorities who live abroad say they have not been able to contact relatives in China, while authorities are placing children separated from their detained or exiled parents into dozens of state-run orphanages across Xinjiang.Mr Leibold believes that the revisions are an attempt to deflect international criticism.China has come under increasing pressure from the US and the European Union after a United Nations  confronted Chinese diplomats in August over reports of arbitrary mass detentions and harsh security measures aimed at Muslims.

There are also proposals to build on Strangford Loughrsquos tourism potential.Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin said the local authority was delighted to have reached a key milestone in the development of the Belfast Region City Deal.ldquoWe have in place an investment proposal that focuses on key investment initiatives within our infrastructure, our tourism, our digital connectivity, the skills and education of our people and innovation and digital capability of our businesses, he said.ldquoAs we move through the next stage of negotiations, we will continue to work closely with our partners and stakeholders to ensure that the city deal we secure will deliver on our ambition of a step change in economic performance and more and better jobs for our people.Cllr Murnin said the city deal process had helped to establish what he described as a ldquogenuinely collaborative working relationship across the region and is spearheading a new way of working for councils, the broader public sector, education and business.The local authority and its partners anticipate that an announcement will be made in the forthcoming autumn budget statement, paving the way for them to work up the respective proposals further..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ash shortlisted for music prize  ","story":"THE new album from Ash has been shortlisted for this yearrsquos Northern Ireland Music Prize.Islands was released by Downpatrickrsquos Tim Wheeler, Mark Hamilton and Rick McMurray in May.The event, which will take place on November  at the Ulster Hall, is now in its sixth year and includes theof three categories that formed part of the very first NI Music Awards back in .Over  industry and media cast their vote for the best album of the last  months.

Of particular interest to local readers will be sections on Saul mdash the place of Patrickrsquos landing.Observing the interest of those outside Ireland on St Patrick, John began thinking seriously about his book project five years ago.He said: ldquoSt Patrick is so obviously supported across the world ndash what is it that causes that support ldquoI was brought up outside Downpatrick in Loughinisland. I assumed I knew everything about St Patrick. I wanted to see ndash what do we know about St Patrick  I wanted to go back. I wanted an anthology of peoplersquos writings throughout the centuries, build up a picture of what he was and what he means throughout our history over , years.John said some of his findings were a ldquototal surprise, such as the article by Maureen Donnelly lsquoThe Altar Stone of Saul Abbeyrsquo. This details how the altar stone on which Patrick is said to have celebrated Holy Communion ended up on a wagon owned by a man who wanted it for the doorstep of his new house at the junction of Saul Street and Scotch Street in .

I could not get in the first time as there was a ceremony on. It took me a bit of time to find it. This is one of the earliest and possibly holiest relics in Ireland open to all to see.John said he was also ldquoblown away by a stained-glass window, lsquoPatrick Arrives in Saulrsquo, in Saul Chapel.ldquoThe three windows are designed so the three windows show one image, he explained. ldquoIt is absolutely beautul.John is the author of many books, including The Irish Christmas Book and The Unkindest Cut: A Cartoon History of Ulster -, as well as books on the Irish famine and the United Irishmen.Surrounded by sites linked to our patron saint in Downpatrick, John believes at times we ldquocanrsquot see the woods from the trees.He points to the massive success of less important sites in the south, or how such a historical location would promoted ldquoto the nth degree in the US.ldquoI think that is the challenge for people here today, he said. ldquoThere is so much scope, there really is. I think we lose the wood from the trees. So many stories, so many things to pursue.Interestingly, his research points to an attitude from some in the south of Patrick being a ldquonorthern saint.

Reporting the meetings for the paper was enjoyable, and I remember on one occasion two Councillors had a, er, lively exchange of views and we all held our breath as John Joe McCusker marched down the chamber to confront Jim Lunny.Of course it all ended amicably. The two men, both Nationalists and both with a mischievous sense of humour, were very dferent characters ndash genuine characters and not the fictional types which would tread the boards later at the same venue. I got to know them both and enjoyed their company.Jim Lunny was a great campaigner for retaining townland names, and John Joe fought his corner for his area. I recall them both having a sense of community, and not only would they do their best for Fermanagh in their day, both were also conscious of the need to pass things on to future generations.So they were very supportive of the then Chief Executive, Gerry Burns, a public servant with real vision, when he was the driving force to transform the Ardhowen into the beautul ldquoTheatre by the Lakes. And the architecture-award winning building became the envy of many places at home and abroad.Pardon the clicheacute, but the ldquojewel in the crown was an apt description, but more than just being a beautul building in a beautul setting, the Ardhowen under the dedicated and expert guidance of people like Eamonn Bradley and others, gave a real boost to the arts and entertainment.Enniskillen, and indeed Fermanagh generally, has a fine tradition in amateur drama and itrsquos gratying to see the likes of Adrian Dunbar and Ciaran McMenamin go on to have distinguished careers. About four years ago, I had the pleasure of chairing the Xchange summer school at the Ardhowen when Adrian spoke of his passion for the arts and as a regular visitor to his home town he still boosts the arts here. As does Ciaran, who engaged locals at such events as the film club. The range of activities at the Ardhowen is ied and we are, indeed, fortunate to have such a venue.Itrsquos starting to show its age, though. Even so, I cannot imagine that the people who got the theatre project up and running  years ago would have expected that already the Council is undertaking an exercise to look at the future of the theatre. Some of the options include an upgrade or extension, but worryingly another option is to build another theatre on another site.All this has been well reported by Colm Bradley in this newspaper.The situation has led to a number of people expressing doubts about the future of the Ardhowen, and Fermanagh Film Clubrsquos Jules Caithness wrote about ldquograve concern at the fog of uncertainty over the theatre which he said had been ldquohorribly neglected.The Council attempted to downplay this by saying they have ldquono plans to sell the Ardhowen site.No plans  Whatthey go for the option of a new theatre on a new site  What happens to the Ardhowen site then  Irsquod have preferred a straightforward, no wersquore not selling it. Itrsquos a uniquely beautul site and wersquod be mad to sell it.Irsquom told a meeting was held in August of ldquostakeholders which unsettled some of those present, and that no Councillors were present.Irsquom wondering how the succeeding Councils over the years allowed the building to get into such a state of repair, to the point where they now need to spend a large sum of money.So much money, in fact, that it exceeds the threshold that an ldquoeconomic appraisal is required.Irsquom sure some bean counter will weigh it all up but how do you place on a balance sheet the richness of cultural experience which the Ardhowen has brought to Fermanagh over three decades, and the reputation our centre of excellence has across Ireland In the current climate, I think the way we are governed isnrsquot as ldquoopen and accountable as it should be. There is certainly a massive disconnect between the people and those in authority at Stormont, though one would expect thatany public body would have the ear of the public it would be the local Council.Some decisions have implications for years to come. I still get annoyed when I walk past the old ldquostreets area opposite the police station in Enniskillen and see a lot of public sector buildingswhere once stood a thriving community of people living in homes on the island.OK, housing conditions were awful, but homes should have been built there instead of what the planners did with the area.So, please members of Fermanagh and Omagh District Council, consider carefully what you do with the Ardhowen. Itrsquos not really yours, and itrsquos not totally a matter of money.Part of the problem, apparently, is a lack of car parking. Aside from the fact that this would suggest itrsquos a popular venue, surely itrsquos not beyond the Council to sort that one out There are other problems, of course, and I fully accept that these are stringent times.Butyoursquore looking for feedback, Councillors, mine is that you should recognise what a magnicent asset you have on your hands. Pluck the jewel out of the crown and abandon it at your peril. In fact, find the money, go the whole hog and turn the ldquotheatre by the lakes into an even greater asset which will build on what has already been achieved and be lauded for years to come.Your predecessors, McCusker, Lunny and Burns among other, had the foresight to do that.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Our position hasn’t changed and we don’t expect the Government will change its position.”The DUP has  MPs, although Ian Paisley will not be able to vote in the Commons until November  after being suspended for failing to declare two family holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government.Mrs May, meanwhile, urged MPs across the Commons to act in the national interest and back a Brexit deal amid warnings that “decisive” progress is needed in the negotiations before a crunch Brussels summit next week.Mr Barnier briefed top EU officials behind closed doors at a regular meeting of the College of Commissioners on Wednesday, which also heard European Commission secretary-general Martin Selmayr warn of the need to be prepared for “all outcomes” from Brexit.In Westminster, the Prime Minister urged MPs to do their “duty” to implement the result of the Brexit referendum as she struggled to maintain discipline within the Tory ranks.It was Mrs May’s first appearance in the Commons since last month’s Salzburg summit, when EU leaders told her that her Chequers blueprint for Brexit would not work.She has come under growing pressure from Brexit-backing Tories to drop the plan agreed by the Cabinet at her country residence in July and instead seek a Canada-style free trade deal.But veteran Europhile Tory Kenneth Clarke urged her to ignore hardline Brexiteers and bring forward a deal acceptable to pro-EU MPs on both sides of the Commons.The former chancellor said that would reveal the “hardline Eurosceptic views” of the “Bennites” in the Labour leadership and the “right-wing nationalists” on the Tory benches were in the minority in the Commons. with Simon Calvert of the Christian Institute pictured in Belfast.\"   with Simon Calvert of the Christian Institute pictured in Belfast.\"  IN FULL: Supreme Court ruling in gay cake caseTeenagers accused of murdering Polish man Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Labour has indicated it will oppose a deal based on the Prime Minister’s Chequers plan and will push for a general election or, possibly, a second referendum.Eurosceptic Tories claim dozens of Conservatives are also prepared to vote against a Chequers-style deal.The Prime Minister said: “I would hope that everybody across this whole House will put the national interest first.”She added they should also remember that Parliament gave the British people the decision over Brexit, and following the  referendum result “it is our duty to ensure that we leave”.try catch     .               ..

Lord Hain, the lead signatory to the letter In the letter, which is reproduced in this newspaper , the eight members of the House Of Lords talk of “signicant direct ministerial or parliamentary experience in Northern Ireland”, and saythey are writing in response to the invitation to comment on the consultation on the mooted legacy bodies.“We understand why many victims and others attach great importance to the prosecution, conviction and sentencing of those responsible for the appalling loss they have suffered,” the peers write. “But experience suggests that it would be a mistake to expect that judicial outcome in any but a tiny percentage of the crimes that have not already been dealt with.”The signatories, including the ex-NI secretaries Lord Reid and Lord Murphy, note that the Historical Enquiries Team completed work on , Troubles deaths, of which “only  were referred to the Public Prosecution Service and only three resulted in prosecutions and convictions for murder”.The likely number of prosecutions arising from the proposed Historical Investigations Unit, they add, is “very small”.

A petition has also been sent in to the National Assembly.Many local residents from Penarth, Barry, Cardf and further afield have shared their frustrations over the sediment being dumped off the coast.Penarth man Anthony Slaughter, who is the Cardf and the Vale Green Partyrsquos campaigns officer and also the chairman of Gwyrddio Penarth Greening, said: ldquoWe understand and share local residentsrsquo concerns over the dumping of this potentially hazardous mud in the Severn estuary.ldquoIn addition to any possible risks associated with this waste we are opposed to any action that enables the development of the Hinkley C nuclear power station.ldquoAs the only political party in Wales that is completely and unambiguously opposed to all nuclear power we do not support the plans for either Hinkley C or Wylfa B power stations.Even rock musician and anti-nuclear campaigner Cian Ciaran, who is the keyboard player for the band Super Furry Animals, has come out against the matter.The musician lodged papers at the High Court seeking an injunction to stop the dumping and said that the ldquonuclear establishment cannot be trusted.ldquoAbsence of evidence is not the evidence of absence, and therefore the precautionary principle should dictate a rethink, said Mr Ciaran. ldquoA rethink by our politicians and policy makers to do the right think by its people.ldquoThe implications and consequences of this dredging could be far reaching.South Wales Central AM Neil McEvoy has set up a CrowdFunder page to raise pound, for the protest as he believes there may be a judicial review.He said: ldquoOur initial target of pound, was so that we could carry out an interim injunction in order to temporarily halt the dumping of the Hinkley nuclear reactor mud.ldquoHowever, in order to stop the mud dump for good we will need toto court, which could lead to a judicial review. Judicial reviews are very costly and so extra funding will be required. This will be used for court fees and to put together a strong legal challenge against the mud being dumped in Wales.ldquoIrsquom concerned because I do not believe enough testing has been done. Wersquore talking about mud being dredged from outside a nuclear reactor.Energy company EDF are dredging the mud ahead of building two new nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point C in Somerset. The company said the dredging is necessary ahead of drilling that needs to be done ahead of works for the new reactors.       ,params: .pushEnvironmental watchdog Natural Resources Walesgranted the licence for the dumping and insist that it is safe.A spokesman for NRW said: ldquoEvery element of the application was considered thoroughly including testing of the sediment from the dredge sites by independent experts in accordance with international standards and guidelines, and advice from health experts. The results showed the material was suitable for disposal at sea.ldquoWersquove tried to reassure people that the proposed activity will not harm people or the environment.EDF says the dredging of mud from the seabed off the Hinkley Point C site is necessary ahead of drilling six vertical shafts for the cooling water system for the new nuclear power station.However, those against the dredging say it could pose health risks.Max Wallis of Friends of the Earth, Penarth and Barry said: ldquoThe NRW up to recently stated the EIA for dumping had been covered in the EIA for the jetty development in Somerset, covered by the Environment Agency but this was contradicted by CEFASrsquos statement of , Nevertheless the NRWissued the  license.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water.

As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet this backstop inevitably means Chequers, staying in both, no say in either, and no right to escape.This is an important moment.

Our position hasnrsquot changed and we donrsquot expect the Government will change its position.Mr Barnier told a business audience in Brussels that agreement on a withdrawal deal was ldquowithin reach at the crunch October - summit of the European Council, with ldquo-% of the accord now finalised.But he made clear that the EU envisages a deal involving new customs and regulatory checks on goods travelling from mainland Britain to Northern Ireland, including health and sanitary inspections for % of animals and animal products arriving in ports like Larne and Belfast from the rest of the UK.Mr Barnier said checks would be carried out ldquoin the least intrusive way possible, adding:ldquoI understand why such procedures are politically sensitive but hellip Brexit was not our choice, it is the choice of the UK. Our proposal tries to help the UK in managing the negative fallout of Brexit in Northern Ireland in a way that respects the territorial integrity of the UK.Another busy day in Brussels.

We will not accept anything which separates NI from the rest of the UK. pic GAGuCQySmdash Arlene FosterOctober , The DUP has  MPs, although Ian Paisley will not be able to vote in the Commons until November  after being suspended for failing to declare two family holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government.Downing Street insisted that defeat on the budget would not amount to a vote of no confidence in the Government under the terms of the legislation which provides for fixed-term, five-year parliaments.ldquoThe Fixed-Term Parliaments Act sets out the circumstances for a confidence vote, the Prime Ministerrsquos official spokesman said.Senior Cabinet ministers are to gather in Downing Street on Thursday for the latest in a series of briefings on the state of negotiations, though it is not expected that any fresh decisions will be made at the meeting. The Government has said it will publish revised proposals for the Irish border ldquoin due course.Mrs May, meanwhile, urged MPs across the Commons to act in the national interest and back a Brexit deal amid warnings that ldquodecisive progress is needed in the negotiations before a crunch Brussels summit next week.Mr Barnierbriefed top EU officials behind closed doors at a regular meeting of the College of Commissionerswhich also heard European Commission secretary-general Martin Selmayr warn of the need to be prepared for ldquoall outcomes from Brexit.In Westminster, the Prime Minister urged MPs to do their ldquoduty to implement the result of the Brexit referendum as she struggled to maintain discipline within the Tory ranks.It was Mrs Mayrsquos first appearance in the Commons since last monthrsquos Salzburg summit, when EU leaders told her that her Chequers blueprint for Brexit would not work.\"Theresa May urged MPs to act in the national interest over Brexit at Prime Ministerrsquos Questions She has come under growing pressure from Brexit-backing Tories to drop the plan agreed by the Cabinet at her country residence in July and instead seek a Canada-style free trade deal.But veteran Europhile Tory Kenneth Clarke urged her to ignore hardline Brexiteers and bring forward a deal acceptable to pro-EU MPs on both sides of the Commons.The former chancellor said that would reveal the ldquohardline Eurosceptic views of the ldquoBennites in the Labour leadership and the ldquoright-wing nationalists on the Tory benches were in the minority in the Commons.The Prime Minister said: ldquoIwould hope that everybody across this whole House will put the national interest first.She added they should also remember that Parliament gave the British people the decision over Brexit, and following the  referendum result ldquoit is our duty to ensure that we leave.#TeamJunckerEU today: state of play of #Article negotiations for the withdrawal of United Kingdom information on ongoing preparedness and contingency work #Brexit.

A mother and grandmother, Cindy, who was just , has been described as an ‘inspirational’ figure both to her family, friends and those she mentored.   Cindy Greer Her son Aaron Greersaid: “My mum was the rock of the family. We all depended on her. “I think we all feel a bit lost right now. To have the person you have always depended upon taken away from you so suddenly, it is dficult to deal with. “She was the most amazing, inspirational person in my le. It is so hard to put into words what she meant to us. “This was always a happy house. I have such good memories because of mum. She brought all of us together. She has two grandchildren and loved them to pieces. The family was mum’s big love. Any excuse for a family gathering to bring us all together. Christmas dinner was always here with everyone around the table.”Her mum Joan Newell is simply heartbroken. She said she couldn’t imagine never seeing her eldest daughter Cindy again. “I just love her so much. She was always there for me and did whatever she could to make my le better.“She was such a rock in this family. She phoned me last Wednesday after she had been talking to Alan. I asked herwe would see her that night but she had a client coming and she would see me on Thursday afternoon. That was the last we spoke.“I was at a meeting in church on Wednesday night and a couple of people came in late and said there had been a terrible accident. I said ‘God help whoever it is’. Little did I know it was Cindy. I couldn’t take it in when I heard the news.”Her partner of  years Alan McIvor said she was coming from work last Wednesday and phoned him on her hands-free around pm to say she was leaving. “She asked how my day was and she was her usual cheery self.“She said to put the tea on, and I reckoned she would be home about .pm. Sadly she didn’t make it.”Her red Honda Civic had been involved in a collision with a van at around .pm.“Someone stopped at the scene and started CPR then Cindy was resuscitated by paramedics.

But the worst thing for a child is to lose a mother. There are no words good enough to describe the person my Mummy is or how I feel at this present moment. Even though her fabulous personality shone throughout every part of her and her le, I am going to miss the simple things like goodnight kisses, the constant ‘I love you millions my special girl’ and the hour long chats about our dreams. I am so so privileged to call her my mother and she made sure she gave all of us the most heart-warming special memories that will stay with us a letime.“Her smile, her laugh, her humour, her love will always be with me. I love you millions forever Mum.”Cindy’s sister Julie Newell said she was  years younger than her and for many years took on a motherly role. “That grew into a friendship, sister relationship which was amazing. She was my biggest support. She is the heart of this family. She was the boss as the oldest sister. She took all the decisions for mum and dad as their health isn’t great.”Cindy and her partner Alan had been together for  loving years. Alan firmly believes Cindy made him a better man. “She was a total and utter inspiration and has improved my le. She was just what I needed.“We met when we both worked for the First Trust Bank, although in dferent departments. We enjoyed such brilliant times together - so many things, holidays and weekends away that I have great memories of.“Over the last few days people have said to me that Cindy and I did more in the last  years than a lot of people have done in a letime.“We had outline plans for Cindy’s th birthday in a year and a half and that is something I will have to deal with.“It is absolutely devastating. She was my rock and inspiration to be a better person.” Cindy grew up in Gilford’s Barrack Hill and went to Craigavon Primary School in the town and on to Tandragee Junior High School. She then went to Banbridge Tech.Straight after school she joined the TSB Bank in Lisburn in  later moving to the Lurgan branch. She was in the Banbridge branch for a while but she spent the longest time in the TSB, or First Trust as it became known, in Portadown where she was a Mortgage Sales Advisor.In Lisburn she was a business advisor for the Wallace High School Young Enterprise Team which won the NI Heat of the competition one year.She took early retirement in  and retrained as a professional make-up artist later working for Clarins initially at Debenhams in Rushmere and most recently Boots at Sprucefield.In Cindy’s younger years she was very involved in her local Church of Ireland at Tullylish in the Girls Brigade and as a Sunday School teacher.Her partner Alan said Cindy held strong religious beliefs. Her other sister Tracy McConnell is involved in with a children’s missionary charity called Abaana based in Bangor. Through that charity, Cindy sponsored a little boy called George in Uganda.Cindy’s partner Alan said some of the family will be taking over this sponsorship and that is why the family feel it is appropriate that donations in lieu of flowers are to the Abaana charity c o Milne Funeral Services.The family have been overwhelmed by the huge support and love since Cindy passed away.Her son Aaron said the kindness of everyone has been ‘unbelievable’ with so many gts of flowers, food and cards.“We always knew mum was popular but didn’t realise just how many lives she had touched.“We now know how much she was loved by everyone around her and how much she loved us... we will always love her.”The family also want to thank the wider family circle and friends for their support and kindness, those who attended the accident scene for their assistance and medical intervention, the PSNI Liaison Officer who has been a tower of strength and support to them the ‘absolutely amazing’ hospital staff and consultants at the Royal Victoria Hospital and the funeral director for his compassion and professionalism.

A company linked to Newry man Brian McConville, who runs the successful MJM Group, has submitted plans for the extension and refurbishment of  –  Donegall Square East. The works include a new extension, with plans for commercial use at the basement, ground floor and four floors, and office accommodation on the first to third, fth and sixth. A design statement from architects Hamilton says the design intention is “to remove any unsympathetic additions and alterations within the listed buildings, retain the original plan form of the buildings, and conserve all extant historic features”. That includes ornate cornices, ceiling roses and moulded timbers “all of which survive in relatively good condition throughout the building”. The design document says the “new work within the historic structure will follow conservation principles of maximum retention of historic fabric, minimum intervention, reversibility, honest, clarity and sustainability”. Brian McConville’s MJM Group is one of Northern Ireland’s fastest growing companies. MJM Marine is MJM Group’s main business, based in Newry, and headed by founder Brian McConville. It was set up in  by Mr McConville, and carries out work for many of the world’s top cruise liners, including Star Cruises.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers. Bank of Ireland is sponsor of Catalyst Inc’s Invent competition and is also working with organisations such as the NI Chamber and CBI to showcase and help companies improve skills, digital prowess and scale exports.Another business with a more than two-decade relationship with Bank of Ireland is Pinnacle.And just some of the Sage Platinum Reseller’s top customers include everyone from the Irish Football Associationand Ulster Rugby to Titanic Belfast and Mash Direct.The software partner, which was set up in Belfast in , now boasts a team of more than  experienced providers of Sage business management software solutions, IT services and support.“Going from humble beginnings, the company has grown into a £m business,” Fran McKee, Pinnacle’s marketing director said.The firm, which is headed by founder Ken Montgomery, has been supported by Bank of Ireland through its stages of growth, which has included organic expansion and acquisition. “We have a solid partnership with Bank of Ireland, which has nurtured our business since its inception in .”The firm offers businesses solutions from simple to more complex business needs with Sage. It now has  offices across the UK and Ireland, but according to Fran, there is “massive growth on the agenda”.“We want to be a £m business within the next few years and as well as growing our Sage ision we want to also grow our IT services offering and with the bank’s support we’ll achieve our growth ambitions.  You can come to us as a one-stop-shop for IT and software requirements.“Customers today are very focused on providing a good service as well as achieving their growth ambitions, so they want to have the software in place to help them make decisions and run their businesses effectively.”And Gavin says the key message is that Bank of Ireland is a “proven and consistent funding partner for businesses over a long period of time.”“We work hard to build a great rapport and great trust with our clients and these long term relationships are testament to that. It is exciting to share the journey of young and small businesses to growth and expansion and we’re keen to help the next generation seize new opportunities for their businesses.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Premier.jpg","title":"premier inn looking at two new ni hotels","story":"Posted on Wednesday October  by John Mulgrew Premier Inn is eyeing up opening new hotels in Newry and Enniskillen as it seeks to expand across Northern Ireland, Ulster Business can reveal.The hotel chain, which has seven hotels here, is seeking developer opportunities in the two new locations, alongside growth in Dublin.The company, owned by Whitbread, has said it secured  new hotels in the UK during the last financial year, and has the same aspirations this year.It also says it is looking for “property partners and freehold development sites in Dublin and other major cities” as it seeks to grow Premier Inn across Ireland.Meanwhile, a new report from PwC says hotel prices in Belfast are rising five times faster than the UK average.In June , the average cost of an overnight stay in Belfast was £. but has now grown to £..Belfast is now the fourth most expensive city to stay in the UK, outside London.PwC Northern Ireland partner, Martin Cowie, said: “The influx of high-quality rooms to the market have driven and continue to support improved RevPAR and ADR for the city. “Though the full impact hasn’t been realised with easyHotel and the George Best Hotel yet to open as well as Signature Living’s new hotel at the Crumlin Road courthouse which just received planning permission, demand continues to be driven by inbound tourism, domestic holidays and events.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Pete-2.jpg","title":"in focus peter hannan on beef brexit and business","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Peter Hannan tells John Mulgrew about turning away the big retailers, growing trade by % and that he doesn’t believe Brexit will happen once people see what’s at the edge of the clf Like many in his industry, Peter Hannan is no fan of Brexit.But the top-end beef and red meat supplier also doesn’t think it’s going to happen, given how disastrous the post-Brexit landscape is painted, now that it’s been starkly laid out in front of everyone.The Kildare-born businessman runs Hannan Meats, based in Moira. He’s become something of a star of the Northern Ireland food scene in the last decade – buoyed on by dry-aged beef and an array of the UK’s best and brightest using his produce.He’s aged beef for , days – yes, more than three years – although purely experimental, boosted turnover by around % in the last two or three years, picked up more three-star awards from the Great Taste Awards than almost any other food firm, and now plans to expand into Dublin as his next venture, by the end of the year. Anyone who’s met the Meat Merchant – the moniker given to his retail business in Moira – will know that the -year-old is a personable, larger-than-le character, whose own personality contributes as much to his business and brand, as does his meat.“Our main areas of growth in the last three years have been into the UK, Republic of Ireland and the continent. We haven’t been looking at doing more at home here, because we have a presence, and we think it’s very adequate. We don’t push that, or cold call. We think the clients that we have in Northern Ireland are the best, and we aren’t looking to expand on that.”France is also becoming a growing market for the company, and Pete says business there is growing “very rapidly”.He’s also recently signed a deal to supply all of the Hastings Hotels’ spots.“We have approaches from all sortsover the years,” Pete says. “We are primarily a food service company, so dealing with any of the multiples – doing it a lot more, or not doing it as well has never been on our radar. We’ve had them drive in to the yard here – four suits getting out of a black-windowed car. You are watching on the camera and say ‘oh, that’s somebody’.“Everyone has dferent ideas. We just don’t believe they are the type of partner that we would want. We don’t want to do  tonnes a week of commercial product.”But a few years ago, he did the highest-profile grocer of its kind in the UK – arguably the world.“Five years ago we started to deal with Fortnum  Mason, and they are truly magnicent to deal with,” he said. “That was a turning point because, regardless of what anybody says, the best front window for food in the world is Fortnum  Mason.”According to Pete, business in the five years since the relationship began has increased by ,% – or around  times.What started as a meat wholesale business, blossomed thanks to the success of Hannan Meats’ Himalayan salt-aged Glenarm beef, and has grown into a business with a wide-iety of products – many of which have been done for the first time in NI.Aside from selling lesser-known cuts of beef, such as hanger and rump cap, Pete’s business has ersied into dry-aging lamb, and curing both pork and beef in a sugar-pit – producing hugely flavoured bacon and cured-beef.It doesn’t take long for Pete to start naming some of the greatest chefs which call Hannan Meats their beef supplier. That includes Angela Harrnett and Mark Hix. He was one of the first UK restaurateurs to exclusively use Peter’s dry-aged beef across all of his restaurants – it all started when Pete met Mark outside one of his eateries and gave him an honest retort to whether he had enjoyed his meal. The beef wasn’t up to scratch.But it’s not all just awards, top chefs, suppliers, restaurants and celebrity-backing. Pete says turnover is up around % in the last two to three years – sitting at around £m.“We have lots of other things going on in the background. Taking our next step forward is something we have been considering. We are at a crossroads as to where we take the business next. We are now at a point, do we go forward with the likes of our Meat Merchant , do we take that to a city  Dublin would be next on the radar.”On Brexit, he doesn’t think it’s going to happen – given a clearer image of what le outside the EU could look like.“No doubt, all of us in business have been reluctant to make decisions because there is no clarity,” he said. “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit. We need to go and apologise, and say ‘as we were’ and just get on. It was a hell of a bad idea. It was sold based on rubbish information, and that’s why people made a rubbish decision.“Now that we have a bit of clarity – Theresa May is bringing us to the clf edge, and saying ‘that’s how far down it is – have a look,you tell me to jump, I’ll jump… but we don’t have to’.“This whole thing about immigration. The thing about bringing , people into this country every year needed to be explained to take that issue off the table. If you want your fruit picked,you want doctors and nurses in the NHS, for example...you want any of those things, then let’s put up the barriers.
