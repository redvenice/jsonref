File photoThe remaining 50 all came from restaurants. Although the FSA acknowledged that many of the samples had come from businesses already under suspicion, that number is still disturbingly high.As someone who has written extensively about the food industry for three decades, the revelation does not come as a surprise. I have no doubt that over the next few years, the percentage of meat coming from dubious origins will continue to rise unless something drastic is done — which I fear will never happen.Bring back pub grub! Diners in backlash against...Over a fifth of meat in Britain\u0027s restaurants and...Share this articleThere are two main reasons for my pessimism. First, there is the nature of the meat industry itself, which is a rapacious sector riddled with far too many businesses that are willing to boost their profits by adulterating their products.While all industries and sectors have their rogue elements, I believe there is a systemic problem within the meat industry that makes it particularly attractive to unscrupulous characters who are really nothing more than criminals.The issue is the complexity and length of the meat supply chain. If you buy, say, a chicken-based ready-meal from a supermarket, the meat could have come from as far as Thailand or Brazil. As you might imagine, that chicken will pass through many hands — sometimes literally — before it ends up on the prongs of your fork here in Britain.Worse still, the meat will often be partially processed somewhere along that chain — usually with salt and water added to boost flavour and volume — which is quite legal.          Obviously, it is impossible for consumers to be detectives about every portion of meat they eat However, what you can do is avoid processed foods and never buy ready mealsAt various stages of the process, it is very easy for someone to do something they shouldn\u0027t. With so many possible opportunities to interfere with the product it is enormously difficult to police the problem and, in particular, to identify who is responsible for any contamination.Although it is harder to pass off other meats as chicken, there is no doubt lamb — which is expensive — is often boosted by adding a cheaper meat such as beef, or worse still, horse. And of course, the more meat is processed — such as mincing it — the easier it is to disguise.This sort of activity has all the ethical bankruptcy of the drug dealer who cuts his cocaine with some other white powder in order to boost the quantity of his product and therefore his bottom line. Many will remember the horse meat scandal of five years ago, when many products in British and Irish supermarkets were found to contain horse. In one instance, all the meat in a Findus beef lasagne was found to have come from horses rather than cattle.At the time, the then prime minister, David Cameron, promised to get tough on what he called a \u0027very shocking crime\u0027, but that was little more than fine words. In truth, apart from a few arrests, nothing substantial happened.If anything, things got worse, which brings me to the second part of the problem — the spinelessness of food regulation in this country.           One-hundred-forty-five items out of 665 tested as part of a Food Standards Agency (FSA) report contained animal DNA that was not listed on the packagingIn the past, there was a comprehensive system of monitoring undertaken by the FSA and local Trading Standards officers, who would mount regular inspections of restaurants, takeaways, abattoirs, and indeed any form of food processing plant or food supplier.But that system is in crisis. In 2011, the FSA inspected 2,917 abattoirs and cutting plants. In 2017, it visited just 1,725 — a fall of just over 40 per cent. The FSA says this is because of a cut in funding. If that is indeed the case, then how hollow David Cameron\u0027s words seem today.Anecdotally, I hear FSA inspections are treated almost as a joke by many in the industry. As soon as inspectors arrive at a meat plant, an anodyne announcement will come over the Tannoy, saying something like, \u0027A set of keys has been found next to the drinks machine\u0027. This will be a coded instruction for employees swiftly to hide anything untoward.With fewer and less effective inspections, the FSA is essentially relying on whistleblowers to do its work. It has set up an organisation called the National Food Crime Unit, a new law enforcement agency which was established in the wake of the horse meat scandal. However, its funding appears pitiful, with the FSA board approving a mere £2.1 million for next year.So with inadequate monitoring and enforcement, what can we as consumers do to protect ourselves when we buy meat?The first thing to realise is that this really does matter. Those most obviously affected are followers of religions that prohibit the eating of certain types of meat. There is a serious issue if Hindus who don\u0027t eat beef are being given it instead of lamb, or if Muslims and Jews are being tricked into buying dishes containing pork.If you don\u0027t follow one of these religions then you may not think it a problem that you are accidentally eating a different type of meat. However, believing the tainted meat scandal is something you can safely ignore would be a mistake — there can be no doubt that businesses that tell porkers about their meat will also cut costs with food hygiene and safety.Obviously, it is impossible for consumers to be detectives about every portion of meat they eat — and besides, that would ruin the relaxing fun of going out for a meal.However, what you can do is avoid processed foods. Never buy ready meals. Stay away from burgers made in factories. Don\u0027t go to chain restaurants where the provenance of their meat is all-but impossible to establish.Instead go to local, independent restaurants where it is more likely the chef and owner — often the same person — cares about where the meat comes from, and will be happy to tell you. Try to buy your meat from a good local butcher.And no, what I am suggesting is not going to hurt your purse or wallet. It is a myth that supermarkets and chain restaurants are always better value than their independent competitors. With High Streets around the country struggling, it\u0027s also a great way to support your local community.The essence, then, is to buy meat that has had as small a journey from field to fork as possible, because that is the only way you can be sure of what you eat. It\u0027s that simple. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/05/18/4FB4173500000578-0-image-m-14_1536167841144.jpg","title":"Russian oligarchs living mansions Britain face crackdown dirty money","story":"    Dozens of Russian oligarchs in Britain are set to have their assets seized in the wake of the Salisbury revelations.

He then apologised for this, before repeating the claims this week.During the podcast, Musk was asked what percentage of his interactions with other people on Twitter was a good idea, with Rogan suggesting \u0027ten per cent\u0027.          Shocking: Musk called Vernon Unsworth a paedophile after the British er criticized the Tesla CEOs submarineMusk replied that \u0027it\u0027s on balance more good than bad, but there is definitely some bad\u0027. He later added: \u0027It\u0027s way easier to be mean on social media than it is to be mean in person.\u0027  Mr Unsworth, from St Albans in Hertfordshire has, through his lawyer, made it clear that he will be suing Musk over his comments.\u0027Elon Musk´s ongoing campaign of publishing vile and false accusations against Mr. Unsworth is outrageous,\u0027 Unsworth\u0027s lawyer, L. Lin Wood, said in an email to Reuters.\u0027Musk has publicly and clearly stated that he `hopes´ to be sued. Let me be equally clear in response - Musk will be sued - not because of his hopes, but because he deserves to be sued,\u0027 Wood said. Musk\u0027s renewed attack on Mr Unsworth, his appearance on the show and his top accountant resigning on Friday saw Tesla\u0027s stock and bond prices drop even further today.During the podcast, Musk revealed that the one thing that keeps him up at night is his electrical car company.\u0027Its quite hard to run companies. Especially car companies. It\u0027s quite challenging. Space X is no walk in the park, but it\u0027s very difficult to keep a car company alive.\u0027There is only two car companies in the history of American car companies  that haven\u0027t gone bankrupt and that\u0027s Ford and Tesla. That\u0027s it. We barely survived.Rogan asked him how close Tesla had gotten to \u0027folding\u0027, to which Musk admitted it had been \u0027very close\u0027.  The $1.8 billion high-yield bond Tesla issued a year ago hit a record low price on Wednesday. It also became more expensive to insure Tesla\u0027s bonds against default.Tesla\u0027s stock has lost more than a quarter of its value since August 7, when Musk tweeted that he had secured funding for a previously undisclosed plan to take Tesla private.Musk on  abandoned that plan on August 24, but he faces lawsuits and a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into the factual accuracy of his tweet that funding for the deal was \u0027secured.\u0027The incident is weighing on investor confidence and has hurt the credibility of Musk, long viewed by Tesla supporters as its most valuable asset.A lawsuit was filed on Thursday accusing  Musk of trying to \u0027burn\u0027 short-sellers through his false tweet  that funding had been secured to take Tesla private.\u0027This appears to be a textbook case of fraud,\u0027  Michael Canty of law firm Labaton Sucharow said in a press release.\u0027We believe Musk attempted to manipulate the price of Tesla securities with false and misleading tweets, in a directed effort to harm short-sellers.\u0027Labaton Sucharow is asking for class action status to represent anyone who bought or sold Tesla shares between August 7 and August 17. Musk has described the infamous privatization tweet - including his assurance that funding for going private was secured - as an attempt to be transparent. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/07/09/4FD22D6B00000578-6142257-image-a-18_1536308906232.jpg","title":"Britains biggest puppy Family adopts Great Dane 95lbs stands 6ft tall","story":"     Arnie the Great Dane is only five months old and already tips the scales at 43kg (95lbs) - and is still growing          The canine, who was adopted by Julie (right) and Colin Reid and their son Josh from Stonehouse, South Lanarkshire, is the biggest the team at Dogs Trust in Glasgow have ever cared for          After receiving a call from someone at Dogs Trust, the family went to see the canine and fell in love with himAfter falling in love with the dog, the family decided to adopt him - even though he dwarfs all of them when he stands  on his hind legs.Julie said: \u0027I received a call from someone at Dogs Trust saying Arnie had come in and that he was a Great Dane.Snake catcher teaches her adorable Jack Russell puppy named...Puppy love: lion, tiger and hyena cubs are reared by a...Share this article\u0027We didn\u0027t have a specific breed in mind when looking for a pet but Arnie is the perfect companion.\u0027When we went in to have a look at him and it was just love at first sight.\u0027He is gentle, loving and so playful he will definitely fit in at home, we are just relieved we have a big enough home to accommodate our new baby hippo.

But because of the prices, the returns and the ratio I\u0027ve come out on top and made money from them, which they don\u0027t like.          Mr Sharpe, from Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire, claims he has had his accounts restricted with bet365.com, Ladbrokes, Coral and Paddy Power\u0027Now if I want a selection on the horses and I go for a horse that\u0027s 5-1 and I try and offer bet365 a tenner, the answer is no - maximum stake 33p.\u0027There\u0027s no point in me gambling with them anymore because it\u0027s for pennies and they won\u0027t shut you down completely because they want to show their shareholders that they have this many million users.\u0027Obviously it\u0027s their right to trade with whom they wish but as soon as you start winning, that\u0027s it.\u0027Mr Sharpe opened his account with bet365 closed in June this year, just five months after he opened it. He opened a Paddy Power account online in September only for it to be closed in December. With bet365, he has only won £1,500 over the last year with the single biggest pay-out being a £400 win after he placed £10 on a 33-1 horse.Yet the highest stake he can now place with the bookie is 33p.He believes he is being punished because the company has noticed that he frequently backs the early price for a horse to win before the odds have shortened.By routinely backing horses at 20-1 before the odds shorten, to say 5-1, means that even though he loses more times than he wins, he still makes money in the long-run.          Mr Sharpe is one of a number of punters across the country who have their accounts restricted by bookmakers like Ladbrokes, Coral and others to stop players \u0027who know what they\u0027re doingEstimates suggest that 50,000 of Britain\u0027s 8.5million gamblers have had their accounts restricted in similar ways. They include members of the House of Lords. The limiting of winning players is such a regular part of sports betting in Las Vegas that professional gamblers will intentionally place wagers at less-advantageous odds to stay off the radar.Operators say scrutinising winners is necessary to help prevent fraud - but critics argue that it is damaging the reputation of the gambling industry. It is now becoming increasingly prominent in the UK and is such a concern that the matter has been debated in Parliament.Mr Sharpe conducted a survey among 150 regular gamblers which found that more than half of them had had their accounts restricted by bet365, Paddy Power and Betfair          Mr Sharpe (pictured) had his bet365 account restricted in June after winning £1,000 over four months on greyhound racingAnother gambler, Will Tomassi, 39, from Farnham, Surrey, makes an average profit of between £3,500 a month on betting.He had his bet365 account restricted in June after winning £1,000 over four months on greyhound racing.Mr Tomassi, who works in sales for a medical company, said: \u0027I was going great guns but then they pulled the rug from under me which was extremely annoying.\u0027bet365 are really the only company who offer decent early prices on the dogs and I betted on \u0027match-ups\u0027 which was essentially picking one dog to beat another dog in the race.\u0027I started with a £2 beginning stake, which rose to £15 the more successful I became, but crucially I could roll over my winnings to a second or third race.\u0027So if I did get to a third bet, I could be betting as much as £60.\u0027Since the account was restricted, the most I can place on a bet in match-ups at any one time is £1 so it\u0027s more or less null and void.\u0027I can play a singles game and pick a winner but even then it\u0027s only for small change.\u0027The problem is that if you apply any kind of intelligence or any intent to try and work anything out, they cut you off straight away.\u0027Earlier this year All-Party Parliamentary Betting and Gaming Group held a seminar at the House of Lords to discuss account closures and restrictions by online bookmakers on successful punters.  Estimates suggest that around 50,000 of Britain\u0027s 8.5million gamblers have had their accounts restricted to maximum bets of 33p - or closed as a result of winning too may bets The group\u0027s chairman Philip Davies MP told MailOnline that at least one member of the Lords had had their account restricted but declined to name who.The group is urging the gambling industry to introduce a minimum bet rule – already in place at racecourse bookies – which would require a betting company to lay an advertised price to lose a specified sum, typically £500.Mr Davies said: \u0027I accept that it\u0027s impossible for bookmakers to let punters lay anything they want on because they\u0027d probably go bust in no time.\u0027But there\u0027s a big difference in that and restricting someone to bet only a few pence or a few pounds.\u0027This happens to a lot of people, I know of a member of the House of Lords who has had his account restricted, and I\u0027m sure the industry will say it\u0027s a very small proportion of punters\u0027The whole point of gambling, whichever side of the counter you\u0027re on, is that sometimes you\u0027ll win and sometimes you\u0027ll lose.\u0027That\u0027 the nature of it and I think too many gambling companies have become risk averse and if you want to be risk averse you shouldn\u0027t be in the gambling industry.\u0027Bookmakers have been far too restrictive in the past but credit where credit\u0027s due, they are starting to wake up and are slowly but surely moving in the right direction.\u0027bet365 has yet to make comment however a spokesman for Ladbrokes and Coral, which merged in November 2016, admitted that a small number of their accounts were restricted.A spokesman said: \u0027Over a million people bet regularly with Ladbrokes and Coral in our betting shops, online and via mobile apps, and over 99 per cent of bets are laid as requested.\u0027Only a small minority of our customers experience restrictions on certain bets for risk management purposes, as is the case with all bookmakers.

The company was founded by track-and-field coach Bill Bowerman and a middle-distance runner Phil Knight, from Portland.Business Insider reported that while Knight had planned to call the company Dimension 6, the name Nike was thought of by their first employee Jeff Johnson and comes from the Greek goddess of victory\u0027s name. 1971 was also the year that Bowerman had his first eureka moment while he was making waffles with his wife. Seeing the waffle iron sparked an idea for grooved patterns on the sole of trainers to help athletes grip the tracks while running and it was referred to as the Nike Waffle Trainer, patented in 1974.In addition to this, the iconic Nike swoosh logo was designed by Portland State student Carolyn Davidson for just $35, more than $200 in today’s currency, but she was later given stock that is now worth over $640,000.The Just Do It slogan was inspired by serial killer Gary Gilmore who had said ‘let’s do it’ before he was executed in 1977 by a firing squad. 11 years later, the first Just Do It campaign was launched, featuring Walt Stack, an 80-year-old runner.Nike was also the first company to use a Beatles song  in a TV commercial, their track Revolution featuring in the sporting giant’s 1987 ad for the Air Max shoes.            Colin Kaepernick kneels during the national anthem before an NFL game against the SeahawksNike adAs reported by Time, many have wondered how much Kaepernick’s deal with Nike could be worth, with some sports agents claiming it could be  millions of dollars a year, which would be a unique development considering he does not currently play for a team in the NFL.The Nike ad features the former player with a caption reading: ‘Believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything. #JustDoIt.’ Despite having signed Colin in 2011, Nike had not used him in over two years and the company agreed to an eight-year extension of the deal with the league in March.Gino Fisanotti, Nike’s Vice President of Brand for North America said: \u0027We believe Colin is one of the most inspirational athletes of this generation. We wanted to energize its meaning and introduce Just Do It to a new generation of athletes,’ adding  the campaign was aimed at those who were between 15 and 17.The full advert, which features Kaepernick for 20 seconds, concludes with the quarterback saying: \u0027So don\u0027t just ask if your dreams are crazy, ask if they\u0027re crazy enough.\u0027 The caption at the end flashes: \u0027It\u0027s only crazy until you do it. Just do it.\u0027Nike boycottAfter the Nike advert was released, protesters on social media called for people to burn their Nike sneakers and boycott the retailer after choosing Kaepernick for its signature Just Do It campaign, with shares in the company initially plummeting.In addition to a number of social media users, actor James Woods joined the many who criticised Nike on Twitter, tweeting that he emailed his wealth manager asking him to sell all of his  shares.\u0027Please est my portfolio of all Nike stock in my personal account in and the plan. Henceforth never buy Nike stock for me again.\u0027 He followed up by tweeting out a meme mocking the Nike slogan, saying, \u0027Nike: Just Sold It.\u0027Nike stockDespite Nike stock having an uptick now, after the company released their 30th anniversary Just Do It campaign featuring Colin Kaepernick, shares fell by two percent to $79.01 but have since recovered to $81.13 per share as of approximately 11:26am EST on Friday, September 7.According to CNBC calculations, if one invested $1,000 in 2008, it would now be worth $6,131.47.While it is not clear whether Kaepernick’s inclusion in the advert would affect Nike’s stock in the long term, Managing Director of GlobalData Retail, said: ‘While Nike has been doing relatively well in a sports market that is under pressure, it cannot afford to make bad decisions.‘Anything which has the potential to damage market share, such as overtly political campaigns, should be avoided.’ However, Host of Mad Money Jim Cramer, pointed out that ‘if people think Colin Kaepernick is cool,’ then ‘it’s a win for Nike.’It is estimated that Nike generated $43 million in free advertising through media coverage when the campaign collaboration with Kaepernick was first revealed at the start of the week, despite the backlash.Nike worthAccording to Statista, Nike’s global net income in 2018 amounted to $1.9 billion, which is a significant drop from $4.2 billion last year and what seemed to be a steady growth from 2009 onwards.Forbes reported that Nike was the world\u0027s leading athletic apparel maker and has a brand value of $15.9 billion. In addition to this, it increased its revenue to $24 billion from $16 billion in five years.Nike\u0027s share of the footwear market rose from 14 per cent to 19 per cent during the same period and expanded its presence in international football, as well as professional and college sports.  Prince Harry has worn the same bracelet for 20 years and this is whyFortnite Monopoly: When is it released and how is it different from the traditional board game?Who is Joe Rogan?

I decided to put this into practice with patients referred to me by care homes, and I was astounded by the response of some of them.After only a few days of regular paracetamol, I was able stop all the anti-psychotic drugs prescribed for one lady. Paracetamol became my first-line treatment for agitation in elderly patients.But paracetamol isn’t the answer for everyone. Skilled nursing care is the missing factor in the tragic plight of so many dementia patients.Just because someone is unable to articulate how they are feeling or what is wrong, doesn’t mean they are not communicating.Non-verbal communication and subtle changes in demeanour can provide a wealth of information about the patient — but it takes experience and time spent with them to pick up on this.I was once called to see an elderly man with dementia in a nursing home. ‘I don’t know what it is, but I’m sure there’s a problem,’ his nurse said. He knelt down and gently took the man’s hand. ‘You can tell from his face. See . . .?’All I saw was an elderly man with his mouth wide open and expressionless eyes, utterly shut off from the world. Then his lip curled very slightly.‘There,’ the nurse said triumphantly. ‘He does that now and again when he’s hungry or thirsty, but he’s been doing it a lot for a few days now’.I wasn’t convinced, but realised the nurse knew his patient so well that he recognised minute, idiosyncratic changes in facial expression indicating a problem.However, after examining the patient I could find nothing wrong. The nurse continued to insist the opposite was true, so I arranged for the man to be admitted to hospital for a full investigation.He was subsequently diagnosed with a urinary tract infection that had spread to his kidneys — and which must have been causing him acute pain. But thanks to his relationship with an empathetic nurse he didn’t have to sit there and suffer for long.Sadly, this type of patientnurse relationship is all too rare in the modern NHS and even in many care homes because of staff shortages, high turnover and a pressured environment.As a result society’s most vulnerable must suffer in silence.    DUMBING DOWN JUST WON\u0027T WORKThe Academy of Medical Royal Colleges has had a brainwave! Patients would be more engaged in their treatment if they were written to in language that avoided medical terminology — rather than copied in on a letter to their GP — after a specialist consultation.I tried it a few years ago but it wasn’t a success. It doubled my workload because I still had to record everything formally in the medical notes rather than rely on a letter to cover everything adequately. Nor did my patients like it. Quite rightly, they seemed to prefer medical professionals communicating with each other about their health, rather than via them in a dumbed-down letter that risked missing key details.Medical terminology and jargon is a language that’s evolved to communicate precise, complex things in as clear and unambiguous way as possible to others who speak that language.Most patients realise receiving a copy of such a letter is a courtesy, but it isn’t intended to explain things to them. That should be done face to face by the doctor during the appointment, and the patient encouraged to ask questions or seek clarification.To me, this interaction is the bedrock of good doctor-patient relationships. Firing off patronising missives to our patients is no substitute.   OLD AGE, NEW TAX!The crisis in social care is not going away. Latest figures from the charity Age UK show 1,000 elderly people are admitted to hospital every day simply due to a lack of adequate social care.I know too well how patients can languish on medical wards, waiting for the social care to be put in place so they can return to their own homes, or for a care home place to be found.It is grossly unfair on patients and puts them at risk of infections and a general deterioration in health: increasingly immobile and lacking the mental stimulation of a non- hospital environment.It is also a shameful waste of much-needed NHS beds. Calling the old and frail ‘bed blockers’ is distasteful, but through no fault of their own that’s what they are. The Government’s social care green paper this autumn will set out plans for addressing this escalating crisis. But the harsh truth is ministers have few options. The system desperately needs more cash and I’m afraid tax-payers must cough up.The alternative is a social care system not fit for purpose, that compromises the efficient functioning of the NHS, denies many the medical care they need and lets down the elderly.I dislike the idea of extra tax, but I dislike even more the idea of inadequate care when I’m old and infirm.A social care tax — ring-fenced so it isn’t subsumed by other expenditure — would let us start building the sort of 21st-century care system expected of the world’s sixth largest economy.If we don’t, then as former Labour leader Neil Kinnock once said (albeit in a very different context): ‘I warn you not to grow old’   WHY DOES THE STIGMA OF HIV STILL LINGER?New cases of HIV are at their lowest level for nearly 20 years. This is in large part due to new therapies, including drugs that prevent someone who is HIV positive passing on the virus.It’s also thanks to PrEp (pre-exposure prophylaxis), a combination of two anti-HIV medicines that are taken daily and which protect someone who may be at high risk of exposure to HIV.It’s a truly seismic shift in the management of a disease that, when I started training to be a doctor in the late Nineties, was still considered a death sentence. Now, men and women infected with HIV and who have access to the best medication can expect to live as long as someone without the virus.Unfortunately, there has been no accompanying shift in public perception of the disease.We still make moral judgments about those who are HIV positive. We still regard infection as some sort of retribution for a debauched or hedonistic life.This contributes to the persistent stigma associated with HIV, and I believe it’s a factor in the significantly higher rates of mental health problems in HIV positive iniduals.For many newly-diagnosed, fear of being ostracised haunts them. So it’s no wonder rates of depression among the HIV positive are nearly ten times higher than in the general public.How sad that, despite incredible scientific advances that have enabled us to conquer HIV, we’ve reached the stage where it is society’s attitude rather than the virus itself that ensures HIV remains a feared diagnosis.  One in four student nurses quits before their course ends, according to new figures. Yet we face a shortfall of 40,000 nurses. It’s an absolute crisis. Nurses are frontline deliverers of care. Without enough, the NHS will collapse. This cannot continue. We can recruit more nurses from overseas — but we also need home-grown nurses, and there IS a simple solution. Abolish tuition fees for nursing degrees, and reinstate the student nurse grant. It would send a clear message that we value our nurses and are grateful for their vocation. If retention rates don’t improve, I fear we will live to regret it. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/08/01/4FDBE4F200000578-0-image-a-18_1536365042407.jpg","title":"Facebook issues apology removing nude Cosmo photos Burt Reynolds tribute posts","story":"    Facebook issued an apology after the above photo from Burt Reynolds\u0027 Cosmo centerfold was removed from tribute posts           Facebook users complained that they were told the image violated community standards on nudity           Facebook automatically flagged the image and then removed it saying it was under review           One user called out Marc Zuckerberg for censoring the Reynold photo but not doing the same for hate speech          The social networking site said in a statement that the photos were mistakenly removed and were being restored On Thursday and Friday, several Facebook users posted status updates venting about the site flagging the image and then removing it from their tribute posts.  \u0027Last night I posted a goodbye post to Burt Reynolds.

File photoThe remaining 50 all came from restaurants. Although the FSA acknowledged that many of the samples had come from businesses already under suspicion, that number is still disturbingly high.As someone who has written extensively about the food industry for three decades, the revelation does not come as a surprise. I have no doubt that over the next few years, the percentage of meat coming from dubious origins will continue to rise unless something drastic is done — which I fear will never happen.Bring back pub grub! Diners in backlash against...Over a fifth of meat in Britain\u0027s restaurants and...Share this articleThere are two main reasons for my pessimism. First, there is the nature of the meat industry itself, which is a rapacious sector riddled with far too many businesses that are willing to boost their profits by adulterating their products.While all industries and sectors have their rogue elements, I believe there is a systemic problem within the meat industry that makes it particularly attractive to unscrupulous characters who are really nothing more than criminals.The issue is the complexity and length of the meat supply chain. If you buy, say, a chicken-based ready-meal from a supermarket, the meat could have come from as far as Thailand or Brazil. As you might imagine, that chicken will pass through many hands — sometimes literally — before it ends up on the prongs of your fork here in Britain.Worse still, the meat will often be partially processed somewhere along that chain — usually with salt and water added to boost flavour and volume — which is quite legal.          Obviously, it is impossible for consumers to be detectives about every portion of meat they eat However, what you can do is avoid processed foods and never buy ready mealsAt various stages of the process, it is very easy for someone to do something they shouldn\u0027t. With so many possible opportunities to interfere with the product it is enormously difficult to police the problem and, in particular, to identify who is responsible for any contamination.Although it is harder to pass off other meats as chicken, there is no doubt lamb — which is expensive — is often boosted by adding a cheaper meat such as beef, or worse still, horse. And of course, the more meat is processed — such as mincing it — the easier it is to disguise.This sort of activity has all the ethical bankruptcy of the drug dealer who cuts his cocaine with some other white powder in order to boost the quantity of his product and therefore his bottom line. Many will remember the horse meat scandal of five years ago, when many products in British and Irish supermarkets were found to contain horse. In one instance, all the meat in a Findus beef lasagne was found to have come from horses rather than cattle.At the time, the then prime minister, David Cameron, promised to get tough on what he called a \u0027very shocking crime\u0027, but that was little more than fine words. In truth, apart from a few arrests, nothing substantial happened.If anything, things got worse, which brings me to the second part of the problem — the spinelessness of food regulation in this country.           One-hundred-forty-five items out of 665 tested as part of a Food Standards Agency (FSA) report contained animal DNA that was not listed on the packagingIn the past, there was a comprehensive system of monitoring undertaken by the FSA and local Trading Standards officers, who would mount regular inspections of restaurants, takeaways, abattoirs, and indeed any form of food processing plant or food supplier.But that system is in crisis. In 2011, the FSA inspected 2,917 abattoirs and cutting plants. In 2017, it visited just 1,725 — a fall of just over 40 per cent. The FSA says this is because of a cut in funding. If that is indeed the case, then how hollow David Cameron\u0027s words seem today.Anecdotally, I hear FSA inspections are treated almost as a joke by many in the industry. As soon as inspectors arrive at a meat plant, an anodyne announcement will come over the Tannoy, saying something like, \u0027A set of keys has been found next to the drinks machine\u0027. This will be a coded instruction for employees swiftly to hide anything untoward.With fewer and less effective inspections, the FSA is essentially relying on whistleblowers to do its work. It has set up an organisation called the National Food Crime Unit, a new law enforcement agency which was established in the wake of the horse meat scandal. However, its funding appears pitiful, with the FSA board approving a mere £2.1 million for next year.So with inadequate monitoring and enforcement, what can we as consumers do to protect ourselves when we buy meat?The first thing to realise is that this really does matter. Those most obviously affected are followers of religions that prohibit the eating of certain types of meat. There is a serious issue if Hindus who don\u0027t eat beef are being given it instead of lamb, or if Muslims and Jews are being tricked into buying dishes containing pork.If you don\u0027t follow one of these religions then you may not think it a problem that you are accidentally eating a different type of meat. However, believing the tainted meat scandal is something you can safely ignore would be a mistake — there can be no doubt that businesses that tell porkers about their meat will also cut costs with food hygiene and safety.Obviously, it is impossible for consumers to be detectives about every portion of meat they eat — and besides, that would ruin the relaxing fun of going out for a meal.However, what you can do is avoid processed foods. Never buy ready meals. Stay away from burgers made in factories. Don\u0027t go to chain restaurants where the provenance of their meat is all-but impossible to establish.Instead go to local, independent restaurants where it is more likely the chef and owner — often the same person — cares about where the meat comes from, and will be happy to tell you. Try to buy your meat from a good local butcher.And no, what I am suggesting is not going to hurt your purse or wallet. It is a myth that supermarkets and chain restaurants are always better value than their independent competitors. With High Streets around the country struggling, it\u0027s also a great way to support your local community.The essence, then, is to buy meat that has had as small a journey from field to fork as possible, because that is the only way you can be sure of what you eat. It\u0027s that simple. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/05/18/4FB4173500000578-0-image-m-14_1536167841144.jpg","title":"Russian oligarchs living mansions Britain face crackdown dirty money","story":"    Dozens of Russian oligarchs in Britain are set to have their assets seized in the wake of the Salisbury revelations.

Don\u0027t assume someone is mean. It\u0027s easy to demonize people.\u0027Earlier this week, Mr Musk suggested in emails to a BuzzFeed journalist that er Vernon Unsworth was a \u0027child rapist\u0027.Musk also claimed, without providing any evidence, that Mr Unsworth had moved to northern Thailand to take \u0027a child bride who was about 12 years old at the time.\u0027The Tesla CEO\u0027s attacks on  Mr Unsworth, whose efforts were considered crucial to the Thai operation, came after the British er criticized a well-publicized effort by Musk to lend a custom-built mini-submarine to the cave rescue effort.Mr Musk responded on Twitter with comments strongly implying that the Briton was a pedophile. He then apologised for this, before repeating the claims this week.During the podcast, Musk was asked what percentage of his interactions with other people on Twitter was a good idea, with Rogan suggesting \u0027ten per cent\u0027.

Let me be equally clear in response - Musk will be sued - not because of his hopes, but because he deserves to be sued,\u0027 Wood said. Musk\u0027s renewed attack on Mr Unsworth, his appearance on the show and his top accountant resigning on Friday saw Tesla\u0027s stock and bond prices drop even further today.During the podcast, Musk revealed that the one thing that keeps him up at night is his electrical car company.\u0027Its quite hard to run companies. Especially car companies. It\u0027s quite challenging. Space X is no walk in the park, but it\u0027s very difficult to keep a car company alive.\u0027There is only two car companies in the history of American car companies  that haven\u0027t gone bankrupt and that\u0027s Ford and Tesla. That\u0027s it. We barely survived.Rogan asked him how close Tesla had gotten to \u0027folding\u0027, to which Musk admitted it had been \u0027very close\u0027.  The $1.8 billion high-yield bond Tesla issued a year ago hit a record low price on Wednesday. It also became more expensive to insure Tesla\u0027s bonds against default.Tesla\u0027s stock has lost more than a quarter of its value since August 7, when Musk tweeted that he had secured funding for a previously undisclosed plan to take Tesla private.Musk on  abandoned that plan on August 24, but he faces lawsuits and a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into the factual accuracy of his tweet that funding for the deal was \u0027secured.\u0027The incident is weighing on investor confidence and has hurt the credibility of Musk, long viewed by Tesla supporters as its most valuable asset.A lawsuit was filed on Thursday accusing  Musk of trying to \u0027burn\u0027 short-sellers through his false tweet  that funding had been secured to take Tesla private.\u0027This appears to be a textbook case of fraud,\u0027  Michael Canty of law firm Labaton Sucharow said in a press release.\u0027We believe Musk attempted to manipulate the price of Tesla securities with false and misleading tweets, in a directed effort to harm short-sellers.\u0027Labaton Sucharow is asking for class action status to represent anyone who bought or sold Tesla shares between August 7 and August 17. Musk has described the infamous privatization tweet - including his assurance that funding for going private was secured - as an attempt to be transparent. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/07/09/4FD22D6B00000578-6142257-image-a-18_1536308906232.jpg","title":"Britains biggest puppy Family adopts Great Dane 95lbs stands 6ft tall","story":"     Arnie the Great Dane is only five months old and already tips the scales at 43kg (95lbs) - and is still growing          The canine, who was adopted by Julie (right) and Colin Reid and their son Josh from Stonehouse, South Lanarkshire, is the biggest the team at Dogs Trust in Glasgow have ever cared for          After receiving a call from someone at Dogs Trust, the family went to see the canine and fell in love with himAfter falling in love with the dog, the family decided to adopt him - even though he dwarfs all of them when he stands  on his hind legs.Julie said: \u0027I received a call from someone at Dogs Trust saying Arnie had come in and that he was a Great Dane.Snake catcher teaches her adorable Jack Russell puppy named...Puppy love: lion, tiger and hyena cubs are reared by a...Share this article\u0027We didn\u0027t have a specific breed in mind when looking for a pet but Arnie is the perfect companion.\u0027When we went in to have a look at him and it was just love at first sight.\u0027He is gentle, loving and so playful he will definitely fit in at home, we are just relieved we have a big enough home to accommodate our new baby hippo.

They don\u0027t like \u0027winners\u0027 basically.\u0027If you complain the customer service team will just say it\u0027s a \u0027trading decision\u0027. It isn\u0027t, it\u0027s the algorithm where they look at your account and go \u0027nope, we\u0027re going to keep losing money to him so effectively shut him down\u0027.\u0027I think taking early prices has a lot to do with it.\u0027When a betting company forms the book they price the horses up initially and adjust the prices down to balance the books based on the volume of bets they get incoming.\u0027If you consistently back a horse at a higher price that it goes on to win at then over time you will come out on top even if more than half your bets lose.\u0027With bet365, for example, if you look at the number of bets I\u0027ve placed with them, more of them have lost. But because of the prices, the returns and the ratio I\u0027ve come out on top and made money from them, which they don\u0027t like.          Mr Sharpe, from Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire, claims he has had his accounts restricted with bet365.com, Ladbrokes, Coral and Paddy Power\u0027Now if I want a selection on the horses and I go for a horse that\u0027s 5-1 and I try and offer bet365 a tenner, the answer is no - maximum stake 33p.\u0027There\u0027s no point in me gambling with them anymore because it\u0027s for pennies and they won\u0027t shut you down completely because they want to show their shareholders that they have this many million users.\u0027Obviously it\u0027s their right to trade with whom they wish but as soon as you start winning, that\u0027s it.\u0027Mr Sharpe opened his account with bet365 closed in June this year, just five months after he opened it. He opened a Paddy Power account online in September only for it to be closed in December. With bet365, he has only won £1,500 over the last year with the single biggest pay-out being a £400 win after he placed £10 on a 33-1 horse.Yet the highest stake he can now place with the bookie is 33p.He believes he is being punished because the company has noticed that he frequently backs the early price for a horse to win before the odds have shortened.By routinely backing horses at 20-1 before the odds shorten, to say 5-1, means that even though he loses more times than he wins, he still makes money in the long-run.          Mr Sharpe is one of a number of punters across the country who have their accounts restricted by bookmakers like Ladbrokes, Coral and others to stop players \u0027who know what they\u0027re doingEstimates suggest that 50,000 of Britain\u0027s 8.5million gamblers have had their accounts restricted in similar ways. They include members of the House of Lords. The limiting of winning players is such a regular part of sports betting in Las Vegas that professional gamblers will intentionally place wagers at less-advantageous odds to stay off the radar.Operators say scrutinising winners is necessary to help prevent fraud - but critics argue that it is damaging the reputation of the gambling industry. It is now becoming increasingly prominent in the UK and is such a concern that the matter has been debated in Parliament.Mr Sharpe conducted a survey among 150 regular gamblers which found that more than half of them had had their accounts restricted by bet365, Paddy Power and Betfair          Mr Sharpe (pictured) had his bet365 account restricted in June after winning £1,000 over four months on greyhound racingAnother gambler, Will Tomassi, 39, from Farnham, Surrey, makes an average profit of between £3,500 a month on betting.He had his bet365 account restricted in June after winning £1,000 over four months on greyhound racing.Mr Tomassi, who works in sales for a medical company, said: \u0027I was going great guns but then they pulled the rug from under me which was extremely annoying.\u0027bet365 are really the only company who offer decent early prices on the dogs and I betted on \u0027match-ups\u0027 which was essentially picking one dog to beat another dog in the race.\u0027I started with a £2 beginning stake, which rose to £15 the more successful I became, but crucially I could roll over my winnings to a second or third race.\u0027So if I did get to a third bet, I could be betting as much as £60.\u0027Since the account was restricted, the most I can place on a bet in match-ups at any one time is £1 so it\u0027s more or less null and void.\u0027I can play a singles game and pick a winner but even then it\u0027s only for small change.\u0027The problem is that if you apply any kind of intelligence or any intent to try and work anything out, they cut you off straight away.\u0027Earlier this year All-Party Parliamentary Betting and Gaming Group held a seminar at the House of Lords to discuss account closures and restrictions by online bookmakers on successful punters.  Estimates suggest that around 50,000 of Britain\u0027s 8.5million gamblers have had their accounts restricted to maximum bets of 33p - or closed as a result of winning too may bets The group\u0027s chairman Philip Davies MP told MailOnline that at least one member of the Lords had had their account restricted but declined to name who.The group is urging the gambling industry to introduce a minimum bet rule – already in place at racecourse bookies – which would require a betting company to lay an advertised price to lose a specified sum, typically £500.Mr Davies said: \u0027I accept that it\u0027s impossible for bookmakers to let punters lay anything they want on because they\u0027d probably go bust in no time.\u0027But there\u0027s a big difference in that and restricting someone to bet only a few pence or a few pounds.\u0027This happens to a lot of people, I know of a member of the House of Lords who has had his account restricted, and I\u0027m sure the industry will say it\u0027s a very small proportion of punters\u0027The whole point of gambling, whichever side of the counter you\u0027re on, is that sometimes you\u0027ll win and sometimes you\u0027ll lose.\u0027That\u0027 the nature of it and I think too many gambling companies have become risk averse and if you want to be risk averse you shouldn\u0027t be in the gambling industry.\u0027Bookmakers have been far too restrictive in the past but credit where credit\u0027s due, they are starting to wake up and are slowly but surely moving in the right direction.\u0027bet365 has yet to make comment however a spokesman for Ladbrokes and Coral, which merged in November 2016, admitted that a small number of their accounts were restricted.A spokesman said: \u0027Over a million people bet regularly with Ladbrokes and Coral in our betting shops, online and via mobile apps, and over 99 per cent of bets are laid as requested.\u0027Only a small minority of our customers experience restrictions on certain bets for risk management purposes, as is the case with all bookmakers. We close very few accounts and a high proportion of these are for responsible gambling or anti-money laundering grounds or because they are duplicate accounts, rather than for trading reasons.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/07/20/4FD8C6B900000578-6143497-image-a-2_1536348980147.jpg","title":"Obama urge Democrats vote citing perilous time U S","story":"    President Barack Obama called for the \u0027restoration of honesty and decency and lawfulness in our government\u0027 and ripped President Donald Trump    Speaking out: Obama acknowledged that he was setting aside \u0027a wise American tradition\u0027 by speaking about his successor in the Oval Office nut said: \u0027This time\u0027s different.\u0027          Student audience: Obama spoke at the University of Illinois where he accepted the Paul H.

We\u0027re supposed to stand up to bullies, not follow them,\u0027 Trump said.  \u0027We\u0027re supposed to stand up to discrimination,\u0027 Obama said. \u0027And we\u0027re sure as heck supposed to stand up clearly and unequivocally to Nazi sympathizers. How hard can that be, saying that Nazis are bad?\u0027 he asked.He was referencing Trump\u0027s comments that there were good people on \u0027both sides\u0027 during the violent clash in Charlottesville last summer. The former rival who saw Trump try to rip up his political legacy then blasted Trump\u0027s own pet project – a border wall – and reigniting the issue of Trump\u0027s failure to release his tax returns. \u0027It did not start with Donald Trump. He is a symptom, not the cause,\u0027 Obama said in a speech that saw his return to the political stage two months before the Mid-term elections.\u0027He\u0027s just capitalizing on resentments that politicians have been fanning for years. A fear and anger that\u0027s rooted in our past but also born out of the enormous upheavals that have taken place in your brief lifetimes,\u0027 Obama said.Urging votes for Democrats in the midterms, he said: \u0027Our democracy depends on it.\u0027 Obama cast Trump, who blasted him during his own campaign and repeatedly questioned his U.S. citizenship, only to seek to dismantle much of his agenda once taking office, as part of a system where the status quo seeks to maintain control.It was a stark contrast to the narrative put forward by Trump, who casts himself as the leader of \u0027forgotten\u0027 Americans battling elites.The former president also joined a liberal critique on the anonymous New York Times op-ed and elements of Bob Woodward\u0027s book that reveal insiders working to thwart Trump by stalling, steering him away from decisions, and even swiping documents off his desk.\u0027The claim that everything will turn out okay because there are people inside the White House who secretly aren\u0027t following the president\u0027s orders – that is not a check,\u0027 Obama said.                             This is not normal.

This is not normal. These are extraordinary times. And they\u0027re dangerous times. But here\u0027s the good news. In two months, we have the chance, not the certainty but the chance, to restore some semblance of sanity to our politics,\u0027 he said to applause. Obama took on Trump\u0027s signature issues, hours after Trump once again assured his own supporters he would force Congress to fund construction of a border wall.\u0027We can\u0027t put up walls around America,\u0027 said Obama.                             I\u0027m sorry, I watched it but I fell asleep.

Trump didn\u0027t do so, saying he would await an audit that was underway. The White House has now cast it as an old issue and hasn\u0027t said they will ever get released. At the same time, special counsel Robert Mueller\u0027s probe has touched on the 2013 Miss Universe pageant that was then owned by Trump and efforts by the Trump Organization in 2015 and 2016 to pursue a Trump Tower Moscow. \u0027We can\u0027t just put walls up all around America.

More often it\u0027s manufactured by the powerful and the privileged who want to keep us ided and keep us angry and keep us cynical because that helps them maintain the status quo, and keep their power, and keep their privilege,\u0027 Obama said. \u0027I know there are Republicans who believe that government should only perform a few minimal functions. But that one of those functions should be making sure nearly 3,000 Americans don\u0027t die in a hurricane and its aftermath,\u0027 he said to applause, referencing the revised death toll in Puerto Rico following the devastating storm last year. Obama, a former community organizer, said he saw a \u0027great awakening\u0027 of activism and cited recent protests. Then he cited a new crop of Democratic candidates, including women and veterans. \u0027We need more women in charge,\u0027 Obama said. He said he was called to speak out \u0027as a fellow citizen.\u0027\u0027I\u0027m here today because this is one of those pivotal moments when every one of us as citizens of the United States need to determine just who we are, what it is that we stand for,\u0027 Obama said. \u0027As a fellow citizen, not as an ex-president, I\u0027m here to deliver a simple message, which is that you need to vote, because our democracy depends on it.\u0027 Trump also sought to energize voters for the off-year election, including those who might be less than inspired by some of the Democratic legislative candidates.

I decided to put this into practice with patients referred to me by care homes, and I was astounded by the response of some of them.After only a few days of regular paracetamol, I was able stop all the anti-psychotic drugs prescribed for one lady. Paracetamol became my first-line treatment for agitation in elderly patients.But paracetamol isn’t the answer for everyone. Skilled nursing care is the missing factor in the tragic plight of so many dementia patients.Just because someone is unable to articulate how they are feeling or what is wrong, doesn’t mean they are not communicating.Non-verbal communication and subtle changes in demeanour can provide a wealth of information about the patient — but it takes experience and time spent with them to pick up on this.I was once called to see an elderly man with dementia in a nursing home. ‘I don’t know what it is, but I’m sure there’s a problem,’ his nurse said. He knelt down and gently took the man’s hand. ‘You can tell from his face. See . . .?’All I saw was an elderly man with his mouth wide open and expressionless eyes, utterly shut off from the world. Then his lip curled very slightly.‘There,’ the nurse said triumphantly. ‘He does that now and again when he’s hungry or thirsty, but he’s been doing it a lot for a few days now’.I wasn’t convinced, but realised the nurse knew his patient so well that he recognised minute, idiosyncratic changes in facial expression indicating a problem.However, after examining the patient I could find nothing wrong. The nurse continued to insist the opposite was true, so I arranged for the man to be admitted to hospital for a full investigation.He was subsequently diagnosed with a urinary tract infection that had spread to his kidneys — and which must have been causing him acute pain. But thanks to his relationship with an empathetic nurse he didn’t have to sit there and suffer for long.Sadly, this type of patientnurse relationship is all too rare in the modern NHS and even in many care homes because of staff shortages, high turnover and a pressured environment.As a result society’s most vulnerable must suffer in silence.    DUMBING DOWN JUST WON\u0027T WORKThe Academy of Medical Royal Colleges has had a brainwave! Patients would be more engaged in their treatment if they were written to in language that avoided medical terminology — rather than copied in on a letter to their GP — after a specialist consultation.I tried it a few years ago but it wasn’t a success. It doubled my workload because I still had to record everything formally in the medical notes rather than rely on a letter to cover everything adequately. Nor did my patients like it. Quite rightly, they seemed to prefer medical professionals communicating with each other about their health, rather than via them in a dumbed-down letter that risked missing key details.Medical terminology and jargon is a language that’s evolved to communicate precise, complex things in as clear and unambiguous way as possible to others who speak that language.Most patients realise receiving a copy of such a letter is a courtesy, but it isn’t intended to explain things to them. That should be done face to face by the doctor during the appointment, and the patient encouraged to ask questions or seek clarification.To me, this interaction is the bedrock of good doctor-patient relationships. Firing off patronising missives to our patients is no substitute.   OLD AGE, NEW TAX!The crisis in social care is not going away. Latest figures from the charity Age UK show 1,000 elderly people are admitted to hospital every day simply due to a lack of adequate social care.I know too well how patients can languish on medical wards, waiting for the social care to be put in place so they can return to their own homes, or for a care home place to be found.It is grossly unfair on patients and puts them at risk of infections and a general deterioration in health: increasingly immobile and lacking the mental stimulation of a non- hospital environment.It is also a shameful waste of much-needed NHS beds. Calling the old and frail ‘bed blockers’ is distasteful, but through no fault of their own that’s what they are. The Government’s social care green paper this autumn will set out plans for addressing this escalating crisis. But the harsh truth is ministers have few options. The system desperately needs more cash and I’m afraid tax-payers must cough up.The alternative is a social care system not fit for purpose, that compromises the efficient functioning of the NHS, denies many the medical care they need and lets down the elderly.I dislike the idea of extra tax, but I dislike even more the idea of inadequate care when I’m old and infirm.A social care tax — ring-fenced so it isn’t subsumed by other expenditure — would let us start building the sort of 21st-century care system expected of the world’s sixth largest economy.If we don’t, then as former Labour leader Neil Kinnock once said (albeit in a very different context): ‘I warn you not to grow old’   WHY DOES THE STIGMA OF HIV STILL LINGER?New cases of HIV are at their lowest level for nearly 20 years. This is in large part due to new therapies, including drugs that prevent someone who is HIV positive passing on the virus.It’s also thanks to PrEp (pre-exposure prophylaxis), a combination of two anti-HIV medicines that are taken daily and which protect someone who may be at high risk of exposure to HIV.It’s a truly seismic shift in the management of a disease that, when I started training to be a doctor in the late Nineties, was still considered a death sentence. Now, men and women infected with HIV and who have access to the best medication can expect to live as long as someone without the virus.Unfortunately, there has been no accompanying shift in public perception of the disease.We still make moral judgments about those who are HIV positive. We still regard infection as some sort of retribution for a debauched or hedonistic life.This contributes to the persistent stigma associated with HIV, and I believe it’s a factor in the significantly higher rates of mental health problems in HIV positive iniduals.For many newly-diagnosed, fear of being ostracised haunts them. So it’s no wonder rates of depression among the HIV positive are nearly ten times higher than in the general public.How sad that, despite incredible scientific advances that have enabled us to conquer HIV, we’ve reached the stage where it is society’s attitude rather than the virus itself that ensures HIV remains a feared diagnosis.  One in four student nurses quits before their course ends, according to new figures. Yet we face a shortfall of 40,000 nurses. It’s an absolute crisis. Nurses are frontline deliverers of care. Without enough, the NHS will collapse. This cannot continue. We can recruit more nurses from overseas — but we also need home-grown nurses, and there IS a simple solution. Abolish tuition fees for nursing degrees, and reinstate the student nurse grant. It would send a clear message that we value our nurses and are grateful for their vocation. If retention rates don’t improve, I fear we will live to regret it. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/08/01/4FDC063100000578-0-image-a-27_1536366423454.jpg","title":"Students need work holidays avoid trapped unpaid work","story":"    Students need to work during the holidays to avoid being trapped in a ‘cycle’ of unpaid internships as graduates, a watchdog chief warnsThose on non-vocational courses and people who have no industry contacts would particularly benefit from work experience, she said.Speaking yesterday at the National Graduate Recruitment Conference, Mrs Dandridge called on universities and employers to improve access to work placements and internships for undergraduates.Facebook is forced to apologize after REMOVING Burt...Three hapless Brits, a French beach at midnight and an...Share this articleShe said: ‘It cannot be right that so many students – especially those in courses with little vocational element and those without the right networks – have no access to good work placements andor holiday internships while they are studying. \u0027This means they are more likely to face a cycle of internships, too often unpaid, after they graduate before they are able to get lasting graduate employment.’ A report by social mobility charity the Sutton Trust earlier this year estimated 40 per cent of around 70,000 internships undertaken a year are unpaid. \u0027With living costs of more than £1,000 a month in London and £800 a month in Manchester, the trust warned this was pushing many ‘less advantaged’ people of out their dream careers.

But on Friday unions representing cabin crew in Italy, Portugal, Belgium, Spain and the Netherlands threatened in a joint letter to extend the summer of industrial action into the autumn.Unions locked in a long-running battle with the airline said they would hold “the biggest strike action the company has ever seen” unless changes were made to their conditions. After a meeting in Rome, unions demanded that staff were given local contracts under local law rather than Irish contracts, which Ryanair uses across its European workforce.They said the strike would take place in the last week of September and that a decision on whether to go ahead would be made by 13 September.“We want to solve this. We don’t want to strike,” said Fernando Gandra, director at Portuguese union SNPVAC. He said the two Italian unions also had pilot members and that the unions would invite pilots and ground staff across Europe to join their cabin crew colleagues in the strike.“The board and management of Ryanair are committed to union recognition, and working constructively with our people and their unions to address their reasonable concerns, as long as this does not alter Ryanair’s low-cost model or our ability to offer low fares to our customers,” Ryanair’s chief people officer Eddie Wilson said in a statement on the Dublin fleet plans.The airline said it had informed 300 pilots and cabin crew in Dublin that their jobs were now safe."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d64c087f982ce1a11fd91b069ecf1376223f8b14/0_252_3648_2189/master/3648.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=498ff30d0af34e1332a880ec35176978","title":"lithuania urges walmart to drop soviet themed shirts","story":"Hammer and sickle symbol is banned in Lithuania, an EU member that was the first republic to secede from the Soviet Union in 1990Lithuania on Friday urged American retail giant Walmart to stop selling T-shirts and hoodies with Soviet hammer and sickle symbols, insisting the image insults victims of often deadly Soviet-era persecution.“We sent a letter to Walmart requesting the withdrawal of products with Soviet symbols and we are still waiting for a reaction,” Lithuanian ambassador to the US Rolandas Krisciunas said.The hammer and sickle symbol is banned in Lithuania, a European Union member of 2.9 million that was the first republic to secede from the Soviet Union as it began to crumble in 1990.The Baltic state’s foreign minister Linas Linkevicius tweeted: “You wouldn’t buy Nazi-themed clothing, would you?“We trust @Walmart’s moral stance \u0026amp call to withdraw products with the symbols of mass murders.”Vilnius estimates more than 50,000 Lithuanians died in camps, prisons and during deportations in 1944-1953, while another 20,000 partisans and supporters were killed in anti-Soviet guerilla fighting.Walmart is selling red-hooded sweatshirts and T-shirts emblazoned with the yellow hammer and sickle symbol over the caption CCCP, which means USSR in the Cyrillic alphabet.Hoodies described as “cool” on Walmart’s website cost $29.95 while the T-shirts go for $18.The Soviet-inspired style has become trendy in recent years as Russian designers make their mark.Walmart did not immediately respond when contacted, but guidelines posted on its website prohibit the sale of products related to “any historical or news event” that could be considered “offensive”.Politicians in neighbouring Baltic states Estonia and Latvia, where people also suffered decades of Soviet occupation, joined the call for the world’s biggest retailer to pull the Soviet-themed merchandise from its shelves.Walmart is present in 28 countries, but not in the Baltic states or other eastern European countries dominated by the former Soviet Union.Lithuania, which joined both the EU and NATO in 2004, was a battleground between Nazi and Soviet troops during the second world war.It was seized by Moscow in 1940 under a secret pact with Adolf Hitler, and within a decade, 300,000 Lithuanians had been deported, mostly to Siberia, or killed in insurgent fighting."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/288110d1658263c21b653cb8771a8aa0ad796294/0_677_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=782d62b917249d979896ee6812d44d15","title":"on the bike path i feel a connection to people your shared spaces","story":"From parks and shops to gyms and cafes,  readers on what their ‘third place’ means to themWith the closure of pubs and nightclubs, libraries and parks suffering under austerity measures, and communities becoming increasingly isolated, we asked you to tell us about your favourite shared space and the value it brings to your life. Responses have been edited for length and clarity.My local park is a haven for me and my two kids. I’ve been going every day since my eldest was six months old – nearly 10 years. As a cash-strapped single mum who works from home part-time, having a free place to go to chat to others while my kids are entertained is precious. I have made fantastic friends with other parents, who are in varying stages of exhaustion – we all leave the park that little bit more relaxed.Very early on some “regulars” formed a pack and we have been tight ever since, watching our kids progress from playing side by side on the swings to forming their own pre-teen cliques. From babies to teens to the tired mums, grandmums and nannies, we have all bonded. (Except the dog walkers, though – there is no mixing of camps there!)Some acquaintances from the park have become my best friends, and have been there during life’s hardest knocks. I will always be grateful to a lady who was unexpectedly the first person I told that I’d just had a miscarriage. I will never forget the comfort she offered, and how she checked in with me afterwards. So few people are comfortable talking about that, but she made me feel less isolated. Faye, SurreyI have recently moved to an area that is nearly exclusively over-55s’ gated communities. I am a solo act the majority of residents are couples in their personal bubbles. If you are not in a couple and your friends are far away, shared spaces may well be your only opportunity to converse with people.There are no coffee shops or public spaces here aside from the library where one can meet engaging people who are also open to casual conversations. It’s become the proverbial emotional safe space for me. Peter Gyfteas, Green Valley, ArizonaOn the bike path I feel connection to people I will probably never meet. On my daily commute teenagers step aside to let me pass, a pedestrian grimaces sympathetically as I pant uphill, I wave as I carefully overtake a child wobbling on their bike, or I slow down until I can safely pass a person in a wheelchair. All races, religions, ages, sexual orientations and gender identities, just sharing the street. And unlike drivers who routinely yell, swear or otherwise harass me, the space is shared with eye contact, a smile and a nod of thanks – recognition of our shared humanity. Caroline, YorkshireResearch conducted by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation in Glasgow uncovered the importance of Tesco in Maryhill as a community hub – I spoke to staff and customers there to try to find out why. Many isolated older people said they were shopping every day or so to break their day up with some human interaction. They highlighted the great kindnesses shown by staff – beyond anything you would call customer service.One customer told us how when her husband became ill, a member of staff from Tesco brought shopping and flowers, and a wheelchair to take her husband out for a walk. When you ask staff if they ever feel risk in approaching customers or of becoming involved in difficult situations, they say they are just doing what anyone would do.I think increasing professionalisation and focus on achieving narrow outcomes in public and voluntary service provision makes those places less welcoming – so not only do we have fewer of them, those we do have are not meeting a simple need of connection. But a day spent at Tesco Maryhill is likely to include shared stories, laughter and quite possibly hugs. Many of the connections I observed there cheered my soul. Zoe Ferguson, Carnegie UK TrustBuses and trains are valuable for my son who is autistic. Unlike, for example, a pub, they are not too noisy and they have a purpose. He can see why he should go on a bus, and during the journey he can sit and watch and listen to other people.For autistic people, shared spaces offer a chance to study how people interact, watch their body language, listen to their tone of voice – aspects of social communication that autistic people find very difficult to master. Shared spaces without too much sensory overload – ie not pubs, nightclubs or noisy cafes – offer a safe and less anxious opportunity to see how the rest of us communicate. Anonymous, BirminghamWhen Sheila and I moved to Denmark 22 years ago we missed the local sociability of English pubs. But here shared spaces are often built into housing developments. An estate or a block of flats often has a community house or room where residents can meet. Local government regulations require that new housing developments contain a proportion of homes with some communal facilities. We have lived for 20 years in a Danish co-housing scheme, where 12 neighbours share a common house, together with a small field with benches, tables, hammocks, and a kids trampoline. We typically eat together twice a week, so you get to cook for about 20 people every four weeks. In the common areas we read newspapers, drink coffee, do fitness, make beer, watch football on TV, and so on.It isn’t a commune – you each still have your private life behind your own front door. But you know that there are friendly people behind all the other front doors if you need someone. In England we lived in places where we didn’t even know the names of most of our neighbours. Here we got to know 11 neighbours in our first week. John Wrench, EsbjergSea Mills is an estate of private and social housing built after the first world war to house an ever-expanding city population. But some areas have few shops and amenities, especially since Bristol city council is keen to shut down our local library.For the past six years we have come together at the community cafe run out of a converted toilet block on council land, mainly by volunteers. There is good coffee and cake and a great welcome. It’s a bit like the village pump – you can find out what’s going on in the area by chatting to other customers and staff. I go at least three times a week, for the sense of community and to share concerns about the area.It is also a way to check up on older, more fragile residents. Gladys is 94 years old and comes in most days. She is phoned up if she doesn’t appear. She has a twin sister in Nottingham, and earlier this year one of the volunteers drove her up there for a visit. The cafe is very much part of Sea Mills now – it is a shared space and the area would much poorer without it. Anonymous, Sea Mills, BristolMy partner and I really get to know the communities we live in at our local Anglican churches. As a gay couple, we’ve experienced only welcome and love there, and this has been especially helpful to me as I’m in the process of moving to the area to be with my partner. It’s given me the chance to talk to people I would not have met otherwise, and begun to connect me up with the area I will be living in.We go to churches in Bagshot and Woking – I’m there three times a week, not only because it satisfies myspiritual side, but because the shared worship and social time connect me powerfully with the people there. The ability to talk to people about real issues in my life has truly been priceless.There have been many moments of joy and also sharing in others’ pain. To lose these would devastate my life. I do not work due to health issues, but this has given me real purpose and structure. I would be immeasurably isolated without it. Kester Gillard, SurreyPerhaps because rock climbing has historically been fairly niche and a magnet for hippies, the culture of climbing gyms encourages openness. With indoor climbing walls opening all over central London, there has been an explosion of climbers in the city, but the chilled-out vibe hasn’t changed. Bouldering has a low barrier to entry – all you need is a pair of climbing shoes and you’re good to go.I always find myself chatting to someone if we are working on the same challenge, sharing tips and tricks – or while resting between attempts. The macho-aggressiveness of the gym doesn’t put me off at the climbing wall, because climbing is so unique to one’s own body. Given that I now climb two to three times a week, it is so important that the gym is social. Part of my experience and love of climbing are the friendships I have made – the improvement to my strength and fitness is secondary.

She is Karen Bradley, actual secretary of state for actual Northern Ireland, and she has granted an interview to Parliament’s The House magazine. “I freely admit,” Karen freely admitted, “that when I started this job, I didn’t understand some of the deep-seated and deep-rooted issues that there are in Northern Ireland. I didn’t understand things like when elections are fought, for example, in Northern Ireland – people who are nationalists don’t vote for unionist parties and vice versa.”For me, I think that quote may be the equivalent of the death blow in Kill Bill. Do you know the one? You get hit just with fingertips, “and then he lets you walk away. But once you’ve taken five steps, your heart explodes in your body, and you fall to the floor, dead.” So with the Northern Ireland secretary’s hot take on Northern Ireland. My mechanism might be shot for good after reading it. I may well be typing my last five steps here.Clearly, it is not simply the initial imbecility of having no clue about the central facts of Northern Irish politics and history, even though you were 28 (TWENTY EIGHT) when the Good Friday agreement was signed. It is also the second imbecility of thinking you should ever mention that in public, much less as delightedly, as Karen did. “It’s when you realise that,” burbled the secretary of state, “that you can then start to understand some of the things that the politicians say and some of the rhetoric.”I mean ... ideally, you would start understanding these things some decades before you were the cabinet minister with operational responsibility for arguably the most highly sensitive region of the United Kingdom. Instead, Karen’s breezy “My Learning Curve” speech casts high office as a remedial scheme for the unreachable outliers of Family Fortunes survey respondents. “We asked 100 people what they imagined were the Ladybird-level facts about Northern Ireland …”Karen’s answer is the type of WTF-ery that allows even Vernon Kay (VERNON KAY) to mug to camera with the practised eyebrow-raise that says: where do they find these quarterwits? It was previously thought that any challenge to Andrea Leadsom’s position as stupidest cabinet minister would have to hail from the mineral or at least vegetable kingdoms. Or be Chris Grayling. But this is quite sensational from Karen, who places herself in the IDS class at a stroke. Theresa May’s decision to appoint her to this government of all the talentless underscores exactly where we are. If you hadn’t already swallowed the red pill, you may safely consider Karen’s interview as your dose. No going back now. The answer to the question “How low is the bar?” is: the bar is in another hemisphere. The bar is orbiting Jupiter. There is no bar.Any bright spots? Well, I see Arron Banks has once again had his bid to sign for the Conservatives knocked back. At this rate, he’s going to notch up more failed medicals than John Hartson.But darker portents attend Karen’s predecessor as the cabinet minister most wantonly and insouciantly unsuited to their job. It’s been a mixed week for Boris Johnson. On the downside for us, Boris has been explicitly backed for the leadership by cruelly miscast kingmaker Jacob Rees-Mogg. On the upside, Johnson’s statement announcing his orce from his wife tees up a series of malarial Love Actually plotlines for when he later – or sooner – gets the keys to No 10. (And if you’re still doubting the heart-exploding inevitability of that scenario, you must have been watching the global upsets of the past two years on tape delay. Everything that can go wrong does. Buy shares in distilleries today.)As for the coveted endorsement from someone Boris would unquestionably have pitied mercilessly at school (they missed being Eton contemporaries by a year), it came in an LBC interview. “Two years ago, in the Conservative party leadership campaign, I supported Boris Johnson, because I thought he would deliver Brexit extraordinarily well,” Rees-Mogg intoned, suggesting he has inherited all his father’s gifts of prophecy. “I haven’t seen anything that would cause me to change my mind on that.” Not anything?! Should have gone to MonocleSavers.Yet Boris is undeniably back. He has never been more back. Perhaps the most striking feature of the immediate period is how people decisively written off as wrong-’uns in the very recent past are emerging again as comparatively attractive prospects. Two years ago, Michael Gove had been deservedly downgraded to a mere Brutus emoji now he’s apparently a leadership contender once more. Outside Westminster, what a pleasure to see Mervyn King given so much airtime this week to sniff about Brexit “chaos”. Is this the same Mervyn King who, as governor of the Bank of England, presided over the first run on a British bank since the 1860s?Perhaps the preposterous inadequates of the past do all seem like elder statespeople now. Others appear so inspired by their accelerated rehabilitation that they are trying to pull off something similar instantly. Take David Davis, who announced this week that he would attend a Leave Means Leave rally in Bolton “as a matter of principle, to ensure Brexit is delivered”.What can you say? Until about 10 minutes ago, David had spent two years as the cabinet minister literally in charge of delivering it. This is like setting fire to a building, running away, then standing outside telling the emergency services how you’d be handling the rescue differently.Expect plenty more auditions for the role of Captain Hindsight in the weeks and months ahead.

Instead, his pain, pills – and professionalism – left me deeply movedIf ever there was proof that fame does not guarantee a lifetime of happiness, then Burt Reynolds offered it up in life-size proportions. In 2015 he came to London to flog his autobiography, But Enough About Me, and I was so excited at the prospect of meeting the star of Smokey and the Bandit and Boogie Nights that I came out of maternity leave three months early to interview him for a  Live event.What other macho man had made more movies examining and undermining masculinity? And what other 70s heartthrob presented all that machismo alongside all that self-doubt? Arguably the biggest star of the 1970s – and still my mental template of how a 20th century playboy looks – I was so excited about meeting him I watched Deliverance twice.No sensible person expects a 79-year-old man to resemble the virile god he was 40 years before. But the gap between the fantasy and the reality that presented itself when I met him on that December night was so devastating I couldn’t speak for a few seconds. Reynolds always was a professional, so he gave it his charming best, doing some obligatory flirting with me, reeling out the anecdotes when the interview started, but the physical evidence was too stark to ignore. Racked by pain from lifelong injuries, he could neither stand up straight nor walk more than five steps without reaching for his pot of pills. These, in turn, made him a little addled, and he stumbled several times as I walked him towards his seat.All interviews are exploitative to some degree, but in my 20 years of being a journalist none felt more so than this. Reynolds had just auctioned off most of his memorabilia and there were rumours of bankruptcy, which he denied. His autobiography was really just a collection of stories about his famous friends from the past – Fred Astaire, Sally Field – and the interview felt less like a celebration of Reynolds’ extraordinary career and more like he was selling his loved ones to stay afloat. Within 10 minutes, Reynolds was crying. “I’m sorry, I wanted this to be fun,” he said helplessly to the audience, trying to be an entertainer to the end.After you’ve interviewed someone it’s almost impossible to separate the person you met from their public persona, and for a few months after the interview I couldn’t even think about Reynolds without feeling almost dizzy with regret and sadness. But after a while the immediate shock of the encounter subsided into something else and what I ultimately realised was this: yes, his end was terrible, and yes, what made it even more painful how much he clearly hated being pitied.But through the pain and the pills Reynolds still came across as, yes, funny, but also thoughtful, intelligent, caring, sensitive and generous. He could still wink and flirt as easily as he could talk and cry. He might have become less than he was, but he was also always more than most people knew."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f07b43aae8df29225f7215d07a87c71e955cae8/0_10_2272_1363/master/2272.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a43a7ecdd2272ae2533140f3d20e48f","title":"uk university professors black minority ethnic","story":"There were 25 black women and 90 black men among 19,000 professors in 2016-17British universities have made little progress in promoting black and other minority ethnic staff to senior positions, according to analysis of equality data.Statistics collated by Advance HE, formerly known as the Equality Challenge Unit charity, show that last year only a small fraction of professors in UK universities were from black and minority ethnic (BME) backgrounds, with women especially poorly represented.In the 2016-17 academic year just 25 black women were recorded as working as professors, out of about 19,000 professors in total. More than 14,000 white men were recorded as professors, while just 90 black men held positions of the same status.The data collected from official sources also showed that BME staff remained more likely than their white peers to be in junior positions, to be less well paid and to be employed on fixed-term rather than permanent contracts.But the report noted some improvements, including a doubling of the number of BME staff in the course of a decade.“Over the past 11 years of producing these reports we have seen small but consistent improvements in a number of equality areas, such as gradual reductions in the average gender and ethnicity pay gaps among academic staff and the narrowing of the BME attainment gap,” said Gary Loke, an Advance HE director.“While this is encouraging, the persistence of these issues and those related to other protected characteristics such as disability, gender reassignment and sexual orientation remind us that there is still a great deal of room for improvement.”However, the gaps varied between ethnic groups, ranging from about five percentage points for Chinese and Indian students compared to white students, to a more than 20-point gap for black students.BME students were more likely to take professional subjects and avoid courses such as history and philosophy. They comprised about one in three students studying law and business, and they were more likely to take science and technology courses than white students.Among all academic staff, a little more than one out of five women earned more than £50,000, compared with more than one in three of their male counterparts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58e09a82b2eec975289b1df02c85c5e6fdbadde6/696_0_1859_1116/master/1859.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd06c53f3352ea3e02b0a4adc3d0611d 700w","title":"the predator review reboot shane black","story":"A refreshingly unrestrained return to the sci-fi franchise balances snappy humor and relentless action with fun if somewhat forgettable resultsOne of the many complaints aimed at Hollywood’s dogged obsession with dusting off old franchises and zapping them back to life is a frustrating insistence on sanitising once adult-targeted films for a broader audience. We’ve seen it with Alien vs Predator, Total Recall, Die Hard 4, Point Break, Terminator: Genisys, all de-fanged for a bigger buck. In Shane Black’s mostly enjoyable revamp of the never-not-gory Predator series, he’s been given no such muzzle (reportedly the result of R-rated Deadpool’s shock box office haul) and if nothing else, we get a film that doesn’t feel hemmed in by studio limitations, a knowing hark back to a less restrictive era of blockbuster cinema.Black, once one of Hollywood’s highest-paid screenwriters whose Lethal Weapon series defined buddy comedies, spent years in the Hollywood wilderness after the commercial failure of his wildly underappreciated Geena Davis-Samuel L Jackson team-up The Long Kiss Goodnight. He returned in 2005 in the director’s seat with slick comic noir Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and has remained both writer and director on his films ever since, rightly retaining control over his work with huge success. For The Predator, he’s directing but co-writes with longtime collaborator Fred Dekker, and the pair have crafted what feels like a franchise rebooter, set up for more chapters dependent on box office success.The film kicks off with a spaceship hurtling to Earth, setting off three separate story strands. The first sees a sniper, played by Logan’s Boyd Holbrook, forced on the run after he witnesses an alien kill his men, sending a package of mysterious otherworldly objects back home to keep them safe. The second sees his son open the package and unwittingly make himself a target. The third focuses on a biologist recruited to help shadowy officials discover more about the crash. All three eventually combine with a bus full of offbeat soldiers and an unlikely group must work together to survive the night.Familiarity swamps The Predator, and not just because we’re returning to a 31-year-old three-film franchise (five if we include the Alien mashups). Black populates his film with recognisable tropes and character types as well a grand throwback score, and there’s a certain charm in his ability to conjure up the past without resorting to pastiche. Black, who also made an appearance in the 1987 original, has entered the franchise with love, and there’s a determination to please fans while also avoiding overly smug fan service.It’s an enjoyably exhausting romp, zipping between forests, shadowy government laboratories and small-town America on Halloween night (Black’s abandoned a Christmas setting for once) without allowing for much of a breath. As he has continued to show in his more recent work, such as Iron Man 3 and 2016’s deliriously entertaining cop comedy The Nice Guys, he’s able to find time outside of the set pieces to skewer audience expectations and gently make jabs at the unavoidable silliness of events. In one of the film’s funniest running jokes, Olivia Munn’s biologist suggests that the name predator is wildly inaccurate and instead, sport hunter would actually make more sense. There’s such a furious procession of jokes that, inevitably, not all of them fly, and at times the miss rate outnumbers the hits quite considerably (“Getting the fuck out of here is my middle name!” stands out as a particular stinker).The action is also relatively nonstop yet despite this, or maybe because of this, the film lacks a genuine jaw-dropper of a set piece. The finale is certainly overstuffed but it’s more of the same, a criticism that could be leveled at a lot of the film with familiarity almost breeding contempt by the end. Black’s efforts are buoyed by a stacked cast who balance both the action and comedy elements with ease, with standouts including Munn, whose strong-willed scientist proves more than a match for the accentuated machismo that surrounds her, and Moonlight’s Trevante Rhodes, showcasing further star appeal as a nicotine-obsessed suicidal soldier.There’s definite fun to be had here and franchise fans will surely appreciate both Black’s nods to the past and his plan for the future but there’s something forgettable about its freneticism, and I struggle to imagine in 31 years if it will be thought of at all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e58389a66a0b29a78223d30a4f5f0e960254ffa/0_78_5269_3160/master/5269.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3fff7aa854be8f7e2b4b5ed97f27cc0","title":"how to eat a blt sandwich","story":"Will we really crave a BLT after Brexit? And if so, should it ever be served it on untoasted bread, with cheese, or cut on the diagonal? How to Eat tackles this transatlantic classicLike boiled eggs, beans on toast or digestive biscuits, the bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich is such an everyday item it is easy to forget that it exists. While “bubble-wraps” and broccoli coffee hog the headlines, the BLT occupies a stolid middle-ground of mass consumption, widely eaten but rarely given much thought. The BLT just is. Yet the subject of this month’s How to Eat  suddenly finds itself in the news.First, the Brexit secretary, Dominic “adequate food” Raab, sought to reassure the public that, post-Brexit, there would be no disruption to food supplies. Britain would still be able to make its beloved BLT, he told reporters (#sunlituplands). It was a curious sandwich for Raab to stake his reputation on, given that the BLT originates in the US (was this a coded come-on to Trump for a trade deal?). And that a man from Danepak then predictably came out to say that, actually, no one could guarantee anything after Brexit, and, in the event of no deal, bacon prices would be likely to shoot up.Raab then had to suffer a second humiliation when a new poll for Warburton’s suggested that, rather than the BLT being a national go-to, it is now a fading 90s’ relic. Despite coming fifth in a survey of Britain’s favourite sandwiches for rival Bird’s Eye as recently as 2016, it was recently reported that the BLT has been usurped by “cosmopolitan” fillings such as brie and cranberry, and “über trendy pulled pork”.This will be news to anyone who considers pulled pork a bit 2015, and brie and cranberry to be the filling of 1995. But the nation has spoken. If the BLT is on the slide (once, it was also Tony Blair’s focus-grouped, carefully triangulated sandwich of choice), perhaps it just needs a little tender loving dictatorial re-examination of how it should be rendered in its most perfect form. In defining what the BLT is, it is important to also stipulate what it is not. It is not a potential party canape. There is no need to reinterpret it as a taco. Every time someone writes a recipe for a bread-free BLT salad, a 200-year-old starter culture dies.If you want to experiment by adding new flavours to a BLT, a vehicle for that already exists. It is called the club sandwich, which, in its cavalier, anything-goes, let-it-all-hang-out second layer, allows you to add chicken, avocado, cheese, pesto, a fried egg or any of the other numerous unsuitable extra ingredients that, through sheer boredom, people suggest adding to this already perfect sandwich. If you need hot sauce on a BLT then, quite simply, you need to stop smoking.Hot. The butter, mayonnaise, tomatoes and lettuce should all be taken from the fridge way in advance. Not just to ensure that they deliver peak flavour (note: in the fridge, the volatile compounds that give tomatoes their pizazz enter a kind of cryogenically suspended inertia), but so that, as they are sandwiched together betwixt hot bacon and golden toast, all the ingredients rapidly achieve a cohesive warmth. A number of now readily melting fats, from the mayo, bacon and butter, should bind the sandwich together as a near-fluid emollient. Is your BLT dripping down your wrists? That is a good thing.For this reason, and many others, the supermarket chiller BLT is an abomination: as cold and lifeless as the automated factory production line it emerged from. In life, no one wants cold bacon.Apparently, sandwich manufacturers know that, in the third week of January, after a period of dieting and self-denial, BLT sales spike. That tells you a lot about the essential appeal of this sandwich. It is a treat. An indulgence. One that, even in the onomatopoeia of its acronym, BLT, implies something unapologetically meaty. Any attempt to “lighten” the BLT – swapping butter for avocado, low-fat mayo, turkey bacon etc – erodes that, irrevocably. If you want low-calorie, you are looking at the wrong sandwich.Beyond the anticipation-sharpening crisp, audio-sensory crunch of the toasted bread (nb: not toast, but lightly toasted bread), the BLT should deliver several distinct but complementary layers, in which the bacon leads. Ingredient ratios are key. For instance, too much bread will muffle the bacon, to which the tomato, lettuce and mayonnaise should offer accents and inflections, rather than directly competing flavours. Think of this, foremost, as a mediated bacon sandwich.The BLT should assert its savoury cured pork character in a way that lingers, as the sweet acidity of the tomatoes, the fresh, lightly vegetal bitterness of the lettuce and the creamy tang of the mayo, play at its edges. The whole thing should meld into a mouthful that – simultaneously umami, acidic, sweet, salty, meaty and clean – does a lot of apparently contradictory things at once in such a way that they aremutually reinforcing.Bread White sliced or, at most, a very lightly malted bread (nothing darker or more worthy), of the best quality you can find or afford. A long-proved, traditional white loaf, soft and strong, is ideal but a decent supermarket sliced-white bread will work fine. Key points: slices should be no more than 1.5cm thick, and do not go down any speciality baguettesourdough boulerye cul-de-sacs. You need a square, plain bread, with a relatively light but durable texture, and one that is not full of holes through which juices will too readily drip.Bacon Most BLT recipes suggest smoked which, if the bacon is of low-quality, is wise – to inject some flavour (albeit often bullish and inelegant). But if you can source some dry-cured Gloucester Old Spot rashers or similar, let that pure porcine flavour shine.The supposed gastronomic schism between those who prefer streaky (cooked to a shattering rigidity) and back bacon in their BLT is a whipped-up media controversy. There is a simple solution to this apparent dilemma: use both. Use two or three layers of bacon (depending on its thickness), in which back bacon, its large collar of fat almost melting away, and hard-bronzed streaky, its fat as crispy as bacon Frazzles, are interleaved to offer a variety of bacon sensations. Under no circumstances slice or crumble the bacon. Its rashers should be left intact.Tomato Cut into roundels of no more than 0.5cm thick. You need a fleshier tomato so its juices do not soak the bread (the often tasteless beefsteak is one option, but experiment). Salt the slices to bring out their flavour.Lettuce Forget flabby, watery iceberg spritzy baby gem is the way to go. Under no circumstances start adding rocket, soft salad leaves or other unwanted foliage – this is not a salad sandwich.The convention of cutting sandwiches into triangular halves is prissy presentational nonsense. Aesthetically, chefs like it because those angles can be artfully arranged on the plate, just as sandwich vendors like to present two fat open-ends to the public. But, gastronomically, it makes no sense. It is almost impossible to fill any sandwich to its very edges, and so those pointed tips on each half of the diagonally-cut sandwich are invariably bereft of filling or, at the very least, make it impossible to take a large, satisfying bite as you would from the middle. Sandwiches should always be cut into two rectangular halves to allow easy entry, whichever way you come at them.Weekend brunch: the BLT is a bit too busy (and salad-y) for breakfast, and, conversely, a little one dimensional at lunch. But, in that weekend bridging zone, where you have the time and inclination to prepare a belter, it is perfect. Simple but not too simple, this super-charged bacon butty delivers a familiar through-line of flavour with just enough complexity to set you thinking appetisingly – like a promising cinema trailer – about the more grownup meals you will eat after midday.In its creamy sweetness, richness and bitterness, coffee mirrors at an angle, the flavours of the BLT. They overlap in a deliciously satisfying way. They are natural partners.So, BLT, how do you eat yours?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11f5b11beae89dfa37733293fdbc8fedeb4471be/0_157_4700_2820/master/4700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33fe887e44d4ff400034367e0e0773c6","title":"womens super league five things to look out for","story":"Chelsea won the league last season and I think they will do it again, with strong competition from Manchester City and Arsenal. City came second last time and, like Chelsea, reached the Champions League semi-finals, but since then Emma Hayes’s team have taken the bigger strides towards identifying where they fell short, which was primarily an issue of squad depth. Knowing the Chelsea manager Emma Hayes relatively well, I think she will want to win everything this campaign despite the retirement of their captain, Katie Chapman. Last season I felt City stalled somewhat, and though they have also brought in players I don’t think they have improved enough to reach the top. Arsenal, going into their first full season under Joe Montemurro, have made strong signings and if they knit together as a unit they should be contenders.Lauren Hemp has done well with England’s youth teams and impressed me a lot at Bristol last season, and having moved to Manchester City could have a big impact this term. City also signed the Belgian striker Tessa Wullaert, who was a runner-up in the Champions League with Wolfsburg last season and is an experienced target player and if they do thrive she will be at the heart of it. The German defender Tabea Kemme is another new arrival, part of the new brigade at Arsenal. Like the men’s team, Arsenal look to play their way out of defence but last season they did not always get it right, and Kemme will add quality and confidence in a key area. There has been a massive turnover of players at Liverpool but it will be interesting to see what impact Neil Redfearn has as manager after the success he enjoyed at Doncaster Belles.What started as an amateur league with a handful of professional players has grown to such an extent that every team is now full-time. There has been so much positive change in only a few years: attendance records are smashed every season, as more people go to better grounds to watch better players on better pitches. For me the key change has been the integration of many women’s teams into men’s clubs. Manchester City started it, giving their women access to the same marketing team, the same social media team and the same training and rehab facilities as the men, and others quickly followed. Now we are attracting fantastic foreign players, allowing our internationals to train with and play against the best in the world and helping our own talent to blossom. In every single team you’ll see young English players. Lauren James at Manchester United is a great example: she’s taking her chance, running the midfield, still only 16.Rachel Brown-Finnis is a BT Sport analyst and will be writing about the WSL for the .

Brazil, for their part, playing their way out of trouble pretty comfortably.66 mins: USA have a free kick wide right, which Acosta is over. It’s a decent ball behind the defence and McKennie darts behind to touch the ball just past the near post, with Brazil looking for an offside. Good delivery, and McKennie could have scored there, with the defence caught flat-footed.64 mins: Weah darts into force a corner as Marquinhos stumbles in his own box, and only just recovers. Trapp’s inswinger is deflected up and into the path of Alisson however, and the latest US set piece comes to nothing. That’s been their most persistent threat tonight, but nothing doing this time.62 mins: Game currently taking place at what I can only describe as “frenetic walking pace”. 60 mins: An hour comes up, with Brazil making their first substitution. Arthur on for Fred. And Costa, who’s been a menace all night comes off to to be replaced by Willian. Which is probably not much consolation to Robinson.58 mins: Twitter has questions, though possibly they were intended for the Kavanaugh hearing:I don’t know. Or I can’t recall. Or could you tell me everyone who works for Hisense on the of-chance I do know, but don’t want to perjure myself?More verifiably, this game has got a little scrappy in the wake of those substitutions.56 mins: Brazil break again after Casemiro robs Yedlin. neymar ends up curling a shot tamely wide from the edge of the boc. And now Arriola and Green come off for Weah and Acosta. Green had done OK with his deliveries into the box. Arriola looked a willing runner but not much more on the night.54 mins: Subs are warming up now, utilizing all the advancements in sports science (Removing bibs! Light jogging! Wandering around talking to each other!). We’ll probably see some changes around the hour mark — maybe seeing Tim Weah for the USA.52 mins: Miazga almost caught out in possession as Neymar darts forward to press him as the last man just inside his own half. Miazga gets the foul, somewhat to his relief.And now Miazga is thwarting Neymar again as the Brazilian picks up a delicious angled pass from Costa to push the ball past Steffen, only for a combination of the keeper’s touch and Miazga’s sprint back to clear the ball off the line as it looks to be trickling in.50 mins: Yedlin surges forward up the right, but fast as he is he’s not in the same class asCosta when he goes on similar missions, as he did in that last break for Brazil.48 mins: Early corner for the US after McKennie’s hold up play sets up a shot from distance for Wood that’s deflected wide. Green’s inswinger is headed clear however and Brazil break at speed. Steffen is forced into a full stretch save as Firmino looks to tap in Fred’s squared ball.Second half about to get under way:Or it will once Brazil finish their slow amble back to the field. Just a reminder that each team is allowed six substitutions tonight.Rai Skrupskis is not impressed: “Not so much a penalty, more of swan e.”Yep. No VAR here tonight. Don’t think slow motion would have been kind to that decision.Looking at the replays of the penalty, by the way, it looked very soft, but it did come in a place on the pitch where the USA had been consistently opened up by Brazil — the right side of the box. Robinson is on a steep learning curve tonight. He’s actually looked decent going forward, but any time Costa has got the ball he’s been running at him with a sense of justified expectation.Dave Sarachan, speaking to the TV crew covering the game, wants his teams to do a lot better in possession. The USA have actually not done badly so far, and could even feel 2-0 is a little harsh for their efforts, but Brazil are currently comfortably seeing them off without ever having to find another gear. Interesting to see how long Sarachan sticks with these starters in the second half before switching emphasis from contesting the game to giving some other players experience.Likewise, will Tite be tempted to move some parts around now his A team have probably taken care of the result? He’s in a curious position. A quarter final World Cup exit was definitely a failure by Brazilian standards, though Belgium had to perform at their peak and ride their luck a little to eliminate the Brazilians. Accordingly the mood around Tite’s Brazil is very different than the one around Dunga’s shellshocked troops when he brought his team to this stadium at around the same stage of this most recent World Cup cycle after the 2014 fiasco. He could afford to loosen things up a little in this one.Half-time thoughts in a moment...45 mins+1: Brooks gets up well but can’t get a clear header. The bal’s recycled well by Green though and McKennie attacks the follow up cross to head just over the bar. We’re into one minute of time added on...45 mins: USA have a free kick on the left side of the box after Robinson is brought down in an advanced position. Can the USA do something before half-time?Neymar stutter steps up, watches Steffen commit, then just carefully rolls the ball into the opposite side of the net. Goal number 58, in his 91st game. He’s not bad is he?Firmino plays a one-two and surges into the box, where he darts between Trapp and Brooks before stumbling to the ground. There’s a pause, and the referee points to the spot...40 mins: Big scramble in the US box as the Brazilians turn on the style. Coutinho hits a cute backheel in the box for the overlapping Neymar, who just slips at the crucial moment, but keeps the move going to initiate a sequence that forces a couple of stops from Steffen. We’ve not seen a lot of that sort of flair from Brazil tonight, but that’s just a little reminder of what they’re capable of.38 mins: Brazil have played well within themselves so far — they’ve looked comfortable for the most part, but rarely overwhelming. USA have done decently too — not overawed, if outmatched.36 mins: Play resumes. Looks like Wood is OK. Can the USA build on that pressure they exerted just then?34 mins: Corner for the US after a crisp attack ends with McKennie’s shot is deflected wide. McKennie’s been playing his way into this game nicely to link up play, after looking anonymous early.And now another corner as Miazga’s header is blocked. And a great chance for McKennie as Brooks’ header deflects into his path from the follow up. He pulls the ball into a shooting position on the edge of the six yard box, but Alisson does well to charge the shot down for another corner. Finally Brazil lift the pressure as there’s a break in play for Wood to retrieve treatment, after taking a possible knock to the head. Best sequence yet for the USA.32 mins: Another moment of torment for Robinson at the hands of Costa — who nutmegs then wriggles clear of the full back before squaring a ball looking for Neymar in the heart of the box. A US foot cuts out the pass, but that was another decent opening for Brazil.30 mins: The half hour comes up with the USA trying to put an attack together by switching the play in Brazil’s half. They look a little incoherent in doing so however, and there’s always the worry about Brazil’s efficient countering opening them up when they’re over-committed.28 mins: Neymar and Firmino almost carve up the USA straight through the middle, but Brooks gets just enough of a touch to slow them up at the crucial moment and eventually Neymar fouls Brooks as he sprints back to shield the ball. That little period os US possession has drifted away for now though, and Brazil are looking more proactive again.26 mins: Scott Bassett sends an email (ask your dad):“I’m finding it a little unpalatable to listen to the commentary on FS1 here in the states and a whole lot better to mute the TV and play Niney The Observer as the audio instead. I wonder what others are using to dull the pain.”I am using the clickety clack of single finger typing and New Jersey catering. Not sure it’s working, Scott.Robinson has to get a decent head in to clear a dangerous looking cross, and does so well, though Casemiro is following up to whack a follow up shot just over the bar.24 mins: The US are doing their best to exert pressure on Brazil, who for their part are content to wait to break the press — clearly liking their odds on any break.22 mins: A little creak in the Brazil defence as Yedlin picks up on a great crossfield ball to run at the right side of the box. A couple of deflected shots have everyone off balance and for a second it looks like the ball is breaking to McKennie on the edge of the box, but the block is already in place by the time his foot connects.Now Yedlin shows up at the other end of the field with a foul on Neymar, who doesn’t like to be fouled.20 mins: Robinson, stretching, does well to get a foot in on Costa as his opposite number looks to go past him again. Better stuff from the USA, as they push into Brazil’s half, but they’ve still come nowhere near threatening Brazil’s goal. In fairness, other than the goal, Brazil have not created any clear chances either.18 mins: USA settling a little again and trying to hold the ball patiently. But a promising spell ends with Paul Arriola picking up the ball wide right and with room to look up, only for the D.C. United player to wildly overhit his cross.16 mins: There’d been a fair amount of speculation about how Weston McKennie might do tonight, but he’s been very, very quiet so far. He shows up in the middle of the Brazil half now, but he’s easily dispossessed by Fred.Miazga’s been at the heart of the action so far though, and he pops up again to get a crucial foot in on Neymar as he tries to force an opening on the edge of the box.14 mins: Half an opportunity for the US as Brooks has a free kick wide left, but his curling cross is always way too close to Alisson. Can the USA find a way into this game having fallen behind. Plan A (thwarting Brazil and stealing a goal on the counter) is out of the window now. Robinson in particular looks like he’s in for a tough evening with Costa running at him.Brazil circulating the ball in US half again and finally Fred tries to poke a final pass through the middle for Neymar, but it’s cut out by Miazga.Brazil try again and this time Costa easily torches Robinson down the right before sending a perfect outsiwnger across Steffen and into the path of Firmino, who touches the ball into the net for an easy goal!10 mins: Robinson missed his kick clearing the free kick, but Brooks got it clear as the ball squirmed dangerously across the box. The Wigan full back has looked a little nervous at the start and the Brazilians are already targeting him.8 mins: Brazil come forward with intent again, looking for a way through the US defensive block, which for now holds firm despite some probing from Coutinho down the left. Now they have a free kick wide left, roughly level with edge of box...6 mins: A little flurry of US possession, but they struggle to work the ball forward, and when they finally do it’s at the expense of Wood fouling Felipe Luis as he contests the ball. 4 mins: The USA’s young midfield runners are doing their best to stick to rotations and harry Brazil in possession, just as they thwarted France in their last friendly. It’ll be a long night to maintain that though.2 mins: Brazil pass the ball around cheerfully among themselves. US players do some earnest chasing to ease themselves into the game, in lieu of having the ball. Hosts trying to do some pressing in the early stages, but Brazil carve a way through early to get Neymar one on one with Miazge in the US box. Miazga stays on his feet and a scuffled block snuffs out the danger, but the pass from Coutinho to start that move opened up the USA in worrying fashion.Make that kick off at 8.07pmThey’re just playing with coins in the middle of the field for now...get ready though.AnthemsOK, we may actually have a game sometime soon. The teams are out and the anthems are being sung.Personally I feel Nike are missing a trick by not forcing Brazil’s players to always bellow out the anthem in the desperately manic style perfected by the 2014 team, who took unhinged patriotism to a height never touched by any team before or since (though to be fair Maradona gave it his best shot this summer...)The US for their part, have handed anthem duties to a singer-songwriter to mangle in the traditional spirit of all-American rampant inidualism. And he’s doing so in front of a giant Stars and Stripes that covers the whole field.End of an eraDempsey wasn’t the only US international to retire this week. Jermaine Jones retired earlier today. Jones overcame a reputation as a yellow card machine before the 2014 World Cup to be one of the strongest members of the US team at that tournament — scoring a great goal against Portugal along the way. After that he had a decent spell in MLS that tailed off a little at the end with a disappointing period at LA Galaxy, but this announcement’s hardly a surprise. Tale of the tapeIf we’re (freakishly) lucky we might get a repeat of what happened when the two teams first met almost 90 years ago in Rio — when Brazil won a wild game 4-3. another six decades passed before the teams met again, and of course Brazil eliminated the US from their own World Cup in 1994.Brazil are W17 L1 D0 against the USA overall, but that one loss was an infamous one, when the USA beat them 1-0 in the semi-finals of the 1998 Gold Cup thanks to a goalkeeping performance for the ages from Kasey Keller.Campaign for truth and accuracy in head coach appointment timesSo after Jurgen Klinsmann was asked to take his eternal optimism elsewhere and Bruce Arena failed to turn round the USA’s World Cup qualifying campaign, Dave Sarachan has been in charge on an interim basis, but the search for a permanent replacement has been cautious to the point of inertia. A new US Soccer president was elected in spring and eventually a general manager position was created and awarded to Earnie Stewart. And Stewart is now apparently suggesting a coach will be in place “by the end of the year”. He hasn’t specified which year.Kickoff is scheduled for 8.06pm by the way.Campaign for truth and accuracy in kickoff timesIt’s one of the “wonderful” idiosyncrasies of US sports that kickoff times are treated more like the commencement times for a party than a hard and fast appointment on the whistle. So what was supposed to be a 7.30 kickoff when this game was announced has turned into a “7.30 for 8 — maybe later if we do anthems and a snack run. BYOB.”8-ish eastern time should see us underway. Though spare a thought for the spectators navigating the delights of New Jersey traffic and parking as we speak. They’ll be here half way through the second half, in time for the concessions stands to close and to join the two hour line to get back out.Social media is availableI should say that if you’d like to email me at graham.parker@the, you can do that. Or if you’d like to tweet “TREASON?” at me, you can do that too @grahamparkerfc. You can also shout at me in the street. Brazil teamSo this is happening...They do know it’s a friendly, right?On the other hands, ticket prices for this game are rather steep. The US fans look like they’ll be getting their money’s worth...Costa, Firmino and Neymar, ably assisted by Fred, Casemiro and Coutinho, will be running at a US back four of Robinson, Miazga, Brooks and Yedlin. For those reading from the US: It’s fine. Everything’s fine. It’s just a game.Two players who won’t be featuring tonight are Cristian Pulisic — the consensus pick as the future of the USMNT — and Clint Dempsey, who retired on Wednesday after a career that was perhaps never fetishized as much in US soccer circles as that of his contemporary Landon Donovan, but which was arguably conducted at a higher level.Pulisic should be on course to eclipse both Dempsey and Donovan, going by his start for Borussia Dortmund and the US (he was one of the only bright spots of their last World Cup cycle). but he’s going to need to learn to do this, if he’s ever going to be truly great:Tite named a 24 man squad for this intenrational window, 13 of whom played in the 2018 World Cup.Look...you know what happened. Brazil may not have got bounced from the World Cup on home soil by a humiliating scoreline this time round, but a quarter final defeat to Belgium was still a poor World Cup outcome for Neymar et al. And where 2014 at least afforded Neymar some sympathy for the injury that kept him out of the semi-final, 2018...well...Still as a footballing and cultural proposition, Brazil’s fortunes are inextricably tied to Neymar for the forseeable future. He’s just been made permanent captain of the team, and has the chance to start the rebuilding of his international reputation running at a fairly callow US defence tonight.OK, so all present and correct. But no start for Zardes. Instead Bobby Wood gets the job as a lone forager — something he’s made a virtue of doing in his previous national team games.Still waiting on confirmed team news, but here’s the roster for this pair of friendlies for the USA:Interesting to see what Sarachan goes for, particularly in defense. There’ve been a lot of calls for him to start with John Brooks and Matt Miazga, as those two look the most likely to be sustained starters in their positions for much of this cycle. Miazga has made a good start at Nantes to build on the promise he first showed at New York Red Bulls (and which earned him a spot on the asteroid storm of loanees that orbits Chelsea). Funnily enough, the two current center back starters for the Red Bulls, Aaron Long and Tim Parker, are in the roster — though are probably here more for experience than significant game time — though Parker showed well against France and may get another look.Wil Trapp has tended to captain the team when he’s called up and may well do so again tonight, while his Columbus Crew SC team mate Zach Steffen is likely to cement his spot as the future number one choice as goalkeeper. The third member of the Crew SC trio called up for this series may get a start too. Gyassi Zardes has been in fine form since moving from LA, but he’s been something of an enigma as an international — and perhaps won’t have that many more chances to convince coaches he can build on the raw promise he showed as a homegrown player for LA Galaxy.“Evening all — and welcome to the 2026 World Cup final between Brazil and host nation USA...”...Well, we’re in the right place, if not the right year, or right trajectory for at least one of these teams. A pretty full strength Brazil side is in Rutherford, NJ this evening to face a youthful USA team in full-on well-that-was-embarassing-but-let’s-look-to-the-future mode, after their failure to qualify for the 2018 World Cup.The USA will of course be co-hosting the 2026 World Cup with Mexico and Canada, and the home of the New York Giants is mooted to be the host for the final. But that’s probably about it for meaningful glimpses of the future for tonight. We’re in the stage of the World Cup cycle where managers (if they’re in place at all, of which more in a minute) go into the free-jazz experimental mode of starting teams of right-backs stacked on top of each other, in the vague hope that something might stick that’ll be useful when competitive games start up again.By that yardstick, the Brazil squad is a pretty conservative selection (think Nike promotional tour rather than a focus on developing youth), while the US, still under interim coach Dave Sarachan, are PLAYING THEIR KIDS™, and continuing a pattern of challenging friendlies that saw them play France in the final World Cup warm-up game for the eventual winners, and which will continue with a clash with eternal rivals Mexico next week.I’ll be back with team news and the 2023 Kentucky Derby winner in a bit, but for now let’s enjoy this official Lane Just Before You Get to the Hedge on Last Turn Before the Road to Qatar, brought to you in association with FIFA. Graham will be here shortly, in the meantime here’s a little tribute to USMNT legend Clint Dempsey, who retired last week:After Clint Dempsey’s somewhat surprising retirement announcement on Wednesday morning, his place in the overall hierarchy of US Soccer history will be much debated. Who was better, Dempsey or Landon Donovan, the man with whom he will be forever tied on the all-time US men’s goalscoring chart? How do you compare an outfield player with goalkeepers such as Kasey Keller, Brad Friedel and Tim Howard, each of whom also had successful club careers abroad?Rather than setting Dempsey in some kind of fixed hierarchy, however, it’s more helpful to think of him as a mile marker on the longer arc of the growth of soccer in the United States.You can read the full story here:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca916342a840d07e41464b98a37ba74eaccbd011/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f66a5b1472c6986815a75c52b2822bf9","title":"palau against china the tiny island defying the worlds biggest country","story":"Archipelago is refusing to switch diplomatic allegiance from Taiwan to China, despite a huge downturn in its tourism industryby  Kate Lyons in KororWearing a Hawaiian shirt and sipping an iced tea, Ongerung Kambes Kesolei sits at a veranda bar overlooking a hotel pool, under fans that slowly push humid air around on a quiet Sunday afternoon.But the calm of the scene is deceptive, for Kesolei is explaining that his small island home of Palau – a dot on the map in the north-west corner of the Pacific with a population of just over 20,000 people – has attracted the ire of one of the world’s most powerful nations and is now at the centre of a geo-political bunfight.Palau is one of just 17 countries that has refused to give up diplomatic relations with Taiwan and switch allegiance to China.Palau, which was under US administration until its independence in 1994, struck up diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1999 after a few years of what Kesolei calls “wooing” from both Beijing and Taipei. The almost 20-year friendship has been strong, with Kesolei saying “every Palauan has a story” of interaction with Taiwan, whether travelling there for a holiday, education or medical treatment.But Taiwan’s allies are slowly being chipped away, as China puts the pressure on and seeks to penalise those that recognise self-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing considers a Chinese territory. El Salvador switched its allegiance last month, and Burkina Faso and the Dominican Republic severed ties with Taiwan earlier this year.Those countries that continue to recognise Taiwan – particularly the six Taiwanese allies located in the Pacific, where China is seeking to increase its influence – are feeling the pressure.In November 2017, the Chinese government ordered tour operators to stop selling package tours to Palau, with reports that doing so could lead to fines.Some insist Palau has always been a blacklisted destination but that until recently the Chinese government turned a blind eye.Evan Rees, Asia-Pacific analyst at Stratfor, says China uses such bans – as well as the granting and withholding of Approved Destination Status (ADS) to countries – as “part of a larger toolkit for compelling behaviour”.Last year, South Korea was the subject of such a travel ban, after a row over its deployment of a US missile defence system, which had a devastating impact on tourism to the country during the PyeongChang Winter Olympics. One Palauan-based Chinese businessman said the word “Palau” had also been blocked as an internet search term in China.The impact of the ban on Palau has been stark.The number of tourists from China has plummeted so dramatically that one airline flying charter flights between China and Palau stopped flights at the end of August, because “the Chinese government made Palau an illegal tour destination possibly and most likely due to lack of diplomatic status”.Palauan tour operators and government officials bridle at suggestions the ban has brought Palau to its knees – there were still 9,000 visitor arrivals in July – but occupancy rates at hotels have dropped and businesses are hurting.At Elilai restuarant, which is heavily promoted as the “best restaurant in Palau” on billboards all over the island, I am the sole diner in a restaurant that could comfortably accommodate 50.Waitress Donita Rose Cagaoan-Tipay is apologetic about the empty room, saying it was the result of a “ban from China”, though she says she doesn’t know much more about it than that.“I asked my friend who is a Chinese tour guide, he said Palau and China, the governments are having a fight,” she explains.The empty restaurants are a far cry from 2014 and 2015, when charter flights from China began landing every day each carrying hundreds of tourists.Leilani Reklai says the impact on the island was overwhelming. “Guys were running around town buying land, getting cash in suitcases and buying everything in sight,” says Reklai, who is the president of Palau’s tourism association.Reklai owned two boats that took tour groups to the Rock Islands, the most famous of Palau’s tourist attractions, which before the Chinese boom would go out four days a week during peak season.“But for almost one year my guys were going out seven days a week” she says.“Some people were saying ‘This is the Chinese strategy, this is what they do, they are going to pour a lot of money in here, and get you addicted like it’s Coke and then turn off the faucet’. But of course, money was louder so people weren’t listening,” says Reklai.At 70, Francis Toribiong has had almost every job in the tourism business. He says the dip hurt “everybody”. Toribiong has been forced to sell a 25-bed hostel but says he got off relatively lightly.“There are so many young men who went to the development bank and borrowed hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy boats,” he says. Now, demand has dropped so much that they are lucky if they are able to make enough to cover fuel and the loan repayments.Despite the pain, most people agree the boom was unsustainable.At its peak in 2015, 169,000 tourists arrived in Palau and the country’s power, water and sewage systems struggled to cope. There was huge inflation, and the price of food and rent skyrocketed.Kevin Mesebeluu, director of the bureau of tourism, says the China ban may be “a blessing in disguise”, giving Palau a chance to reevaluate its approach to tourism.“The president has been very clear about the direction,” he said. “High-value, low-impact sustainable tourism.”Indeed, the country was heading down this path before the ban came into effect. In 2015, Palau’s president, Tommy Remengesau, announced a reduction in the number of charter flights between China and Palau, in response to environmental and social concerns.Reklani thinks this decision, which came into effect gradually, means Palau escaped much more serious financial trouble. “We definitely got out in time, this pain we’re going through, it would have been so much worse,” she says.Since the China ban, Remengesau has reiterated his commitment to Taiwan, telling the Nikkei Asian Review that while China was an “important partner” Palau had “more in common with Taiwan”.A statement from his spokesperson was even more defiant, suggesting Palau would not bow to pressure: “Palau is a country of laws, it is a democracy and we make our own decisions.”However, there are others who would not mind seeing Palau switch diplomatic horses.“It’s about time that we focus our interests and views towards the People’s Republic of China,” said Senate president Hokkons Baules in July at the groundbreaking ceremony for a Chinese-backed resort, according to the Island Times.The China-Taiwan question is expected to be a key issue at the next presidential election in 2020. But the Taiwanese ambassador to Palau, Wallace Chow, says he is not worried about the relationship, saying it is “very solid”.Speaking to  during an event for 25 Taiwanese youth ambassadors who are spending several days in Palau as part of a “soft power” mission, Chow says it is this “down-to-earth, to the people, for the people” approach that will keep Palau onside.But Palauans may also be persuaded by the more than $10m in aid provided by Taiwan to the country each year, reminders of which are dotted around the island as signs announce that road or building projects are funded by Taiwanese grant money.“I’m very confident that the Palauan people know who is their true partner and which side their bread is buttered,” said Chow.Under the slowly moving fans, Kesolei says he does not expect a diplomatic switch anytime soon. “It’s part of our culture that we are very loyal to our friends,” he says.Palauans also like the image of themselves as a country that is standing up to a superpower."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7289c288ede69e2e8b85a37244a2db9406187502/0_545_4650_2790/master/4650.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75a884829a07c5ae29ce8dc7ddf9b4ae","title":"should i limit the amount of time my child spends with their mobile phone","story":"Children and parents may not agree on how much screen time is acceptable, but some ground rules about usage and online security will make for a more harmonious householdIt’s an argument virtually every modern parent has had with their child: the battle to prise them away from the mobile phone they’re glued to. For children, a smartphone is a window to games, videos and constant interaction with their friends. But for parents, it can feel like a minefield, raising questions about whether their access should be restricted and how to keep them safe as they learn to navigate the digital world. But who’s in the right?First, it’s worth bearing in mind that screen time can be beneficial. Peter Twining, professor of education (futures) at the Open University, conducted research between 2015 and 2017 into mobile phone use among five- to 11-year-olds, and his findings about what children use phones to access may surprise parents who assume they’re just playing games. “We tend not to recognise the value of what they do on their mobile devices, but they often use them to extend an interest – for instance, if they’re interested in gymnastics, they’ll watch videos of routines and try to learn from them,” he says.This difference in understanding of children’s mobile phone usage may help to explain the substantial disparity in opinion between children and parents about how much screen time is acceptable. According to a survey of 1,000 adults and 1,000 children aged nine to 15 conducted by Tesco Mobile, the mean amount of screen time that adults thought appropriate for children was 1.75 hours, with children believing it to be 3.34 hours.But at least both parties do recognise that there should be limits. However, recent research suggests that instead of setting specific time limits for usage, such as a maximum of two hours per day, it’s actually the nature of the screen time that matters. For instance, passively flicking through social media posts is less beneficial than actively playing games, which can improve problem-solving skills and persistence. A study conducted by the University of Michigan on four to 11-year-olds found that “how children use the devices, not how much time they spend on them, is the strongest predictor of emotional or social problems connected with screen addiction.”Twining agrees, saying: “I’m less concerned about screen time than about the nature of the interactions around the screen. The screen should become a shared focal point for interaction within the family rather than an inidual activity. The screen shouldn’t be an alternative to socialising with your child, it should be an enhancement to it.”Some experts believe that rather than setting concrete limits to screen time, it may be more useful to establish general house rules about the context of phone use. “Many families find a unified screen time approach beneficial,” says chartered psychologist Dr Sarah Kuppen, author of Little Kids, Big Dilemmas: Your parenting problems solved by science.“A media plan sets limits on screen usage to ensure children access a wide range of daily activities. Restrictions sometimes include screen-free zones, screen-free times or device curfews. However, these should be adapted and updated over time.”According to Dr Linda Papadopoulos – a child psychologist and ambassador for Internet Matters, a not-for-profit organisation dedicated to children’s online security – these family guidelines are crucial. “You need to set a good example with your own device and any rules you create, be careful not to break them yourself. For instance, we never have our phones at the dinner table so we can all interact together offline.”Other suggestions from Papadopoulos include only letting children have their phones after their homework, and never allowing them to sleep with the device. She advises explaining the reasons behind these rules. “We know it’s a bad idea to use the phone just before bed because it causes sleep disturbance, so they need to get off it at least a couple of hours before. Equally, we know if a child is studying and their phone is pinging next to them, they won’t consolidate memory, so the chapter they’re reading will take twice as long to absorb. The more kids understand why you’re making these rules, the more they’ll live by them.“And if you still feel they’re using their phones too much, technology can actually help – there are apps where children are rewarded for taking time away from their tech.”Twining believes that parents know what’s appropriate, so they should trust their instincts. “They’re sometimes nervous about exercising it, but parents usually have really good common sense,” he says. “If children are on their phone all the time, clearly that’s too much – you want them to do other activities, too. The key is finding a balance.”Visit Tesco Mobile for more information and content on families and mobile"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5274848e4e0be4abbac76fb3a11e637550fbba17/0_22_6303_3783/master/6303.jpg?width=645\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cddcfb2095e4f3f0bd5ff69eea4c8350 645w","title":"as you age optimism seems stupidity","story":"I’ve always thought of myself as lucky – but optimism can seem more like stupidity as you ageSomehow, over the past few years of attempting to get fit – and even joining a sports team – I have managed to avoid getting injured. That is until this week, when an intense exercise class led to a fall, and a trip to A\u0026ampE. A knee sprain, the doctor informed me. “Rest your leg, keep it elevated, apply ice. It’s a nasty one,” she said. “You might need a week you’ve been unlucky.”Funny, because I’ve always thought of myself as lucky. I play every sweepstake I apply for random jobs I regularly seem to meet interesting people, by chance, on the street or in planes. I feel as if I am often in the right place at the right time.I know that luck per se isn’t real, but – as science confirms – people who think of themselves as lucky often are. Like optimists, they are more likely to follow their intuition, to take bigger risks (and often to gain bigger rewards) – and when they don’t, they pick themselves up and try again.But scientists also say that feeling lucky tends to dwindle as you age that when life has thrown so many slings and arrows that they begin to repeat themselves, to appear like clockwork, optimism seems more like stupidity.And this week I have felt that acutely, sitting here recovering, recuperating, going stir crazy. Is this the great marker of adulthood?Perhaps, I think, the luck was never there. My first boyfriend, for example, whom I met on the bus (lucky), but turned out to be a kleptomaniac whose farts could mutate DNA (unlucky) the £20 I won on a scratchcard (lucky) but spent £25 phoning the premium number to claim it (unlucky, also daft) that time I got 20 fizzy strawberries in a Haribo.I’ll admit that here in the silence of my cooped-up convalescence, it’s easy to let my mind get away. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t spend a few hours Googling questions such as, “How long does it take to go feral?” and, “What are the signs?” I know I’m having a bad week when I have to use my pick-me-up before midday, just to feel alive (and by pick-me-up I mean a YouTube video of a cat being surprised by a toaster).The thing is, without luck, how on earth am I going to get through life? By informed, measured decisions and hard work? Pfft, I’ll be dead in a week. Anyway, it’ll take more than a sprain to sever my ties with lady luck.

I’m 21, so it didn’t have the biggest impact on my day-to-day life, but emotionally it’s been an extremely challenging time. They’re both finally moving on. Although I obviously love seeing my parents happy, I can’t help but feel uneasy thinking about them being with other people.It hurts my feelings that they seem to be replacing each other, and the child in me is terrified of being forgotten and overlooked, even though the rational part of me knows this is somewhat ridiculous.Am I right to feel worried and insecure? Is it rational to raise it with them, even though they are both happier now that they have separated and are dating other people? I feel stuck in a massive dilemma and I don’t know how to ever feel comfortable about this.Sometimes, when we have a big problem, we spend so much time thinking, “Am I right to feel like this?” that we end up with two dilemmas: the original problem and then the avoidance of it. So I think you need to let yourself feel this way – it’s natural. You are having to come to terms with the fact that your parents are separating, which can make you question everything you thought you knew (“When did they stop being happy? Were they happy when I lived at home?”), and you have to accept your parents are sexual beings and have new partners, which many children can find difficult. I wonder also, is there something about this that taps into what’s going on with you at the moment, for example, in your own love life?I went to family psychotherapist (aft.org.uk) David Secrett, who has a lot of experience studying the effects of orce, and asked him why you might be feeling like this.“While separation of parents is frequent and may these days be considered ordinary,” he says, “we often develop, in childhood, a core need for emotional unity, consistency and continuity with our parents. The 18- to 25-year-old age group can be at risk of considerable distress and instability when their parents separate.” You are preparing to leave home and say goodbye to the status quo of family life, but at the same time, you expect it to remain in place and don’t want to lose your past.Secrett’s advice is not to dismiss how you feel as “ridiculous”. He suggests you might want to “see your childhood life in a broader, richer way when the sadness gets too difficult”. So have a leaf through family photo albums, wallow in who you are and where you’ve come from and realise that nothing has changed, or can change, that.At the moment, all you can see is what you might lose and what you’re leaving behind, not what you might gain – you can’t see or enjoy your new life yet, one where your parents may be happier, only mourn for the last one. This is a period of massive transition over which you have little control I call these forcefields – you can’t go back, you can only go forward. I find them easier to bear if I accept I have to – for a while – simply attempt to stay upright and stop trying to direct what happens, because I can’t. It might also be worth honing in on what you are worried about, then work through how realistic these worries are and sort them into things you can do something about and things to let go. Sometimes, even adult children of orcing parents can be concerned about practicalities such as: “Where will I spend Christmas?” or “Where will my childhood belongings live?” These worries aren’t silly.Secrett thought you would benefit hugely from some CBT sessions you should be able to get some free via your GP – but you can also look at babcp. CBT isn’t right for everyone or every situation but can be very helpful in looking at how you approach certain situations.It’s a primal fear that we will be overlookedreplaced by our parents, but they are replacing their partners, not you. Your role in their life is unchanged from their perspective.You ask whether you should talk to your parents: you should. So often problems that are growing out of control can be pruned to a sustainable level by a good conversation. I think you need to trust yourself, and your parents, a bit more. Hopefully you will get reassurance and comfort from them – they may also welcome it.• Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.

Stag dos and hen parties in Las Vegas or Ibiza or Amsterdam, glitzy foreign and “multi-day” weddings, multiple outfits to avoid being photographed in the same dress or suit ... some twenty- and thirtysomethings say they are wiping out their savings and building up debts as a result of attending costly events.Take the case of Georgina Childs. In the space of just four years, the PR consultant attended 15 hen dos and 21 weddings, all of which set her back a staggering £10,000.“When I first started going to weddings in 2014, I lived at home with my parents,” says Childs, who is 30. “So without having a bulky amount of London rent to pay, it was easier to pay out for weddings. I bought new outfits, stayed in nice B\u0026ampBs with my friends and was generous with my wedding gifts.“At the time, I don’t think I realised quite how many weddings I would attend in the next four years and how much I would spend.”One wedding in Lake Garda in northern Italy cost Childs more than £650 once she had shelled out for transport, accommodation and a dress, while a hen do in Granada in Spain set her back a similar amount.“Retrospectively, I couldn’t really afford it and shouldn’t have gone,” she admits. By the end of 2017, she had racked up £2,000 on a credit card and was forced to move back in with her parents.In hindsight she wishes she had been more frugal from the start. “I could perhaps have looked at using the money as a flat deposit or even for travelling the world. Having said that, I have many memories with many friends.”According to two surveys this year, from planning website Bridebook and Brides magazine, the cost of the average “full” wedding has hit £30,000. However, the price is also spiralling out of control for guests, with those attending the nuptials splashing out an average of £1,015, according to a recent survey from loan provider Provident.“New outfits, wedding presents, travel and often accommodation costs all mean that a busy wedding season can end up being extremely costly for guests,” says Jack Duckett, senior consumer lifestyles analyst at Mintel. “While in the past guests may have recycled wedding garments, the omnipresence of social media arguably adds pressure to create new looks for every wedding, for fear of being photographed in the same outfit at multiple events.”When Gemma Robinson’s brother-in-law chose to get married in Cyprus last year, she had no idea it would end up costing an eye-watering £8,000 and “wipe out” their savings.“We had to go for a week because of the way the flights worked out,” says Robinson, from Manchester. The costs piled up after her husband and son were asked to be groomsmen, and her daughter a flower girl.“I assumed they would pay for their outfits, but they didn’t, so that meant my husband’s suit cost £200, and because she wanted the little boys to wear matching Hugo Boss shirts, that cost £70, and then we had to pay for Sarah’s flower girl dress, which cost £70, plus shoes which were £30.”The couple had already splashed out on an expensive family trip to the US just the month before, which they had already paid for. “We had to use money we’d received for our own wedding to pay for it. We were absolutely skint from it.”Jade Beer, editor of Condé Nast Brides magazine and author of The Almost Wife, also says that weddings today are becoming increasingly extravagant – and expensive. “In 2018, they can easily extend over more than two days and have an itinerary of activities that guests need to dress for, and which may require them to travel to different locations for different events. This is a huge personal investment before they’ve even thought about buying the couple a gift.”Jenna Harrison has attended upwards of 30 weddings and 15 hen dos in locations such as Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, New York and the Greek island of Mykonos over the past three years, costing her in the region of £30,000.She says there are additional costs because of the pressure to wear new outfits, which might cost about £250 each.“I mostly always buy something new to wear, partly because I work in fashion and partly because I don’t want to wear the same thing twice,” she says. “Often I will need two things because it’s become quite a trend to do something on the Friday night, too, like a drinks or welcome dinner, particularly for destination weddings.”With plenty of disposable income, Harrison says she has no regrets when it comes to spending such a large sum. “It would be nice to have extra money in the bank to put towards our new home but, truthfully, my husband and I love weddings so much. It’s money well spent in my mind.”But today, celebrating isn’t just tied to the nuptials themselves – many are encouraged to join extravagant hen and stag parties, which can cost guests an average of £164 each, according to Mintel.“The rising cost of stag and hen parties can be largely attributed to the increasing breadth of activities that groups look to include in their celebration, ranging from afternoon tea and wine tasting experiences to spa weekends away in foreign countries,” says Duckett.“This ties in with an overarching shift in consumer behaviour, which has seen people put greater emphasis on products and services that will offer unique experiences they will remember and that they can tell their friends about.”However, for some, spiralling wedding costs are just too much to bear. Chloe Minette, 22, from Bedford, admits she was forced to bow out of being maid of honour at her friend’s wedding after the costs kept creeping up. “She wanted to get married in Spain, but the bridesmaids had to pay to go over and were expected to be in Spain for a week. I started to panic as I’d just bought a house and couldn’t afford to go away for a week to Spain.”There was also talk of a hen do in Ibiza. “I texted her to explain calmly that financially I couldn’t do it ... we’ve not spoken since.”Like Minette, if you can’t afford the outlay, it’s best to be honest rather than getting yourself into debt. There are, of course, plenty of excuses you can use.“If you have children, blame them,” says Beer. “If you have a demanding boss, they can be your excuse. Dwindling holiday allowance, or having to attend solo due to a partner’s clashing diary requirements, are all acceptable.”If you aren’t going to attend, perhaps invite the couple to dinner post-honeymoon so they can tell you all about it, advises Beer.If you do decide to attend but are on a budget, you could cut costs by checking out Airbnbs, just staying over on the night of the wedding, and travelling together in a group.Kate Beavis, founder of the creative wedding blog Magpie Wedding, says guests can save money by creating their own gift or giving the gift of time – such as offering babysitting vouchers. “Some people may think this odd, but really, any good friend would understand and actually appreciate it. Don’t feel you have to buy a new outfit, either. Change the accessories or hat – or maybe you could borrow some.”When that invite lands on the doormat, Beer advises recipients to “press pause on any dramatic reactions until you’ve had time to process it all and decide what you’re in for – and what you’re not”.* Some names and places have been changed"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a1de7d5a3dfbefbe489543f089249ff90539854/0_0_4280_2567/master/4280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e439a223903be9b666b8f507f37314ba","title":"in transit eight of the best audiobooks for long journeys","story":"That hefty tome you’ve been meaning to read for years?

Perhaps your parents played it during long car journeys as a child, or you listened to it furtively in your bedroom way past your bedtime. Well, it’s even better as an adult. Sit back, relax and let Fry do the hard work for you.War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy, read by Frederick Davidson61 hrs 8 mins, equivalent to driving from Inverness to Tel AvivJames Norton caused a stir when he took over our screens in the BBC’s six-part adaptation of Tolstoy’s vast 19th-century novel about life among Russia’s aristocracy in the Napoleonic wars. Seeing as merely holding the book aloft is likely to do you an injury, it’s wise to find an audible alternative. Luckily, the late Frederick Davidson – the chain-smoking titan of the audiobook world, who narrated more than 700 titles – had a quick 61-hour flick-through to make your life easier.Sherlock Holmes: The Definitive Collection by Arthur Conan Doyle, read by Stephen Fry72 hrs 3 mins, equivalent to cycling from Monaco to MadridElementary, my dear Watson. Though, of course, Arthur Conan Doyle, Sherlock’s creator, never really wrote those words – it’s a misattribution. Or is it?

Simon Sebag Montefiore’s look at the history of the Romanovs – the dynasty of tsars and tsarinas who ruled Russia and its empire from the 17th century up until the revolutions of 1917 and the death of Tsar Nicholas II in 1918 – was well reviewed, but is a heavy book to carry around and get through. Simon Russell Beale, the Bafta-winning actor who starred in films The Death of Stalin and Into the Woods, reads it all for you, which makes it much easier to sort your tsarinas from your Tatianas and your Alexanders from your, er, other Alexanders.Ulysses by James Joyce, read by Jim Norton and Marcella Riordan27 hrs 16 mins, equivalent to flying from London to WellingtonThis is probably one of those books you always thought you ought to manage if only you could summon the wherewithal.

In 2016, their report showed that the wealthiest 62 iniduals owned the same amount as the bottom half of the world’s population. This year, that number had dropped to 42: three-and-half-dozen people with as much stuff as three-and-a-half billion.This yearly ritual has become part of the news cycle, and the inequality it exposes has ceased to shock us. The very rich getting very much richer is now part of life, like the procession of the seasons. But we should be extremely concerned: their increased wealth gives them ever-greater control of our politics and of our media. Countries that were once democracies are becoming plutocracies plutocracies are becoming oligarchies oligarchies are becoming kleptocracies.Things were not always this way. In the years after the second world war, the trend was in the opposite direction: the poor were getting richer we were all getting more equal. To understand how and why that changed, we need to go back to the dying days of the conflict, to a resort in New Hampshire, where a group of economists set out to secure humanity’s future.This is the story of how their dream failed and how a London banker’s bright idea broke the world.In the years after the first world war, money flowed between countries pretty much however its owners wished, destabilising currencies and economies in pursuit of profit. Many of the wealthy grew wealthier even while economies fell apart. The chaos led to the election of extremist governments in Germany and elsewhere, to competitive devaluations and beggar-my-neighbour tariffs, to trade wars and, ultimately, to the horrors of the second world war.The allies wanted to prevent this ever happening again. So, at a meeting at the Bretton Woods resort in New Hampshire in 1944, they negotiated the details of an economic architecture that would – in perpetuity – stop uncontrolled money flows. This, they hoped, would keep governments from using trade as a weapon with which to bully neighbours, and create a stable system that would help secure peace and prosperity.Under the new system, all currencies would be pegged to the dollar, which would in turn be pegged to gold. An ounce of gold cost $35 (that’s about $500£394 today). In other words, the US Treasury pledged that, if a foreign government turned up with $35, it could always buy an ounce of gold. The United States was promising to keep everyone supplied with enough dollars to fund international trade, as well as to maintain sufficient gold reserves for those dollars to be inherently valuable.To prevent speculators trying to attack these fixed currencies, cross-border money flows were severely constrained. Money could move overseas, but only in the form of long-term investments, not to speculate short term against currencies or bonds.To understand how this system worked, imagine an oil tanker. If it has just one huge tank, then the oil can slosh backwards and forwards in ever greater waves, until it destabilises the vessel, which overturns and sinks. At the Bretton Woods conference, the oil was ided between smaller tanks, one for each country. The liquid could slosh back and forth within its little compartments, but would be unable to achieve enough momentum to damage the integrity of the vessel.Strangely, one of the best evocations of this long-gone system is Goldfinger, the James Bond book. The film of the same name has a slightly different plot, but they both feature an attempt to undermine the west’s financial system by interfering with its gold reserves. “Gold and currencies backed by gold are the foundations of our international credit,” a Bank of England official named Colonel Smithers explains to 007.The villain Auric Goldfinger’s cunning scheme is to own pawnbrokers all over Britain, buy up gold jewellery and trinkets from ordinary Brits in need of a bit of cash, then melt them down into plates, attach the plates to his Rolls-Royce, drive them to Switzerland, reprocess them and fly them to India. By doing so, Goldfinger will not only undermine the British currency and economy, but also earn profits he could use to fund communists and other miscreants. Hundreds of Bank of England employees are engaged in trying to stop this kind of scam from happening, Smithers tells 007, but Goldfinger is too clever for them. He has secretly become Britain’s richest man, and has £5m-worth of gold bars sitting in the vaults of a bank in the Bahamas.“We are asking you to bring Mr Goldfinger to book, Mr Bond, and get that gold back,” says Smithers. “You know about the currency crisis and the high Bank rate? Of course. Well, England needs that gold, badly – and the quicker the better.”By modern standards, Goldfinger wasn’t doing anything wrong, apart perhaps from dodging some taxes. He was buying up gold at a price people were prepared to pay for it, then selling it in another market, where people were prepared to pay more. It was his money. It was his gold. So what was the problem? He was oiling the wheels of commerce, efficiently allocating capital where it could best be used, no?No, because that wasn’t how Bretton Woods worked. Colonel Smithers considered the gold to belong not only to Goldfinger, but also to Great Britain. The system didn’t consider the owner of money to be the only person with a say in what happened to it. According to the carefully crafted rules, the nations that created and guaranteed the value of money had rights to that money, too. They restricted the rights of money-owners in the interests of everybody else. At Bretton Woods, the allies – desperate to avoid a repeat of the horrors of the inter-war depression and the second world war – decided that, when it came to international trade, society’s rights trumped those of money-owners.All this is hard to imagine for anyone who has only experienced the world since the 1980s, because the system now is so different. Money flows ceaselessly between countries, nosing out investment opportunities in China, Brazil, Russia or wherever. If a currency is overvalued, investors sense the weakness and gang up on it like sharks around a sickly whale. In times of global crisis, the money retreats into the safety of gold or US government bonds. In boom times, it pumps up share prices elsewhere in its restless quest for a good return. These waves of liquid capital have such power that they can wash away all but the strongest governments. The prolonged speculative attacks on the euro, the rouble or the pound, which have been such a feature of the past few decades, would have been impossible under the Bretton Woods system, which was specifically designed to stop them happening.One reason Baring hated the restrictions was that they were killing the City of London. “It was like driving a powerful car at 20 miles an hour,” lamented one banker, of his spell in charge of a major British bank. “The banks were anaesthetised. It was a kind of dream life.” In those days, bankers arrived at work late, left early and frittered away much of the time in between having boozy lunches. No one particularly cared, because there wasn’t much to do anyway.Today, looking over its glass-and-steel skyline, it is hard to imagine that the City of London once almost died as a financial centre. In the 1950s and 1960s, the City played little part in the national conversation. Yet, although few books about the swinging 60s even mention the City, something very significant was brewing there – something that would change the world far more than the Beatles or Mary Quant or David Hockney ever did, something that would shatter the high-minded strictures of the Bretton Woods system.By the time Ian Fleming published Goldfinger in 1959, there were already some leaks in the compartments of the oil tanker. The problem was that not all foreign governments trusted the US to honour its commitment to use the dollar as an impartial international currency and they were not unreasonable in doing so, since Washington did not always act as a fair umpire. In the immediate post-second-world-war years, the US government had sequestered communist Yugoslavia’s gold reserves. The rattled eastern bloc countries then made a habit of keeping their dollars in European banks rather than in New York.Similarly, when Britain and France attempted to regain control of the Suez canal in 1956, a disapproving Washington froze their access to dollars and doomed the venture. These were not the actions of a neutral arbiter. Britain at the time was staggering from one crisis to another. In 1957, it raised interest rates and stopped banks using sterling to finance trade in an attempt to keep the pound strong (this was the “currency crisis and the high bank rate” that Smithers told Bond about).City banks, which could no longer use sterling in the way they were accustomed, began to use dollars instead, and they obtained those dollars from the Soviet Union, which was keeping them in London and Paris so as to avoid becoming vulnerable to American pressure. This turned out to be a profitable thing to do. In the US, there were limits on how much interest banks could charge on dollar loans – but not so in London.This market – the bankers called the dollars “eurodollars” – gave a bit of life to the City of London in the late 1950s, but not much. The big bond issues were still taking place in New York, a fact which annoyed many bankers in London. After all, many of the companies borrowing the money were European, yet it was American banks that were earning the fat commissions.One banker in particular was not prepared to tolerate this: Siegmund Warburg. Warburg was an outsider in the cosy world of the City. For one thing, he was German. For another, he hadn’t given up on the idea that a City banker’s job was to hustle for business. In 1962, Warburg learned from a friend at the World Bank that some $3bn was circulating outside the US – sloshing around and ready to be put to use. Warburg had been a banker in Germany in the 1920s and remembered arranging bond deals in foreign currencies. Why couldn’t his bankers do something similar again?For the City’s most ambitious financiers, this was tantalising: there was all this money squirrelled away, doing nothing much, and it was exactly what they needed in their quest to start selling bonds again. As Warburg saw it, if he could somehow access the money, package it up and lend it, he would be in business. Surely, Warburg thought, he could persuade the people who were paying Swiss bankers to look after their money that they would rather earn an income from it by buying his bonds? And surely he could persuade European companies that they would rather borrow this money from him and avoid paying the steep fees demanded in New York?It was a great idea, but there was a problem: the compartments of the oil tanker were in the way. It was impossible for Warburg to move that money from Switzerland via London to clients who wanted to borrow it. But he took two of his best men and told them to get it done anyway.They began their efforts in October 1962, the same month that the Beatles released Love Me Do. The bankers finalised their deal on 1 July the following year, the same day that the Fab Four recorded She Loves You, the song that sparked global Beatlemania. That extraordinary nine months not only revolutionised pop music, but also geopolitics, since they included the Cuban missile crisis and John F Kennedy’s Ich bin ein Berliner speech. Under the circumstances, it is understandable that a simultaneous revolution in global finance passed little remarked.Warburg’s new bond issue – these bonds became known as “eurobonds”, after the example set by eurodollars – was led by Ian Fraser, a Scottish war hero turned journalist turned banker. He and his colleague Peter Spira had to find ways to defang the taxes and controls designed to prevent hot money flowing across borders, and to find ways to pick and choose different aspects of different countries’ regulations for the various elements of their creation.The cumulative effect of this game of jurisdictional Twister was that Fraser created a bond paying a good rate of interest, on which no one had to pay tax of any kind, and which could be turned back into cash anywhere. These were what are known as bearer bonds. Whoever possessed the bond owned them there was no register of ownership or any obligation to record your holding, which was not written down anywhere.Fraser’s eurobonds were like magic. Before eurobonds, hidden wealth in Switzerland couldn’t really do much but now it could buy these fantastic pieces of paper, which could be carried anywhere, redeemed anywhere and all the while paid interest to their owners, tax free. Dodge taxes and make a profit, worldwide.So, who was buying Fraser’s magical invention? Who was providing the money he was lending to IRI, via Autostrade? “The main buyers of these bonds were iniduals, usually from eastern Europe but often also from Latin America, who wanted to have part of their fortune in mobile form so that if they had to leave they could leave quickly with their bonds in a small suitcase,” Fraser wrote in his autobiography. “There was still a mass migration of the surviving Jewish populations of central Europe heading for Israel and the west. To this was added the normal migration of fallen South American dictators heading east. Switzerland was where all this money was stashed away.”Later, historians tried to downplay Fraser’s account a little, and to claim that corrupt politicians – those fallen South American dictators – made up just a fifth or so of the demand for these early bond issues. As for the remaining four-fifths of the money that bought up the bonds, this came from standard tax dodgers – “Belgian dentists”, the bankers called them – high-earning professionals who steered a chunk of their earnings to Luxembourg or Geneva, and who welcomed this lovely new investment.The eurobonds set wealth free and were the first step towards creating the virtual country of the rich that I call Moneyland. Moneyland includes offshore finance, but is much broader than that, since it protects every aspect of a rich person’s life from scrutiny, not just their money. The same money-making dynamic that enticed Fraser to defang capital controls on behalf of his clients, entices his modern-day counterparts to find ways for the world’s richest people to avoid visa controls, journalistic scrutiny, legal liability and much more. Moneyland is a place where, if you are rich enough, whoever you are, wherever your money comes from, the laws do not apply to you.This is the dirty secret at the heart of the City’s rebirth, the beginning of the process that eventually led to today’s stratospheric inequality. It was all made possible by modern communications – the telegram, the phone, the telex, the fax, the email – and it allowed the world’s richest people to avoid the responsibilities of citizenshipThat first deal was for $15m. But once the way to sidestep the obstacles that stopped cash flowing offshore had been identified, there was nothing to stop more money following behind. In the second half of 1963, $35m of eurobonds were sold. In 1964, the market was $510m. In 1967, the total passed $1bn for the first time, and it is now one of the biggest markets in the world.The result was that, over time, the system created at Bretton Woods fell apart. More and more dollars were escaping offshore, where they avoided the regulations and taxes imposed upon them by the US government. But they were still dollars, and thus 35 of them were still worth an ounce of gold.The trouble that followed stemmed from the fact that dollars don’t just sit around doing nothing. They multiply. If you put a dollar in a bank, the bank uses it as security for the money it lends to someone else, meaning there are more dollars – your dollar, and the dollars someone else has borrowed. And if that person puts the money in another bank, and that bank lends it, there are now even more dollars, and so on.And since every one of those dollars was nominally worth a fixed amount of gold, the US would have needed to keep buying ever more gold to satisfy the potential demand. If the US did that, however, it would have to have bought that gold with dollars, meaning yet more dollars would exist, which would multiply in turn, meaning more gold purchases, and more dollars, until the system would eventually collapse under the weight of the fact that it didn’t make sense it couldn’t cope with offshore.The US government tried to defend the dollargold price, but every restriction it put on dollar movements just made it more profitable to keep your dollars in London, leading more money to leak offshore, and thus more pressure to build on the dollargold price. And where the dollars went, the bankers followed. The City had looser regulations and more accommodating politicians than Wall Street, and the banks loved it. In 1964, 11 US banks had branches in the City of London. In 1975, 58 did.The US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, who administered the federal banking system, opened a permanent office in London to inspect what the British branches of American banks were up to. But the Americans had no power in the UK and got no help from the locals. “It doesn’t matter to me,” said Jim Keogh, the Bank of England official responsible for monitoring these banks, “whether Citibank is evading American regulations in London”.By that time, however, Washington had bowed to the inevitable and stopped promising to redeem dollars for gold at $35 an ounce. It was the first step in a steady dismantling of all the safeguards created at Bretton Woods. The philosophical question over who really owned money – the person who earned it, or the country that created it – had been answered.If you had money, thanks to the accommodating bankers of London and Switzerland, you could now do what you wanted with it and governments could not stop you. As long as one country tolerated offshore, as Britain did, then the efforts of all the others came to nothing. If regulations stop at a country’s borders, but the money can flow wherever it wishes, its owners can outwit any regulators they choose.The developments that began with Warburg did not stop with simple eurobonds. The basic pattern was endlessly replicable. Identify a line of business that might make you and your clients money. Look around the world for a jurisdiction with the right rules for that business – Liechtenstein, the Cook Islands, Jersey – and use it as a nominal base.If you couldn’t find a jurisdiction with the right kind of rules, then you threatened or flattered one until it changed its rules to accommodate you. Warburg himself started this off, by explaining to the Bank of England that if Britain did not make its rules competitive and its taxes lower, then he would take his bank elsewhere, perhaps to Luxembourg.Hey presto, the rules were changed, and the tax – in this case, stamp duty on bearer bonds – was abolished. The world’s response to these developments has been entirely predictable as well. Time after time, countries have chased after the business they have lost offshore (as the US did by abolishing the regulations the banks were dodging when they moved to London), thus making the onshore world ever more similar to the offshore piratical world that Warburg’s bankers created.Taxes have fallen, regulations have relaxed, politicians have become friendlier, all in an effort to entice the restless money to settle in one jurisdiction rather than another. The reason for this is simple. Once one jurisdiction lets you do what you want, the business flows there and other jurisdictions have to rush to change, too. It is the Moneyland ratchet, always loosening regulations for the benefit of those with money to move around, and never tightening them.“It’s very easy for oligarchs of developing countries, non-democratic countries, to hide their wealth. That provides them with huge incentives to loot their countries, and there’s no oversight,” says Zucman.Come January, we will get another update of how much more of the world’s wealth these oligarchs have taken for themselves: the only surprise will be the precise volume of their new acquisition, and how little they have left for the rest of us. But we shouldn’t wait until then to grasp the urgency of the situation.We need to act now to shine a light on their wealth, on the dark matter whose gravitational power is bending the fabric of our societies. We may have been ignoring Moneyland, but its nomad citizens have not been ignoring us. If we wish to take back control of our economies, and our democracies, we need to act now. Every day that we wait, more money is stacked against us.Adapted from Moneyland: Why Thieves \u0026amp Crooks Now Rule The World \u0026amp How to Take It Back by Oliver Bullough, published by Profile Books• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5eb608db7b5c17c5e33d6465ee8a67ac86e82bb7/0_7_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1a42093dc2697a52d931567359e37e4","title":"weatherwatch nuclear power plants feel the heat","story":"During this summer’s heatwave, nuclear reactors in five European countries had to be shut down or put on reduced powerAn argument of the nuclear lobby is that renewables, particularly wind and solar, are unreliable because of changing weather. Only nuclear power can guarantee to keep the lights on or the air conditioners running.This summer’s heatwave has shown that prolonged high pressure does reduce the output of the wind industry but it has also had serious consequences for nuclear power. In five European countries, Finland, France, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland, nuclear reactors have had to be put on reduced power or shut down completely because their cooling water got too hot.Nuclear stations use an enormous amount of cooling water, dumping it back into rivers, lakes or the sea, when it has done its work – much warmer than when it was extracted. Problems occurred this summer when the water intake was too warm to cool the plant, and the hot water being returned to the river or sea was killing fish and other wildlife. This problem has occurred in French rivers before, but this year the Baltic Sea was too warm to cool stations in Finland and Sweden.Fortunately the UK’s operating nuclear stations are on colder seas where the threat is more from winter storm damage and rising sea levels.

Soubry, who has been critical of the prime minister’s Brexit stance, held Broxtowe with a majority of just 863 at last year’s general election.As McDonnell’s nationwide tour begins, however, there is little sign of the two sides in Labour’s civil war being reconciled.Chuka Umunna, the Streatham MP who was recently forced to deny that he was planning to leave Labour and set up a rival party, will give a speech in London on Saturday, urging the leadership to “call off the dogs” from MPs critical of Jeremy Corbyn, several of whom are facing motions of no confidence from their local parties.He will say: “Having only been re-elected by their constituents last year, already centre-left MPs are being targeted systematically with motions against them for standing up for these values – for demanding we have a zero tolerance of racism in our party. More motions such as this are expected by colleagues.“My message to our leadership: it is within your power to stop this, so call off the dogs and get on with what my constituency, one of the most erse communities in the nation, demands we do without equivocation: fight this Tory Brexit. That is where all our efforts should be.”Labour activists called for a party inquiry on Friday after an Iranian state-backed broadcaster streamed footage of the Enfield North MP, Joan Ryan, losing a confidence vote.The Press TV footage, which appeared to have been filmed inside the meeting, was carried on the station’s Twitter feed and referred to Ryan, who chairs Labour Friends of Israel, as a “pro-Israel MP”. It included the hashtag #WeAreEnfieldNorth.The local party chairman, Siddo Dwyer, said that filming was not allowed in the room and he would be making a formal complaint to the channel. “Warnings were issued about filming, including a direct warning to the member in question,” he wrote on Twitter. “It didn’t occur to any of us at the time that they were from a state broadcaster.”But Roshan Salih, a journalist at Press TV, disputed that account. He told the : “No general warnings issued, no posters, no approach to person we obtained footage from.”A Labour spokesperson said: “Filming of local Labour party meetings is not permitted and Enfield North will be reminded of this fact.”Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, said the filming made a farce of the proceedings and “is not how the modern Labour party should conduct its affairs”.Ryan was critical of Corbyn over his stance on antisemitismduring the row that has preoccupied the party for much of the summer.The no-confidence motion, which is not binding, accused Ryan of “smearing” the Labour leader’s character, “without him having the right to a fair and balanced defence”.Another MP critical of Corbyn’s leadership, Gavin Shuker, who represents Luton South, was also the subject of a vote of no confidence from his constituency party on Thursday night, but he said he would continue to serve his constituents.Labour’s unrest was further inflamed on Friday by remarks from the former prime minister Tony Blair, who said the party had “profoundly changed” under Corbyn’s leadership.“It is a different type of Labour party. Can it be taken back? I don’t know,” he said on the BBC’s Political Thinking podcast.The Momentum founder, Jon Lansman, a member of Labour’s national executive committee and staunch backer of Corbyn, shot back that Blair was “never in the right party and there will never be a return to his politics in Labour”.Momentum is keen for grassroots party members to play more of a role in selecting and removing Labour’s candidates for parliament."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a8d6027b1a3ee1335c8febac8751c4722a5ec40/0_45_1731_1039/master/1731.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6ccf1943b5b7344bb826edcfdd3579f","title":"feline hungry an expert guide to feeding cats","story":"Your cat may act like it can look after itself but, like a teenager, it’s definitely underselling how much it needs you – especially when it comes to nutrition. Here’s how to get it rightCats are masters of being able to wind their owners around their little claws, and as a result they make us believe they are desperately in need of feeding when in fact, they’re not. Despite what we think, cats have no social aspect to eating. In other words, they don’t love us for it.Portion sizes should be followed according to the type of food you are feeding (most feeds have a guide for portion sizes on the pack, or offer a nutritional advice helpline) and according to the breed, build, age and activity level of your cat. A rough guide would be an urban outdoor cat that weighs about 4kg would need about 300kcal a day. If your cat is an indoor-only animal of about the same weight, this would reduce to 200kcal a day.The type of cat you have will affect what they need to eat to stay fit and healthy. Long-haired cats benefit from a different food to their shorter haired cousins, while bigger breeds such as Maine coons have a larger skeleton, so benefit from more joint support than others.The shape of the cat’s jaw can determine how and if they eat a kibble, which is why different breeds benefit from a specific shape. Cat jaws are designed to move up and down, not side to side, so they can tear at food rather than chew – and you’ll find cats eat in one of three different ways:Cats are very fussy about how food feels in their mouth and texture is very important to cats – more so, in fact, than taste, as they have relatively few taste buds compared with humans. They also need fresh drinking water at all times.SiameseThese animals are long, lean and athletic, and benefit from a diet to support muscle tone – one that has more protein and less fat. Their jaw is a specific triangular shape, so they need a kibble that works with their natural eating action, encouraging them to crunch their food.Bengal An athletic breed that benefits from a higher level of protein but also fat to fuel their activity. A diet that will help maintain its very distinctive coat is also desirable containing specific amino acids, vitamins and omega fats aimed specifically at skin and coat health.Maine coon Maine coon owners should have an awareness of the heart health issues associated with this large, heavy breed. Make sure its diet has the right energy density so that you’re not encouraging weight gain.Norwegian forest catLike other cats with longer coats, the Norwegian forest cat often needs a food that contains specific fibres such as psyllium, which help to naturally move hair swallowed during grooming through the digestive tract – as without the right care and nutrition, hairballs can be an issue.SphynxThese hairless cats are covered with a light down, but they can struggle to maintain their body temperature and so benefit from a food with a higher fat content to provide extra energy for their active metabolism. Keeping their skin healthy is also a priority. RagdollAnother long-haired cat with a broad jaw, these benefit from a pyramid-shaped kibble that is easy to grasp and encourage crunching. As with other heavier cats, they benefit from food with additional health nutrients, such as glucosamine and chondroitin to support joint health.Whatever the breed, Royal Canin offer a wide variety of wet and dry foods tailored to your cat’s inidual nutrition needs.

Team Sky’s Wout Poels took a perfectly calculated stage six win, while the overnight leader Primoz Roglic showed the after-effects of lingering health problems.Alaphilippe had looked like the strongest climber in the race since the ascent of Challacombe on stage two in Devon and he had the perfect foil in the Luxembourg national champion, Bob Jungels, who showed grinding power to set up his Quick-Step teammate’s searing uphill accelerations. With two flat stages to come, there is every chance Alaphilippe will become the first Frenchman to win the race since Geoffroy Lequatre in 2008.The double act had made their intentions clear on the 168.3km (105.4 miles) stage at the first time-bonus sprint in Ulverston, slashing time off Roglic’s overall lead after an intense battle in the crosswinds that swept the field as they rode alongside Morecambe Bay, and as the race hit the lower slopes of the two-mile climb of Whinlatter 90 miles later at the other end of the Lake District, Jungels raised the pace to soften up the field.When he faded Alaphilippe took over, using the explosive climbing skill that has won him two stages in the Tour de France. Roglic hung on initially, which was all he had to do. However, after his LottoNL-Jumbo team had won the previous day’s time trial up the easier western side of the pass, the Slovenian had expressed doubts about his form because of a double operation on an elbow and copious amounts of antibiotics. He lacked team support at the crucial moment on the final run-in to the climb and slipped backwards with just under a mile to go.While the young Briton Hugh Carthy was the other main aggressor on the climb alongside Alaphilippe, and was rewarded with third place for the stage, Poels was cold-bloodedly restrained. The Dutchman ignored Alaphilippe’s initial surge, preferring to hold his own pace he caught up soon after Roglic gave best, and made one move when it counted, as the road eased in the final 500m.What mattered was to be first into the tight right-hand bend close to the line – taking the riders into the same final 100m they had covered in the time trial – and there was little doubt Poels would land his third Tour of Britain hilltop finish, after the Pennines at Hartside and Haytor in Devon. Given Team Sky’s record, they feel obliged to do more than merely participate in this race, so his victory will be as much a relief as a triumph.“I was riding for the green jersey not the stage win. He was fresher than me, so I’m not disappointed,” Alaphilippe said.Poels’s win was enough to elevate him to second overall at 17sec, with Roglic dropping back to third, 32sec behind that should be enough for Alaphilippe barring any untoward events in Saturday’s flat stage in Nottinghamshire or Sunday’s London finale.On which note both the Frenchman and Roglic survived a pile-up soon after the early sprint, which calmed the friskier spirits down and allowed a four-rider escape to embark on a long march northwards through the Lakes, with the young Britons Conor Swift and James Shaw accompanying the former world time-trial champions Vasil Kiryienka of Team Sky and Katusha’s Tony Martin.They were swept up on the lower slopes of Whinlatter but it was far from a pointless move, as Kiryienka’s presence meant Sky could sit back and focus on protecting Poels until the final showdown."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66db9d7c4d7b9e399456d96554b00e76ec849a9f/222_37_4303_2582/master/4303.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12beb7a5aaf5bdda8c4086015e55b608","title":"alastair cook long goodbye england india final test","story":"It was the sound of Alastair Cook leaving the crease at the Kia Oval that you really noticed. There were three parts to it. First was the weird, involuntary groan as Jasprit Bumrah rushed a ball through Cook’s defences to splay the stumps. It was 4.22pm. Cook had nudged and cuffed and occasionally flashed his way to an autumnal half century on one of those sunny, steady opener’s days where the game is still crisp and starchily in order, there to be tickled into shape, and where, briefly, anything seems possible.Bumrah has been the best of India’s fast bowlers. He is also a fast bowler who does not resemble a fast bowler at any stage in his run up and action, right up until the moment he suddenly becomes one to startling effect. Bumrah starts by walking 10 paces. Then he skips, grudgingly, for six more. Finally he leaps, star-jumps, points a finger to the sky and whirls that straight arm down like a man lashing a bullwhip.Perhaps Cook did not pick the length this time. Perhaps it kept low. Either way the ball beat a late, endearingly ugly adjustment and Cook was gone for 71, his 57th Test half century and an obligingly gnarled, crabby innings almost a tribute in itself to the very idea, the basic principles of Cook-ishness.Bumrah celebrated, then stopped and watched Cook go, a nicely spontaneous moment of fraternal respect. At which point the second noise came, as the crowd around this low-rise bowl stood and applauded Cook all the way from the middle, not so much an ovation as a shared public embrace.There was a kind of beauty to that walk off. The Oval is a good place for goodbyes, a ground that is always at its best in the dry, bleached-out days of early autumn, when the air is full of endings and last things. Ever since Cook announced that this would be his final Test it has been hard to find anyone without a Cook anecdote, a Cook take, a memory of the first time they saw this skinny kid and thought … well, what exactly?The best, and most honest, of all these was probably Nasser Hussain, whose first meeting with Cook involved Hussain basically ignoring him and whose second meeting with Cook also involved Hussain basically ignoring him. This seems very Cook. The applause as he walked off was greeted with a wave of the bat all the more genuine for its slightly shrugging nature, that familiar walk, the dip of the head as he approached the gate, shadows already stretching across the lime-green late summer grass, the pavilion and Bedser stand on its feet.In that moment the realisation that there really is no more Cook after this felt a little cruel, as though some essential part of the English summer is leaving with him – as though the decision has been taken to abolish tea, or the British Museum, or rainy Sunday afternoons or saying sorry to people when they have just stood on your toe.There are very few things as reassuringly English as this, Cook on a nibbly, breezy day that could go either way, the long-form drama of leave and edge and nurdle, as English as muggy weather and shiny bedspreads and weekend rail replacement services.For now we had those fond four and half hours on a day when until that moment after tea England had looked to be blunting some fine, concerted efforts from India’s seam attack.There was a slightly bashful guard of honour at the start of the morning session. And with a rush Cook was ready to face the 26,087th ball of his Test career. Playing to the gallery he left it, of course.Disappointingly for those looking for some doughty-old-Cook colour his first scoring stroke was a push through cover rather than something more classically grizzled, a nurdle through square leg or an inside edge off a foot. There was a crushing cut for four off Bumrah, one of those shots where Cook stands up and thrashes aristocratically through point like a crotchety earl swatting midges with his shooting stick. And so Cook ground on, setting himself to last out the day like a Soviet-era combine harvester chugging its way across the horizon.Keaton Jennings departed with the score on 60. This was a shame as in Jennings, Cook has finally found a partner who manages the amazingfeat of making him look by comparison lithe and elegant and fluent.Approaching his 50 Cook leaped back as Ravi Jadeja dropped short and k-cut the ball to the fence, the same shot that got his Test career moving back in Nagpur in 2006. The ovation for his half century in the next over had a hunger about it, a crowd willing the game one way as Cook pushed his 139th ball down the ground to rack up the first half-century by any opener in this five-Test series.And finally it was time for him to depart, although perhaps not for the final time. The ovation as Cook walked off seemed to have an extra depth of feeling. Will anyone ever have a career like this again?Will there be Test batsmen prepared or even given the chance to play so many games for so many years, and to such an acquisitive, oddly comforting rhythm. The third and final sound as Cook walked up the steps was unexpected, a sudden shouted cheer around the ground. He did not look back."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03bcb6b13fea1fe61fa9d02d065968187466e518/0_125_4433_2659/master/4433.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=139cddbb41ac5de9298cf5c55f596530","title":"talking horses harry angel strong fancy haydock sprint cup horse racing tips","story":"The favourite would be the first horse to win this prize in consecutive years since Be Friendly more than 50 years agoLots of possible winners and some unknown quantities make Saturday’s running of the Haydock Sprint Cup a really enjoyable one to contemplate. It seems a pity, then, to go for the favourite but the claims of Harry Angel (4.15) are strong and he can become the first to win this in consecutive years since Be Friendly, more than half a century ago.Soft ground also prevailed when he won last year, his most impressive performance to date. Of course, his preparation went rather more smoothly that time. He comes here after injuring himself in the stalls at Royal Ascot, causing him to run rather poorly, but his rivals here may need him to do something similar. The Tin Man is a danger with Oisin Murphy aboard for the first time, while Speak In Colours can fare well for Joseph O’Brien.1.50 Haydock Jessica Harrington’s Persian Lion improved for the move into handicaps and a step up in trip last time. This ground will be a new test but his siblings coped well with soft.2.05 Kempton It’s really tempting to oppose Enable, who will be something like 4-7 despite her 11-month absence. There’s a lot that could go wrong for her backers here, bearing in mind that her first run of 2017 resulted in the only defeat of her career. But Crystal Ocean is being asked to achieve an awful lot in giving her 8lb. That weight concession makes me more inclined to stick with the filly and hope she still has fire in her belly.2.25 Haydock A shock winner of the Sussex Stakes on soft ground last summer, Here Comes When gets that kind of surface for the first time this year. At the odds, it is worth chancing him over Regal Reality, who beat just a handful of rivals at Goodwood last time.2.45 Ascot The best four runs of Raising Sand’s career have come at this track, including when he was beaten less than two lengths in this race a year ago. He blew the start that day and there is always a chance of him doing that but surely a line can be put through his non-effort at Sandown last time.3.15 Kempton Having looked like a horse who would improve in handicaps, Honey Man took a nice step forward to score over this course and distance last month. Lawmaking had excuses back in fourth but Honey Man has more to offer and is taken to repel that rival once more.3.35 Haydock Having shown a preference for a slow surface last year, Mam’selle has had to race on good to firm since May. Her mark has dropped a bit but the ability still seems to be in there and she may be seen in a better light this time.3.55 Ascot From the Charlie Appleby yard that continues in excellent form, Ghostwatch can follow up his Melrose win at York after a 6lb hike that could have been a lot worse. That success came on his first run since being gelded and it may be worth sticking with this progressive son of Dubawi.

Djokovic enjoys a 14-2 record in the head-to-head series between the players, though one of those defeats was a four-set shocker in the US Open semi-finals back in 2014. Since then, Djokovic has won 13 straight meetings including four previous times this year with the Serb winning in Madrid, Rome and the Wimbledon quarter-finals. The sixth-seeded Djokovic is in form, having won 10 straight sets at Fluhsing Meadows since dropping a third-set tiebreaker to Tennys Sandgren in the second round. Meanwhile, Nishikori, the No 21 seed, is coming off a marathon victory over Marin Cilic, a rematch of the 2014 US Open final, which required more than four hours on court. He’s trying to become second-lowest seed to reach the US Open final after No 28 Kevin Anderson last year – and out to become the first Japanese man to win a Grand Slam title.Bryan will be here shortly.

He’s a deserving finalist, and will give either Novak Djokovic or Kei Nishikori something serious to think about come Sunday. On which subject, you’d best race over to say hello to Bryan Armen Graham, who will be in the big chair for the second men’s semi. Congratulations to the magnificent Juan Martin del Potro, commiserations to the stricken Rafael Nadal, and thanks to everyone for reading. Nighty night, and sweet dreams!But the extremely likeable and exceptionally talented Juan Martin del Potro deserves to reach the final. It’s not the way he’d have wanted to get through, but take no gloss off a fine performance. He was simply magnificent this evening. “Well it is not the best way to win a match. I love to play against Rafa because he is the biggest fighter, I don’t like to see him suffer and I am saddened for him. But anyway the key of the match was the first set, we both played good tennis and I did well in the tie-break. I am so happy to be in the final again. It means a lot to me, I didn’t expect to get into another grand-slam final. This is my favourite tournament, and my biggest memories are here in 2009. But I was a kid, and now I am much older.”Nadal calls the trainer down again. A quick word. His head drops and he puts his racquet back in his bag. He then gives the umpire the word ... he can’t continue. He retires and embraces del Potro. The pair chat awhile as a distressed Nadal explains his predicament. It’s a bittersweet moment. Nadal takes his leave, the Arthur Ashe Stadium stunned into silence for a second, before giving the exiting hero the ovation he deserves. Such a shame.Nadal* 6-7, 2-6 del Potro. Nadal is serving to stay in the second set. He goes 30-0 up quickly enough, but then three unforced errors in a row gifts del Potro a set point. Nadal saves it by charging the net, forcing del Potro to send a forehand wide right. But he flaps another shot into the net, and it’s a second set point. Del Potro flashes a forehand past him, and it’s the second set to Del Potro.Nadal 6-7, 2-5 del Potro*. Nadal isn’t just playing with an injured knee his movement’s also hampered by Black Dog, who has sunk his teeth into his Aris and isn’t letting go. He is fuming. Eyebrows at 45 degrees. Not sure whether he’s annoyed with himself, his injury, or that argument over the mid-rally call. But he’s not in a good place right now. Del Potro wins an easy service game to love.Nadal* 6-7, 2-4 del Potro. Nadal was in a deep funk during the changeover, staring into space, frowning, brooding. His mood’s not helped when a ball’s called out mid-rally, but it’s ignored, the point continues and Nadal sends one wide. Break point. He walks up to the umpire, furious, wagging his finger. During an emotional rant, he utters a sentence which has the word “retire” in it. Oh no. The good news: he continues playing, and holds his serve. Here’s hoping he’s good to continue.Nadal 6-7, 1-4 del Potro*. But then del Potro makes his 18th unforced error of the match so far, flapping a weak forehand into the net. He’s in trouble at 0-30. But he moves Nadal around in a couple of rallies, clawing it back to 30-30. Nadal hollers in agony as he slides towards a ball far out to the left is it the knee, or simply frustration that he couldn’t reach it? Two points later, and that’s a big hold for del Potro, who dug in brilliantly and sent a gingerly moving Nadal hither and yon.Nadal* 6-7, 1-3 del Potro. Nadal’s back up and about ... and immediately sent scampering around by del Potro, who dinks a cute one over the net. Del Potro, sensing that it’s time to strike, quickly goes 0-40 up, wheeching a backhand pass down the left sideline. Three break points. Nadal responds with a screaming passing shot of his own, then Delpo nets weakly. But Nadal can’t escape again. He hoicks long, and the 2009 champ is a set and a break up on the three-time winner.Nadal takes a medical time-out. The defending champion is getting his right knee taped up again. He doesn’t look particularly happy, grimacing in pain as the trainer loops the tape around his tendon. The trainer gives him a good, hard massage, then applies some sort of spray on the knee. Here’s hoping he’s good to continue. And a thought for del Potro, too he’s on top right now, and won’t want to lose his mojo waiting around.Nadal 6-7, 1-2 del Potro*. An easy hold to love for the big man.Nadal* 6-7, 1-1 del Potro. Nadal charges the net, but del Potro zips a magnificent backhand down the right sideline. Then a long rally is won by the big man, with a stunning whip down the left. Then a simply outrageous point for del Potro, who crashes a cross-court forehand that rocks Nadal back on his heels Nadal recovers and looks to have won it with a delicate drop shot, but del Potro gathers then volleys to earn a couple of break points. Nadal is the dictionary definition of tenacious, though, and suddenly shifts up a gear, winning four points in a row to hold. Del Potro threw everything at him then, but he escaped with the game. Del Potro will be annoyed at passing up an opportunity for another break, but at least he’s making plenty of chances. Both players have won 47 points so far.Nadal 6-7, 0-1 del Potro*. Del Potro takes control of a couple of rallies, moving Nadal this way and that. Perhaps trying to test his movement, Nadal having swathed his knee in tape earlier on. He goes 40-15 up. But Nadal wakes up, winning one point with a glorious passing shot, then digging out a defensive return that surprises Delpo at the net. But a see-saw game ends in style, as del Potro follows up a big serve with a delicious drop shot that beats Nadal all ends up. Del Potro starts the second set with a hold.Del Potro won that tie-break with ease. That’s some performance, because he looked a broken man for a while back there, having passed up two glorious opportunities to serve the set out at 5-4. Had he gone on to lose the set, it could have been hard coming back. But he bounces off beaming, a mixture of jubilation and relief. Nadal was strangely uncompetitive during the tie-break.Nadal 6-7 del Potro. Del Potro goes a mini-break up as a netcord sends Nadal’s ball out. Delpo wins his first service point to go 2-0 up. Nadal gets the mini-break back with a stunning cross-court two-handed backhand. But then loses it again as del Potro crashes a big forehand to the left-hand corner Nadal can’t return. Then Nadal gets the benefit of a net cord, a drop shot nearly going wrong but toppling over the net. It’s 3-2 to Delpo, who has a mini-break in his pocket. Then 4-2, as Nadal is inches long with an outrageous lob. And then 5-2, a huge serve setting up a powerful forehand Nadal can’t reach. Nadal needs to hold onto his two service points. But he misses an empty deuce court with a forehand and Delpo has his third set point at 6-3. Nadal flashes a forehand into the net, and a 69-minute first set goes to the 2009 champ!Nadal 6-6 del Potro*. Farcical scenes as del Potro hits a big serve and stops playing as Nadal whistles it back past his lugs. Delpo thought his serve was out, so challenges. It’s in, and he loses the point. A sign of a head addled by those squandered set points. It nearly costs him, too: serving at 40-30, a good serve’s called out ... and he’s got no challenges left! But he pulls himself together at the death, and this first set is going to a tie-break.Nadal* 6-5 del Potro. Having been broken, del Potro looks broken. His shoulders are slumping, his feet are dragging. Nadal eases through his service game to love.Nadal 5-5 del Potro*. Nadal missed a couple of forehands in that last game, which may explain why he threw his water bottle in irritation as he got back to his chair. He takes the tape off his knee. And goes out to put del Potro under some pressure, racing to a 15-30 lead. But del Potro sends a huge kicker of a serve out right, dispatching Nadal’s desperate return at the net. Another big serve and he’s got set point. Which he should convert, but he tightens up and sends an easy cross-court winner out on the left. Deuce. Then another set point - which he slaps into the net! If Nadal nicks this game, it will kill del Potro. Del Potro hoicks another one wide ... then flaps one into the net to hand the break straight back! Two set points have come and gone del Potro visibly tightened in the clutch. That was dreadful.Nadal* 4-5 del Potro. So having said that, del Potro suddenly finds top gear - in the middle of a long rally, pressing Nadal back - and breaks again! He seals the deal with a crashing forehand down the right Nadal can only whip a return lamely into the net. And now the big man will serve for the first set!Nadal 4-4 del Potro*. A busy pit-stop for Nadal, who asks for one of his racquets to be restrung, and gets his right knee taped up. He doesn’t seem to be in too much discomfort as he wins a 14-shot rally. But del Potro winds up his serve again and sees the game out. Strange to say of a match which has had two breaks of serve already, but this hasn’t quite taken off yet. A sprinkling of the spectacular, but neither player has hit top gear.Nadal* 4-3 del Potro. Del Potro asks a serious question of Nadal, sending a 101mph forehand to the corner. But Nadal somehow returns, and del Potro hoicks long. Another easy hold for Nadal.Nadal 3-3 del Potro*. Nadal races into a 0-30 lead, forcing a mistake during a grinding rally, then benefiting from a del Potro forehand that loses a battle with the net cord. But then Delpo gets his first serve going. Four points in a row to win the game, the last a rare victory in a baseline rally.Nadal* 3-2 del Potro. An easy hold for Nadal, who wraps up the game with a good old-fashioned serve-and-volley point.Nadal 2-2 del Potro*. Del Potro, playing in Australian gold, teases Nadal towards the net, then sends a screamer along the left sideline. Then he flirts with trouble, a couple of unforced errors giving Nadal a 15-30 lead. But some big serving digs him out of a hole. He holds his serve for the first time.Nadal* 2-1 del Potro. Nadal sends a forehand down the sideline, the ball swerving into the right-hand corner and kicking wide, leaving del Potro no chance of a return. That ball was doing all sorts in the air outrageous skill. It sets him on his way to the first service hold of the match.Nadal 1-1 del Potro*. Del Potro charges the net, and engages Nadal in some rat-a-tat volleying. Nadal wins the point by whipping the ball across del Potro and through the deuce court. Nadal earns two break points, and he only needs one. An immediate break back! A couple of unforced errors by del Potro in that game, a forehand ballooned long, another slapped wide left.Nadal* 0-1 del Potro. A shaky start by Nadal, who nets a couple of weak forehands. Then a lengthy rally. It looks as though del Potro is in charge, but a weak approach is returned down the line by Nadal. A fizzer. But Nadal flays a loose shot wide during the next rally, and del Potro has a couple of early break points. Nadal saves the first with an outrageous drop shot, but comes off second-best in a lengthy rally, and the big Argentinian has an early break!Juan Martin del Potro: A Class Act (pt II in a continuing series): Before he got togged up to play, he was pictured out front talking to a bunch of fans in Argentina soccer shirts. All were singing, some were bouncing, most were chugging tinnies of delicious alcoholic lager beer. Every one of them got a hug from their hero. Anyway, over to the umpire: “Take your seats, please, ladies and gentlemen. First set, Rafael Nadal to serve. Ready ... thank you ... play!”The players are on the court! The denizens of the Arthur Ashe Stadium give both men a huge reception maybe the defending champ gets a little bit more love. But these are two popular players. That’s because they’re so damn nice: Nadal says in his pre-match interview that he’ll have to play his best tennis to beat an opponent he respects greatly, while del Potro bridles at the word “rivalry”, which sounds way too aggressive and personal for his liking he’s just playing tennis against a player he admires. True gents. Out on the court, del Potro wins the toss, calling heads correctly, and opts to receive. We’ll be off in a minute!It’s possible that this US Open men’s semi-final will be over in a couple of hours. Yes, it’s possible ... it’s just not very probable. Rafael Nadal and Juan Martin del Potro don’t half enjoy an epic, you see. Nadal has just spent four hours and 49 minutes seeing off Dominic Thiem del Potro needed three-and-a-half hours to dispatch John Isner after four sets and two tie-breaks. And you may recall the pair meeting at Wimbledon earlier this summer that clash took the best part of five hours to complete.The defending champion Nadal is favourite to make it through to the final, holding as he does an 11-5 head-to-head lead over del Potro. He saw off the big Argentinian this year at Wimbledon and Roland Garros, as well as in the semis here at Flushing Meadows last year. But del Potro does have one crumb of comfort: he blasted Nadal off the court here in the 2009 semis, 6-2, 6-2, 6-2, and went on to win the title, ending Roger Federer’s 40-match unbeaten run in the process.So get comfy, it could be a long night. It’s the first men’s semi. It’s the 2009 winner versus the 2010, 2013 and 2017 champion. It’s a battle to face either Novak Djokovic or Kei Nishikori in the final. It’s on!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/711ac3e8613daf07464fb17834b3819110b8332a/0_95_2070_1243/master/2070.jpg?width=500\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3423a077170a3445555198227006877a 1000w","title":"tesla chief elon musk smokes marijuana on live web show","story":"The company’s head of accounting, Dave Morton, and head of human resources, Gaby Toledano, said they were leaving the company, which has been placed at the centre of a string of controversies by its maverick CEO.Morton, who joined the company just one month ago, said he was leaving because “the level of public attention placed on the company, as well as the pace within the company, have exceeded my expectations”.“This caused me to reconsider my future. I want to be clear that I believe strongly in Tesla, its mission and its future prospects, and I have no disagreements with Tesla’s leadership or its financial reporting.”Morton joined the company one day before Musk tweeted that he was considering taking the company private with “funding secured”. The plan was abandoned 17 days later, but not after drawing a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission and a series of lawsuits alleging market manipulation.Toledano, who has been on leave of absence from the company, told Bloomberg she would not be returning to the firm.The pair quit a day after Musk provoked fresh concern after smoking marijuana on a live web show with US comedian Joe Rogan.Musk, 47, spent two-and-half hours on the streamed podcast late on Thursday discussing everything from artificial intelligence and its impact on humankind to flame throwers and social media.Taking a puff from a joint – which Rogan said was a blend of tobacco and marijuana and is legal in California – Musk said he “almost never” smoked. “I’m not a regular smoker of weed,” Musk said. “I don’t actually notice any effect … I don’t find that it is very good for productivity.”Musk stunned investors last month with tweets saying he had funding to take the company private for $420 (£323) a share. He then backed off from his plan saying Tesla was better off as a public company.Asked about the wisdom of smoking marijuana while he is under investigation by the SEC for the “take private” tweet, Musk told the  by email: “ is the most insufferable newspaper on planet Earth”.Musk did not immediately respond to additional questions about his behaviour or comments on the podcast.Earlier this week Musk escalated his baseless attacks against the British er Vernon Unsworth, claiming that the man who helped rescue children from a cave in Thailand was a “child rapist” in an email to a reporter. Neither Tesla nor Musk have commented on the Buzzfeed report.Musk first called the er Unsworth a “pedo” in a July tweet – an unfounded claim against a man who was part of the international team that freed 12 young footballers and their coach from the Tham Luang cave complex. Musk, who had unsuccessfully attempted to assist the rescue mission, eventually apologised to Unsworth.Musk’s behaviour has raised concerns about his leadership and several Wall Street analysts have called for the company to appoint a strong deputy to prop up Tesla’s operations and standing with investors.“We have been calling for a Co-CEO or COO to assist to codifying the leadership structure and in so doing, the culture at Tesla,” said James Albertine, an analyst at brokerage Consumer Edge. “We think this is further evidence that the time is now for management and the board to address these issues.”Many senior executives have quit Tesla recently. In the first three months of the year, the company lost Morton’s predecessor, Eric Branderiz and Susan Repo, who was treasurer and vice president of finance. Chief financial officer Deepak Ahuja retired in 2015, but returned in 2017 after his successor, Jason Wheeler, quit after 15 months.On Friday afternoon, Musk told Tesla employees to ignore what he called “a lot of fuss and noise in the media” in an all-staff email published on the company blog. Musk also announced a number of internal promotions to fill vacant executive positions, including the elevation of Jerome Guillen to the newly created role of president of automotive operations.Many of Musk’s Twitter followers questioned if smoking marijuana was against the company’s policy, while others mocked the CEO’s initial $420 bid, a number that has become code for marijuana.“Elon getting high on weed and whiskey is the first reason to go long on $TSLA in a while. He needs to relax a bit,” one Twitter user said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73f063621de17e3093dacb1df1e895a3bb46cca7/141_355_2869_1722/2869.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6edd522fd3c9989bc2f1d472605d39c0","title":"burt reynolds a life in pictures","story":"The hirsute heart-throb has died at the age of 82.

The move, at a stormy summit in Tehran, left the three countries to paper over their differences through a broadly worded joint statement calling for all sides to back a political settlement to end Syria’s civil war.The outcome of the summit led to warnings from the west that Russia was pushing Syria towards the edge of an abyss, while US officials claimed it had evidence that the Syrian government was preparing to use chemical weapons.At a closing press conference, Russia’s Vladimir Putin and Iran’s Hassan Rouhani openly clashed with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Putin insisted that the removal of terrorists from Idlib was the first priority.Erdoğan at the last minute urged his fellow leaders to include a ceasefire in the text of the final communique, but Putin said the armed opposition groups, including those designated terrorists, were not present at the talks, so no such commitment could be made.It is unclear whether Russia will now order Syrian government forces to pause in the face of Erdoğan’s resistance, and growing warnings from the west of a humanitarian disaster if a full-scale military escalation goes ahead.The UN special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, urged Putin to allow more time for efforts to separate UN-designated terrorists from within the the population of Idlib. de Mistura said this was feasible if Turkey was given time to mobilise civilians in Idlib to send a message to the fighters to evacuate the towns and villages. He held up candles to symbolise the wishes of the civilian population.At the Tehran summit Erdoğan warned: “Any assault, whatever the reason for it, will inevitably lead to a catastrophe, killings and a major human tragedy. We never want to see Idlib to turn into a lake of blood. We have to find a rational way out in Idlib that could meet our security concerns.” He added that millions of refugees would flee towards Turkey if a major attack against rebels took place.As many as 3.5 million people live in the Idlib region, the final enclave holding out against the regime of Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. Almost half of them have been displaced from other towns recaptured by the Syrian government, such as Homs, Aleppo and Ghouta, and have nowhere left to escape within Syria.Erdoğan explained that Turkey had neither “the strength or capability” to host a fresh influx of refugees, raising the prospect that refugees would head to Europe.But Putin insisted that the UN-designated jihadist terrorists inside Idlib had to be removed, and implied that Turkey had already tried and failed to negotiate their voluntary removal to separate them from legitimate opposition groups. Putin said Russia found it “unacceptable” when civilians were used a pretext to “shield terrorists” and target Syrian government positions.He added: “We hope that representatives of terrorist organisations will have enough common sense to stop resistance and lay down their weapons.”Putin’s rejection of a ceasefire was backed by Rouhani, who insisted that there could be no compromise. “It is necessary for the fight to continue until all terrorist groups in Syria, especially in Idlib, are eradicated.” The Russian stance led to condemnation by western diplomats at an emergency meeting of the UN security council in New York. The US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, accused Russia of using the “playbook of death” and said any attack on Idlib would be considered a serious escalation. François Delattre, the French ambassador to the UN, warned that Syria “was at the edge of an abyss”, and said Russia would be held responsible if a massacre occurred.The UK ambassador, Karen Pierce, said there were more babies than terrorists in Idlib, and named the Syrian forces preparing to attack the region, promising that they would be held accountable if indiscriminate attacks on civilians went ahead.John Ging, the UN’s senior humanitarian official, said: “Idlib has the potential to create a humanitarian emergency on a scale not yet seen in this crisis.”HTS is designated by the UN as a terrorist group, and has been sending weaponised drones towards Russian positions. De Mistura has estimated that there are 10,000 UN-designated terrorists in the region. Russia puts the figure higher.Turkish troops are stationed at 12 observation points inside Idlib, over an area of 6,000 sq miles, sent to the region as part of an earlier de-escalation agreement. Turkey will now have to decide how to make sure they do not become collateral damage in the attack. Earlier, the US said there was significant evidence that chemical weapons were being prepared by Syrian government forces. The warning was made by the new US envoy for Syria, Jim Jeffrey. The US has repeatedly said it would not tolerate a chemical attack, but has not said how it would respond.Jeffrey said: “I am very sure that we have very, very good grounds to be making these warnings. Any offensive is to us objectionable as a reckless escalation. There is lots of evidence that chemical weapons are being prepared.”Separately, Russia has warned the US to move a small group of troops out of a base in southern Syria, saying it intends to attack the area where the Al Tanf US airbase is located due to the presence of militants. The Pentagon has ordered its troops to remain at the base."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/282bb0935872a0ae34a3823dc27760b52cbc04d8/0_308_3264_1958/master/3264.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12878b8de138855a5a8e1d8976b10b11","title":"were insubordinate the rural towns at forefront of swedish populist wave","story":"Anti-immigration Sweden Democrats could win control of rural areas on path to real influence nationallyAs you drive through the rich farmland flanking Ringsjön lake in Skåne, the first sign of Hörby is a board proclaiming it “a modern market town with an old heritage”.The slogan may bring sniggers from big-city Swedes, but this small agricultural town is at the forefront of a movement set to shake the country’s political system this weekend: the emergence of the populist, anti-immigration Sweden Democrats as a serious rival to the traditional parties of left and right.“My goal is that we should be twice as big as the next party,” said Stefan Borg, the party’s local chairman, sitting in a cafe off Hörby’s main square as he took a break from campaigning for Sunday’s local and national elections.The party also hopes to win real influence on a national scale. Since the last general election, support for its policies has surged on the back of unease over immigration. Sweden accepted more asylum seekers per head during the 2015 refugee crisis than any other EU country.It is not just Hörby. The Sweden Democrats hope to become the biggest party in 15 of the 33 municipalities in Skåne. “We’ve always had a historical tradition of being sceptical of anything which comes from Stockholm,” Borg said of Skåne and neighbouring Blekinge. “We are insubordinate.”At the Boijertz Conditori, a cafe looking over the square to the town’s jugendstil hotel, a woman selling cinnamon rolls summed up the party’s appeal. “It’s because there have been so many problems, a lot of gang fights, knives, drugs being sold openly on the streets,” she said. “It was a sweet little town. You didn’t have to be scared when you went out. And it’s not like that any more.”One of her customers, Hillevi Gustafson, retorted that this was more perception than reality, pointing to a police survey carried out in December. “It found that more people are feeling unsafe but that nobody had actually had anything happen to them personally,” she said.“It’s a war zone in Malmö,” Karin, one of three sisters at a neighbouring table, chipped in when she overheard us. “The last two years it’s exploded.”On Tuesday, yet another young man was shot dead in Malmö, bringing the yearly toll of fatal shootings in the city’s ongoing gang war to 11, or 3.2 per 100,000 people. The shootings have shocked Sweden, and are comparable to London, which has seen 91 murders so far this year, some of them shootings.Just as they have nationally, the Sweden Democrats here have exploited anxiety over crime. In May, Borg obtained a list of local shelters for asylum seekers and other vulnerable people.“We have 22 so-called HVB homes here where cities like Malmö and Lund put their problem cases,” he said. “It’s not just immigrants, but the majority are. And of course they come here with all the problems they’ve brought from wherever they come from. Drug abuse is very common.”Borg, who describes himself as a translator of Russian religious philosophy in the tradition of Dostoevsky, and his colleague Cecilia Bladh In Zito, a former executive at an Italian power company, exemplify the party’s shift away from the working class.“When I came back here after seven years abroad I was shocked,” In Zito said. “I was like: what has happened?” Even then, it took time for her to become active. “I believed what the TV and newspapers told me, that this was a racist party.”In 2012 a representative of the party in the town, Ronny Esbjörnsson, was caught railing on Facebook against blatte (immigrant) police officers, saying there should be schools exclusively for “ethnic Swedes” and declaring he would rather rent out a property to Hells Angels than Muslims.Susanne Meijer, the town’s Social Democrat mayor, accuses the party of still being racist today. She said she was proud that the town welcomed young asylum seekers, whom she described as “talented and smart kids who are studying and learning how to function in Swedish society”.But she seems to be struggling to convince voters that there’s no reason to be anxious.On the road out to the north, the council has erected another sign: “Hörby: here we live well and we feel good.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3622073.1536345653!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"housing activists take over city centre building in waterford","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tOccupation: protesters at the former presbytery.

There are over 3,000 on the housing list in Waterford, and there are over 110 people homeless in Waterford at present.”She told reporters the activists had chosen the former presbytery, which the council leases from the diocese of Waterford and Lismore, because “it’s city centre, it’s huge, it’s an old building with a preservation order on it, and it’s owned by the council. For that reason we feel it’s something they could act on immediately. It’s nobody’s private property. It’s owned by us. When we think of apartments in the city centre – I’ve lived in them myself – they’re tiny little shoeboxes. This is a huge building that has big huge rooms, and it could be a fantastic apartment block.”After meeting the Waterford protesters, who include housing activists, trade unionists and students, the Garda and council said they could stay in the building until 11.30am on Saturday. They have been told not to go beyond the ground floor, where arts workshops have occasionally been held, because of safety risks on upper floors. A decision on the building’s long-term use is pending."},{"url":null,"title":"it s a huge find megalithic passage tomb discovered in co meath","story":"  July 16, 2018Archaeologists uncover burial chambers on historic Br\u0026uacute na B\u0026oacuteinne heritage site   July 19, 2018Department warned against changes to house built above 5,000-year-old tomb   July 21, 2018Br\u0026uacute na B\u0026oacuteinne finds have captured public\u0026rsquos imagination, and raise questions for the State   September 6, 2018Reports to National Monuments Service include prehistoric barrow cemetery, a henge, ringfort enclosures "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3622098.1536346534!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"arlene foster ordered minister to keep rhi scheme open inquiry told","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFormer DUP minister Jonathan Bell arrives at the RHI inquiry at Stormont Parliament buildings in Belfast. Photograph: Niall CarsonPA Wire.Northern Ireland’s former first minister Arlene Foster “ordered” a party colleague to keep open a renewable energy scheme despite spiralling costs, an inquiry has heard.Jonathan Bell claimed he argued that doing so was “folly” but he was ultimately overruled. He was minister at the Department of Enterprise Trade and Investment from May 2015-May 2016, which oversaw the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme.The scheme was intended to encourage businesses to switch from fossil fuels to green alternatives such as biomass. By the summer of 2015 the cost to the taxpayer was beginning to spiral as firms realised how lucrative the incentives on offer were. At one stage it was feared the scheme could cost the public purse hundreds of millions of pounds.The so-called ‘cash for ash’ scheme caused a political row which culminated in the resignation of deputy first minister Martin McGuinness in January 2017 and the collapse of powersharing at Stormont. A public inquiry set up to examine what went wrong with the scheme heard a claim on Friday that Mrs Foster was giving mixed messages about closing it.Mr Bell signed a directive on January 22nd, 2016 to close the scheme. But the inquiry heard that DUP adviser Timothy Johnston “rescinded” his decision.Mr Bell also claimed that Mrs Foster “created a paper trail” calling for the scheme to be closed, but verbally, her and the DUP’s special advisers were pushing for it to be kept open.According to Mr Bell’s evidence, the situation came to a head during a tense meeting between Mrs Foster and Mr Bell on February 9th.“There was tension, the atmosphere was abusive, Arlene was very abrupt,” Mr Bell told the inquiry. “I said ‘minister, I have made the decision (to close the scheme), we had announced the decision and really are you going to place me in a position ... where in my view I am effectively asking a civil servant to do something that is wrong, and order them to do it’. I wasn’t prepared to do it.“I did argue hard not to do it, but she ordered me to do it.“She said ‘look, I am the first minister, you will follow my order. I am instructing you and reversing your decision’.“I felt bullied into taking the decision because I was taking the decision against my rational judgment.”Mr Bell said Mrs Foster said she wanted to keep the scheme open to consult further with industry. “I thought that was totally unreasonable because we had a scheme that was out of control,” he said.Mrs Foster has given evidence to the inquiry that she was not proposing to reverse the decision to close the scheme completely, but to delay it for several more weeks.Mr Bell’s former special adviser Timothy Cairns told the inquiry the delay in closing the scheme was only to be for another two weeks.During Mr Bell’s evidence, the inquiry heard that several hours after the meeting, there was a second friendlier meeting between the two.At that meeting, Mr Bell said Mrs Foster asked for a two-week extension to the scheme which he agreed to.Mrs Foster and the two advisers have told the inquiry they believe Mr Bell opposed a two-week extension to the closure of the scheme because it made him look foolish.Mr Bell completed his two days of evidence by telling the panel he sacrificed his political career to stop the overspend on RHI.“My only motivation was those hundreds of millions of pounds to get back into the health service and our education system,” he said.“For that, I knew I would have sacrificed my political career.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3621007.1536259861!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"consequences of no deal brexit go beyond what we can imagine","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPolish MEP Danuta Hubner chairs a European Parliament committee that must sign off on any Brexit treaty. Photograph: Carl GibneyDCUThere was an “openness” within the European Union to consider other ways of avoiding a hard border in Ireland to help secure a Brexit deal, an influential European MEP has said.Polish MEP Danuta Hubner, who chairs a European Parliament committee that must sign off on any Brexit treaty, said there had to be “openness” from the UK too to find an alternative solution to the issue. EU and UK negotiators are locked in a political stalemate over agreement on the so-called backstop that would guarantee an open border in Ireland in the event of no deal on future EU-UK trade. “If UK has a better proposal for the backstop, we are open to discuss these things. In a sense, there is openness. It just all depends on whether there is also an openness on the UK side,” she said.The British were offering no solution to maintain an open border in Ireland while London was still sticking with its “red lines” of leaving the EU single market and customs union, she said.Ms Hubner, on a visit to Ireland to speak at Dublin City University’s Brexit Institute, warned of the possibility of the UK crashing out of the EU without a withdrawal treaty being agreed.“We don’t have other options,” she said. “The consequences of no deal, I think, go beyond what we can imagine but we have to be prepared . . . it is a possibility or a likelihood.” The Polish politician told the institute in her presentation that people were “extremely pessimistic” in Europe abut the Brexit negotiations, putting the chances of a deal between the EU and UK at 50:50.She suggested that the UK should seek a Norway-type deal to join the European Economic Area and remain in the single market as Europe could not afford another “very specific, bespoke solution”.“If the Brits were smart, then they should join the EEA and then look for changes later on,” she said.The chair of the European Parliament’s constitutional affairs committee said that Brexit negotiations could slip past a key EU summit in October but November was the final deadline for a deal if EU lawmakers were to ratify it in time for the UK’s departure from the union in March.“It might slip to November and we can still do it on time if we have it in November. Any further delay would really bring a threat of no deal,” she told The  before her address to the institute.Ms Hubner said that the deep isions British prime minister Theresa May was struggling with in her own party on Brexit were “certainly not helpful”.“Whatever she is proposing, she sees two unhappy halves of her government because for some it is not enough for others, it is too much,” she said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Frank Miller  A leading social policy analyst has said up to 30,000 houses need to be built annually to tackle the housing crisis and his message to Government and local authorities is: “Just do it.”UCD professor of social policy Tony Fahey said there is no reason the Government and local authorities cannot press ahead with social housing developments once they ensure work is done in parallel to ensure all important services, such as schools and policing, will be put in place.An apparent focus by Government and some local authorities on seeking that new social housing developments be “mixed-tenure” or not exclusively local authority tenants may be contributing to delays in building, he said.The objections to 100 per cent local authority estates are “completely overdone”, he said. “The concern with mixed tenure is an obstacle to getting the job done and it’s hard to understand where it comes from.”Many well-established developments in Dublin such as Cabra, Drimnagh and Donnycarney started life as local authority estates but became mixed tenure for reasons including tenants buying out their houses and private developers building in those areas as they prospered, he pointed out.Prof Fahey was speaking after Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy had criticised the failure of some local authorities to put in place family hubs as emergency accommodation for the homeless in preference to hotels. The Minister has threatened to use emergency powers to transfer responsibility for emergency accommodation to his own department.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar told RTÉ on Friday there was “no quick fix” to the housing crisis and denied the Government was seeking to put the blame on the local authorities.Prof Fahey said homelessness is “a very small part of the total picture” in a context where nearly 10,000 people are homeless and the Economic and Social Research Institute has said 25,000-30,000 houses need to be provided annually to house those on housing waiting lists.A wide range of possibilities are open to address the crisis, including a return to the large scale housing programmes of the 1930s and 1960s, from which places like Cabra emerged, he said. The Government could direct local authorities to launch a “new wave” of local authority housing and it was up to central government to provide funding for that.Local authorities had built or funded the building of 300,000 housing units in the past and while there was criticism of some developments such as Ballymun, he considered the criticism was “unbalanced” and ignored the achievements.Local authorities had two roles in relation to social housing for most of the 20th century, he said. They provided and managed rental housing, much of which they would have commissioned private developers to build and also provided low-cost loans.After the mid-1980s recession, governments essentially cut off the supply of funding for such loans but the Government’s announcement of a new scheme of lending for home purchase for certain low-income limits was the first indication of a possible return to that earlier function of local authorities.Michael Walsh, chair of the County and City Management Association (CCMA) Housing Committee, said local authorities are at the forefront in addressing the “very challenging” issues faced on housing.“We are absolutely committed to meeting the targets set out for us by Government,” he said.The Rebuilding Ireland strategy sets annual targets for the build, acquisition and leasing of new social housing stock, which have been met each year, Mr Walsh said.The targets for this year, and subsequent years, continue to increase as local authorities accelerate their building programmes, he said.Local authorities are also pleased to facilitate and collaborate with approved housing bodies to deliver new social housing, he added.

Like the doctors who put General Francisco Franco through needless torment for weeks before his death in November 1975, Theresa May’s ministers will stop at nothing to keep her Chequers plan for Brexit alive.\u0026nbspThe Spanish doctors were terrified that the dictator would reap his fiery reward before his courtiers had every detail in place for an orderly succession. For weeks TV news bulletins around the world reported nightly that Franco was not yet dead, inspiring Saturday Night Live’s regular update later confirming that he was still dead.Throughout the summer Conservative Brexiteers have been telling the prime minister that Chequers is as dead as Franco, a diagnosis confirmed this week by EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier.“Les propositions sont mortes,” he told a group of MPs this week, according to Labour’s Stephen Kinnock.The prime minister and her allies insist that Chequers remains a negotiable proposal, pointing out that the EU has not rejected it. It is true that although Barnier has rubbished two of its central elements – single market access for goods and a complicated, dual-tariff customs arrangement – the EU has not yet issued the death certificate. May is confident that, when EU leaders meet in Salzburg, Austria, on September 20th, they will continue to be polite about her proposal even if they restate their commitment to the principles that make it unacceptable.The Brexiteers, who flirted for a while with a no-deal Brexit (even attempting to rebrand it as “WTO rules”), have for the most part woken up to the fact that leaving the EU next March without a transition period would be catastrophic.This shift has been driven partly by the return to the back benches of Steve Baker, long an organising force behind the Brexiteers who as Brexit minister was responsible for no-deal planning. It has been encouraged by Jacob Rees-Mogg, who has been “trying to keep the crazies in line”, according to one source.Rees-Mogg was among the MPs who met Barnier in Brussels this week, and he claimed afterwards that they agreed that the best option consistent with Britain’s red lines was a Canada-style free trade agreement. When Brexit secretary Dominic Raab appeared before the EU scrutiny committee on Wednesday, a number of Brexiteers asked him why the government didn’t abandon Chequers in favour of Canada.One argument Raab made against Canada was that it would not solve the issue of the Border, and would consign Northern Ireland to an indefinite limbo under the terms of a backstop.Richard Drax, a former officer in the Coldstream Guards who represents South Dorset, told Raab that the issue of Northern Ireland had been blown out of all proportion.“Having served out there on three tours, I can tell you that if the Irish Government started to put up some sort of restrictions on the Border there would be an outcry, not just from the North but also from the South. It just wouldn’t happen,” he said.Drax, whose full name is the quadruple-barrelled\u0026nbspRichard Grosvenor Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax, is the great-nephew of the Irish writer Edward Plunkett, Lord Dunsany, who was part of the Irish literary revival in the early 20th century. Dunsany achieved worldwide success with stories and plays set in a fantasy world, and Drax may be engaging in magical thinking when he suggests that the issue of the Border can be ignored.Britain has rejected the EU’s draft protocol on the backstop but its negotiators have shown no sign that they are ready to propose an alternative text.Barnier, however, has sought to “de-dramatise” the issue, stressing that the EU is simply seeking to build on existing checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK for animal and plant hygiene, for example. To this end he has asked Britain for details of how such checks are conducted today.He has also indicated that the EU is willing to change the language of the protocol, which currently includes two phrases that are particularly toxic for unionists on both sides of the Irish Sea. The first refers to the creation of a “common regulatory area” on the island of Ireland, and the second states that “the territory of Northern Ireland...shall be considered to be part of the customs territory of the Union”.The joint report agreed between Britain and the EU last December called only for full alignment “with those rules of the internal market and the customs union which, now or in the future, support North-South co-operation, the all-island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement”.In recent weeks Barnier has referred to a limited number of EU rules continuing to apply to Northern Ireland, a shift that could reassure unionists that the backstop does not undermine the UK’s constitutional order.\u0026nbspRegulatory checks could be conducted at British ports only and not in Northern Ireland because the EU is only concerned with goods travelling from east to west. Northern Ireland’s traders would continue to have frictionless access to the rest of the UK as well as to the rest of the island of Ireland.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Charles McQuillanGettyFor me, I think that quote may be the equivalent of the death blow in Kill Bill. Do you know the one? You get hit just with fingertips, “and then he lets you walk away. But once you’ve taken five steps, your heart explodes in your body, and you fall to the floor, dead.” So with the Northern Ireland secretary’s hot take on Northern Ireland. My mechanism might be shot for good after reading it. I may well be typing my last five steps here.Clearly, it is not simply the initial imbecility of having no clue about the central facts of Northern Irish politics and history, even though you were 28 (twenty-eight) when the Belfast Agreement was signed. It is also the second imbecility of thinking you should ever mention that in public, much less as delightedly, as Karen did. “It’s when you realise that,” burbled the secretary of state, “that you can then start to understand some of the things that the politicians say and some of the rhetoric.”Ideally, you would start understanding these things some decades before you were the cabinet minister with operational responsibility for arguably the most sensitive region of the United Kingdom. Instead, Karen’s breezy My Learning Curve speech casts high office as a remedial scheme for the unreachable outliers of Family Fortunes survey respondents. “We asked 100 people what they imagined were the Ladybird-level facts about Northern Ireland.”Karen’s answer is the type of WTF-ery that allows even Vernon Kay (Vernon Kay) to mug to camera with the practised eyebrow-raise that says: Where do they find these quarterwits? It was previously thought that any challenge to Andrea Leadsom’s position as stupidest Downing Street minister would have to hail from the mineral or at least vegetable kingdoms. But this is quite sensational from Karen. Theresa May’s decision to appoint her to this government of all the talentless underscores exactly where the UK stands. If you hadn’t already swallowed the red pill, you may safely consider Karen’s interview as your dose. No going back now. The answer to the question “How low is the bar?” is: the bar is in another hemisphere. The bar is orbiting Jupiter. There is no bar.Darker portents attend Karen’s predecessor as the British cabinet minster most wantonly and insouciantly unsuited to their job. It’s been a mixed week for Boris Johnson. On the downside for us, Boris has been explicitly backed for the leadership by the cruelly miscast kingmaker Jacob Rees-Mogg. On the upside, Johnson’s statement announcing his orce from his wife, Marina Wheeler, tees up a series of malarial Love Actually plot lines for when he later – or sooner – gets the keys to 10 Downing Street. (And if you’re still doubting the heart-exploding inevitability of that scenario, you must have been watching the global upsets of the past two years on tape delay. Everything that can go wrong does. Buy shares in distilleries today.)As for the coveted endorsement from someone Boris would unquestionably have pitied mercilessly at school (they missed being Eton contemporaries by a year), it came in a radio interview on LBC. “Two years ago, in the Conservative Party leadership campaign, I supported Boris Johnson, because I thought he would deliver Brexit extraordinarily well,” Rees-Mogg intoned, suggesting he has inherited all his father’s gifts of prophecy. “I haven’t seen anything that would cause me to change my mind on that.” Not anything?! Should have gone to MonocleSavers.Yet Boris is undeniably back. He has never been more back. Perhaps the most striking feature of the immediate period is how people decisively written off as wrong’uns in the very recent past are emerging again as comparatively attractive prospects. Two years ago, Michael Gove had been deservedly downgraded to a mere Brutus emoji now he’s apparently a leadership contender once more.Perhaps the preposterous inadequates of the past do all seem like elder statespeople now. Others appear so inspired by their accelerated rehabilitation that they are trying to pull off something similar instantly. Take David Davis, who announced this week that he would attend a Leave Means Leave rally in Bolton “as a matter of principle, to ensure Brexit is delivered”.What can you say? Until about 10 minutes ago, David had spent two years as the cabinet minister literally in charge of delivering it. This is like setting fire to a building, running away, then standing outside telling the emergency services how you’d be handling the rescue differently.Expect plenty more auditions for the role of Captain Hindsight in the weeks and months ahead. First the government and its renegades were post-truth now they are post-shame. – "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3621910.1536344364!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nike ad campaign brings kaepernick back into political play","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBillboard displays Colin Kaepernick on the roof of the Nike store in San Francisco: \u0027Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything.\u0027 Photograph: Justin SullivanGetty Thursday was a key date in the American calendar – the start of the National Football League season.At a packed game in Philadelphia, the Atlanta Falcons faced defending Superbowl champions the Philadelphia Eagles in the opening game of the season. \u0026nbspBut in these highly charged political times, it seems that no part of American life is immune from politics.American football has become embroiled in an increasingly fractious debate over race, patriotism and national identity this past year, with the National Football League (NFL) finding itself at the frontline of Donald Trump’s ire on several occasions. This week the debate intensified after Nike unveiled NFL player Colin Kaepernick as the face of its 30th anniversary “Just Do It” ad campaign.The 30-year-old quarterback has become synonymous with an increasingly bitter controversy over the flying of the American flag at NFL games.The protests began in 2016, when Kaepernick, then a player for the San Francisco 49ers, sat and later knelt during the national anthem, in protest at racial oppression.The main target of the protests was the alleged targeting of African-Americans by the criminal justice system in the United States, following a series of shootings of black men by white police officers.“I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of colour,” he said, after one game. “To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.”Over the following year, the protests grew with hundreds of players “taking the knee” while the national anthem was played before games.The controversy sparked a national debate, with many on the right expressing outrage at what they viewed as players disrespecting the anthem, and others seeing it as players’ right to raise legitimate concerns about race relations.Given the fact that the vast majority of American footballers are black, the debate had a strong racial component.By September last year, Donald Trump had waded into the controversy. At a rally, he called on the NFL to fire players who knelt: “Get that son of a bitch off the field right now, out, he’s fired. He’s fired!”While the NFL has struggled to respond to the crisis – it has now ordered players who plan to protest to stay in the dressing-room during the anthem – Kaepernick himself has struggled professionally due to the controversy.The quarterback has been out of work for almost a year. While some clubs have said it is because his asking price is too high, Kaepernick believes he is being blackballed by the NFL system over his protest. He recently launched legal proceedings against the NFL.This week, Kaepernick returned to the mainstream – with a splash. Nike announced on Monday that Kaepernick would lead its ad campaign. The ad shows a picture of Kaepernick beneath the words: “Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything.”As the NFL’s official clothing partner, Nike is taking an enormous risk by backing Kaepernick. On Tuesday, Nike’s shares fell by more than 3 per cent. During the day #NikeBoycott was trending on Twitter, with some users posting videos of burning Nike apparel.Trump also lashed out on the social media network: “Just like the NFL, whose ratings have gone WAY DOWN, Nike is getting absolutely killed with anger and boycotts. I wonder if they had any idea that it would be this way? As far as the NFL is concerned, I just find it hard to watch, and always will, until they stand for the FLAG!”Whether it will affect the company in the long term remains to be seen. Nike is due to post its earnings later this month, and senior executives will likely shed more light on its decision.In the meantime, there are signs that the NFL controversy may feature as an election issue in November. Republican Senate candidate Ted Cruz, who is facing a tighter-than-expected battle with Democrat Beto O’Rourke in Texas, seized on the issue this week, highlighting his opponent’s support for the protesting NFL players.Noting that former Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had lent his support to Kaepernick, he tweeted: “When a radical anti-Semite, anti-American Iranian dictator emphatically agrees with you, maybe that’s a sign Beto, the NFL and Nike are all on the wrong side of the American people . . .”"},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

But these are the newly “restored” 15th and 16th century wooden carvings of an Asturias church, following the intervention of a well-meaning parishioner.Church authorities have been sent to survey the damage after the resident in the village of Rañadoiro was given permission to take the carvings home for a revamp, resulting in what specialists have called “an absolute disaster”. A figure of the Virgin Mary - previously in a plain wooden finish - now sports a shocking pink robe, the Infant Jesus in her arms dressed in garish green.In another carving, the mother of Christ has been turned from brunette to platinum blonde, her clothes updated to a soft rose hue in a makeover that has drawn comparisons to Barbie.The government of the autonomous community in northern Spain said Friday it had opened an investigation into why the parishioner was allowed to undertake the restoration works despite having no experience.The carvings have been given a major revampGenaro Alonso, the Asturias education and culture counsellor, expressed his “obvious displeasure” at what he described as a “mess”.The parishioner responsible, named by the Asturias paper El Comercio as María Luisa Menéndez, has defended her efforts, insisting the villagers had been pleased with the results.“I am not a professional, simply the figures were horrifying and I wanted to paint them to make them better,” Ms Menéndez, who runs a local news stand, told El Comercio.Another parishioner, who lent his support to Ms Menéndez, said she spent more than a year working on them as she had to give them “several coats”. The figures before their makeoverLuis Suárez Saro, the expert who undertook the last professional restoration of the carvings in 2003, lamented that they had “an enormous historical and artistic value” and were now covered in “a modern paint, of the kind used to paint houses or furniture”. Mr Suárez said it was unclear whether the figures would be able to be salvaged, especially as two of them already had paint finished.The 20th century Ecce Homo style fresco of Christ before and after restoration It is not the first time that amateur restoration works have raised eyebrows in Spain.In 2012, Cecilia Giménez, an octogenarian resident of the Aragonese town of Borja, shot to international infamy with her attempt to restore a 100-year-old fresco of Jesus.The incident, and the inadvertent boon for the town’s fortunes as thousands of tourists flocked to see the botched work, has since been made into a comic opera. Please review our commenting policyMac Miller dies aged 26: Stars pay tribute to US rapper found dead at homeBarack Obama breaks his silence to attack Donald Trump, asking \u0026#39how hard is it to say Nazis are bad?\u0026#39Strictly Come Dancing 2018: twerking, dodgy toes and old spats - what we learned from meeting the class of 2018Teaching assistant lost unborn baby after being kicked in stomach by pupil, GMB poll findsScallop wars isn\u0026#39t over: French and British fisherman fail to finalise dealTiny bird comes out on top in battle against bird of preyGogglebox, episode 1 review: A welcome reunion with our old friends on the couchTrump campaign aide George Papadopoulos jailed for lying to FBI in Russia collusion probeRussian hitmen spent weeks in Geneva before nerve agent attack on Sergei SkripalDozens of Scottish secondaries fail to teach pupils a foreign language for benchmark three yearsJohnny Kingdom, the wildlife expert, dies in digger accident on his farmDuke of York says \u0026#39headbanging nonsense\u0026#39 of house and garage music keeps him calm Youngest Last Night of the Proms soloist urges audience members to clap between movementsTwitter and Facebook criticised after they host instructions on how to build 3D-printed gun Sir Vince Cable announces membership overhaul in bid to spur \u0026#39En Marche!

The rupee fell to 71.785 per dollar on Wednesday, although it recovered somewhat to trade at 71.915 to the dollar in early Thursday trading.This follows a previous drop to a record low of 69.62 rupees per dollar last month, in the wake of the Turkish economic crisis.Decline in the rupee came as investors abandoned emerging market assets - EM equities entered a bear market this week, marking a 20 per cent decline from their peak in January. “Investors who have been on the sidelines may think of the selloff as a good opportunity to start accumulating some oversold emerging market assets,” said Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM. “However, the prospects of more US interest rate hikes, and continuing global trade tensions make it difficult to jump in.” \u0026nbspPresident Trump is expected to announce another round of tariffs on $200bn (£155bn) worth of Chinese goods in the coming days. “Going ahead with these tariffs (will) suggest that a full-blown trade war has just kicked off and more pain will be felt across the globe,” Mr Sayed added. John Ferguson, global economist at The Economist Intelligence Unit, said: “Most emerging-market economies should be able to weather this pace of economic tightening, provided that their trading conditions remain favourable. However, investors are on the alert for financial, economic or political weaknesses.”“The turbulence experienced by Argentina and Turkey in mid-2018 is a reminder of how difficult it can be for policymakers to regain market confidence where external imbalances are large and macroeconomic policy frameworks are fragile.”Mr Ferguson added: “For now, a full-blown emerging-market crisis should be averted, but we expect the number of countries seeing their currencies come under pressure to rise over the next two years.

It is likely that we will see periods of volatility as the global trade dispute interacts with the shift away from easy money.”Trump’s unrelenting trade war won\u0027t push us into a recessionSouth African rand weakens as economy enters recessionChaos in Turkey feeds fears of wider emerging market crisisMeanwhile, Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, noted that the selloff in emerging markets has spread beyond Turkey and Argentina to some of the developing world’s largest economies such as Russia, Mexico, Indonesia and South Africa - the rand dropped on Wednesday after it emerged the South African economy had entered recession.“These economies are seeing a sharp selloff in both stocks and currencies which is unnerving investors, with fears of contagion sending European shares lower and contributing to a softer open on Wall Street,” said Ms Cincotta. “Whilst Turkey and Argentina started out as the weakest links in the EM space, investors have been shaken and are broadly looking to reduce their exposure with investors questioning which economies are most vulnerable and where is spill over likely.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/04/11/forbidden-planet-denmark-street-1.jpg","title":"forbidden planet comic book shop london geek culture neil gaiman","story":"Created with Sketch.Four decades on, the institution is still enjoying a position both at the top of the market and in the hearts of nerds across the landClick to followThe Independent‘What’s lovely to see now is the generation that has come up, those who grew up discovering shops like Forbidden Planet, who are now making the decisions in TV and movies’If you haven’t picked up a comic in a few decades, it might surprise you that buying them – especially American superhero fare from Marvel and DC – isn’t quite as straightforward today as you might remember.Back in the 1970s and early 1980s, American comic books could be picked up in newsagents, often shelved alongside the home-produced titles such as Beano, Misty, Whizzer and Chips, and Warlord.But while you could generally guarantee that your friendly neighbourhood newsagent would be able to procure for you British comics week in and week out, American titles such as Spider-Man were a different matter. Supply was random and the monthly comics would appear in uncertain quantities, and you could never guarantee that your newsagent would get the following month’s Uncanny X-Men, or even that they would get in any American comics at all.And that led to the rise of what is known as direct market, which saw distributors ship brand new comics in the week that they were published straight to a new breed of specialist comic shops that began to spring up around the UK.Today, most towns have a specialist comic shop which works on this model, but one of the most venerable and successful brands is Forbidden Planet, which is celebrating its 40th anniversary and enjoying a position at the top of the market for not only monthly comics but the ever-growing world of geek culture that takes in action figures, toys and collectible movie merchandise.Forbidden Planet is just a shop, albeit a long-running and successful one. But it also occupies a position in the hearts of many consumers of popular culture, both long-standing ones who remember the days when access to comics was not as easy as it is now, and younger fans who have grown up with easy access to the plentiful products of geek culture.“I think I discovered Forbidden Planet, much like everyone else, through those marvellous Brian Bolland ads on the London Tube,” says author, comics writer, and all-round geek culture god figure Neil Gaiman. The ads in question are iconic Brian Bolland is one of the most talented and much-loved British comics artists, who back in the late 1970s was a star of British sci-fi weekly comic 2000AD and his ads for Forbidden Planet, which ended up adorning a million carrier bags, featured a coterie of grotesque characters and the now-famous legend, “People like us shop at Forbidden Planet”.Back when Forbidden Planet had first opened and was in the first few years of finding its feet, Gaiman was years away from making his name as the writer of the long-running comics series The Sandman, his novels American Gods and Good Omens (with Terry Pratchett), much less the TV adaptations of those works. How important was finding this oasis of geek culture to him back then?“I’m not sure I would have survived as a young journalist without Forbidden Planet,” he acknowledges.In those far off, pre-internet days, it was a lot more difficult for fans of geek culture to find each other. You might have been\u0026nbspthe only person in your entire school who read comics. Finding your way to a shop like Forbidden Planet was opening up a world of other people like yourself.As venerable as Forbidden Planet might be, it wasn’t quite the first comics shop in the country. People speak very fondly of a shining light in London’s geek scene in the shape of Dark They Were, And Golden-Eyed (where Forbidden Planet takes its name from the 1956 science fiction classic movie starring Walter Pidgeon and Anne Francis, the forerunner shop borrowed its name from a 1949 short story by Ray Bradbury).Dark They Were, And Golden-Eyed shone brightly for a short time located on Soho’s Berwick Street from the late 1960s. Gaiman vividly remembers bunking off school to head into its dark recesses to discover the latest science fiction books. Plenty of people who became luminaries in the science fiction and comics fields hung out there, from the aforementioned Bolland to Bryan Talbot to Alan Moore.But one regular customer in particular was to go on to shape the future of geek shopping in the UK. Nick Landau produced a comics fanzine and helped organise the earliest comic conventions in the UK, and in the late 1970s he spotted a gap in the market for the growing number of comics fans whose only access to the output of Marvel and DC was their local, haphazardly-stocked newsagents, while the comics put out by independent and underground publishers were practically unobtainable.With like-minded iniduals Mike Lake and Mike Luckman, Landau set up a company to import American comics and get them into the smattering of shops such as Dark They Were, And Golden-Eyed. When they decided to open their own shop in 1978 on Denmark Street, they christened it Forbidden Planet, and together with Dark They Were and the New Cross-situated Weird Fantasy, these were practically the first and only specialist comic and science fiction shops in London four decades ago.Another famous name who cut his teeth at Dark They Were is broadcaster and comics fan Jonathan Ross. When that shop closed in 1981, a lot of the custom gravitated towards the newcomer, Forbidden Planet.“Denmark Street was my favourite Forbidden Planet location,” recalls Ross. “With both Dark They Were and Forbidden Planet, I thought they were remarkable places when I was really young. They had all these comics, and not just the superhero ones, but all this European stuff that these shops allowed me to discover.”Gaiman agrees. “The fantastic thing about Forbidden Planet wasn’t books or comics or magazines but it was the number of intersections that were made … everybody went there and everything came through them. I’ve got friends I’ve had for 30 years who were made in Forbidden Planet, waiting in line to get someone to sign a book or comic.“It was where we found each other, we the geeks, we the few, we the people who loved this stuff and didn’t know if there was anyone else like us.”Most of the biggest names in science fiction and comics have passed through Forbidden Planet at some point, from Douglas Adams (1979) to Mark Hamill and David Prowse (1980) through Stan Lee (1987), Stephen King (1983), Game of Thrones author George RR Martin (2009) and science fiction grandmaster Arthur C Clarke (1986).The shop proved so popular in its early days that they had to open a second store, just round the corner on St Giles Street. Further moves followed, first to New Oxford Street and then to the first Forbidden Planet Megastore on Shaftesbury Avenue, which remains its flagship store today.But more expansion was to come, as with the turn of the millennium geek culture exploded into the mainstream. New Forbidden Planets sprung up, in Birmingham and Bristol, Liverpool and Newcastle.Confusingly, there are actually two companies called Forbidden Planet now, dating back to 1992. Mike Luckman went to New York to open a Forbidden Planet store, while Mike Lake set up a series of Forbidden Planet shops mainly in Scotland and the north of England, trading as Forbidden Planet International. Landau set up the Titan Entertainment Group in 1993, which today runs the Forbidden Planet chain, as well as a major book and comic publishing arm. But they all have their origins in the Denmark Street shop which opened in 1978.“I suppose Forbidden Planet today is more of a pop culture destination that the comic shop it started as,” says Ross. “The big store in Covent Garden doesn’t have that feel of a 1970s comic shop anymore, but it’s an amazing place. I go there fairly regularly and they save my comics for me every month.”​Beano launches new comic strip to support childrens’ mental healthTrailer for Matt Groening\u0027s new Netflix series DisenchantmentGaiman adds:\u0026nbsp“We live in a weird period of geek culture, especially for those of us who grew up with it in the 1970s and 1980s. For a long time I would talk to people in Hollywood and they would tell me that people didn’t like to see science fiction and fantasy in the cinema or on their TVs. What’s lovely to see now is the generation that has come up, those who grew up discovering shops like Forbidden Planet, who are now making the decisions in TV and movies, and they’re the sort of people who can see that isn’t true, that people do love science fiction and fantasy.”Forbidden Planet is now no longer the only specialist geek shop in the country, not by a long way. But it’s probably fair to say that because of the hard work put in to make it a success 40 years ago, there wouldn’t be comic shops in most towns, HMV wouldn’t be selling rows and rows of Funko Pop! Vinyl bobblehead geek figurines, and WHSmith wouldn’t have piles of discounted books about the Marvel Universe or Game of Thrones.And there’s another important change that’s taken place as well, and that’s the clientele. Back when Brian Bolland did his first ads for Forbidden Planet, the “people like us” who shopped there according to his illustrations were outsiders, just like geeks were at the time. And something else as well. Gaiman says:\u0026nbsp“Yes, we were mainly male and mainly in our early twenties. But I absolutely love the fact that this has changed over the years and now it is absolutely no longer true of the fans.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/30/13/frestonia-1.jpg","title":"frestonia squatters london declare independence uk 1970s free independent","story":"Created with Sketch.The Free Independent Republic of Frestonia was born of a generation who knew counterculture as much as precarious living. Now a new book collects photography and stories from the communityClick to followThe IndependentThe community designed a flag, appointed ministers of state – including actor David Rappaport as foreign minister – made their own postage stamps and issued visas for visitorsThere was a lot of talk, in the wake of the Brexit referendum, suggesting that London should stage its own exit from the United Kingdom, declare independence, and ask to rejoin the EU as a nation state.Ignoring for now the fact that not everyone – though\u0026nbspit might seem that way to London – outside the capital voted to leave the EU, it seemed a satisfying, though jokey, postscript to the Brexit vote. Indeed, more than 180,000 Londoners signed an online petition calling for the mayor, Sadiq\u0026nbspKhan, to “declare London independent, and apply to join the EU –\u0026nbspincluding membership of the Schengen zone”.But what a lot of the signatories might not have realised was that there was indeed a precedent for London seceding from the UK. Or at least, one street of the capital.\u0026nbspWelcome to the Free Independent Republic of Frestonia. Or, what’s left of it, which these days amounts to the Frestonian Gallery, keeping the name and spirit alive of one of the most curious episodes in London’s history. It\u0026nbspbegan on Halloween\u0026nbsp1977, when the residents of Freston Road in Notting Dale, West London, which was largely comprised of squats and communes, declared independence.Threatened with eviction, the squatters said they were no longer part of the UK and appealed to the United Nations to send in peacekeeping forces to prevent Greater London Council turfing them out of the homes they had claimed. They designed a flag, appointed ministers of state, and even made their own postage stamps and issued visas for visitors.The short-lived story of the Free Independent Republic of Frestonia has now been documented in a new book of photographs by one of its residents, the photographer Tony Sleep, who was resident on Freston Road from 1974.\u0026nbspSleep describes the Frestonia experiment as “part publicity stunt, part theatrical protest”, and adds that while it wasn’t a serious attempt to break away from the UK, there was never any need to, because what became Frestonia “was already on a different planet”.He writes in the lavish book: “Frestonia was rooted in the counterculture of the time. The period is now dismissed as little more than daft clothes and hair, accompanied by a great soundtrack and the invention of sex and drugs.“It was, we are told, youthful self indulgence that ended badly because it was irresponsible and naive.”Frestonian Gallery)Frestonia was born out of problems that young people will recognise today: the lack of affordable accommodation. Sleep points out that the millennial generation might have a beef with the baby boomers who grew up in the 1960s and 1970s because they had it easy, and accommodation was cheap and plentiful. Not a bit of it, he says.“Rented flats were in very short supply, and mostly slum standard. You might achieve a rented bedsit as long as you weren’t black, Irish\u0026nbspor a dog. Then, as now, landlords wanted ‘professional’ people.“Council housing lists were only for families, and backlogged for decades. Despite what now seem like absurdly low prices, only the wealthy and secure could obtain mortgages at a time before easy mass debts. Less than half the population owned their own homes at the start of the 1970s.”Freston Road, where squatters and activists founded housing coop and community Frestonia\u0026nbsp(Getty)Many of the houses on Freston Road were empty, having been condemned as unfit for human habitation, and most of the residents had been relocated to the new highrise blocks of flats that began to go up in the 1960s and 1970s. There had been a move to demolish the vacant properties, but residents in neighbouring communities had complained that they would be looking out onto swathes of barren, rubble-strewn land that would encourage flytipping, so the authorities decided to take the cheaper option and just leave the buildings standing for a while.Freston Road might have been abandoned, but that didn’t mean it was unused. From 1974, squatters began to break into the empty houses and set up home there Tony Sleep, aged 24 at that time, was one of them.He recalls:\u0026nbsp“Squatting is distinctly equal opportunity. If you can gain possession, it’s yours. This led to an interesting mix of people who had little in common except needing somewhere to live and being poor for one reason or another. While some tried to make their new homes habitable, several houses were quickly wrecked.”Sleep remembers well his first sight of Freston Road. He’d been living in a “dismal rented basement” in west Kensington, but as he and his girlfriend parted company, he needed somewhere else to live, and heard about a street of empty houses. Some of his friends went to have a look and broke into two of the houses.“That night I paid them a visit,” writes Sleep. “Eight people, four guys, four girls, in one candlelit room, the only one that had windows. There was no toilet, no water, no electricity.”But his friends set to work installing plumbing and wiring as best they could, found an old toilet, rescued carpets and furniture from skips, and Sleep asked if he could move in with them.By 1977 Freston Road had settled into an unorthodox community, of sorts. But the attention of the GLC wandered back to these old, abandoned homes, and the squatters were told that they were to be evicted from these properties.The council offered to place the squatters in what were considered “hard to let” properties dotted around London, and some took the flats –\u0026nbspand, says Sleep, were promptly replaced in Freston Road by other people desperate for somewhere to live.\u0026nbspThe GLC announced its intention to bulldoze Freston Road after all, and a meeting was called, attended by 200 people. They decided – inspired by the Ealing comedy Passport to Pimlico – to go it alone. The Free Independent Republic of Frestonia was born. And the battle was on.The Frestonian National Anthem was written (“Long live Frestonia! Land of the free – not the GLC”) and a community newspaper, The Tribal Messenger, was distributed. Frestonia made the international press, and the Daily Mirror ran a piece declaring “All Hall, Frestonia”. The actor David Rappaport was made foreign minister, and playwright Heathcote Williams became ambassador to the United Kingdom.It was all a bit jolly and, of course, more than a pinch of Ealing comedy. But, Sleep points out, Frestonia was also an interesting way of putting British society under the\u0026nbspmicroscope.“Communities are defined, more or less, by what people have in common,” he writes. “That’s usually class, background or aspiration, sometimes race or religion. What people have in common helps them feel safe and valued. What is different can be threatening or isive.Frestonian Gallery)“Families, on the other hand, are a matter of being stuck with people you sometimes struggle to tolerate, let alone like. Frestonia was a bit of both.“Frestonians were, beneath the veneer of pragmatic anarchy, from different cultures. There were the hippies, idealists of a sort. There were the punks, nihilists of a sort. And there were the itinerant street people, whose lack of youth and lost changes gave them a thread of bitterness to chew on together.”Over the next couple of years, fighting the threat of the GLC bulldozers, the anarchic squat collective organised itself more seriously, forming the Bramley Housing Cooperative with an aim that was less about the fun of independence and more about securing the future of the Freston Road community.Eventually, the GLC won the war, and demolition of the squats began in 1983. But the Bramley Housing Cooperative, working with the Notting Hill Housing Trust, continued to fight for Freston Road as a residential area. And, ultimately, they won.Sleep says, “Frestonia didn’t cease when the squats were demolished. How could it? They were only useful ruins. Frestonia was about the people, its improbable family.“If you walk through Frestonia now, there’s little to suggest it is much different from anywhere else. You’ll find a street of small, but perhaps unusually pretty houses, built in the mid 1980s. They look carefully designed, a bit too inidual to be social housing. You may not notice the enclosed communal gardens, or the sheltered housing scheme that the coop insisted on, you won’t know the coop ensured housing for some of the more vulnerable Frestonians.”It might be that Frestonia would be forgotten all together, but for Tony Sleep’s photographic record of the people, events and houses on Freston Road in the late 1970s and early 1980s.‘Pop-up squat’: Activists occupy property to protest Housing BillNew photography exhibition shows the tough reality of squattingChallenging consumption and overwork in a Danish communityThe name does linger on in the form of the Frestonian Gallery, opened in 2017 by Matt Incledon and Rollo Campbell, who have published Tony Sleep’s photographs and recollections in Welcome To Frestonia. A pair of, in their own words, “itinerant art dealers”, they opened the gallery in The People’s Hall, a Victorian building that was once at the heart of Frestonia.\u0026nbspFrestonian Gallery opened in 2017 to remember a most curious episode in London’s history\u0026nbsp(Tony SleepFrestonian Gallery)Becoming appraised of the story of Frestonia, they were introduced to Tony Sleep, and arranged an exhibition of his photographs. They write in their foreword: “It was an exhibition unlike anything either of us had worked on previously. Each day at the gallery provided a steady stream of visitors keen to revisit and share their own personal memories of Frestonia. It would be a nice point at which to say ‘We then decided a book of Tony’s work needs to be published...’ but again, in truth, the decision had been made for us already by the sheer emotional response to this unique exhibition.”Was it all worth it for the Frestonians? Did it make a difference? Tony Sleep closes his remarkable document of this time by musing, “Forty years on, the UK seems to have travelled in a large circle and arrived little the wiser, but probably angrier, more cynical and more ided than ever.\u0026nbspWe are all Frestonians, on this small blue dot in the middle of nowhere.

One believes that the Labour leader’s radicalism in this area is a political weakness or a distraction that should be set aside to ensure focus on domestic policy, the party’s strength. The other side takes the view that not only are there important principles at stake, but that in fact Corbyn has some compelling iding lines to draw here with his opponents and predecessors.\u0026nbspSo long as Corbyn remains leader, it is the latter camp that is likely to win out. The prominence of foreign policy is simply an unavoidable fact of life for any British government or opposition, irrespective of any desire to focus on the domestic. The UK is a permanent member of the UN Security Council, a nuclear power, one of a tiny minority of states capable of projecting military power on an intercontinental basis, and one of the largest economies in the world.\u0026nbspCorbyn’s stances in this area will continue to be shaped by his longstanding worldview, and the fact that the recent furore over his participation in a Palestinian wreath laying ceremony in 2014 has had no discernible effect on Labour in the polls means that there is little incentive for him to change course.\u0026nbspIt may be, however, that the underlying premise of this disagreement at the top of the party is a faulty one. Because when we look seriously at the actual substance of Labour’s foreign policy, what we find is not particularly radical. Corbyn’s personal philosophy on international affairs may be sharply different from that of the political class, but the concrete set of policies Labour espouses under his leadership are (to make a strictly analytical rather than a value judgement), mildly reformist, not revolutionary.\u0026nbspLabour’s current policy position is set out in four key texts: Corbyn’s speech to the foreign policy think tank Chatham House in May 2017, his brief speech in response to the Manchester Arena bombing that same month, a speech to the United Nations in Geneva in December 2017, and the party’s 2017 election manifesto. The defining themes throughout are the importance of international law and the UN system, the value of multilateral and inclusive dialogue to avoid or de-escalate conflict, and the urgency of tackling global poverty and inequality. Scholars of international relations looking to categorise this overall stance are likely to find liberal multilateralism –\u0026nbspa conventional tradition in the academic literature –\u0026nbspto be the closest fit.\u0026nbspThis is not to imply any sense of business-as-usual. Corbyn’s strongly sceptical view of western military interventionism, together with his critique of corporate-friendly globalisation, situate his policy platform firmly on the left-hand edge of the liberal multilateralist paradigm, and at odds with a great many of its adherents. But these are hardly off-the-wall positions in the context of numerous western policy failures (from the Iraq war to the financial crisis) over the past two decades, and align to some degree with a growing disquiet in the centre left of established thinking.\u0026nbspOne of Corbyn’s most ostensibly challenging positions was the one articulated after the bombings in Manchester during last year’s general election campaign, when he argued that a connection exists between western military interventions in the context of the “war on terror”\u0026nbspand the persistence of the terrorist threat. Again, within the academic literature on non-state violence this is an entirely mainstream and unremarkable analysis\u0026nbspwhen taken with Corbyn’s acknowledgement of the importance of other factors, such as the ideological outlook of the terrorists and their socioeconomic backgrounds. It is also a common view amongst the general public, with 53 per cent of those subsequently polled agreeing with Corbyn’s analysis versus 24 per cent who disagreed, and with voters across all parties more likely to agree with him than not. What generates near hysteria from media pundits and political opponents elicits merely a shrug elsewhere.“Radicalism”\u0026nbspis a relative term. While the formal foreign policies of Corbyn’s Labour are hardly radical when set against the spectrums of expert or public opinion, the underlying view of the international scene that guides Corbyn personally on these matters is very much at odds with that of the political class, and this perhaps is the real source of tension.AFPGetty)Like many on the left of his generation, Corbyn is a product of the 1960s peace movement, opposition to the Vietnam war, and the global campaign against apartheid. His worldview is one that sees modern international relations – specifically the large imbalances in military power and economic autonomy – as the product of centuries of formal empire, out of which a more informal system of quasi-imperialism has evolved in recent decades.\u0026nbspThis sharply contradicts the conventional wisdom of the political establishment, articulated by former Labour foreign secretary David Miliband, that “if the world is increasingly ided between firefighters and arsonists then Britain has, for centuries, been a firefighter”. Many in the global south do not recognise this version of history, to put it mildly. For them, and for much of the grassroots left in Britain, global north states such as the UK are not inherently benign actors, and have in fact long presented a challenge, and even a danger to, the nations and peoples of the south. Evidently Corbyn shares this view – an authentically radical one in relative if not objective terms – and this rather than his formal policy programme seems to be the actual cause of the resentment from his opponents and detractors. There is a palpable sense that Corbyn is regarded by a significant number of them as not just mistaken but treacherous – his crime being a refusal to uphold the official faith in the inherent virtue of British power in the world.\u0026nbspUK news in picturesThe poppy sculpture Wave by artist Paul Cummins and designer Tom Piper at IWM North, The Quays, Manchester.

The Prime Minister is on a two-day visit to Northern Ireland. During her visit, focusing on Brexit and the deadlock at Stormont, she will visit the Irish border and discuss the potential impact of Brexit with Northern Irish businessesAgain, however, when we get down to concrete policies, there is little to shock. Corbyn’s vision of future UK relations with the global south were set out most clearly in his December 2017 Geneva speech to the UN, where he advocated for British participation in UN peacekeeping missions, a crackdown on tax havens to help protect the fiscal autonomy of developing states, a marked increase in support for refugees, and a stronger response to global warming. There is little reason to suspect that this is a mild veneer disguising a revolutionary reality. Those who knew Corbyn best during his days in the political wilderness affirm that he could never be heard expressing support for violent struggle, with the hard-left former MP George Galloway referring to him rather sniffily as a “woolly Californian”. So even in that area of foreign relations most closely associated with his radicalism – relations with the global south –there is little in his formal policy stances to seriously offend the average genuine liberal, whatever deeper philosophical differences they may have with him.This potential, practical common ground between Corbyn and more pragmatic elements of the centre left is reflected in the resemblance between his preference for dialogue over conflict and that of Barack Obama. In the American context, Obama was the reaction to George W Bush, just as Corbyn was a reaction in the British context to Bush’s valet, Tony Blair. Although each come from different political starting points, they share a scepticism that conflicts can be solved militarily, and a willingness to point to the experiences of the 2000s to underline the point.\u0026nbspObama’s presidency should not be sentimentalised in hindsight, given, to take one example, the active enabling role his administration took in Saudi Arabia’s devastating war on Yemen, and his culpability in the resulting humanitarian disaster. But on Iran at least, Obama took a view (under considerable fire from his opponents) which Corbyn would recognise, namely that diplomacy is most required precisely with people we dislike, and is almost always preferable to military conflict.\u0026nbspHere, Obama’s approach was a direct rebuke to that of his predecessor. When Iran offered a “grand bargain”\u0026nbspto the Bush administration in 2003, offering to withdraw support for Hamas and Hezbollah, sign up to the Arab peace initiative for a two-state settlement to the Israel-Palestine conflict, and submit to nuclear inspections in return for a normalisation of relations, the offer was summarily rejected by Washington on the grounds that “we don’t talk to evil”. It is likely that a lot of subsequent pain in the region could have been avoided had that door not been slammed shut, and Obama’s push for the nuclear deal during his presidency was part of an effort to revive these possibilities, reintegrate Iran into the international system and thus de-escalate wider conflicts and tensions. The other parties to the deal have worked hard to maintain it after President Trump walked away, demonstrating the fact that its strategic wisdom remains widely appreciated.Miliband (pictured with Hillary Clinton) said: ‘If the world is ided between firefighters and arsonists then Britain has\u0026nbspfor centuries\u0026nbspbeen a firefighter’ – a view sharply contradicted by the Labour leader\u0026nbsp(AFPGetty)Obama was notoriously careful about spending political capital, and his drive to secure the Iran deal resulted in weaker stances elsewhere, not least on Israel-Palestine where he showed a consistent unwillingness to apply the serious pressure on Israel that any fair resolution to the conflict will require. Israel-Palestine is the issue area where Corbyn is politically weakest due to Labour’s much discussed problems with anti-Semitism, but his policy stance itself is an entirely conventional one: support for a two-state settlement with “a secure Israel alongside a secure and viable state of Palestine”. Moreover, the wisdom of emphasising diplomacy over the “we don’t talk to evil” approach is clearly one that could be usefully applied to this case.When Hamas won the 2006 Palestinian elections, a hypothetical Prime Minister Corbyn at that time might have urged the west to take the approach it eventually took with Iran on the nuclear issue: one that says “we don’t like your ideology or your policies, but we recognise that it’s better to talk through our problems if possible”. Instead, the new government was cast beyond the pale and sanctioned, leading to a civil war between the key Palestinian parties, the isolation of Gaza, over a decade of immiserating siege, several rounds of devastating violence between Hamas and the Israeli military, and the total collapse of the peace process. The recent acceptance from Hamas of a two-state settlement (a position long in gestation within its leadership) hints at the possibilities of what might have transpired had the diplomatic approach been taken from the start. Again, a good deal of pain over the past decade might have been avoided.\u0026nbspOne of the reasons that Obama, a cautious moderate, arrived at a similar place to the more philosophically radical Corbyn in respect of the question of diplomacy over conflict is the experiences of the past decade and a half in Iraq and Afghanistan, and in Libya on his own watch. While Corbyn and Obama would disagree about whether these ventures were crimes or merely mistakes, the upshot places them in the same reality. The application of western military force is repeatedly showing itself in practice to be a futile and destructive endeavour, making the search for negotiated settlements, even in situations as unpromising as Syria, the more attractive or least unattractive proposition. Whether one likes it or not, the west is apparently unable to impose its will militarily on the global south as it once could, forcing a shift of emphasis to diplomacy irrespective of whether that is taken up with reluctance or enthusiasm.\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn should back a Final Say on the referendumTrump and Obama’s foreign policies are unexpectedly similarThe deeper trends in international relations are also driving in this direction. The end of the Cold War may have given the west a deceptive notion of its own omnipotence, but the slow and steady return of global south powers such as China and India to the levels of international prestige they enjoyed before the ravages of European colonialism only serves to further underline the point that a reliance on mere strength – military, diplomatic or economic – will not serve the global north states well going forward.\u0026nbspAdjusting to these new realities is proving challenging for some in Washington and London. Senior Obama aide Ben Rhodes referred contemptuously to the US foreign policy establishment as “the Blob”, in his frustration with its resistance to his boss’s approach. Across the Atlantic, one senior British general went so far as to threaten a mutiny if Corbyn made any attempt to “emasculate and shrink” the armed forces. Quite the revealing turn of phrase. But the fact remains that the experience of the “war on terror”\u0026nbsphas been a political disaster for Anglo-American militarism, creating space for less chauvinistic figures –\u0026nbspfrom Obama to Ed Miliband to Corbyn – to emerge from various points on the liberal-to-left spectrum, and raising the prospect of some significant policy changes in the future.\u0026nbspNotwithstanding the current right-wing moment in both the UK and the US, the long-term demographic trends point to an inexorable shift in the political balance of power in favour of the Democratic and Labour parties, both of whom have been experiencing internal left-wing insurgencies to varying degrees. There is now a fair prospect of a future President Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren making some degree of common cause on the international stage with a future Prime Minister Corbyn. And while this would not herald a strictly revolutionary change in Anglo-American foreign relations, it would represent a very real and important departure from the days of Bush and Blair.Enter your

European Union (EU) membership since the 2016 referendum.In total, 59 per cent of voters would vote to remain in the bloc, while 41 percent\u0026nbspwould opt to leave, the survey published as part of

cent voted to remain and 52 per cent voted to leave.\u0026nbspHowever,\u0026nbspthe poll’s author caveated the findings by saying the interview panel was skewed towards remain and some of those who changed their minds did not take part in the original Brexit referendum.Analysis of different polls by seen by The Independent\u0026nbspearlier this week found more than 2.6 million people had abandoned their support for Brexit and now back staying in the EU.If that number had voted to remain in 2016, Britain would still be a member of the EU.\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its own campaign for a Final Say on the Brexit deal\u0026nbspand to date, 750,000\u0026nbsppeople have signed our\u0026nbsppetition calling for a second referendum.Polling expert Sir John Curtice, the author of the new report, cautioned that those interviewed reported they had voted 53 per cent in favour of remain in the referendum — a five\u0026nbsppercentage point higher proportion than the actual vote.“Nevertheless, this still means that there has apparently been a six-point swing from Leave to Remain, larger than that registered by any of our previous rounds of interviewing, and a figure that would seemingly point to a 54 per cent (remain) vote in any second referendum held now,” Sir John\u0026nbspsaid in the report.Speaking at an event to launch it, he added the findings were broadly in line with those of other pollsters, whom he said showed an average of 52.5 per cent support for remain.“Don’t get excited as to think this is some poll that shows a dramatic shift to remain,” Sir John said. “The apparent thin lead that remain have is at least in part built on the potential sand of the responses of those who did not vote two years ago.”Britain is due to leave the EU on 29

I will help bring Europe back to the people and re-establish the bond between citizens and the European Union. I want to kick start a new chapter in the EU.\u0026nbsp“I want to become the EPP\u0027s lead candidate for the 2019 European Elections and be the next President of the European Commission. Europe needs a new beginning and more democracy.”AFPGetty)In recent months Mr Weber has taken a tough rhetorical line on immigration and migration, in an apparent bid to position himself for the role. In January he was forced to apologise for a comment in which he called for a “final solution to the refugee question”. He later said he regretted the choice of words after it was pointed out that they resembled a Nazi slogan.The European Commission president is chosen through a convoluted process based on the most recent set up European Parliament election results.\u0026nbsp The European Council votes by weighted qualified majority for a candidate, taking into account the results of the elections.\u0026nbspEuropean commission member in charge of Brexit negotiations with Britain, French Michel Barnier listens at the President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker speaking at the European Parliament in StrasbourgFrank-Walter Steinmeier, President of the Federal Republic of Germany, delivers his speech at the European Parliament in StrasbourgEuropean Union\u0027s chief Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt, President of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE), addresses the European Parliament during a debate on Brexit priorities and the upcomming talks on the UK\u0027s withdrawal from the EUMichel Barnier, European Chief Negotiator for Brexit reacts during a meeting at the European Parliament in StrasbourgMember of the European Parliament and former leader of the anti-EU UK Independence Party (UKIP) Nigel Farage wears socks with Union Jack flag at the European Parliament in StrasbourgNigel Farage, United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) member and MEP, addresses the European Parliament during a debate on Brexit priorities and the upcoming talks on the UK\u0027s withdrawal from the EUEuropean commission member in charge of Brexit negotiations with Britain, French Michel Barnier gestures  during speeches at the European Parliament in StrasbourgThe President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker (L) speaks with European commission member in charge of Brexit negotiations with Britain, French Michel Barnier at the European Parliament in StrasbourgEuropean Union\u0027s chief Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt, President of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE), addresses the European Parliament during a debate on Brexit priorities and the upcomming talks on the UK\u0027s withdrawal from the EUGerman president Frank-Walter Steinmeier delivers a speech during a plenary session at the European Parliament in StrasbourgThe European Parliament in Strasbourg, eastern FranceEuropean commission member in charge of Brexit negotiations with Britain, French Michel Barnier listens at the President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker speaking at the European Parliament in StrasbourgFrank-Walter Steinmeier, President of the Federal Republic of Germany, delivers his speech at the European Parliament in StrasbourgEuropean Union\u0027s chief Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt, President of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE), addresses the European Parliament during a debate on Brexit priorities and the upcomming talks on the UK\u0027s withdrawal from the EUMichel Barnier, European Chief Negotiator for Brexit reacts during a meeting at the European Parliament in StrasbourgMember of the European Parliament and former leader of the anti-EU UK Independence Party (UKIP) Nigel Farage wears socks with Union Jack flag at the European Parliament in StrasbourgNigel Farage, United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) member and MEP, addresses the European Parliament during a debate on Brexit priorities and the upcoming talks on the UK\u0027s withdrawal from the EUEuropean commission member in charge of Brexit negotiations with Britain, French Michel Barnier gestures  during speeches at the European Parliament in StrasbourgThe President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker (L) speaks with European commission member in charge of Brexit negotiations with Britain, French Michel Barnier at the European Parliament in StrasbourgEuropean Union\u0027s chief Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt, President of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE), addresses the European Parliament during a debate on Brexit priorities and the upcomming talks on the UK\u0027s withdrawal from the EUGerman president Frank-Walter Steinmeier delivers a speech during a plenary session at the European Parliament in StrasbourgThe European Parliament in Strasbourg, eastern FranceIn 2014 this meant picking the “lead candidate” from the group which won the biggest candidate at the elections – in that case the EPP.

It\u0027s the political equivalent of dismembering yourself.”And Ben Bradshaw, who backs the People’s Vote campaign, said: “We now know the government is preparing for Brexit in the same way they’d approach catastrophes like flooding, a disease outbreak or a terrorist attack.

I’m kind of hoping they’re not right.”Lord Blunkett, a Labour MP for 28 years and a minister for most of Mr Blair’s administration, said he was not sure if he would back the party even if he knew his vote would make the difference between Mr Corbyn becoming prime minister or not.Asked what he would do in these circumstances, the Labour peer said: “It would entirely depend on whether my good friends in the Parliamentary Labour Party and the Commons hadn’t been deselected and were there to ensure that the sane, rational policies of a Labour Party for the future were going to be implemented.”But Mr Blair’s intervention sparked a backlash from Mr Corbyn’s supporters, with MP\u0026nbspChris Williamson\u0026nbspsaying he did not understand Mr Blair’s argument, given the huge support Mr Corbyn enjoyed in the party membership.He said: “The Labour Party has never been more united.

This is a fight for the soul of our party and the future of our democracy, Ms Pressley said. That movement is reshaping a Democratic Party still searching for leaders and identity in the era of Donald Trump.\u0026nbspGrassroots activists on the left have a mixed record in Democratic primaries this election year, but the self-described progressive movement has scored enough victories to suggest its popularity is based on more than just protesting the Trump White House. The movement is also remoulding the Democratic Party into a younger, more erse and decidedly liberal party.\u0026nbspAyanna Pressley and New York\u0027s Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, two women of colour, both defeated Democratic incumbent congressmen in their primaries. The progressive movement has helped nominate three black Democrats for governor\u0027s seats, including a clear upset in Florida, where Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum knocked off establishment favourite Gwen Graham. Mr Graham\u0027s establishment credentials could not have been stronger. Her father, Bob, is a Florida icon who served as governor and US senator.\u0026nbspGeorgia\u0027s Stacey Abrams, meanwhile, trounced a primary opponent recruited and backed by much of her state\u0027s Democratic old guard. Ms Abrams would become the first black woman elected governor in any US state.\u0026nbspScores of other down-ballot candidates are running for local, state and federal offices with backing from grassroots groups like Inisible, MoveOn.org, the Working Families Party and the offshoot of Bernie Sanders\u0027 2016 presidential campaign, Our Revolution.\u0026nbspWhy it mattersThe ersifying, more liberal slate will be measured by the outcome in the November vote.\u0026nbspRepublicans — and some Democrats — argue that the party is going too far to the left for American voters, particularly outside of the cities and close-in suburbs where Democrats\u0027 base of white liberals and non-white voters is concentrated.\u0026nbspProgressive nominees like Ms Pressley and Ms Ocasio-Cortez are running in Democratic strongholds, so their wins in November are all but guaranteed. But Republicans will use the rise of the left — and its support for policies like single-payer health care and scrapping US Immigration and Customs Enforcement — to tar all Democratic candidates.\u0026nbspThe counter argument from Democrats and activists on the left is two-fold: 1) Many issues that more liberal candidates support — some gun regulation, expanding Medicaid, raising the minimum wage — actually have widespread public support, even among independents and some Republicans and 2) the more openly liberal candidates from outside the old-guard establishment can bring in new voters who do not regularly cast midterm ballots.\u0026nbspBeyond November, the new generation of Democrats will have a say in how the party governs. Ms Pressley and Ms Ocasio-Cortez will not determine whether Democrats pick up the 23 new House seats they need for a majority, but they will help shape the arguments within the Democratic caucus.\u0026nbspThey and their fellow freshmen will have a say in whether a new Democratic majority returns Nancy Pelosi to the speaker\u0027s chair. They will have leverage — much like the arch-conservative Freedom Caucus does with the House GOP leadership — over every debate, from health care to the potential impeachment of Mr Trump.\u0026nbspSo, for example, while there might not be enough support for a real push toward single-payer health care, the movement could draw the party toward supporting a public health insurance option to compete alongside for-profit companies selling policies in Affordable Care Act exchanges. And, even if an immediate $15 minimum wage is too heavy a lift, perhaps the left-flank forces a compromise of graduated raises over time.\u0026nbspWhat to watch out for\u0026nbspDelaware Democrat challenges incumbent as part of \u0027blue tsunami\u0027Democrats take double-digit lead over Republicans ahead of midtermsDemocrats need to focus on young people in the 2018 midterm elections Trump unprepared for impeachment and Democratic takeover: reportSanders-backed progressive could become Florida\u0027s first black governorBefore primary season concludes, there are a few more key match-ups to measure the left\u0027s influence. In Delaware, military veteran and activist Kerri Evelyn Harris is aiming on Thursday to knock off moderate Democratic Senator Tom Carper. She is a big underdog, but even a competitive finish will serve notice anew that incumbents must at least contend with the left base. Similar dynamics exist in New York, where actress Cynthia Nixon is trying to topple Governor Andrew Cuomo in a 13 September primary.\u0026nbspSome of the most intent observers of the party\u0027s evolution are the gaggle of aspiring presidential candidates. Certainly, some of those figures have helped drive the shift — Mr Sanders and his 2016 campaign, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and her outspoken economic populism.\u0026nbspBut Mr Sanders, Ms Warren and the rest are also careful to watch the base and not get caught flat-footed as it evolves. That is one reason potential candidates like Senators Cory Booker and Kamala Harris and former Vice President Joe Biden have made sure that their endorsement and campaign finance activity this midterm cycle has ned the spectrum of the party\u0027s down-ballot candidates: If the so-called progressive movement becomes the centre of the party, no one who wants to be the Democratic presidential nominee boxed out.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/04/14/xi-jinping-china-africa.jpg","title":"china africa bejing forum investment interest free loans","story":"Created with Sketch.China\u0027s Xi Jinping\u0026nbspsays\u0026nbspinvestment comes with \u0027no political strings attached\u0027Click to followThe IndependentChinese President Xi Jinping, centre, with South Africa\u0027s Cyril Ramaphosa, centre left, and other leaders behind, attend the 2018 Beijing FOCAC summitRepresentatives from\u0026nbspalmost every country in Africa dined with Xi Jinping on Monday night as they attended what is believed to be the largest gathering of African heads of state ever staged\u0026nbspoutside the continent.They had plenty to toast, after China’s President Xi pledged new infrastructure investments in their countries of $60bn\u0026nbsp(£46bn) ning the next three years.The latest investment\u0026nbspis in addition to the $60bn\u0026nbsppledged back in\u0026nbsp2015, and promises to continue the remarkable growth of China-backed building projects across the African segment, known as the Belt and Road Initiative.China now far outstrips the economic clout and engagement in Africa of either the US or Europe, and its involvement has inevitably sparked criticism.Malaysia’s prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, warned against what he called a “new version of colonialism” last month when he cancelled a $20bn Chinese-backed rail project.And in his speech addressing leaders at Beijing’s Great Hall of the People, Mr Xi appeared to acknowledge these concerns, saying Chinese investment came with “no political strings attached”.“China does not interfere in Africa’s internal affairs and does not impose its own will on Africa,” he said. “More than 1.3 billion Chinese people and more than 1.2 million African people have always pursued a shared future.“We respect Africa, love Africa and support Africa.”Since Mr Xi’s announcement, African heads of state have similarly sought to play down any suggestion that China’s interests are in anything other than mutual economic growth.Zimbabwe’s newly elected president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, hit out at critics of China in an interview on state TV.“There is now a transition to a new world order and those who don’t see it are blind,” he said.Cyril Ramaphosa, South Africa’s president, said the Forum on China–Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) in Beijing was working towards “a vision that has been crafted in Africa, by Africans… of an integrated, prosperous and peaceful Africa”.May overlooked a vast humanitarian crisis on her Africa tourNever mind Brexit, the South Africans will love us after May’s dancingTheresa May’s visit to Robben Island is insultingThe UK securing trade deals in Africa doesn’t make much senseMay makes ‘unashamed’ vow to use aid to boost UK firms in Africa“FOCAC refutes the view that a new colonialism is taking hold in Africa, as our detractors would have us believe,” he added.Rwanda’s Paul Kagame, the current African Union chairman and a fierce critic in the past of foreign aid, said he considered China to be a “more respectful partner” than either Europe or America.“The relationship between Africa and China is based on equality, mutual respect and a commitment to a shared well-being,” he said. “Our growing ties with China do not come at anyone’s expense.”Some experts are not so sure. The International Monetary Fund warned in April that at least 40 per cent of low-income countries in Africa are either in debt distress or at high risk. Since the last FOCAC forum in South Africa in 2015, a number of countries have attempted to restructure their debt.But Chinese officials have previously denied taking part in so-called “debt trap” diplomacy, and on Monday Mr Xi said government debt from China’s interest free loans due by the end of 2018 will be written off for indebted poor African countries.“Unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise,” Mr Xi warned, an apparent reference to an ongoing trade war between his country and Donald Trump’s America.“China-Africa cooperation under the BRI (Belt and Road Initiative) is a way to common prosperity that brings benefits to both our peoples.”The only African country not represented in Beijing at the summit, which continued on Tuesday with meetings between business leaders and entrepreneurs, was newly-renamed eSwatini, formerly Swaziland.That’s because it is now the only nation left in Africa still conducting diplomatic relations with Taiwan, the self-ruled territory claimed by China. Beijing refuses to do business with any country that maintains ties to Taipei – business which the rest of the African continent has decided it cannot afford to lose.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/23/13/Gaza-Palestine-fuel-Israel.jpg  width= 2221  height= 1666  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/23/13/Gaza-Palestine-fuel-Israel.jpg","title":"israel embassy paraguay jerusalem tel aviv netanyahu","story":"Created with Sketch.\u0027Israel views very seriously Paraguay’s exceptional decision which will strain the relations between the countries,\u0027 says office of\u0026nbspPrime Minister Benjamin\u0026nbspNetanyahuClick to followThe IndependentIsrael hits back at Paraguay after it moves embassy back to Tel Aviv from JerusalemIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ordered the closure of his country\u0027s\u0026nbspembassy in Paraguay in response to a\u0026nbspdecision by the South American nation to move\u0026nbspits own embassy back to Tel Aviv from JerusalemThe decision by newly-elected President Mario\u0026nbspAbdocomes\u0026nbspcomes\u0026nbspjust months after his\u0026nbsppredecessor, former President Horacio Cartes, opened the embassy in Jerusalem in May.\u0026nbspThe city of Jerusalem has been a fundamental issue in tensions between\u0026nbspIsrael and the Palestinian, and the latest moves will be a set-back to Mr Netanyahu.Donald Trump controversially broke from decades of American policy, when he announced a new US policy last year that recognised Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.

It is set to be a key moment for the new coalition.Ahead of the proposed 2019 budget, Italian lawmakers have called for a \u0026ldquoPlan B to be prepared, meaning an exit from the eurozone for Italy.Speaking to CNBC, Jim McCaughan, CEO of Principal Global Investors said: An Italian exit from the EU and an Italian exit from the euro would be a very, very painful event for the European and therefore world banking system.\u0026ldquoIt could require the biggest bank recapitalization ever, bigger than the US in 2008, so there is that tail-risk.                \u0027Brexit is the END of political order\u0027 MEP attacks struggling EU                 French leader says Brussels being \u0026lsquoCRUSHED\u0026rsquo by its own bureaucracy With public opinion in Italy remaining pro-EU, so long as that stays, I think they are not going to get into that kind of tension.In May, Italy was plunged into a political crisis after President Sergio Mattarella rejected the nomination of anti-euro economist Paolo Savona to become Finance Minister.Instead, Mr Mattarella instilled a former International Monetary Fund official Carlo Cottarelli as interim prime minister until new elections could be arranged. Since then, the\u0026nbspFive Star Movement\u0026nbspand the\u0026nbspLega Party have reached an agreement and since\u0026nbspformed a new government, led by\u0026nbspGiuseppe Conte.The increasing support of populist parties at the last Italian election triggered the concerns of the EU as both the right-wing Lega and centrist 5 Star Movement (M5S) called for extensive reform of the bloc and called for a referendum on eurozone membership.Brexit news: An Italian exit from the Euro could spell disaster for world banks warns an expert  (Image: CNBC)At the time, M5S politician Fabio Massimo Cataldo said a future Italian government will shield Britain from any attempt by the EU to take revenge for Brexit.Mr Castaldo said the UK\u0027s decision to pursue Brexit was also \u0026ldquoa matter of respect for democracy.He said: \u0026ldquoWe will try to do our best to bring political pressure (so) that the process will be fair and there will be no attempt for any kind of punishment of the UK.

But one of ­Parliament’s biggest secrets is that most of the men and women in it are actually pretty decent.What rightly makes voters angry with Parliament is that it doesn’t look like the country it represents, and approves policies that often make the world a worse place. In the current Parliament, 29 per cent of UK-educated MPs went to private schools.This is a record low, but it is out of step with the public, which is around seven per cent privately educated. Only 32 per cent of MPs are women, and 7.8 per cent are from ethnic minorities, while roughly 14 per cent of the general population is black or minority ethnic.The majority of MPs were already working in politics before being elected or held well-paid jobs as lawyers.In my new book, Why We Get The Wrong Politicians, I’ve discovered one of the main reasons why only well-off people become MPs. It’s because they have to spend tens of thousands of pounds of their own money on standing for Parliament.I asked 532 candidates who stood in the 2015 election how much it had cost them, and was shocked by the answers. The average cost for all candidates, whether they were standing in a seat that they’d certainly win, one where they might win or a no-hope constituency, was £11,118.For those who had to fight in marginal seats, the costs were even higher. Conservatives who won their seats spent £121,467. Their colleagues who failed to win still lost an average of £18,701.Labour was no better. If you won your seat, you lost around £19,022, but those who failed to get elected spent even more — £35,843.Some spent money they had saved to buy a home. Others maxed out their credit cards and are still paying off the debts today. This money didn’t go on leaflets or any of the other official campaign spending that is tightly regulated.Instead, it was working for free for up to two years, travelling around and sometimes even moving to the constituency, and attending local events. One broke candidate needed help from members of her party to pay her mortgage. She didn’t even win her seat.Another ex-candidate was delighted when he landed a new job and could afford to buy a house — before he realised he’d spent the deposit on campaigning, ironically for the “party of home ownership”.This ludicrous cost excludes so many people who would make much better MPs than the ones we currently have. MPs do not really do the job they’ve been elected to perform, anyway.The pressure is for them to do as their whips tell them, rather than to look at the legislation going through the House of Commons. Most vote on bills without realising what they might entail.Even when they are appointed to the bill committees scrutinising every line of a law, MPs in the governing party are told to sit quiet and vote with the Government every time. Many write their Christmas cards in these committees.From the “bedroom tax” to interventions in Iraq and Libya, MPs have failed to notice problems before they turn into real crises.It doesn’t have to be like this. The parties could pay their candidates to stand. The Conservatives have already announced a modest bursary fund, and Labour has toyed with the idea too. Other groups should stump up some funding as well.The Women’s Equality Party, for instance, is stunningly well-funded but has little chance of getting an MP elected. It would be much better to use that money to get more women MPs in all the political parties. Currently MPs don’t have to take any responsibility for approving dud policies.My book suggests a new stage for legislation, called “Public Payback Panels” where people directly affected by a government policy could ask the minister and members of the bill committee who approved it to explain why they voted the way they did.This would encourage politicians to take their job seriously and really look at the laws they were approving.If this doesn’t change, MPs will still have the most expensive job interview on Earth — and will then be told when they arrive in Parliament not to do their job.

The company should be renamed Two-Facedbook.Lucy McHugh’s body was found in Hampshire woodland six weeks ago. She had been stabbed to death.Police arrested Stephen Nicholson, 24, a care worker who had been living with Lucy’s family, on suspicion of murder and sexual activity with a child.Nicholson admits being in contact with Lucy via Facebook on the evening before her disappearance and on the morning of the tragic day. But he refused to give police his Facebook password so they could check what was said.Nicholson was prosecuted for refusing to cooperate with the investigation. His lawyer said his client was afraid cops would find evidence of his involvement with cannabis.The judge dismissed this excuse as “wholly inadequate”, surely putting it mildly.Last week Nicholson was jailed for 14 months for preventing police from checking his messages. In the UK, failing to cooperate with police is an offence under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act. He got a much longer term than he would ever get for smoking dope.Meanwhile Facebook — a US company not bound by our laws — refused a police request to divulge Nicholson’s password.Detectives had to apply to the US authorities for an order giving access to Nicholson’s account. That process could take many months.Facebook insists it cannot give police quick access, because of its commitment to privacy and freedom of expression. That excuse sounds even more pathetic than Nicholson’s dopey cannabis story.Yes, privacy and free speech are crucial principles to defend, including online.But in practice, Facebook has as much regard for those freedoms as a police-state apparatchik.Its bosses’ one serious commitment is to their freedom to rake in cash. They monitor our private lives and make money off our likes and desires.Facebook and other tech giants use our online activity to target advertising and allow companies access to our data. As for free speech, Facebook has been busy closing right-wing pages that do not suit its leftie Silicon Valley tastes.It says it will not tolerate “hate speech and harassment”. When it comes to child murder suspects, it apparently takes a more liberal attitude.Facebook has bizarrely chosen the case of Stephen Nicholson to strike a phoney pose as a stalwart defender of privacy and freedom.Double standards don’t come much lower. This looks like a grossly misjudged attempt at moral grandstanding designed to repair Facebook’s right-on reputation.It appears more likely to have the opposite effect, lowering its standing still further.We should never take the issue of privacy and state intervention lightly. In a free society, the police should not be given licence to pry and poke into our affairs and online activities as they see fit.We must be on our guard against the creeping advance of state snooping.But the demand for privacy can also be used to the detriment of a free and civilised society. After Sir Cliff Richard won his privacy case against the BBC over the reporting of a police raid on his home, many have demanded “Cliff’s law” be enforced to prevent the media naming those suspected of serious crimes.In a terrible case such as the murder of Lucy McHugh, it surely ought to be possible to work out a fast way to access the chief suspect’s Facebook account — he having chatted with the victim shortly before she disappeared — without declaring open season for police snoopers.The law must be changed to help police get data in cases like this — so long as that law is tightly framed and properly scrutinised.Facebook can posture and hide behind the US courts but our media is subject to a full book of laws that have empowered police and state agencies to demand news- papers hand over sensitive information and name their confidential sources. No passwords required. Some publishers, it seems, have more freedom than others.Facebook’s two-faced bosses should be brought to book for their double standards on privacy and their blatant disregard for the public good.

They do not like Jews.The evidence for that is so categorical and so widespread across the left of the party that nobody can doubt it now.Certainly I don’t. Nor does our Jewish community, which is genuinely worried by the ­hideous Corbyn.If you’ve got your doubts then I just don’t know what WOULD convince you.Maybe CCTV of Corbyn torching a synagogue and screaming “Intifada!” Would that do it? Or would you respond by saying, ah, he was actually worried that the people inside the synagogue might be a bit cold. That’s why he threw the firebomb in.Or maybe the excuse Corbyn himself comes up with, every time. It wasn’t me! I wasn’t there!Then, when it’s proved that he was: “Oh, um, yes. But I didn’t really know what I was doing.”As I’ve said before, Corbyn’s defence is always to portray himself as a complete moron who doesn’t know where he is or what he’s doing. It doesn’t wash. He’s an anti-Semite.But there’s another group of people who know this only too well. And they’re doing very little about it.That’s the Labour MPs. The ones who cannot abide Corbyn and Momentum and want him gone. The Old Labour Party, the one we used to have before the lefty infants took over.But they do nothing. Not a thing, apart from moan quietly in the background.If ever there was a time for a split, for a new party to be formed which might capture the attention of the voters, this is it.But they don’t have the balls. Or they are scared to lose their safe seats and their nice incomes. That’s probably a false hope too, mind. Corbyn isn’t going anyplace anytime soon.And if he did another lunatic would take over who might conceivably be worse. And Momentum now control the entire party. So, one after another, the moderate Labour MPs will be deselected and lose their seats anyway.The ones who think Israel has a right to exist.The ones who don’t think Cuba and Venezuela have particularly brilliant governments.The ones who don’t want to police newspapers which don’t agree with them.The MPs whose first consideration is poverty and inequality, not identity politics and fatuous agitprop grandstanding.So far only one of these has made a stand — the excellent Frank Field. He has resigned the Labour whip, disgusted at ­Corbyn’s anti-Semitism.All it would take is three or four more and suddenly we would have a new political party.So, what about it, Kate Hoey? And the former Blairite, Caroline Flint? And Ben Bradshaw? And John Mann?Are you telling me you’re happy where you are, in today’s Labour Party?

Neo Nazis. People with posters of Hitler in their bedrooms.I daresay there are a few nasty types on those marches who wish there was still a Gestapo. But I think the vast majority of those demonstrating are ordinary German citizens, sick of what has happened to their country.And the same thing has been happening across Europe.It’s not the far right at all, no matter how often the liberals tell you it is.GREAT call from the President of the Philippines, a bloke called Rodrigo Duterte.According to him, if women want to avoid being raped they should not be so beautiful.Maybe they should have all their teeth removed? Men won’t want to give one to someone who is totally toothless. It’ll put them off completely.The women could also slice their noses off.Or have facial surgery to make them resemble an anteater or a pipistrelle bat.The world has its fair share of dimbo leaders. But Rodrigo is right there near the top.SO the latest plan is to put road markings on the pavement.It’s so zombies attached to their iPhones, staring at the ground, don’t walk into the middle of a road or off the edge of a cliff.There has been a rise in accidents involving pedestrians who are locked tightly into their own little world.I have been nearly flattened by joggers immersed in some crap pounding through their thick skulls. And nobody talks to anybody any more. We discuss banning the burka from public spaces.But is there anything more antisocial than someone with their head down, oblivious to the world around them?ANNOYED that her partner had allegedly cheated on her, Serena Reynoldson filmed herself pouring bleach into his tropical fish tank while cackling, “Die, die, die!” Which is what they did, of course.I think her ex, Jon Fitzpatrick, is well out of it, frankly.It all seems a bit hard on the poor fish. So far as we know, they hadn’t cheated on Ms Reynoldson. Mr Fitzpatrick also had a snake, which was lucky to get out of the place alive.I think the moral is if you’re going to upset your missus, make sure you have pets that can look after themselves. A Tasmanian devil, say, or a king cobra.WHY has Jose Mourinho not been sacked by Manchester United?I don’t mean because his team are not terribly good. Or about as pleasing to watch as John Prescott eating a curry.But he’s just been handed a one-year suspended prison sentence and hit with whopping fines – for tax evasion running into the millions of pounds.Does Manchester United not have any principles?I’LL be glued to the box watching The Mighty Redcar on BBC2 tonight. Seeing that the town is only a stone’s throw from my gaff in Saltburn.I was worried at first that it was just another poverty-porn film.You know, when the BBC turns up somewhere north of Watford so everyone can have a good old snigger at the people who live there.But having spoken to some of the people who took part, it isn’t like that at all.Redcar’s had it rough and wages are low. Both Labour and the Tories have let down the steelworkers, who are no more.But there are plenty of new businesses thriving, beyond the BBC’s cameras.Redcar will be just fine in the end, just as it was when I lived there in the Seventies.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Raising it further will kill aspiration, investment and jobs.To help the poor, CUT their taxes instead.WE’RE not swallowing the Treasury scares about jobs being at risk if restaurants are made to put calorie counts on their menu.Food apps can assess a dish’s calories in moments. Totting up a menu is a few hours’ work once in a while.Better that than impose more nanny-state taxes to crowbar diners off grub they like. It’s far more likely to persuade them to pick a healthier option too.The problem is enforcing it. We don’t want council “calorie cops” giving firms a hard time. But someone has to check the figures are accurate. Which DOES sound like a recipe for red tape.It’s a decent idea . . .

The stitch-up reeked.When MEPs found out, even the European parliament was appalled.The improper manoeuvre will keep Selmayr, a devout federalist, at the centre of power for years to come and long after his patron Jean-Claude Juncker has retired to spend more time with his wine cellar.How did they pull it off?The outgoing secretary-general had told Juncker, privately, he would retire this year.Armed with Juncker’s inside knowledge, Selmayr successfully applied to be deputy.Then, at a meeting of commissioners, Juncker revealed the secretary-general post was suddenly vacant and that, as luck would have it, Selmayr was ready to fill it.The ombudsman’s conclusions on what the pair did are scathing. Four serious breaches of protocol and maladministration are listed.Selmayr did not take appropriate measures to avoid conflict of interest. The rules of procedure were broken.“A situation of urgency to fill the post of secretary-general was created artificially,” O’Reilly says, and: “The commissioners  responsible for the maladministration in this case. It is extraordinary that no commissioner seemed to question the secretary-general appointment procedure, which in the end raised valid widespread concerns.”Extraordinary is putting it mildly.The report makes for shocking, if not surprising, reading. The rules-based Brussels order and its highly paid apparat behave like a gangster racket.Just to be helpful, I’m going to send a copy of O’Reilly’s report to every EU flag-waving “People’s Vote” campaigner and to Gary Lineker, the crisp- toting TV football host, who has emerged as a leading voice in the campaign for a second referendum.Needless to say, Selmayr and Juncker face no sanctions or punishment.Instead, O’Reilly recommends that the commission should develop a new procedure — I’m sure that will help — for appointing the next secretary-general.My first thought on reading her report was that the commission is an even more appalling and arrogant organisation than it looks, sitting at the heart of an imperious EU wedded to ever-closer integration.Thank goodness we’re leaving. But are we?To listen to the hysterical wailing of the People’s Vote crowd in recent weeks, you would think that Brexit is about to be stopped and a grateful public will beg to be bossed around by Selmayr and his goons for years to come.There isn’t the parliamentary time for another referendum before we leave on March 29 and it’s an exceptionally duff idea regardless.If there can be two referendums, why leave it at that? Why not make it best of three or five? The decision to leave has been taken. Britain is quitting the EU.Thank goodness, in my view a shame, in the view of others — what matters now are the terms.Here, the Tory party is engaged in a row with itself over the Prime Minister’s Chequers proposal, which envisages Britain sticking with the EU’s rule book on goods.It is astonishing to see how purist this has made some of my fellow-Brexiteers who spent years before the referendum acknowledging in private that there would have to be compromises.Not long ago, Boris Johnson was so torn by the nuanced arguments on either side that he plumped for Leave by the narrowest of margins. Now he plays the zealot.But contrary to the prophets of doom, the Chequers proposal isn’t dead yet.No10 is adamant that it has “unlocked the talks” and that, beneath the rhetoric of the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier, progress is being made that may become apparent at the Salzburg meeting of EU leaders on September 20.In a weird way it might work. With Theresa May’s internal critics split and producing almost as many alternative Brexit plans as there are Tory MPs, Labour divided, and other EU member states anxious that we don’t leave without a deal, something like the Chequers plan remains the best one on offer.It would satisfy non-obsessives like me to just agree a deal, improve it as we go along, and get on with life beyond Brexit. Life is full of compromises.This is sacrilege to my purist friends. But soon, hardline Conservative MPs must decide whether they care so much about ideology that they are prepared to vote down an imperfect deal.If they do that, they risk losing the lot.And by opening the way to emergency extensions of our membership until we come up with another plan, they could condemn Britain to staying in the awful organisation that elevated Martin Selmayr to power.Times/News SyndicationOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Look at their other positions:Corbyn and his No2 John McDonnell both now admit they would never use our nukes, even under attack. A Corbyn Britain would thus abandon our deterrent, whatever Labour’s manifesto says.Will they ever be honest enough to tell voters they would unilaterally disarm, just as the world gets more dangerous?Honesty, though, is not their strong suit.Yesterday McDonnell repeated the absurd lie that he only wanted “peace” in Northern Ireland. He and Corbyn wanted IRA victory, achieved through ­murder. McDonnell wanted Provos “honoured”. He praised them for bombing their way to the negotiating table.As for the anti-Semite Corbyn, how chuffed he must be that 40 per cent of Jews could flee Britain if he wins power. How proud that Corbynite racists plaster Jew-hating posters across London.It’s what happens when you campaign, as Corbyn did, for the right to be more racist towards Jews than the international anti-Semitism definitions allow.And then there’s Brexit, and the insanely dangerous second referendum he seems increasingly ready to back.But at least Leavers would then know who betrayed them.

There is misery throughout the supply chain.Seven-year-old Joel Urhie, who dreamed of being a firefighter, died in a suspected gang arson attack on his family home in August.He was trapped in his bedroom in Deptford, South London. It was thought a gang had targeted his brother.A family friend told how the lad’s elder brother. 21-year-old Sam, broke down and sobbed: “It should have been me.”He had links to the 814 gang — an offshoot of The Ghetto Boys — and had spent time in jail for drugs offences.A friend said: “This might be because of something Sam did. He was involved with the wrong people.He used to live there before he went to prison and was there for a bit afterwards when he came out.“He was apparently involved in gangs and stuff and it might be the case the people who did it were after him.”Rapper Siddique Kamara was stabbed to death just yards from where his fellow band member was killed.Siddique, who went by his stage name Incognito, was stabbed in Cameberwell on 1 August.His bandmate Rhyhiem Ainsworth Barton was shot to death in May 2018.The two men were both pictured alongside Radio 1 DJ Tim Westwood and have appeared on his YouTube channel.Kamara died at the scene on Warham Street, and two other males aged 16 and 31 were taken to hospital with non life-threatening stab wounds.Moscow17 has been engaged in a longstanding feud with Zone 2 from neighbouring Peckham.The borough of Southwark, were Camberwell and Peckham are, has the second highest level of knife crime in London — with 805 stabbings last year.Tanesha Melbourne, 17, was shot dead in Tottenham, North London, in April while outside her boyfriends mums house.She was with a group of friends when she was hit by a hail of gunfire in a drive-by shooting.The Sun offered a £50,000 reward to catch the killer.It was believed she may have been gunned down in a dispute sparked by a brawl in a milkshake bar.Mobile phone footage of a punch-up may have snowballed into a deadly gang war which left innocent Tanesha caught in the crossfire.There has been a ten-year dispute between the WG and NPK gangs in the area.Corey Junior Davis, 17,  was fatally shot in the head in East London in September last year.The schoolboy was sat with friends when the attacker approached from behind wielding a gun and opened fire in a suspected revenge attack.CJ suffered irreversible brain damage and his life support was switched off.His mum Keisha McLeod said gangs bragged about the killing online.She said: There’s a rap song saying, ‘I don’t care your son’s dead, I laughed when I saw you bury him.’“These are the lyrics of the song. I’ve ­actually had to hear this. They just don’t care.“I’m speaking out against them and even when my son’s killers are caught this will not stop for me.”CJ was killed as part of a turf war between rival gangs Woodgrange E7 and The Beckton E6 crew."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000431857217.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"959\" width=\"960","title":"lidl worker gangster girlfriend kim kardashian lifestyle","story":"Gangsters moll Emily Lock liked the high life and gave the game away by posting pictures of extravagant holidays and expensive designer items online.Her partner, Mark Price - who claimed to be a struggling builder - funded their high-end lifestyle as he raked in £1,600 a week selling drugs in South Wales.Lock showed off their holidays and her designer clothing on social media - despite the budget supermarket worker earning less than £10,000 a year.Suspicions were raised after they shared snaps sunning themselves in Paris and Dubai, wearing Gucci sunglasses and driving an Audi RS4.Defending Lock, Andrew Taylor told the court she became obsessed with living like a celebrity, adding: Many young people today are fixated by a Kim Kardashian type of lifestyle.Wales Online reports it is thought they spent more than £100,000 on their high-end life during Prices drug dealing.Cops eventually raided the 28-year-olds home in September 2017 and found a 110g bag of cocaine.Price admitted possessing cocaine with intent to supply, being concerned in the supply of cocaine and fraud.A message on his phone to co-defendant Kyle Crowley was also found boasting of earning £1,600 a week dealing the drug.Locks home was searched while the couple were on another luxury holiday to Thailand and dozens of luxury items were found including jewellery, watches and bags worth around £50,000.When she was quizzed by cops she claimed she had no idea her boyfriend was a dealer and thought he was a builder.The 22-year-old woman from Caerphilly admitted acquiring criminal property and was sent to prison for 15 months.The court heard Lock, in her second year of a criminology degree, was 19 at the time of the offending and Price – who is five years older – was her first boyfriend.Price was jailed after the trial for seven years at the trial in April and ordered to pay back £24,000.He had bought himself an Audi RS4, while Lock bought herself Vivienne Westwood handbags, Gucci sunglasses, Christian Louboutin shoes and Christian Dior perfume.The CPS estimate the pair blew £100,000 while Price was dealing drugs.Police raided Crowley and his partner Dionne Thomas’ home, also in Caerphilly, and found 12 cannabis plants with a potential street value of up to nearly £8,000.Edward Mitchard, who defended Crowley, said he had been forced to stop working as a nurse following mental health problems and set up a cannabis factory to make money.The court also heard Price had taken out a £33,000 loan by fraudulently stating he was employed by a construction company that had actually gone bust.Crowley was jailed for five years, while Thomas was given a community order requiring her to complete 120 hours of unpaid work.Price’s phone led officers to Christopher Morgan and they found 30 cannabis plants in his attic on January 5.He claimed the plants were for personal use but the 30-year-old later admitted producing and supplying cannabis and was given 20 months in jail.PC Michael Coles, for Gwent Police, said: I hope the sentences issued to these individuals highlight that the supply of controlled drugs will not be tolerated in Caerphilly.These people endanger our community and this lengthy investigation shows we are committed to using all powers and resources available to bring them before the courts.I hope this sends a message to those who continue to be involved in the supply of controlled drugs, that you will not just be prosecuted, we will also use our powers to seize any financial assets you have acquired though criminality."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000431744023.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"640\" width=\"960","title":"electric shocks playground high brooms kent","story":"At least two children reported being jolted by a live current running through playground equipment on Greggs Wood Road in High Brooms, Kent.Local resident Shaun Veness was pushing his daughter Poppy, 3, on a swing when she started crying in pain.He said: I popped her on the swings, gave her a push and felt a bit of static.I pushed her again and she stated crying, saying it hurt.

The Sun is calling for a change in the law to help police move more swiftly.Figures suggest more than a million people are stalked every year. One in five women may be victims and one in ten men. But last year just 806 stalkers were prosecuted and sentenced.That’s because their actions, while terrifying and intimidating, often falls just short of breaking the law in the early stages. However, evidence shows many stalkers will escalate their actions until they injure or kill.Tory MP Sarah Wollaston has a Private Members Bill in Parliament that calls for the introduction of Stalking Protection Orders. They would allow police to go to magistrates at the first hint of stalking for an order warning an offender to stop or face jail.We want Sun readers to sign our petition urging the Government to throw its weight behind Dr Wollaston’s Stalking Protection Bill to make sure it becomes law. Kym was the victim of an obsessed fan for nine years.Add your support at change.org/p/the-house-of-commons-stop-a-stalkerThe Sun on Monday revealed a staggering one million men and women fall victims every year.But just 800 are prosecuted and sentenced, because their stalkers’ actions in the early stages fall short of breaking the law.Corrie star Kym Marsh on Monday called on Sun readers to back the campaign.IF you are a victim of stalking, tell a friend, secure your social media, contact the police and call the National Stalking Helpline on 0808 802 0300.Ms Wollaston has urged the Government to adopt the Bill – and push it through in its “own time” to guarantee it becomes law.Previous Private Members Bills have been beset by delays or been “talked out” by MPs.Ministers stepped in two months ago and adopted a Private Members Bill calling for a ban on upskirting after it was blocked by Tory backbencher Christopher Chope.Former Home Secretary Amber Rudd last night added her support to the Sun’s call for action.She said: “The Sun is right to highlight the misery, damage and sometimes violence that stalking causes to women.“Stalking Protection Orders are a way of ensuring that victims can be protected from their stalker earlier than before.Police need this tool to protect women.“And it is right that we campaign to ensure that the support is there for the women who need it.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Known as The Ghetto, it is awash with guns and drugs.Ten people have been shot dead in Malmo already this year, despite police crackdowns on gang violence. In January, Rosengard’s police station was bombed.Police blame criminals from migrant backgrounds.When we visit Herrgarden, three Iraqis in a BMW glare menacingly until they hear our English accents.“We thought you were cops,” one eventually laughed.Doing her grocery shop in an Arabic corner shop, headscarf-wearing Rabia Arif, 30, originally from Lahore in Pakistan, shakes her head when asked about the SD election surge.The mum-of-one said: “I’m worried. If they come into Government they’re not going to want migrants in Sweden.”Her fears may be well-founded.SD leader Jimmie Akesson once called his nation’s Muslim population “the biggest foreign threat since the Second World War”. He wants to stop asylum seekers coming to Sweden and to ban full-face veils in public. In 2010 he emphasised his nationalist credentials by dressing in traditional Swedish costume to enter parliament.Sweden’s centre left prime minister Stefan Lofven, of the  Social Democrats, has described the party as “a neo-fascist ­single-issue party” with “Nazi and racist roots”.SD began life in 1988 as a white supremacist group. They eventually traded bovver boots for business suits and on Sunday may become the country’s largest party, according to some predictions.Anders Sannerstedt, a political scientist at Sweden’s Lund University, said: “There are still neo-Nazis in the party but they’ve been more careful this time vetting candidates.”At Malmo’s Central rail station, we meet a local SD councillor and parliamentary candidate who hardly fits the knuckle-dragging mould. Iran-born Nima Gholam Ali Pour’s first home in Sweden as a five-year-old was a refugee camp before his family moved to the Rosengard “ghetto”. The former primary school teacher insisted: “There are a lot of people with a migrant background in the party.“Our programme is a conservative one without any extreme elements. When a person says something ­racist they are thrown out.”A recent poll showed 12 per cent of foreign-born Swedes now support the Sweden Democrats. Mattias Karlsson, the party’s parliamentary chief, said: “A lot of the crime is happening in the suburbs where a lot of foreign-born people live.“It’s their cars that are being burned. It is their children’s schools that are descending into chaos.”His colleague Nima blames Sweden’s “liberal migration policy” for the failed integration of migrants following the refugee ­crisis.The Nordic nation’s open-door policy saw almost a quarter of a million asylum seekers arrive in 2014 and 2015. More than 40,000 of the new arrivals were unaccompanied children, mostly boys. Schools and housing were overstretched.Today, around a fifth of Sweden’s 10million people have foreign roots.Nima, 36, explained: “We took too many people in too quickly — we didn’t have the capacity,”SD also want to follow Britain’s lead and quit the EU.“We want a referendum on membership and we want Swexit,” Nima added. “We don’t want bureaucrats in Brussels deciding on our laws — we want the representatives of the Swedish people to decide.” When he returned to Rosengard to campaign recently, Nima was abused in an area that votes heavily for the current PM’s centre left Social Democrats.“People spat at us, called us traitors,” Nima revealed. “I was disappointed — some of these people were born in Sweden and feel that all Swedishness is their enemy.”Rosengard — built in the late Sixties as housing for workers — is home to around 24,000 people mostly from a migrant background.Ex-Man United star Zlatan Ibrahimovic grew up here. So did IS terrorist Osama Krayem, a suspect in the Paris and Brussels attacks, currently in a Belgian jail.Like other migrant areas in Sweden’s big cities, Rosengard is plagued by violent crime, something the SDs are quick to underline.More than 320 shootings and dozens of bombings were reported in Sweden in 2017. And there were more than 110 murders and 7,226 rapes — a ten per cent increase on 2016. Rosengard police inspector Mats Svensson says nearly all suspects in his area — and their victims — come from a migrant background.“We can’t go on like this,” he said. “We need to stop mass immigration and take care of these neighbourhoods before racism starts to spread together with crime.”Strolling past Rosengard’s Middle Eastern butchers and grocers, Ahmed Diini, 19, says he understands why crime and immigration are key issues at this election.Born in Malmo to Somali parents, he revealed: “The Swedish Democrats are racist, they blame everything on immigrants. In Malmo we have a lot of shoot-outs. Often it’s immigrants shooting each other.The after-school club teacher — who supports the Social Democrats — added: “It’s only a few immigrants who mess it up for the rest of us. Sweden has given many of us a new life. My father and mother arrived here from war. I am forever thankful.”Back in the neighbouring SD stronghold of Almgarden, undecided voter, builder Pelle Svensson, 42, said: “People here see a foreign guy driving a BMW and get mad.“Just because our immigration law has been s*** doesn’t mean you should vote for the SDs.Just three miles from Rosengard in Malmo’s old town, the gang epidemic seems a world away.White-collar Swedes sip wine at outdoor cafes in medieval squares.Sweden’s economy is booming and it is regularly ranked as one of the best places to live in the world.Yet this “humanitarian superpower” is still trying to cope with the fallout of the 2015 refugee crisis.Student Frida Eliasson, 24, won’t be voting for the SDs, but says: “Integration hasn’t worked. We have the Swedish and the immigrants. We must mend this split society.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But the British won’t do that.One Brexit red line that Theresa May is adamant that she will never cross is her insistence that no British PM could sign the EU’s proposed text on the Irish border, which would see Northern Ireland become part of the customs territory of the EU.But the two sides need to sort this issue out. For the alternative is no deal, a scenario that neither side is prepared for.One Cabinet minister tells me that “no deal would be almost a state of economic war” between the UK and the EU.This is an exaggeration. But it does show the tensions it would lead to. No deal would also result in the kind of Irish border that both sides say they are keen to avoid.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, is prepared to ­produce a de-dramatised ­version of the backstop.This would concentrate on the 16 areas where the EU thinks there would need to be checks between Britain and Northern Ireland.The hope is that the dry, technical nature of this ­document will make it less controversial.But the UK will still struggle to sign up to this backstop.Why? Because it would still leave the threat of a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the country. The Government COULD accept some regulatory checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. But it COULD NOT accept Northern Ireland being part of a different customs territory to the rest of the country.Senior figures on the UK side are instead mulling an approach where the checks are split three ways between the UK, Northern Ireland and the Republic.Their thinking is that the point of the backstop is to keep the Irish border as it is today but not to create a back door into the EU for goods.If the responsibility for that was split three ways with the UK doing regulatory checks on goods going into Northern Ireland and the Republic taking care to ensure that all goods from the North exported via its ports are properly declared, then you would have a solution that was acceptable to the UK.The EU will be very wary of this idea. It doesn’t want the Irish to have to carry out any additional checks.It also wants to keep the UK in a customs union with the EU, and the Northern Ireland question helps them in their attempt to do this.But the UK should point out that if disagreement over the Irish border prevents any kind of deal, then there will have to be a hard border.The Government is hopeful of making some progress on a deal with the EU at the Salzburg summit later this month. One of those closely involved in the negotiations tells me: “Salzburg won’t be dramatic. But look for a shifting of the plates. They need to give her something to stand up and point to.”What May must avoid is being faced at the end of the negotiations with a choice between staying in a customs union or no deal.A customs union would send Britain out into the world with one hand tied behind its back while no deal would cause real problems in the short-term.BORIS Johnson has received multiple ­communications from the Tory inquiry into his newspaper column on the burka.I understand that the former Foreign Secretary received an initial letter asking him if he wished to say anything in his defence. Those with knowledge of the inquiry say that he responded to that with a vigorous defence of free speech and the need for politicians to be able to take part in these debates.Johnson’s response was met with a further ­communication from the party asking him if he wanted to say anything about his particular ­comments about people wearing the burka ­looking like letter boxes and bank robbers. My information is that Johnson has not responded to this letter. The Tory inquiry simply says that it does not ­comment on ongoing investigations.In truth, this absurd exercise should be dropped. The Tories having an inquiry into the newspaper column of a backbench MP is ridiculous. If it is still dragging on by conference, it could become yet another thing that causes trouble there.Of course, the reason so much attention is paid to Boris Johnson is his status as the members’ favourite to be the next Tory leader. Since quitting over Chequers, he has enjoyed a resurgence in popularity with the party rank and file.Oddly, though, his status as favourite might help Theresa May if a vote of confidence in her was called. As one Cabinet minister explains: “At the moment, there’s a majority against Boris having the top job. So you have to vote for Theresa as you can’t risk him being in the final two.”IN the event of no deal there would be 12 weeks of disruption at the border, ministers will be told on Thursday.Ministers will be summoned to Number 10 for a two-hour Cabinet meeting on no-deal planning.Originally, it had been expected that this meeting would take place at Chequers. But it was then pointed out that this would look like a crisis summit and the idea was shelved.It will be emphasised to ministers that no deal means no deals. In other words, don’t expect a series of workarounds to be agreed between Britain and the EU to keep things ticking over.At best, the Government is hoping for a couple of bilateral deals in areas that are of overwhelming importance to the EU. If no deal does become the most likely scenario, I am told no-deal readiness will become pretty much the sole activity of the civil service.Ministers will also get to discuss a Treasury forecast of the short-term economic impact of no deal. But, rather absurdly, these papers won’t be circulated until Tuesday.THE police and intelligence work that has enabled two Russian operatives to be identified as the lead suspects for the Salisbury attack is impressive.But we shouldn’t kid ourselves that this public exposure will put a stop to Russian mischief.The very decision to use Novichok in the attacks shows that Moscow really didn’t care if it was traced back to Russia.I AM told that the Budget this autumn will not be a dramatic affair.With better than expected tax receipts, Chancellor Philip Hammond should be able to fund an increase in NHS spending without raising the headline rates of tax.However, other tax changes – including to the Enterprise Investment Scheme – are being discussed.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

My child is among many who have been made to stand up in class and explain why they haven’t got the school coat.Teachers have gone through lockers to find children who have not got the coat, bag and PE kit. My child came home and said he felt humiliated by this treatment. Parents have sent complaints after complaints and are not being listened to, they alleged.Another parent, who wished to remain anonymous, claimed: Parents have been questioned on the playground, children interrogated in front of the class and bags and lockers searched.There should be a limit on what a school can ask parents to pay for uniform and it should be reasonable, otherwise we have no say in what we buy our children and no option to shop around to suit our budget.In a statement, Ryder Hayes said: Ryders Hayes first informed parents of the decision to change the school uniform in July 2017... The change was brought in because children have been coming into school with large bags and coats which cause a health and safety hazard given the size of the school corridors.The school has purchased lockers to fit the new bags and coats which will ensure that this is no longer a hazard.The school has listened to parents and has made some changes to the uniform requirements. FourThey added the vast majority of parents bought the uniform, and the school went to great lengths to supply good quality items with coats costing a maximum of £28 and bags available at £8.A payment plan is in place for those wishing to pay over a six month period, the school said, and is financially supporting a number of parents.They added: The school has communicated by letter or face to face with parents rather than with their children, where children are not wearing school uniform, to ascertain the reason.

Michel Barnier said two points in the Prime Minister’s Chequers proposal were “not acceptable”. He also said the future of the Irish border remained the “main obstacle” to a withdrawal agreement. The comments made to MPs on Monday emerged yesterday in a translation of the meeting. Asked by MP Hilary Benn whether the Chequers plan was “dead in the water”, Mr Barnier replied: “In the White Paper there are lots of positive things, lots of useful things. I did not just reject the White Paper outright.” He said Brussels will not accept Mrs May’s proposals on customs or her suggestion the UK and EU could have a free trade area which excluded services. He said: “The proposals are not acceptable on customs and on the common rulebook for goods.”  On Mrs May’s suggestion that the UK could carry out customs checks for the EU, he said: “Your proposal does not seem workable to us.” He told MPs he was “very concerned about Ireland” and that the suggestion put forward by some Brexiteers that the border could simply be kept open, was “too easy” because neither the EU or the UK could protect their consumers and businesses. But he said that the EU was “open” to discussing other arrangements for Northern Ireland than the Brussels proposal for it to remain within the European customs area, which has been rejected by Mrs May. Mr Barnier also rejected a suggestion by Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg that the “divorce bill” of around \u0026pound40billion agreed by Mrs May represents a payment for a future trade deal and could be withheld.

In an extraordinary interview, Oleg Kalugin tonight told the Mirror the president saw Britain as a “soft touch”. The former general said Theresa May should now kick out the Russian ambassador after the novichok poisonings. And he warned of the possibility of further Salisbury-style attacks. Speaking after Britain named the alleged assassins as Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, Mr Kalugin said: “The Russians see Britain as a soft touch. “I would not rule out more assassinations. “Now that you’ve identified two assassins, I feel Britain should at the very least expel the Russian ambassador. That would send a proper signal.”  He added: “Putin is not afraid to attack those of his enemies who he thinks betrayed him personally. He would have no scruples about doing so again, through whatever agency.” Mr Kalugin, formerly chief of KGB counter-intelligence, is still on the run. If he returns to Russia he will spend the rest of his life in jail. And Mr Kalugin believes he would have been killed long ago if he lived in the UK. He was Putin’s boss when they both worked in the KGB in Leningrad in the 1970s. The pair now hate each other. Mr Kalugin was so senior, he was one of only three men in a meeting in which the KGB sanctioned the assassination of Bulgarian dissident Georgi Markov, via a poisoned umbrella, in London in 1978. And he told of his surprise over claims Russia used its GRU military intelligence unit to carry out the Salisbury attack. He said: “The only thing that has surprised me about the Skripal attack was that, according to the British, the attackers were from the GRU.  “In my days, the GRU was only there to pick up military secrets. Dealing with traitors was only a job for us, the KGB.” He added of the nature of the attack: “Just note how differently the Russians, and before them the Soviets, have acted in the US. Yes, they interfere in elections but they have never, to my certain knowledge, even attempted a political assassination on US soil. “Of course, Britain has less means to make Putin feel threatened. But it’s been lacking in strong counter-action.” Mr Kalugin went on: “Internally, I’m not sure Britain realises the dangers. Intelligence activities have been re-activated by Putin after something of a lull under [his predecessor] Boris Yeltsin. “So far, the British Government and security agencies have failed in their job. Sergei Skripal served them well as a double agent, so how could they leave him unprotected in Salisbury? “Skripal was a full colonel in Russia’s military intelligence. He was an obvious target for Russian revenge.”  Mr Kalugin lives with his Russian wife in a small bungalow on the east coast of the US, where he once posed as a reporter during his spy days. Speaking of a future visit to the UK, he said: “I know this could expose me to Putin’s assassins, but I don’t care. I’ve had a full life and I’m an old man. “My last trip to Britain was very unpleasant. The police picked me up as I arrived at Heathrow. They interrogated me about Markov. “But our embassy got me out the next day and I flew back to Moscow. I was not the killer of Georgi Markov.” But he said: “I was one of only three men who discussed whe\u0026shyther the KGB should help the Bulgarians in \u0026shyMarkov’s killing. I sat at KGB headquarters in 1978 with our chief Yuri Andropov [later Soviet Union President] and his deputy. It was his decision. “My department, counter-intelligence, never carried out killings. Our job was to get secret information.” Mr Kalugin went on: “Our science and technology directorate had the weapon designed and constructed in Japan. It was an umbrella that fired a small dart into Markov’s leg. I believe that department still exists.”  He said British security services should have learned after failing to protect defector Alexander Litvinenko, poisoned in London in 2006. Mr Kalugin said: “He met with his killers more than once without MI5 intervening or getting close protect\u0026shy\u0026shyion. “It didn’t take a genius to work out Litvinenko’s life was deeply in danger.” Mr Kalugin was called an American stooge by Putin. He said: “I publicly accused Putin of being a mass murderer for waging war in Chechnya. “I’ve also had the guts to attack Putin in a book. If I had been living in Britain instead of the US, I would have been dead long ago.” And he warned it was possible British intelligence services still have Russian double agents within them. Mr Kalugin said: “We had between 10 and 20 agents inside MI5 and MI6 when I was in charge of foreign counter-intelligence. Russia’s intelligence services, who took over from the KGB, still have that capability.” He added of Salisbury: “I think more will emerge in the next few weeks.” War game is a serious show of strength to UK  By Chris Hughes   DEFENCE AND SECURITY EDITOR  Russian President Vladimir Putin is staging war games involving 300,000 troops – and a social media campaign to wreck enemy morale.

How much more do things cost now? “I do hours overtime, anyway. I can’t rush visits because these are elderly people, and I don’t get paid travel time. I do 50 visits some days. It’s slave labour, really, but we do it because we care.” O’Grady, 58, is in Manchester for a speech at the Mechanics Institute – the birthplace of the Trades Union Congress – as part of \u0026shycelebrations ahead of its 150th Congress, which starts on Sunday. But these women are on the front line of modern-day labour – underpaid workers rinsed in the new zero-hour economy run by distant corporations. With the support of Unison, the care workers have recently won a court case over petrol money and are now fighting over 15-minute visits and travel time. The General Secretary has just come from the early morning picket line at Wigan Hospital, where NHS cleaners and porters are fighting privatisation.  Her job – battling hard Tory Brexit, the eighth year of turbo-austerity, and the spectre of automation – is among the toughest public roles in the country but she is rarely short of inspiration. “Those women on the picket line know we’ve got to stand up for each other,” O’Grady says. “That’s what trade unionism is.” The TUC was born in tough times, when working people were being crushed under the wheels of the Industrial Revolution. At the Mechanics Institute we sit in the room where a “congress of trades councils and other federations of trades societies” came together in 1868. A portrait of George Potter, a joiner and cabinet maker who became the first President of the TUC, hangs on the wall. O’Grady’s own heroes include Mary Macarthur, the 1903 General Secretary of the Women’s Trades Union League. “I love the way she was cutting edge,” O’Grady says, perhaps thinking of the TUC’s new app aimed at young people. “She was getting films into cinemas at the turn of the century, she brought the strikes to the people. There was also that little bit of civil disobedience, a bit of cheekiness. She wasn’t brow-beaten.”  O’Grady laughs. “And, Anne \u0026shyScargill,” she says of the founder of Women Against Pit Closures and ex-wife of miners’ leader Arthur. “She’s still going for it at 80. No flashy ego and a twinkle in her eye. I remember when she occupied that mine. It’s ‘what are we going to do about it?’ Not the big I Am.” O’Grady’s day in Manchester is all “what are we going to do about it?” – not the Big I Am. She would rather not talk about herself, or the great founders of the movement. Instead, she meets the brilliant Rusholme bus drivers from Unite. They took strike action against First Manchester last winter after realising they were being paid nearly \u0026pound5,000 a year less than colleagues at a depot just five miles away.  “We knew they weren’t just going to give it to us,” Unite’s Neil Clarke tells O’Grady. “We knew we were going to have to stand outside for it. But the support we had was amazing. We just wanted the same pay for the same conditions in the same city for the same job. And in the end, we won.” At St Peter’s Square, O’Grady meets the inspirational TGI Fridays strikers, some as young as 18. “We were suddenly told that 40% of service charge payments were now going to top up kitchen wages,” a waitress tells her. “We understand kitchen staff are underpaid, but why is their pay rise coming out of our pockets? This isn’t a struggling family business.” The 150th Congress, which O’Grady will address on Monday, takes place within hours of the 10th anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which former staff are celebrating with a party. “I don’t have a problem with reunions,” says O’Grady, dryly. “But I feel sick nothing’s really changed. Those bankers got off scot-free.  “Yet there are one million more children in relative poverty since 2010. And for the majority of poor children, their mums and dads are in work. So the Tory idea that work is the best route out of poverty is one big fat lie. They work all the hours God sends and yet they are no better off. We have to do something about the greed at the top. It’s not about resenting someone’s success but about being made a fool of, taking people for mugs. “A lot of people heard Theresa May talking about the Just About Managings and thought maybe she would do something about it. Apparently not.” The youngest of five children in an Irish, working-class household, O’Grady grew up in family that was often just about managing. As we talk about a free uniform scheme in Manchester, she nods. “I remember we couldn’t afford the school skirt, which was box-pleated. I had to have one with pleats all around it. It was amazing how conscious I was of it.” She shakes her head. “We’ve got to get wages rising. We need a bloody big lift to the minimum wage.” O’Grady grew up the youngest daughter of James, a chrome fitter and shop steward at the British Leyland carworks in Cowley, Oxford, and Rita, a shopworker who later worked for the NHS.

Megan Fairfield, 22, was more than twice the legal drink driving limit when she smashed her red Audi into the vehicle just 200 yards into her journey.  A court heard she had been celebrating her last shift as a care assistant with colleagues when she decided to drive the 500-yard trip home on August 1.  And now she cannot take her dream job caring for young children in the community as she\u0027s now lost her driving licence, Rossendale Free Press says.  Fairfield admitted drink driving and was given a fine and costs totalling \u0026pound299 and disqualified from driving for 40 months, reduced by 40 weeks if she completes a drink driving course. Burnley Magistrates Court heard she had previously been disqualified in March 2016 for 17 months for the same offence.  Charlotte Crane, prosecuting, said: He [the owner of the parked car] went outside and was approached by Miss Fairfield who initially claimed that she needed assistance because her friends had run off. He called the police and they arrived. She then changed her story and accepted driving the Audi and made comments that she had been to a leaving do, had been done for drink driving before and apologised for her behaviour. The defendant, from Helmshore, near Blackburn, Lancs., provided a breathalyser reading of 78mg in 100ml of breath. The legal limit is 35mg.

They would grow and pick their own fruit and vegetables and use it for sports. Dubai\u0027s Palm Islands took a decade to complete, with work starting back in 2001 and finishing with Palm Jumeirah in 2011.

A spokesman for the company said: Addiction to drugs, alcohol and gambling are have often been cited as reasons for relationship breakdown but the dawn of the digital revolution has introduced new addictions. These now include online pornography, online gaming, and social media, so it is no surprise to us that more and more people are having relationship problems because of our digital addictions.

Marion Symonds, 51, owner of Portreath Bakery and Made Marion Gluten Free and a long time campaigner of the traditional Cornish pasty, said: I would have thought they would sell whatever they sell in their normal stores. If they sell pasties in their other shops why wouldn\u0027t they sell them in pasty world? I believe that Cornish people who have had Cornish pasties with traditional ingredients will always go to a Cornish bakery.

The boy, who did not have a phone or any money had no means of getting home to Netherton, Liverpool, the Liverpool Echo reports. However, after spotting him crying, Year 11 student Tom O\u0027Brien gave the boy \u0026pound10 for a taxi, while Year 7 students Harry Campbell and Dylan Robson made sure he got home safe.

Tom told teachers he was just happy the boy had got home safe and was pleased that teenagers are getting some good publicity. Now his dad Kenny has spoken out about how proud he is of his thoughtful and caring son. The 55-year-old said: I am very proud of him. He is a very thoughtful lad and has a great personality. He didn\u0027t tell me what had happened until later in the night when he realised people were talking about it on Facebook. He just said he was on the bus asking the Year 7\u0027s how they had got on, on their first day and he noticed this kid sat on his own, looking anxious and upset and asked him was he okay. The boy said he had got on the wrong bus and was getting further and further away from home so Tom thought on his feet, told him to get off the bus and gave him \u0026pound10 for a taxi. Dylan\u0027s mum Toni said she heard about what happened when her son got home from school. She said: He came home and said that there was a boy on the wrong bus and he was upset. He told me about Tom giving him the money and how he and Harry had rang a taxi. I asked him how he had known the number to ring and he said he had Googled it. I am very proud of him.

The former footballer, accused of driving a Bentley at 59mph in a 40mph zone in London, will try to have the case thrown out on a technicality, arguing that the notice didn\u0027t arrive within the statutory 14-day window. There are practically no defences in court for driving over the speed limit, a legal expert has told the Liverpool Echo. But a driver can have the charge dismissed if they can prove that the notice arrived too late, like Beckham is attempting to do, said Phoebe Callender, legal adviser at DAS Law.  Here, Ms Callender explains the rules surrounding a notice of intended prosecution and what happens if one is delivered too late to a vehicle\u0027s registered keeper. What are the rules surrounding the notification of a fine? When you receive a speeding fine, the first notification you will receive is called a notice of intended prosecution  which is where you need to inform the police who was driving at the time under Section 172 of the Road Traffic Act 1998. This notice should be sent to the registered keeper within 14 days of when the speeding offence took place. If you don’t send the police the driver’s details within the time they state, then you can face up to six penalty points and a fine which is usually \u0026pound100. After this you will be sent notification of whether they will be offering you points and a fine a speed awareness course or if it will progress to a court summons. Can I have a fine dismissed if it was delivered ‘late’?  Under the Road Traffic Act 1998, the NIP has to be sent to the registered keeper within 14 days of the speeding offence. If when you receive the NIP it is dated more than 14 days after the offence took place, then you should send it back to the process office and reject it as it is out of time. If you are not the registered keeper of the car and you receive the NIP past 14 days, you have to check to see if they sent it to the registered keeper within the time period. If it has been, then it won’t be classed as late. If you fail to receive a NIP and only receive a court summons, then you can have a defence to the speeding offence and any subsequent prosecution that takes place. How do I challenge a speeding fine? It is very difficult to challenge a speeding fine as there are practically no defences to why a person was driving over the speed limit, even if you believe it’s not fair. You may be able to challenge it if the notice was incorrect e.g. the date, time, location of the speeding offence. However, spelling mistakes or minor mistakes like the colour of a vehicle etc. will not be accepted. Challenging the evidence of the camera itself can be also tricky as unless you have evidence that the camera is faulty then it is unlikely that you will be able to challenge your speeding fine successfully. Should I use a lawyer/barrister to handle my case or can I do it myself?

Fiona Boston, from Stockton, County Durham, paid for the sofa in cash at the Darlington store after deciding it was a perfect fit for her home. However, she says it was never delivered after the chain went into administration. Speaking to Teesside Live, the 52-year-old claimed she got no help from staff, so decided to take matters into her own hands. She and some friends marched into the shop, dismantled the sofa in the showroom and walked out the front door with it.  Fiona said: “On July 26 I bought the sofa and chair. I’d had my eye on it for a couple of years, it was a perfect fit for my home. “I paid in cash and three days later I went back to buy some extras on my debit card which cost \u0026pound715.” However, the delivery date for Fiona’s purchases reportedly kept being pushed back. She went back to the store on several occasions to ask when she would get them and to check the sofa was still there. “My husband Alan had an aneurysm last year and it’s taking him a while to get back to full health, but he’d been sitting on deck chairs at home as we were still waiting, she said.  He deserved to be comfortable. I kept asking the manager and staff but they were saying everything was out of their hands.” But then House of Fraser went into administration and Fiona say she lost her money, along with the sofa. She said: “They told me I would be put on a list of creditors and to wait to get my money back. I knew that the chances were I wouldn’t be getting it back. “They even told me I could take finance out on the sofa - but I refused to pay for it twice.” On September 1, Fiona decided to go into the store and take the sofa herself. She said: “I got some of my family together, some strong lads and a van from Scott Bros in Haverton Hill, and decided to go to the store late in the afternoon when it was quite empty.  “We went up to the second floor, took the sofa apart and walked right out the front door. No one batted an eyelid.” Staff quickly surrounded the vehicle as soon as they loaded the sofa into the van. Fiona, who works as a market trader, claimed: “They told me that they’d call the police as it was theft. I said I’d paid for it and had a receipt.” She drove off but was soon pulled over by the police where she explained what happened. “I showed him my receipt and that it was rightfully mine, she said. “He wasn’t happy but called his inspector who said it was a civil matter and to let us drive off. “So we did. It’s what you call British justice.” "},{"url":null,"title":"odd highway code loophole driving","story":"AdvertorialOdd Highway Code loophole about driving a car in the dark is leaving motorists baffledBizarre rule applies in brightly-lit 30mph zones - but there\u0027s a catchShare\u0026nbspByDave Masters09:48, 4 SEP 2018Updated09:19, 6 SEP 2018AdvertorialMost motorists won\u0027t have heard of this\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAs the weather changes, there are a few things drivers need to know about their cars and driving. The law on lights is simple enough: you must use car headlights from half an hour after sunset until half an hour before sunrise. But there is a surprising exception to this rule. If you\u0027re travelling under 30mph in a brightly-lit area, you don\u0027t legally have to have them on - though you do still need your sidelights. It\u0027s an odd quirk of the law, but is it recommended? It\u0027s generally agreed that using dipped headlights at night is always the best option - making you more visible to other road users as well as improving your view of the road ahead. But if you do choose to use just your sidelights, make sure you don\u0027t fall foul of the rules - or you risk a \u0026pound50 fine. Not a bright idea. Make sure you know the rules  It\u0027s absolutely crucial that, at all times of the year, your car has a full set of working lights.  As well as an MOT failure, driving with a faulty or damaged light could mean a fixed penalty notice, or three points on the driving licence plus a bigger fine if it goes to court .   Since 2011, it\u0027s also been a legal requirement for all new cars sold in the EU to have daytime running lights . The new UK MOT rules mean that cars registered after March 2018 will need to have these working to pass the test.  Research has shown that DRLs are likely to reduce multiple vehicle daytime accidents and fatalities by up to 6% once all vehicles are equipped.   If you don\u0027t have DRLs on your car, then it\u0027s acceptable to leave your sidelights on all the time. Many cars will automatically turn sidelights on if they have an auto mode for lights, they will also switch to dipped lights when its sensor feels it\u0027s dark enough. The law states that you need your dipped headlights on between sunset and sunrise - but there\u0027s no harm turning them on early to improve your visibility to other road users. Check your lights regularly  The best way to do this is with a friend who can confirm that the reverse and brake lights are all working. Alternatively, you can use a reflective surface like a garage door. You can check hazard/indicator lights yourself as well as the running lights and dipped/main beam settings. If you notice a bulb isn\u0027t working, then pop to Halfords - they will select and fit replacement bulbs to your car for a small fee, and there\u0027s no need to book beforehand.  For a more comprehensive check that everything is working as it should, make an appointment online or in-store for a Free Car Check . As well as a bulb check, they\u0027ll also check your battery, wiper blades, engine oil level and air conditioning, and check for any windscreen chips. They\u0027ll even give you a free screenwash top-up!  Don\u0027t be dazzled  As nights get earlier we all have to contend with headlights dazzling us. Remember that most rearview mirrors these days offer protection from bright lights from behind. On newer cars you\u0027ll often have an auto-dimming mirror - which means you just let it protect you from being distracted by overly-bright lights. If you find yourself struggling to see, you\u0027ll notice an off switch to disable the feature. On older cars it\u0027s common that your rear view mirror will have a small mechanical switch underneath it. Flip that and the mirror will change angle, without adjusting the view you see. This is used to stop you from being dazzled in the same way a modern electric system works.  If your car has an old manual mirror then why not upgrade to an EchoMaster Dynamic Mirror and Reversing Camera Kit  for \u0026pound149. A reversing camera is fitted behind your number plate by a bracket. This rearview mirror also auto-dims, perfect for autumn driving! Halfords will also fit the whole system for \u0026pound75.  Keep your car clean  A dirty car looks bad, but it might also get you in to trouble. The law states that your number plate needs to be clean and visible at all times. You also need to make sure that brake lights are clean and clearly visible.  As well as using a good car cleaner you should also make sure your windscreen and lights are clean. Use a specialist glass cleaning product like Autoglym Car Glass Polish , \u0026pound8. You can pair that with the Demon Car Valet Pack  - priced \u0026pound24.50  to get every part of your car shiny as new.

Then there’s Tony Blair , who took time out from lobbying for a gas \u0026shypipeline on behalf of his autocratic Azerbaijani paymasters, to give an important interview with the BBC.  As we hit the 10th anniversary of the banking crash, was he finally going to admit that his government’s lax \u0026shyregulation and its attitude of being “intensely relaxed” about the rich getting richer, helped cause the worst depression since the 1920s? Maybe an apology, or an attack on The Big Swinging Dicks who caused it, then were allowed to speed past the rest of us in shiny red Lamborghinis while we sat in clapped-out Ladas in the slow lane? No. Just an attack on a Labour Party leadership that is proposing policies that would rein in the City-led greed that holds our country back. This past decade, while banks have grown bigger, richer and more untouchable on taxpayer subsidies, ordinary people have been punished with a brutal austerity programme which has seen their wages stagnate and personal debt rocket. Their recklessness may have ruined millions of lives but not one senior banker has been jailed in the UK or one judge-led inquiry into their countless acts of criminality set up.  Today our banking system has more capital behind it than it has done for a century yet the wider economy has suffered the lowest decade for growth since Victorian times. They’re still Masters of The Universe, enjoying eye-watering pay, bonuses and payoffs, and the subservient politicians who encouraged their reckless greed a decade ago are even more in awe of them. It’s as though the political class has deliberately refused to learn anything from that seismic crash. The mantra from on high is still that without these financial “wealth creators” our public services would start collapsing. Even though, like that dated economic model itself, they already have.

The pictures show Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov separately walk through gates at the airport. But the snaps are timed at the same moment - 16:22:43.

The suspects walked through customs before they were faced with a number of automatic gates at the West Sussex hub, police said.  But the images suggest Petrov and Boshirov split up to and each go down a different thin corridor at the same time.

Some 40 pupils from Forge Valley School in Malin Bridge, Sheffield, were given their marching orders or put into isolation on Thursday for breaking the zero tolerance uniform rules.  Scarlett O\u0027Donoghue, 14, was pulled to one side by a teacher and told to change her trousers - for which mum Claire paid \u0026pound27 for three pairs from the Asda school range - or go home.  And staff rang her furious mum Claire, 42, to tell her Scarlett was not allowed in class. She said: Scarlett was so excited about starting her GCSEs - I was livid. We\u0027ve not got a lot of money and Scarlett knows we\u0027ve not got \u0026pound50 to spend on an outfit she can\u0027t wear. What I cannot get over is what right does one teacher have to say my child\u0027s trousers are too tight?  Claire forking out \u0026pound51 on three pairs of trousers and three skirts but teachers said the clothing was unacceptably tight. The mum-to-two, who runs a glazing firm with husband Michael, 51, added: Scarlett thinks she\u0027s too fat like a lot of teenage girls - for someone in authority to \u0027say your clothes are too tight\u0027 is disgusting. A lot of girls also have issues about their weight and their body image. So if you have an adult telling you the skirt is too tight it\u0027s going to hugely harm your self-esteem. What is that saying to teenage girls about their self-confidence when they are already worried about their weight. They\u0027re sexualising young girls who should be allowed to wear whatever they want to wear.  Scarlett has been very upset and angry about the whole thing. We spent over \u0026pound50 on new school uniforms and the school are not going to give me that back. It was the second time Scarlett had been pulled up over uniform after she arrived in school the previous day wearing a skirt which staff also said was unacceptably tight. An online petition has been signed by more than 500 parents, angry with the uniform policy. But Dale Barrowclough, headteacher at the school, said: We have the uniform policy because it promotes a professional ethos in the school and it allows pupils who can\u0027t afford branded clothes to avoid bullying. This is something that was raised by parents and which is why they wanted the uniform policy and it would be unfair to change it now. I\u0027m not prepared to relax our high standards. It\u0027s why Forge Valley is oversubscribed and we could not say that when the school opened. Parents are always given adequate warning about next year\u0027s uniform in my end of summer term letter which says that full uniform must be worn for the start of September.

After making threats to ‘\u0027bang’\u0027 and ‘\u0027stab’\u0027 his new girlfriend, Dickinson and her accomplices burst into 18-year old Mr Baines\u0027 home in Lancaster whilst the couple were in bed together. The three swarmed around Mr Baines and left him with three stab wounds to the back and a bite mark. Dickinson and her best friend Kathryn Stanley, 18, then burst into his bedroom where the unnamed girl, 17, was lying in bed naked. Stanley jumped on top of his girlfriend, punched her to the head and held her arms to stop her defending herself as Dickinson stabbed at her and tried to cut her hair off as a way of \u0027\u0027degrading\u0027\u0027 her.  The assault only ended when Stanley said: “I didn’t think you were going to stab her.\u0027\u0027  Baines and his girlfriend later received stitches for the several serious lacerations and stab wounds but made a miraculous recovery.  In a statement the girl said she feared she would be killed and added: “Since the incident I have struggled with my anxiety and stress due to what happened when I was stabbed by Anna. “I am so scared of them and I will go out of my way to never be see them again. I struggle day to day now to leave the house without somebody. What they did to me will stay with me for the rest of my life and I will always have the scars on my back. “I have started counselling and I am trying to deal with how to trust people again in my life. I am scared and fearful of them. She was contacting my friends and calling me a liar and trying to intimidate me.” At Preston Crown Court Dickinson, Stanley and Jordan Gardner, 18, all of Lancaster admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent and unlawful wounding. Dickinson and Stanley were locked up for 32 months in a young offenders institution and Gardner a close friend of Tyrone was detained for 21 months.  As sentences were passed fighting broke out between loved ones of the families.  The incident took place on February 19 after Tyrone split up with Dickinson following a four month fling and began dating the other girl. Prosecutor Raymond Smith said: “Dickinson and the girl had been friends and known each other for some years.  But the friendship between the two of them deteriorated to the point Dickinson sent messages via social media threatening to “bang” and “stab” her. That day Dickinson had sent messages to Tyrone asking if his girlfriend was at home. \u0027\u0027Some time later Tyrone and his partner went to bed and fell asleep.  Two hours later, Tyrone was woken up by Gardner shouting to be let in. Tyrone got out of bed partially dressed and went downstairs and heard Gardner trying to get in through the living room window. “Tyrone opened the door and Gardner came into the house running upstairs, whilst Dickinson and Stanley also came into the house and came running upstairs.  Dickinson was carrying a knife and Tyrone recognised it as being from the kitchen. In light of the previous threats Tyrone was scared for his girlfriend and he tried to hold the bedroom door shut.  “But Dickinson was stabbing at him trying to get around him. Tyrone was trying to reason with the two women. Tyrone was being stabbed many times by Dickinson. Eventually he failed to stop them gaining entry to the bedroom and witnessed the attack on his partner. “By this stage Gardner was leaving and had left the house. Tyrone had sustained stab wounds to the neck and back and had cuts to the back and bruises to his neck where Dickinson had tried to bite him when she was trying to get past him. “The female victim could see that Tyrone was struggling with the two women and she could see a knife in Dickinson\u0027s hand.  Stanley ran into the room and jumped on top of her and punched her to the head and body. She held her wrists making it difficult for her to defend herself. “She remembers the blade of the knife being held to her throat and being stabbed on her arm by Dickinson. She then remembers Stanley shouting: “I didn’t think you were going to stab her.” Tyrone had gone to get the two women out of the bedroom when the female noticed she was bleeding from many wounds.  In her statement she said she was frightened and thought she was going to be killed.  The girl suffered stab wounds to her arms neck and face plus wounds to her left upper back and chest.  Tyrone had wounds to his back and chest.  After the attack Dickinson called her mother requesting a lift and made a telephone call at 4am to tell a friend what she had done. Mr Smith added: “Dickinson played a leading role in the group attack. It is aggravated by the location and time of the offence, this was in the victim’s bedroom when she was naked and asleep.\u0027\u0027 Dickinson\u0027s lawyer Amanda Hamilton said: “She is accepting of what happened and has deep regrets and hurt for the two people who suffered significant wounds.  She was in a relationship with Tyrone, he was the man she loved and there was a desperate nature of the relationship, it was a difficult one. She wishes she didn’t attend Tyrone’s house in that night. “She accepts she went to the house and took a weapon with her but she didn’t make threats to use the weapon. She wants to face up to and understand what happened that night. She wants the victims to know how truly sorry she is.   “She has done a lot of volunteer work with animals, she enjoys working with cats and dogs . She has an extremely supportive family.  She doesn’t recall sending these messages and they have disappeared from social media, but as the prosecution witnesses are saying they received them, she accepts that. Since her arrest she has found a group of friends who support her.”  Robert Elias for Stanley, said: “She did not have a quarrel, she had not been scorned but she was holding Dickinson\u0027s hand. She had no knowledge of her friend picking up the knife. This wasn’t premeditated, she didn’t knew it was going to happen. “Once the momentum began she took part. She climbed by that young lady, struck her, then unknowing there was a knife she offered the responsibility and prospect of matters getting worse. She was horrified, she was shouting about the need for it to happen.  “Since the incident she has moved counties. She presents to be quite an intelligent young woman and is frustrated with herself for having got in this situation, she doesn’t blame Miss Dickinson, she thinks she should have seen through the anger before there was this confrontation. “ She was there for other reasons, she wanted to show loyalty and to help her friend. She is wanting to make a go of things.” Sentencing Judge Heather Lloyd said: “Tyrone Baines and the female victim began to get close and it was clear you did not like the fact they were together. It is clear from the messages you were threatening to stab his girlfriend and on that night that is precisely what you did.

Aaron, 36, has dreamt of living in a 1930s\u0027 home complete with authentic gadgets and furniture from the era ever since he was a five-year-old boy. He is the proud owner of a modest three-bedroom semi - built in 1937 - looks like the rest of the suburban street from the outside but is a time capsule inside. Everything inside is from a bygone era, including the rare wallpaper, coal fires and electric cooker which was one of the first of its kind. Aaron recalls browsing junk shops aged five, picking up an old radiogram, hoover, mincers and gas lamps during trips with his grandmother\u0027s sister. Since then, he has slowly become enamoured with the decade\u0027s style and way of life. He bought his current home in Blackpool, Lancs., for \u0026pound87,000 in 2007 after it had stood empty for nearly a decade.  The enthusiast has worked tirelessly to transform the house - installing German wallpaper which was buried in a time capsule in the 1930s and cost Aaron \u0026pound100 a roll. He sleeps in a vintage bed, has a GEC cooker, doesn\u0027t own a television or fridge and still uses a laundry mangle. Not content with just looking like it\u0027s in the 1930s, the house also runs like a pre-war one would have, heated by four coal fires and without double glazing windows. He said: From the age of five I always liked the music, a lot of people think I\u0027ve been here before. My grandmother\u0027s sister would take me round junk shops and I collected a lot of gramophones.  The first ever item I bought was an old radiogram from the 1950s and an old hoover, as well old mincers and gas lamps. It\u0027s all bits like that as to how it all started and it\u0027s got a bit out of hand since. I\u0027ve tried to make sure all the items in the house are originals, rather than being replicas. My pride of joy is an HMV state of the art gramophone from 1937. It came from an old house down south where bits and pieces were being sold off, and a friend of a friend told me about it. Anyone that comes to the house absolutely love it, I\u0027m not saying they would want to live in it but I\u0027ve not really had any bad feedback. Aaron, who has no children, loves 1930s vocalists including Judy Garland, Jessie Matthews and Billie Holiday and even watches silent films.  When at home, he wears vintage clothes, sports a slick back undercut hairstyle and bearded finish and eats a 1930s diet - including cooking foods in beef dripping. The house was built in 1937 so this house always had a toilet, he added. It runs on coal so I have to lit the fire in the backroom for hot water. If I buy a rib of beef and have friends for tea I will cook it the old fashioned way, I don\u0027t use oil.  The washing machine I\u0027ve got is a Hotpoint electric one with a mangle. The hoover is a 1934 electric hoover senior which I have been using since I was kid. The wall masks I collected are hard to come by, they are by an artist called John Douglas. I have the King up on the wall and there are thirties art decor original pictures. There is the Victorian organ in there as well as a great big Edwardian sideboard. The kitchen has got the original tiles and sink and cupboards. It\u0027s pretty bog standard to how it was when it was built. The hallway is pretty much as it was apart from it\u0027s got new wallpaper, it\u0027s an old reprint. The items I have sort of go up to the 1940s. Even at the end of the war, you were still living in the thirties because there was no production.

Laura Gallazzi claims the medic butchered her son and hid the truth from her when she gave her the devastating news that her baby didn\u0027t make it. The 34-year-old\u0027s premature son, Steven, was trapped in the breech position and, instead of performing an emergency Caesarean section, Dr Vaishnavy Laxman tugged on his legs in a bid to get him out. The infant\u0027s head broke off in the womb and had to be recovered later by two doctors who carried out a C-section.   Ms Gallazzi, who was just 25 weeks pregnant when she went into labour, has spoken out for the first time about her son\u0027s death at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee and how she has been left with post-traumatic stress disorder.   She told the Sun that she puts the blame squarely on Dr Laxman, who has been cleared to continue practising, and she believes she was fooled into initially forgiving her.  Ms Gallazzi, who keeps her son\u0027s ashes in a teddy bear and has outlines of his hands and feet tattooed on her arm, said: She butchered my son. How could this happen in this day and age? She had been rushed straight into theatre after arriving at the hospital, where medics discovered that she had a prolapsed umbilical cord, which happens when the cord drops through the open cervix into the vagina ahead of the baby.  The cord can become trapped against the baby\u0027s body during delivery. Ms Gallazzi said she was told to push and, even though it felt completely wrong and she thought she would have a C-section, she did as Dr Laxman asked. She was only two to three centimetres dilated - less than the NHS guidelines of 10cm for a natural birth - and the doctor had twice cut her cervix. Dr Laxman, who was nearing the end of a 24-hour shift, tried a natural delivery instead of a C-section as the baby arrived on March 16, 2014. Ms Gallazzi said she felt the doctor pull on Steven\u0027s legs as other medics pushed down on her stomach. She said she begged Dr Laxman to stop because she was in so much pain, and tried to crawl away from her.  She said: “I could feel something between my legs and then all of a sudden I felt a massive, loud pop. I thought I’d done it. I thought he was out. “But then I felt a sense of chaos and panic throughout the room and I was being told to push again. Then I was told I was being put to sleep and the lights went out.” After her son died during birth, she woke up as she recovered in a room for mothers who have suffered loss in pregnancy. Her sister Louise was in tears and Dr Laxman soon came in and delivered the devastating news that Steven had died. Ms Gallazzi assumed the baby died because he was premature and claims she didn\u0027t know that his he had been decapitated. She said Dr Laxman sat down next to her on the hospital bed and told her that Steven had died.

The kiosks were launched next to Canary Wharf tube station and opened for just one minute at 2:58pm - the time Brits need it the most. Each Human Charging Point contained headphones to give you the chance to take one minute out of your day before heading back to work. According to research conducted to coincide with the launch, 85 per cent of Londoners say they face a lull in the afternoon – and more than one-in-four say that chocolate is what helps to get them through the afternoon lull.

The teen, who was abducted on her way home from school, said her survival instincts kicked in and she realised she had to work with the man holding her captive.  I said [to him], ‘I don’t judge you for this. If you let me go, I won’t tell anybody about this,’” Abby recalled during an interview with ABC News .  However her initial attempts to negotiate with her sick abductor proved unsuccessful and for nine months he forced her to wear a dog shock collar and call him Master.  Twisted Nate Kibby inflicted abuse on her daily, but she used the \u0027power of prayer\u0027 to keep her hope alive. She added: “I remember I never said ‘amen’ in my mind. I never wanted to end my prayers because I didn\u0027t want God to leave me. “I just really wanted to live.” One of the other tactics Ms Hernandez used was to think strategically and establish a bond with her captor. She said: “I told him, ‘Look, you don\u0027t seem like a bad person. Like, everybody makes mistakes… If you let me go, I won\u0027t tell anybody about this.’”  Ms Hernandez, then 14, was hidden away in a storage container where she was drugged, repeatedly raped and psychologically tortured before finally being released. She was abducted after leaving school on October 9, 2013, sparking a desperate search that ended when she walked into her family\u0027s home nine months later. For the first time, Ms Hernandez, 19, has described her ordeal in detail and told how she is coping years on from the abduction in the US town of Conway, New Hampshire.  In an exclusive interview, she told the ABC News programme 20/20 that Kibby put a dog shock collar on her to stop her from screaming and alerting people nearby.   He also told her to call him Master and claimed that he had rigged the storage container on his property in Gorham - about 30 miles from where he abducted the girl - to erupt in flames if she tried to escape or if someone tried to save her. Ms Hernandez said: “He said, ‘You know, I’m thinking of finding something a little more humane for you to keep you quiet. “He said, ‘I’m thinking of a shock collar’, you know, like dogs wear. “I remember he put it on me and he told me, ‘OK, try and scream’. I just slowly started raising my voice and then it shocked me. “He was like, ‘OK, now you know what it feels like’.”  She added: “He told me call me ‘Master’.” Kibby, now 37, claimed he had rigged the storage container\u0027s door with wires and screws, telling Ms Hernandez that she would die if someone tried to rescue her. She told ABC News correspondent Deborah Roberts: “He told me that he tripped the door so that if for any reason it was busted open it would catch on fire. “If somebody kicked open the door I would go up in flames, basically.” She thought Kibby was watching her remotely because a surveillance camera was always blinking.  Ms Hernandez said she used psychological strategies to stay alive, including bonding with Kibby. She didn\u0027t know his name until she found it inside a cookbook he had given her while she was being held. Kibby had kidnapped her after offering her a ride home, and pulled out a gun and threatened to shoot her when she tried to get out of his car. She didn\u0027t know him but accepted the ride because her feet were sore and blistered.

He wrote: Where\u0027s that \u0027ridiculous things you believed as a kid\u0027 thread?

The decline in tourism in Tunisia followed a spate of terror attacks in 2015, where 71 people were killed in three incidents. The worst of that year occurred in June, when 38 foreign tourists, including 30 British nationals, were killed in an attack on Port El Kantaoui near Sousse. Eerie footage shows hotels in Djerba, which were also hit hard by the decline in tourism. Still laid out in all their grandeur, the white lobbies and dining halls remain laden with chairs, tables and sofas for guests. Stunning chandeliers hang from the ceilings and facilities, from a fully-equipped bar to massage tables and spa rooms, remain intact apart from a heavy coating of dust. Outside, the magnificent Moorish-design courtyards remain impressive yet overgrown in their abandonment, with green pond-like liquid lying in the pools, Jacuzzis and water features. A state of emergency was first declared in Tunisia three years ago.  Advice from the UK Government states: Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in Tunisia, listing eight extremist activities. Urban explorer Bob Thissen, from Heerlen, The Netherlands, visited the sites after the country was declared a no-fly zone, and where some of the hotels closed as early as 2008. Bob said: It was crazy to walk alone in such big resorts where thousands of tourists used to spend their holidays. It was so silent. It\u0027s like a lost paradise. The pools have dirty green water, are half filled with sand and vegetation, or just the salt is left inside the saltwater pools. The normally perfect swept paths are now full of sand and covered with dead palm leaves. The outdoor animation buildings are falling apart, bars are empty, and the playground equipment appears lonely. All resorts were completely different, from perfect condition to completely ruined. I liked the post-apocalyptic exteriors with the pools the most.  It\u0027s crazy that these sized resorts are abandoned. Most resorts have multiple outdoor and indoor pools. It was a big contrast to see these abandoned decaying hotels against the beautiful blue water beaches. The decline in tourism in Tunisia followed a spate of terror attacks in 2015, where 71 people were killed in three incidents. The worst of that year occurred in June, when 38 foreign tourists, including 30 British nationals, were killed in an attack on Port El Kantaoui near Sousse. Bob and his group of \u0027urbexers\u0027 documented the locations for their channel \u0027Exploring the Unbeaten Path\u0027. He said: I think the area around Sousse was affected more by the decline than in Djerba. I think Djerba already had a hard time in the tourism industry, many hotels were already abandoned before 2015, but after the terrorist attacks it became even worse. I think it\u0027s not only abandoned due the attacks but made even worse because of the media and government. In Western Europe there have been many terrorist attacks and those countries remain \u0027safe\u0027 for tourists to visit. After the two terrorist attacks Tunisia was turned into a no-go zone, many airlines didn\u0027t fly to Tunisia anymore until recently and it had a huge impact on the tourism industry.

I think it might be good for both of us.”While Kamara has remained in Scotland this week for treatment, Kallman is off on international duty, though not with the full squad.But while, after winning his first full cap earlier this year, he appears to be dropping a level as he joins the U/21 squad for two vital Euro qualifiers, he’s happy.The 20-year-old is very much of the opinion that his near-certain involvement against Denmark and Poland will be a case of taking one step back to make two forward.The Dens loan signing from Turku doesn’t hide from the fact he would love to have competed at the higher level.For him, though, time on the park is what matters most and that’s why he’s more than happy to be representing his country in the younger age group.“Of course you always want to go forward and I heard back in Finland they were looking to put new players into the team and the manager said I was one of the options,” he said.“However, then again you have to think about that. Now I am in the U/21s and we have two qualifier games.“I’ve played with them all the time and am going to play as the first striker for them. You have to know which are the best moments to go to the first team because, if I go to the U/21s, I’ll get playing time and we have two games to try to qualify with them.“For that reason I think it might be better to be with the U/21s to get playing time. If I got called up to the first team, yes, I would be there but how much playing time will I get, I don’t know.“It’s easier to say afterwards because you don’t know how much time you will get but with the U/21s I know I am guaranteed playing time.”And the benefit to Dundee of his trip back to the continent should be the competitive nature of the action he sees.Not only are the opposition he’ll face of a decent standard, there’s plenty of stake in the fixtures.If the young Finns can win both, they would still be in with a chance of qualifying for the Euro finals, though the history of the group so far does suggest they will have their work cut out.When they faced the Danes at home last year they were on the wrong end of a 5-0 drubbing, so to beat them in the away tie will be a big ask.Kallman, though, is up for the challenge and is determined to do all his can to at least extend Finnish interest in qualification.“These will be a tough two games. They are the deciders for us because teams are four and five points ahead of us in the table with Poland first and Denmark second.“We have to at least not lose these game to still have a chance to proceed.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"craig easton sees irn bru as a chance for dundee united kids to get their fizz back","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United reserve team boss Craig Easton believes Saturday’s Irn-Bru Cup clash with Alloa will be the perfect test for his young team.The Tangerines second string were on the wrong end of a 5-1 score in the Reserve League at Hearts on Monday.But Craig believes the margin of the home team’s victory was not a fair reflection on his side’s play and is viewing the weekend tie as a chance to show that.“We are looking forward to the game even though it comes on the back of what wasn’t a good result for us against Hearts,” he said.“It wasn’t a 5-1 performance, though. We missed two penalties and we were always in the game until the last two goals went in later in the second half.“So, I think the score was harsh on us in the end but you still don’t want to lose five goals in any game and you want to defend better.”Looking forward, he suspects Alloa will not be much changed from the side that drew with United in the Championship last weekend“I think they don’t have a massive squad so it could be similar to the league game against us on Saturday. They are a good, fit and organised outfit. It will be a hard game.”As was the case in the first-round victory over St Johnstone Colts last month, the United ranks at Tannadice on Saturday are likely to be bolstered by several first-team men.And young midfielder Archie Thomas is back in contention for a starting place.He was injured in the first minute of the first-round victory but returned for half an hour of Monday’s game.United have set the entry price for Saturday’s game at £10.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b618c05b50b5-923x564.jpg ","title":"csaba laszlos new boys are showing some promise at dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIt remains early days so far as judging new-look Dundee United goes but there is no question Csaba Laszlo’s team are getting to know each other.After a sticky start to the season, there have been definite signs over the last three, unbeaten, Championship outings that the team is coming together.And the Tele takes a look and how the new men have contributed, so far.Matej RakovanAfter joining up on the same day as fellow-goalie Benjamin Siegrist, one of the big questions going into the campaign was which of the pair would get the nod. It was the Slovakian and, so far, he’s justified the faith shown in him with a string of impressive performances. He did make an error for the goal lost against Partick, but by then the game had been comfortably won.Frederic FransThe Belgian was added to the squad to provide steel in central defence and the fact he had experience of the Scottish game from a spell with Partick made him a sensible addition. So far he’s lived up to expectations and looked a strong and calming influence.Paul WatsonProbably the most low key signing, at first it seemed doubtful if the man who was a squad player at Falkirk would feature too often. Given his chance at Queen of the South last month, the powerful centre-half grabbed the opportunity and impressed in each of his three league games to date, scoring three goals in the process. With the arrival of Rachid Bouhenna, he still faces a challenge to keep his place.Christoph RabitschThe Austrian has had a robust start to his United career and a couple of rash tackles when he was already on a booking have seen him subbed to prevent the team being reduced to 10 men. The 22-year-old was publicly slapped down by Csaba for that. He appears to have taken it on board and there’s no question his ability to get in about opponents is an asset.Adam BartonCaptured from Partick Thistle just before the Betfred Cup games kicked off, the tall Englishman has added to United’s new-found aerial strength. Most of his appearances so far have been in midfield, so he’ll face a challenge once skipper Fraser Fyvie returns from injury, but he’s also been used in central defence and that versatility has given the manager more options.Fraser AirdOne of the first signings of the summer, the Canadian has added pace in the wide areas. He earned his move on the strength of performances against United for Dunfermline last term and, so far, he might just have been the best of the new bunch.Yannick LoembaThe winger was an unknown quantity who hadn’t had much football in the last year or so. However, there’s been no evidence of that and he’s made a lightning start to his time with United. The 28-year-old always wants on the ball and his eagerness to get forward has made him a fans’ favourite.Pavol SafrankoThe loan signing from Aalborg marked his debut with an excellent goal in the win at Queen of the South and has looked the part since. Well-known to the manager from their time together in his native Slovakia, Safranko looks to be the centre-forward United have been crying out for.Craig CurranA dead leg picked up in pre-season delayed his involvement until the opening league game when Dunfermline won at Tannadice. As his fitness has improved after that injury, Curran has shown himself to be a hard worker and chipped in with a goal against Partick.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee have a real gem in young striker cedwyn scott says berwick boss","story":"\t\t\t\t\tYoung Dundee striker Cedwyn Scott has earned high praise after a brace on his debut for Berwick.Boss Robbie Horn was highly impressed by the teenager.His double came in a 5-3 win at Albion Rovers when he grabbed the third and fifth goals in a dramatic tie.Horn said: “My research had shown that Cedwyn was a good player but he is better than I had hoped for.

They don’t understand how difficult it is to go to places like Alloa and do what you usually do.“Looking at the pitch, compared to Tannadice it’s completely different altogether, so you have to adjust your game. Alloa are playing there nearly every week so they’re used to it.“You’ve got that against you but it’s not just us, it’s going to be every team that goes there.“It was a difficult task on Saturday but again that’s an excuse and we shouldn’t have excuses.“We should be going there and doing the job.”Barton and central-midfield partner Christoph Rabitsch endured a difficult afternoon as Alloa’s Allan Trouten and Steven Hetherington engaged them in a physical battle.And the 27-year-old Englishman admits they lost control of the match.“We didn’t control the game at all, it’s as simple as that, we tried and couldn’t. It’s just the way the game was,” he added.“I’m sure at home it will be a completely different game but we weren’t used to the conditions and the width of the pitch, so it was tough.“I thought we deserved a point. I don’t think we deserved to win the game and fair play to them because they gave everything they’ve got.“We went to Alloa knowing it was not going to be easy. We didn’t underestimate them but they just played their game very well.“Even in midfield I drop in to get the ball and we mostly look like a back three.“We couldn’t do that against Alloa because it would give them a chance to press us and we were unable to do that.“That was one way in which we were affected in the way we like to play but I’m sure a lot of teams will go there and struggle to play their game.”Barton was honest in his assessment of the performance and says United’s players are not used to a more physical game but insists he knows they’ll need to get used to it.“It turned into a bit of a scrap. We don’t set up to play that kind of football and we don’t have the players who do that.“A lot of people would say you need to be able to adapt to most games but even the best players in the world don’t do the scrappy side of things. It’s just the way it is.“It’s in your nature, you can’t work on the physical side on the training pitch, you can work on being organised and having a better structure but you can’t go into training and work on aggression.“It just doesn’t happen and if you’re an aggressive person, great – if you’re not then you’re not.“You can’t wake up one day and say ‘I’m going to be aggressive’.“We’re not bothered about the play-offs, we want to win the league and we need to go to Alloa and win.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"poll results dundee fans give clear verdict on whether neil mccann should stay as manager","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee fans have given a clear message to the board regarding the future of manager Neil McCann.The Tele yesterday ran an online poll asking fans if McCann deserves more time to turn things round after at Dens a terrible start to the season.His position as Dundee manager is coming under increased scrutiny after his side lost for the fifth match running on Saturday.The Dark Blues went down 3-1 at home to Motherwell – and it could have been a lot worse.The Dee sit bottom of the table without a point and have twice been beaten by lower league opposition in the Betfred Cup.McCann is correct when he says his team had a similarly bad opening to last season’s campaign before recovering to finish safely in ninth place.However, less than one in five supporters shared his optimism as 80% of Dundee fans who voted in our online poll called for him to be dismissed after 17 months in the hot seat.Of the 1,609 votes submitted, 1,297 believed his time was up.One of our readers wrote: \u0026#8220His tactics and player recruitment have not been good enough.\u0026#8220There is no passion in his players, they were second best against a Motherwell side who chased and harried for everything throughout the match.\u0026#8220He should do the gentlemanly thing and resign and realise he is a better pundit than a manager.\u0026#8221Just 312 people felt he deserved more time.One wrote: \u0026#8220He is still a rookie and there are worse teams in the league.\u0026#8221McCann has time to regroup his players during the international break before a trip to Rangers, one of his former clubs, a week on Saturday.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/doors-open-days-collage.jpg ","title":"revealed all 36 buildings in dundee you can gain free entry into this weekend","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA number of Dundee\u0026#8217s best-loved and most recognisable buildings will throw open their doors this weekend. 100vw, 1000px\" /In total, 36 landmarks will welcome the public and give a behind-the-scenes look into some of the city’s hidden histories.Visitors will be given a glimpse inside the buildings tomorrow and Sunday.Tours will be provided at some locations and others may even put on refreshments especially for guests.Some places require booking in advance, others specify specific visiting hours while some can allow folk to turn up when they please.See below a list of all the places taking part an information regarding visiting times.For more information, visit the Doors Open Days website.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b45cc3d57c90-e1531308229935.jpg ","title":"revealed these are the men dundee fans want in charge if neil mccann leaves","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee supporters have revealed who they want to take over if Neil McCann leaves the club.Five straight defeats at the start of the season have heaped pressure on the current incumbent of the Dens Park hot seat.The Dee are slumped at the foot of the Premier League table and with a trip to McCann\u0026#8217s former employers Rangers next up, on September 15, there are concerns the club could soon become entrenched in the drop zone.A Tele online poll revealed yesterday that 80% of surveyed fans wanted McCann to leave.In the same survey we asked who supporters would want to take over in the event of McCann\u0026#8217s departure, and the voting was tight.Of the 186 people who suggested a new manager, the most preferred candidate was Robbie Neilson, with 28 votes. 100vw, 643px\" /The 38-year-old, who made 21 appearances for Dundee United in 2011-12, led Hearts from the Championship to the Europa League in the space of two years before leaving for MK Dons in November 2016.

But hopes that work would start in June floundered when a council officer and Historic Environment Scotland voiced disquiet over proposals for a rebuild that would have been lower than the original building.Although talks are still ongoing regarding the rebuild, planning officers using delegated powers have now given permission for the demolition on the condition the stones are numbered and stored for the rebuild.Central ward councillor Bet McAllister who will attend a meeting with other councillors, officials and the\u0026nbspowners tomorrow\u0026nbspis confident of a solution and hopes the project will be completed by this time next year.\"I would like to see work start before the end of this year and then once the better weather comes in March or April to have it rebuilt next year unless they hit any other snags,\" she said. \"That would be my dream.\"She also insisted that the building should be reinstated to the same height.\"We will stick to our guns on that,\" she said. \"It has to be done to what we want.\"Cllr McAllister said a compulsory purchase order could be an option if a resolution was not forthcoming.\"Hopefully, it will not come to that,\" she said. \"I am confident the owners will play ball and that everything we have asked them to do will be done.\"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspA council spokeswoman confirmed discussions were continuing regarding a rebuild and expected details of the project\u0027 programme to be released next week.Asked whether the council was considering a compulsory purchase order if the talks and proposals failed, she replied: \"All options remain under consideration which will enable the High Street being restored to full use.\"Pat Hayden, chairwoman of Crown and City Centre Community Council, said work should start as soon as possible and felt a more contemporary design for the rebuild should be considered if it would speed up progress.\u0026nbsp\"Time is being wasted,\" she said. \"If it is too difficult to rebuild as it was, let\u0027 forget it.

Detailed measures will be presented next week.Leaders of the minority independent administration said every attempt would be made to minimise the impact on services but \u0026ldquosome impact on service is inevitable.Budget leader Alister Mackinnon said: \u0026ldquoOur  reserves of \u0026pound8 million are well below the minimum recommended by Audit Scotland and it\u0027 vital that they\u0026rsquore not depleted further. The committee agreed stricter controls on recruitment and overtime, a review of all agency appointments and tighter controls on staff travel.The \u0026pound5.1 million figure equates to one per cent of the total budget and compares with a \u0026pound2.7 million estimate at this stage last year. The potential overspend is blamed on high cost placements for \u0026lsquolooked-after children\u0026rsquo, lower income from new parking charges and fewer savings from toilet closures because those two policies have not yet taken full effect.Council chiefs insisted no staff jobs were at risk.Finance director Derek Yule, however, warned there were \u0026ldquono more rabbits to be pulled from hats to tackle the problems.Black Isle Liberal Democrat Gordon Adam blamed Scottish Government grant cuts while SNP city councillor Richard Laird said the crisis was \u0026ldquoentirely of this council\u0027 making.Council leader Margaret Davidson claimed local government services were \u0026ldquonot a priority for the Scottish Government.The budget leader angered the SNP benches, accusing group leader Maxine Smith of not fully participating in budget discussions. He said he invited her to meetings but had been turned down \u0026ldquobecause she views her private commitments more important than reorganising her diary.She was not in the chamber to respond. In a later statement she said: \u0026ldquoOn Friday, I received a request to attend a meeting on Monday to discuss the budget. I had commitments but they were pre-arranged meetings with constituents. I\u0026rsquove sent him a meeting request for tomorrow. I\u0026rsquom available any time, so hopefully he\u0026rsquoll re-arrange his diary.

It will receive over \u0026pound487 million Scottish Government funding in 2018-19.n Support was voiced for a city councillor who has quit as the SNP\u0027 deputy leader on Highland Council.Richard Laird  cited health reasons for his decision.

For the last year or so, both my physical health and my mental health have been in decline.

They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

Accommodation, food, travel and the support of a qualified and experienced mountain leader and safety team are all included, and I\u0026#8217ll be there to support you throughout your fundraising journey.

Macmillan is there to help people with cancer live life as fully as they can.Offering a broad range of cancer information and support services \u0026#8211 including a free support line and a community of over 7,700 healthcare professionals \u0026#8211 demand for Macmillan’s services is constantly growing, but we rely on the generosity of the public to provide this support.Macmillan’s Coffee Morning takes place on Friday September 28 \u0026#8211 but people can host whenever they want. Whoever they invite and whatever they serve, people are highly encouraged to host a Macmillan Coffee Morning in a way that suits them.If people can’t bake, that doesn’t have to stop them. Throughout September, headline partner M\u0026ampS will be selling a selection of limited edition coffee morning products \u0026#8211 including lots of cakes, biscuits and two exclusive mugs \u0026#8211 with 10 per cent of proceeds going to Macmillan.Homes, workplaces and communities from the Shetland Islands to Land’s End will be hosting coffee mornings this year readers in Argyll and Bute can find events nearby using the interactive map on the Coffee Morning website www.macmillan.org.uk/coffee.Thank you to everyone who gets involved.Joanna Lumley, actress and Macmillan supporterSir,The SNP announced it is starting up a new \u0026#8216fact-checking\u0026#8217 service to monitor the accuracy of research and political statements.Many people in Scotland will be wondering if the SNP will be fact-checking the cost of its new independence blueprint.

Jemma won the two-lap race in 25.7 seconds and placed highly in another three events. Beth won the high jump clearing 1.14m and the long jump and Kirstie had an outstanding run to win the four-lap race in 55.5 seconds. The other event winner in this contest was Jemma’s twin sister Jorja who won the javelin throwing 14 metres.Local girl Neve Bowden was the under 9 champion thanks to wins in the four-lap race and long jump. Scarlett Speirs from Inveraray was runner-up winning the high jump and two-lap race. Carla Renton from Campbeltown won the javelin in this age group.Violet Campbell from Glenbarr dominated in the under 13’s contest winning all five events including a 6.49 metres throw in the shot putt. Emma Plumber from Tayvallich was runner up with Kyra Robertson from Ardrishaig in third place.Karis Kidd from Ardrishaig was the under 15 champion, winning the two running events and the long jump and finished 1.5 points ahead of Amy Gibson from Bunessan on Mull who won the high jump with a 1.40 metres clearance. Caryn Kerr from Campbeltown was third on overall points and won the shot putt with a 6.67 metres throw. The previous week Caryn won the junior shot putt at Oban Highland Games.Three girls tied on points in the under 7’s competition and the final placings were decided on the most individual wins which resulted in Cara Green from Ardrishaig the winner ahead of Zara Whyte and Chloe Hill.Ruairidh Charnock from Lochgilphead was the boys under 7 champion just one point ahead of Olly MacVicar from Tighnabruaich. Ruairidh won the two-lap race and long jump while Olly won the four-laprace and javelin throwing nine metres.Local boy George Balkeen dominated in the under 9’s with a clean sweep of wins which included impressive performances in the two-lap race recording 27.9 seconds, four-lap in 61.6 and a 10.50 metres javelin throw. Luke MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was second overall and Ciaran Johnstone from Oban was third.Roan MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was the under 11 champion thanks to wins in the two running events and finished four points ahead of Sam Gillespie from Lochgilphead who won the high jump and javelin throwing an impressive 14.25m. Third placed Robert Kerr from Campbeltown won the long jump in this section.Two Kintyre boys excelled in the under 13’s with Lewis Gilchrist from Tayinloan champion thanks to wins in the two-lap race in 22.9 and four-lap race in 48.2 seconds. Runner-up Ruaridh Campbell from Glenbarr won the shot putt throwing 9.76 metres and third placed Murray MacDonald also impressed winning the high jump with 1.31 metres and long jump.The entry was disappointing in the two older age groups where Finlay MacLean from Oban won the under 15’s ahead of Ewan Ferguson from Lochgilphead. Finlay won four events and Ewan won the high jump.Jake Gillespie from Lochgilphead was the under 17 winner ahead of Shaun Doy from Kilmichael Glassary. Shaun won the long jump and high jump clearing 1.55 metres. Jake recorded 22.1 seconds in the two-lap and threw an impressive 10.33 metres in the shot putt. Jake had a very successful summer season competing at the local Highland Games in Argyll and ended the circuit at Oban Games the previous week winning the overall Argyll junior championship.The two annual trophies in memory of the late Hugh MacArthur, founder member of the local club in 1984 who died in June 2015, were contested in the under 9 boys and under 9 girls.

A glass pane at Belleisle pro Richard Gordon’s shop was smashed in the 4am raid. Titleist and Wilson clubs were taken, in addition to Richard’s Ping bag and clubs. Police told the pro there’s been around 25 similar thefts in Scotland since April. And they are working with the Scottish Professional Golfers’ Association to track down raiders. “It’s absolutely gut-wrenching,” said Richard, 45. “The bag and clubs were presented to me in April in Phoenix, Arizona,” he said. The pro was given the accolade of being named Ping Custom Fitter of the Year for Scotland. His precious set of clubs includes a titanium driver, along with a three-wood, hybrid clubs, a full set of irons and a putter. All are high-end, high-value clubs - as are the other makes taken in the raid. Richard and his staff moved into the new South Ayrshire Council shop facility around two-and-a-half years ago. “It’s fully alarmed, and has CCTV cameras,” he said. “Security is excellent, but these raiders are prepared to go to any lengths.” It’s been reported, in other raids, that thieves have smashed through metal shutters, and even brick walls. The pro shop at Dundonald Links, between Troon and Irvine, was also targeted in a recent raid. Richard praised the way the police are conducting their inquiries. “They’ve been highly forensic in their investigation - even trying to get DNA,” he said. “The CCTV shows hooded figures, but it’s something the police are still looking at,” he added. Richard has been associated with Belleisle for 25 years, and has been head pro for 11 years. Richard’s wife Vikki works with him in the business, and Lee Hughes is his assistant pro. Richard said: “I love Belleisle, and it’s great that South Ayrshire has invested so much in municipal golf facilities.” “I think South Ayrshire runs the best municipal golf course in Britain if you exclude St Andrews.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrGet into GolfAyr NewsSouth Ayrshire CouncilSt AndrewsTroonDundonald"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13191066.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_IBP_AYP_290818CHAMPION_11JPG.jpg","title":"hundreds flock welcome back inspirational","story":"NewsHundreds flock to welcome back inspirational world record breakerPupils, parents and teachers surrounded the car park of Kyle Academy to show their appreciation of Gavin Drysdale, who smashed a world record at the European World Para Athletics in Berlin.Share\u0026nbspByLochlin Highet14:05, 4 SEP 2018NewsKyle Academy pupil Gavin Drysdale \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHundreds of people flocked to a school to welcome back an inspirational hero. Pupils, parents and teachers surrounded the car park of Kyle Academy to show their appreciation of Gavin Drysdale, who smashed a world record at the European World Para Athletics in Berlin. S6 pupil Gavin, of Ayr, brought home the gold in the race running 100m category with an incredible time of 17.37 seconds. And he was given a hero’s welcome as he was led in by a bagpipe performance. He made his way round the hundreds of emotional crowd, and there was barely a dry eye to be seen. It was clear to see how much Gavin had brought the community together, and how immensely proud they were of the superstar. A teacher was even seen asking “is my mascara running?”, which summed up the emotional parade for Gavin. And it was so clear to see how delighted Gavin was with the turnout, with pupils even running over to grab selfies with him. A buzzing Gavin said: “The reception I got coming back to school was overwhelming. “I wasn’t expecting anything like that reaction I got, it was great. “Kyle Academy are always very supportive of any competition I am doing.” Gavin, 17, has cerebral palsy and has been race running for 10 years. He trains at Dam Park, and when he started way back in 2008 he was the only race runner from Scotland. Now there are over 100 competitors from the country.  He is part of the race running club which is supported by Blue Rock Insurance Brokers. The race club is a branch of Ayr Seaforth and is coached by David Phee. Gavin also trains at Red Star in Glasgow with Janice Eaglesham. And the race running has came so far since he started, and these games have helped it get well on its way to being a part of the Paralympic games. Gavin competed in a special racing trike, which has impressive Continental tyres on it. Gavin is still on cloud nine after bagging the top prize in Berlin. He said: “When I won I was totally stunned. “I felt like I had already won a gold medal just by being there, so the fact I actually won was amazing!”  All the way through Gavin’s journey, his mum Margaret and dad Peter have been there supporting him. His family and friends have helped him along the way, and his sister Natalie even had banners up at the family home to celebrate his success for when he got back. Dad Peter said: “We are just so proud of Gavin. “We were so relieved when he won the gold - as we knew how much hard work he put into his progress. “The games went great, and it’s incredible to see how well the Scottish athletes done at the games.  “We have to extend our thanks to Kyle Academy for being so supportive and for this spectacular welcome they have given us.” Gavin isn’t just a star on the track, he has just sailed through S5 picking up an impressive five highers at A and B grades. He was also a part of the Commonwealth games baton relay in 2014. Headteacher for Kyle Academy, Mary Byrne said: “The whole school is so proud of Gavin. “We are delighted that we are able to show our support for him, and everyone at the school is delighted for him.” "},{"url":null,"title":"prestwick airport could used free","story":"NewsPrestwick Airport could be used as free parking base for ScotRail passengers on Ayr to Glasgow Central lineGovernment officials have pledged to examine the possibility of using the airport - which they own - for free parking relief to help ease the pain of commuters.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson16:08, 6 SEP 2018NewsPrestwick Airport could be used for free parking \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPrestwick Airport could be used as an unlikely saviour in the ongoing crisis at Ayr Railway Station. Government bosses are examining a plan to utilise the flight hub - which they own - for free parking. A number of services on the Ayr to Glasgow Central line will start and terminate at Prestwick Town from next Monday. But with concerns over a lack of parking in the town, transport chiefs have begun scrambling for other options. Ayr MSP, John Scott, led calls for the move to be considered during First Minister\u0027s Questions today in Holyrood. After raising the issue with Nicola Sturgeon, he told the Ayrshire Post: This is now a crisis situation and we should be looking at all available options. Parking in Prestwick is at a premium as it is, so if the airport can provide free spaces until this situation is resolved, it is something we should look at. Responding to Mr Scott\u0027s idea in parliament, Ms Sturgeon said: It strikes me as a very good suggestion and I can\u0027t think of any immediate objection anyone would have. We know the pressure this is putting on commuters. The First Minister has pledged to explore the option with her officials. Four carriage services will continue to operate between Ayr and Glasgow, but six carriage trains will be halted at Prestwick as part of ScotRail\u0027s plan to combat overcrowding on the line. It comes as crisis engulfs Ayr station with the crumbling overhead hotel, owned by a private Malaysian businessman, subject to a large exclusion zone.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnNicola SturgeonPrestwick AirportScotrailGlasgowAyrTransportAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"stagecoach accused turning ayr street","story":"NewsStagecoach accused of turning Ayr street into \u0027deathtrap\u0027 as double deckers thunder down back roadNeighbours say double decker buses accessing the Waggon Road depot in Ayr are thundering along quiet Green Street at all times of the day and night after a route change.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson13:59, 7 SEP 2018NewsResidents protest outside the bus garage \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFurious residents claim a bus giant has turned their back street into a deathtrap.

collaborations between Scottish and Barbadian or \u0026ldquoBajan culture.\nMusicians, dancers, drummers and pipers all come together for a fun-filled weekend, accompanied by top chefs, serving up much loved Scottish meals with a distinct Bajan twist.\nThe now popular festival had humble beginnings in the 1990s when a Welsh men\u0026rsquos choir travelled to the island to perform in a local concert hall.\nSince then, the celebration has expanded and has featured Celtic acts from Canada, across the UK, Ireland, the USA and even Australia.\nFestival director Carol Anderson from Edinburgh

report showed just five were issued in the space of a year.\nFigures revealed via a freedom of information request showed that in 2017 the local authority received 100 complaints about out of control dogs \u0026ndash but gave just six advisory notices and five dog control orders to irresponsible owners.\nHowever, following a meeting with Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale MSP Christine Grahame, the council has revealed it has handed out 15 dog control notices over the last 12 months, with two still pending.\nMs Grahame, who introduced the Control of Dogs  Act 2010 as a member\u0026rsquos bill, said: \u0026ldquoI had a very useful discussion with the representatives from Scottish Borders Council and it was important to hear first-hand how this legislation is being used in practice.\n\u0026ldquoIn the last year there have been 15 dog control notices with two pending, although there are some issues with obtaining owner details. Some owners just need to be spoken to and advised of their responsibilities.\nDog control orders allow Scottish Borders Council to impose certain conditions on dog owners. For example, a dog which frequently runs away may be required to be kept on a lead at all times, or an aggressive dog may have to be muzzled when in public spaces.\nThe control orders can also be used to compel dog owners to seek training for themselves and their pet. Failure to adhere to a dog control order could lead to a ban from keeping animals or the dog being put down.\nA Scottish Borders Council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe council is currently reviewing its responsible dog ownership strategy, which will aim to remind owners of their social and legal responsibilities.\n\u0026ldquoAs part of this strategy, the council works in partnership with local and national charities to promote responsible ownership and dog control by educating the public at ious events across the Borders.\n\u0026ldquoThe council responds to all complaints received concerning out of control dogs, but in order to assist us in investigating each complaint fully, we ideally require the dog owner\u0026rsquos details.\n\u0026ldquoMembers of the public can contact 0300 100 1800 or visit www.scotborders.gov.uk if they have a concern about a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour.\nMs Grahame added: \u0026ldquoMy main concern is that members of the public may not be aware that if a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour is causing concern, for example being allowed to be out of control, they can report it to the council through this route.\n\u0026ldquoThe police, of course, deal with the most serious incidents. However I brought in my bill establishing dog control notices as a way of intervening before a dog bites or attacks and becomes dangerous.\n\u0026ldquoOnce a dog control notice is issued, the council will regularly check up to ensure it\u0026rsquos being followed.\n\u0026ldquoI would encourage anyone concerned about a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour whether in public, in its garden or indeed any other private place to get in touch with the council.

Before the official opening, our reporter Hilary Scott met up with Susan Meikle and Hazel Millen, owners of the Allotment, who stepped in to save the day following the closure of the previous Post Office on the High Street.\nIt wasn\u0026rsquot ever their dream to be postal mistresses. Susan and Hazel were content running their successful store, which has been selling fresh fruit and vegetables, cheese, wholefoods, jams and chutney since 2011.\nThey had always been open to suggestions from residents on new products and ideas \u0026ndash creating a monthly cheese tasting evening, and a popular home delivery service.\nWhen news hit the town of the Post Office closure in February last year, the community fought a hard campaign to see its full-time service return.\nThe impact of the closure was felt by the Allotment and other High Street businesses. Susan explained: \u0026ldquoWhen it closed, a lot of people who previously used the Post Office started going out of the town and naturally doing their shopping elsewhere. It hit Innerleithen hard.\nThe pair had previously laughed off any suggestions by locals that they could house the Post Office within their store.\nBut one evening in late December, something moved Susan to click a link online to find out more information \u0026ndash and from this very moment, the revival of the Post Office began.\nNo-one had officially approached them to take on the Post Office, so when asked what moved them to send the application, Susan and Hazel looked at one another and mused: \u0026ldquoYou could call it insanity!\nIt wasn\u0026rsquot easily signed, sealed and delivered. There were many loop holes to jump through, including applications, interviews and trips to Glasgow for training, before they could start running Innerleithen\u0026rsquos new service from their premises.\nAnd although Susan and Hazel say they will not financially benefit by taking on this new responsibility, they feel the gain is retaining a vital service for the people of Innerleithen.\nVariety is the spice of life, and for the Allotment owners and their two hardworking members of staff Leanne and Susan, they\u0026rsquoll be juggling more than apples and pears on occasions. \u0026ldquoI hope people give us a chance. It is going to be a challenge running the Post Office and serving our valued customers, added Susan. \u0026ldquoThere are going to be times that there will be a queue and we would appreciate people\u0026rsquos patience. We are new to this. It might take a little longer for us to do things, but it will be done right.\nI on the other-hand like to think that a little festive magic played its part in the happy ending to this tale, and somewhere in this quaint town, the one request on someone\u0026rsquos Christmas list was that the community didn\u0026rsquot lose its postal service.\nAnd it wasn\u0026rsquot delivered by a postman, or a man with a white beard wearing a red suit and black boots.

This can make the successful donation and transplantation of more delicate organs such as the heart and lungs less likely.\nAnother factor is thought to be an increased awareness of the benefits of lung transplants, leading to an increased number of referrals.\nBut it said family refusal remains the biggest barrier to all forms of organ donation and transplantation.\nAlthough more people are supporting donation than ever, one in three families still decline to donate.\nLaura Beattie, 29, from Stretford in Greater Manchester, has cystic fibrosis and was added to the transplant waiting list just over a month ago. Her lung function has declined in the last couple of years and is now at around 24%.\nThe Manchester United fan now uses oxygen in daily life and also a wheelchair at times when she goes out for more than a few hours. She also requires non-invasive ventilation \u0026ndash airway support administered through a nasal mask \u0026ndash overnight.\n\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove known for more than 20 years that I would need a transplant one day but I was still terrified to be told I was going on the list because it made it real, Ms Beattie said.\n\u0026ldquoBut I know it\u0026rsquos the right thing to do. I get breathless even turning over in bed or getting dressed.\n\u0026ldquoI could be waiting a short time or a long time, I don\u0026rsquot know. I just try and get on with my life.\n\u0026ldquoI really hope more people support and really consider donation because a transplant is my only option now and donation can save so many lives.\nAround 17% of people listed for a lung transplant have died a year later.\nJohn Forsythe, NHS Blood and Transplant associate medical director for organ donation and transplantation, said: \u0026ldquoLast year, 65 people died on the lung transplant waiting list and many of those lives could have been saved or transformed had more families said yes to donation.\n\u0026ldquoTelling your family what you want also makes things easier at a difficult time.\n\u0026ldquoSadly, many donation opportunities are lost every year because families don\u0026rsquot know if their loved one wanted to be a donor or not.

local schools.If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved  school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities.Council authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system.Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is of course partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms so as to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew’s House.Is it

halves.Despite having an intensive and productive pre-season programme, the Pupils somehow went missing for the first forty-five minutes of last Saturday’s Argyll derby against the previous season’s runaway Premier Two champions, Lochgilphead Red Star.For whatever reason, the local lads looked completely out of sorts from the start, scorning ball possession for the direct ‘killer’ pass behind the visitor’s resolute back four.This tactic was never on because of a following breeze and the unpredictability of a wet greasy surface.Nevertheless, Sary Rhama showed his mettle when a parting shot was unlucky to slam off the cross bar with the keeper well beaten.Minutes later, Star’s imposing last of defence pulled off a great one-handed stop as he launched himself to turn the ball round the post.The first half was anything but a classic, and although the local McFadyen sponsored Pupils had the lion’s share of possession, they were fortunate to see a low strike clatter off the base the post with the home keeper well beaten.Minutes before half-time, a searching cross-field pass caused confusion in the home defence, and with two men going for the same ball, Lee McLean picked up the loose ends to cut inside and send the ball into the far corner of the net for the opener,Cue the second half, and it was transformation time as far as the home side was concerned.Night and day would be an accurate description of their play, as the Pupils pounded the Lochgilphead rearguard in search of the equaliser.A headed clearance early in the second half fell short of its mark, and this allowed Robin Barr to chest down and hit a sweet volley past a despairing last line of defence – all square and everything to play for!Gary Grumoli was next up, and his angled drive was tipped onto the inside of the post before it running invitingly along the goal line before being thumped to safety.Liam Renton had a great run into the box this before his inch perfect cross found Rhama whose parting shot was smothered by a grateful but fortunate goalkeeper.Lochgilphead were very aware of the threat of Donald McCallum on the Pupils right flank, doubling up defensively to crowd out the ex-Dumbarton man at every opportunity.As the Pupils committed forward there was always the chance of a goal on the break, but the home defence copped well and received good support from their midfield to nullify any threat.In the end both teams had to settle for a point apiece in he first derby of the season, on reflection, the visitors the happier of the two sides after withstanding a veritable siege for almost two-thirds of the second period.A decent sized home crowd enjoyed the second half after an uncharacteristic slow start by the local favourites.It is on to the Scottish Cup and a game

Both present geological challenges but they can be overcome.\u0026#8216Today, I\u0026#8217ve asked for a feasibility study to look at these issues and move things forward.\u0026#8217In February, the Courier compared a potential bridge from Kintyre to Northern Ireland, to the Øresund bridge, which connects Copenhagen in Denmark with Malmo in Sweden.Professor Dunlop drew on this comparison during his speech, referencing the fact that the Øresund bridge links two separate countries, each with their own distinct identifies but sharing a cultural heritage, similar to Scotland and Northern Ireland.He pointed out the political benefits of linking the two UK countries, especially post-Brexit.He believes a bridge may re-balance the concentration of power held by Westminster and be an investment in what he considers to be the true north.Argyll and Bute MSP, Michael Russell, said of the plans: \u0026#8216A bridge, together with better road links to the central belt, would open up Argyll in a dramatic new way.\u0026#8216I would be keen to see public bodies investigate the feasibility of such a link.\u0026#8217The Øresund bridge, linking Denmark and Sweden, could be similar to a structure linking Kintyre with Northern Ireland.

Oban.The items, including a dummy shell, gas goggles, badges and medals, a uniform and original airship banners and propellers, were collated, over the course of a year, by Eleanor McKay, bibliographic and local studies librarian at Live Argyll, after a conversation with Major Struthers\u0026#8217 son Charles.\u0026#8216He said he had \u0026#8216one or two things\u0026#8217 belonging to his late father,\u0026#8217 Eleanor explained. \u0026#8216It turned out to be eight boxes full of artefacts that we\u0026#8217re still going through now.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s one of the best collections from the First World War that we have seen.\u0026#8217There are parts of shot-down airships, a parachute, fragments of a radiator from a zeppelin and much more.Accompanying the artefacts, are photographs, many taken by Major Struthers himself, documenting his personal life and military career, as well as the history of airships.Major Struthers, who was mentioned in dispatches, was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, with two bars later added, for his missions with the Royal Naval Air Service, which amalgamated with the British Army\u0026#8217s Royal Flying Core to become the Royal Air Force in 1918.Major Struthers was recognised for flying more hours than any other airship pilot during the war.Aged 52 by the time the Second World War broke out, Major Struthers was too old to serve but he was in the Royal Observer Corps, his patch stretching from Sutherland to Machrihanish.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s local to Oban but it\u0026#8217s an Argyll story,\u0026#8217 said

Campbeltown opening to find out more about the Cornish history, and found it \u0026#8216fascinating\u0026#8217.During her opening speech, Eleanor said: \u0026#8216I think this is an area of World War One that people don\u0026#8217t really think about.\u0026#8216They think about later aircraft, especially in World War Two, but I don\u0026#8217t think they know the role they had in World War One.\u0026#8217Councillor Donald Kelly, who attended the opening, said he thought it was essential to engage with local school children: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s important that youngsters today know

Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

And it takes the masterplan a stage further with more detailed ideas for each of the zones proposed in its vision, including calling for the Scottish Government to be invited to base its HQ for its proposed state company on the site, as well as suggesting offshore windfarm company Inch Cape \u0026ndash which wants to place a substation on the land to bring energy ashore from proposed turbines \u0026ndash should also be encouraged to put its Scottish base there.  The community council document comes in the wake of a brochure produced by neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council promoting its vision of a Port of Prestonpans cruise terminal at the former power station site.  That proposal sparked anger among supporters of the masterplan vision, who accused the Prestonpans group of ignoring the views of the local communities.  It led to the launch of \u0026lsquoGreenhills: delivering the Masterplan\u0026rsquo, a campaign by local groups and businesses backing the consultation document.  Now Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council has drawn up a draft brochure which sets out why it supports the plans and proposes a range of detailed ways it could be taken forward.  That includes putting head offices for Inch Cape and the Scottish Government energy interests in one part of the site, identified as its \u0026lsquoEnergy Quarter\u0026rsquo.  It also floats the idea of flooding the power station footprint to create a marina \u0026ndash as suggested by a local fisherman \u0026ndash with associated retail and leisure facilities, attracting businesses such as a film studio or 3D printing innovation to the site, or even creating a brewery.

ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.

If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.

All four have confirmed they will be attending the hearing.

That project came about following rising safety concerns from drivers who did not feel confident using the unlit road.  Since then, driver confidence has improved by 78 per cent, with the project, which was undertaken by UK-based Clearview Intelligence in partnership with Transport Scotland and Amey, shortlisted in the Road Safety, Traffic Management and Enforcement category at the National Transport Awards, which take place in October.  Councillor Norman Hampshire, a Dunbar ward councillor and deputy leader of East Lothian Council, as well as chairman of the A1 Action Group, was one of those hailing the project as a big success.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe installation of the studs has, in my view, revolutionised the driving experience on the A1 after dark.  \u0026ldquoThe studs have improved night-time visibility beyond all recognition along certain parts of the route.  Concerns about driving conditions on the unlit road were first raised by the A1 Action Group, which comprises councillors from Scottish Borders and East Lothian Councils, transportation groups and community councils.  Transport Scotland met with the action group and, upon investigating the road, recognised that entering or exiting the A1 during the hours of darkness was a key area of concern due to a lack of visibility, junction definition and consistency in signage and road markings.  Clearview Intelligence was then appointed by Amey to make improvements to the road as part of a wider project and installed the road studs to give a visual consistency to the route by ensuring all major junctions were visible and treated similarly.  This included using white, red, amber and green studs to effectively highlight road edges, the centre of the road and junctions.  Andy Salotti, director of solutions at Clearview Intelligence, said: \u0026ldquoWe are immensely proud of the work we did to improve the driving conditions on the A1 and delighted this has been recognised at a national level.

Ward councillor Kenny McLeod  backed the Barratt proposal, highlighting the lack of council housing available for rent in Tranent: the proposed Barratt development included 25 per cent affordable housing.  Mr McLeod said: \u0026ldquoWe need to keep the local connection and they are not building housing for rent in this area.  \u0026ldquoIt must be 50 years since a house was put in the area for rent.  However, fellow Tranent, Wallyford and Macmerry councillor Colin McGinn  said he was concerned about the traffic that would be created by more than 100 homes on the site, which is on the opposite side of the town\u0026rsquos Haddington Road from Steading View.  He added: \u0026ldquoWe have a responsibility within Tranent to increase employment and opportunities for our young people.  Councillor Brian Small , opposition leader, told the committee: \u0026ldquoThere is no point in having a [Local Development] Plan if at the first turn we think we can turn it over. We need to give this business land the opportunity to develop.  The committee was told that while the district valuer had agreed with developers that the land was not financially viable as a single business plot, they had said it could be made financially sound by developing it in phases.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoWe have enough land set aside for housing.  \u0026ldquoPeople want \u0026ndashand need \u0026ndash local employment and if we build it they will come. This is a signal to developers we want to grow the number of jobs around the county.  The committee voted by nine votes to two to support the officials\u0026rsquo recommendation to refuse the plans."},{"url":null,"title":"transport-co2-emissions-on-the-rise-in-east-lothian","story":"  The latest data from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy has revealed that CO2 emissions from freight and passenger transport rose by 4.2 per cent in the county between 2011 and 2016.  That means traffic was responsible for 18.5 per cent of the total amount of carbon dioxide released in East Lothian in 2016.  But in total, CO2 emissions in the county fell over the same period.  Jason Rose, from East Lothian Greens, blamed more housing developments in East Lothian for the rise in CO2 from emissions relating to transport.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoTo live [in the new developments], you need a car. More houses means more cars.  Mr Rose also highlighted the fact that nearly half of East Lothian residents commute to Edinburgh every day for work.  \u0026ldquoThe main issue is half the people who live in East Lothian work in Edinburgh, so they have to commute, he said.  \u0026ldquoBuses take a long time, you want cheap and reliable.  \u0026ldquoWith trains, there definitely needs to be more of an effort to improve length and frequency.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council should be trying to increase employment in East Lothian, so people don\u0026rsquot need to commute.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove heard some people say, \u0026lsquooh what if you open a bridge here or build another road?\u0026rsquo but creating more roads just increases traffic and spreads the problem around.  Overall, emissions from transport, both private and for business purposes, increased by 3.5 per cent in the UK over the period between 2011 and 2016.  However, total CO2 emissions fell by 4.6 per cent over the five years in East Lothian.  The county was responsible for releasing 1.1 million tonnes of CO2 in 2016 \u0026ndash down from 1.15 million tonnes five years earlier.  But Mr Rose highlighted that it was not just CO2 emissions that needed to be monitored.  \u0026ldquoWe need to watch for NO2  and PM10  \u0026ndash those are the pollutants that can cause health risks, he added.  In East Lothian, industrial and commercial activities are by far the main producer of CO2 emissions, releasing 63.9 per cent of the total. In 2016, households produced 16 per cent of the CO2 in the county, lower than five years earlier.  The Department also takes into account the amount of CO2 produced by farms and through other rural activities and the CO2 removed from the air by trees.  According to its estimates, these agricultural activities produced more greenhouse gases than forests removed, and so were responsible for 1.6 per cent of the carbon emissions in East Lothian in 2016.  Overall, the UK reduced its carbon emissions by 15.4 per cent over the five years."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  We\u0027ll also reveal the Top 25 in this year\u0027s Pet Idol competition.

Duo Gymnastics, based at the Aubigny Sports Centre, Haddington, is keen to buy a new vaulting table, which costs about \u0026pound1,000.  Jane said: \u0026ldquoWhat I have been really impressed with is the way the club and coaches have adapted to him.  \u0026ldquoThere is mainstream gymnastics but they have adapted lessons for his needs.  \u0026ldquoIt has made him not feel different and he still feels part of the club \u0026ndash he really enjoys it.  \u0026ldquoCameron\u0026rsquos disability comes under Global Development Delay.  \u0026ldquoHe has a real difficulty with comprehension and understanding what is being asked of him, following instructions.  \u0026ldquoHe is also very sensitive to noise and sudden loud noises.  \u0026ldquoThat is what they have managed to do really well, break it down into small parts for him.  \u0026ldquoThrough time, it becomes a routine and he understands what is being asked of him.  Jane, who lives near Gifford, has been a keen swimmer for a number of years and represented Scotland in the 1994 Commonwealth Games, in Canada.  However, after a break from swimming she returned to the pool at the beginning of the year before swapping the pool for the sea earlier this summer.  She said: \u0026ldquoI kept swimming as a hobby and to keep fit.  \u0026ldquoI have always swam but it has always been indoor swimming.  \u0026ldquoI started looking about and had always had an interest in open-water swimming but never did it.  \u0026ldquoI came across the Firth of Forth swim and that quite appeals to me and thought I would give it a go.  The mum-of-two signed up in March for the swim, which sees swimmers head off from Hawes Pier and swim alongside the Forth Bridge towards North Queensferry.  Swimmers set off at 2.10pm and have an hour to complete the 1.4-mile swim.  In preparation for the fundraiser on September 22, Jane has taken to the waters off Dumfries and Galloway\u0026rsquos coast and has also linked up with the Bass Rock Swimmers, who are based in North Berwick.  Despite being an accomplished swimmer, Jane said there were still challenges.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe currents are certainly a big factor.  \u0026ldquoIt is just your awareness and you can go off track very easily and just that anticipation of what is below you and what you are swimming over.  \u0026ldquoI have enjoyed the challenge and it has certainly put me out of my comfort zone.  \u0026ldquoI have really enjoyed it and met some really lovely people.  \u0026ldquoMy thanks go to my husband, Garry, and family for support and encourage to take on the challenge and to Duo Gymnastics Club for the support and help they have given Cameron.  Pamela Fletcher, from the gymnastics club, said: \u0026ldquoThanks to Jane undertaking the swim, the club can purchase a new and much needed vaulting table for the gymnastics at Aubigny Sport Centre. Due to local support we have now met our target however donations continue meaning we can hopefully purchase some more equipment. Our club trains twice a week however classes are ran Monday to Friday through enjoyleisure so the equipment is well used by over 200 local gymnasts.

I\u0026rsquom now in my late 50s, and 60 is looming ahead of me like a cat waiting to pounce and have cruel fun. Yet I know people who are in their 30s and 40s who are much older than me, and folk in their 60s and above who are younger. My oldest daughter is in her early 20s and is already lamenting the fact she is no longer \u0026lsquoyoung\u0026rsquo.  The truth is that age is a mentality or, as is often said, \u0026lsquojust a number\u0026rsquo. Of course, deteriorating health and pain can come with age, as I have experienced, but even then, getting this far makes me very thankful despite the wear and tear.  I often say that life is like toothpaste: we use it with abandon at first and then, as we realise it\u0026rsquos running out, each squirt becomes increasingly more precious and satisfying.  \u0026ldquoA whole summer seems nothing these days, it\u0026rsquos over before you get used to it, a friend said to me recently. And indeed it is nothing if we measure it by days passed.  Yet if we measure not the passing of hours, days or years but the accumulation of memories and experiences, then time seems longer, both in quantity and quality. The trick, then, is to make those experiences and memories, and to truly live in them as they happen. This means understanding what is truly meaningful to us, and what gives genuine joy and fulfilment.  I think that is the secret to a long life, regardless of what number you reach. It\u0026rsquos not just about how much toothpaste is in your tube, it\u0026rsquos about how much you savour and use the amount you have. All of us savour key moments, of course. The first day at school for our children, our holiday time, time with friends or spent doing things we enjoy.  Yet inevitably such moments are less common than what we might call the daily routine of life. I suppose that\u0026rsquos what makes them stand out. Thus the daily routine of \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo life shoots us by, almost without us noticing. And that\u0026rsquos most of our life.  And so I am now more determined than ever to make my life \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo for as long as I may have left. This isn\u0026rsquot a commitment to hippy living in a campervan  but a conscious decision to savour every day as if it were my last. And what really helped me in this realisation was a conversation one day while waiting for a train. . .  One spring morning just before this summer, I was standing on the platform at Prestonpans station waiting for a train. I was not used to getting this early train and was surprised how busy it was. I was heading into Edinburgh to do some storytelling and so unusually sharing my journey with commuters.  It was a beautiful warm sunny morning, the herald of the heatwave soon to arrive. As I waited for the train I scrolled on my phone. Then I heard a voice behind me saying: \u0026ldquoOn your death bed, will you really look fondly back on the countless hours, equivalent to years of your life, spent scrolling on a phone? Will you remember just one per cent of that activity, or even want to?  I turned round to see who was speaking to me there was nobody. Then I noticed the hawthorn tree.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos better, the hawthorn said. It was resplendent with blossom, leaning over the edge of the side of the bridge which takes the cars below the station.  Perhaps I had seen it before, but this time I really noticed it because it had spoken to me. I studied its flowers and took in the immense beauty of it. It\u0026rsquos perfectly situated to admire, but the hawthorn seemed sad.  \u0026ldquoCan you imagine the effort it takes to get this magnificent and beautiful? it said. \u0026ldquoYet nobody seems to notice me.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure they do, I replied. \u0026ldquoNo, they don\u0026rsquot watch, insisted the tree. And so I did.  The hawthorn was right. People walked past the tree, stood next to it, but nobody seemed to notice it, and certainly nobody took any time to admire it.  \u0026ldquoBut they are busy, I said in our defence.  \u0026ldquoWe are all busy in different ways, said the tree. \u0026ldquoBut we can choose to be \u0026lsquotoo busy\u0026rsquo for some things while being busy doing others. Often you decide what is important to be busy with so you exclude what you think are the less important things.  \u0026ldquoLike looking and admiring you? I replied sarcastically.  \u0026ldquoPrecisely, said the hawthorn, perhaps not understanding a sarcastic tone.  Suddenly the train arrived. People put away their phones and I bade a hasty farewell to the tree. We all crammed into the carriage and it filled up to the brim. I saw the blazing white of the hawthorn\u0026rsquos blossom through the window. Then we headed for Wallyford.  The train ground to a halt and the doors opened. There was a crush and people calling out politely \u0026ldquoplease move up. I wondered if everyone would get on, and I think they did, but only just. Now the train felt overloaded and it literally ground its way out of the station.  When it arrived at Musselburgh, the doors opened to present a human wall made of commuters from the Pans and Wallyford. There was simply no way anyone was getting on. I watched from the privilege of my seat. Two young men with suitcases, obviously going on holiday had no chance, and didn\u0026rsquot even try.  As the train pulled away, leaving dozens of people stranded on the platform, I felt a sense of guilt at having a seat. At Waverley we were trapped in a bottleneck by ticket collectors, ensuring that none of the lucky ones who had actually managed to get onto the train would escape paying for their good fortune.  When I returned I had to cross the bridge to my car. And there was the hawthorn tree, showing off its blossom like a peacock trying to impress a mate with its feather display.  And I have noticed the hawthorn ever since. The blossom faded as summer arrived and now it bears it berries. Its haws glisten where once there was blossom, reminding me that summer has had its course, and asking the question of how I made it memorable.  I am so thankful for the hawthorn\u0026rsquos advice. It was simple but so important. The trick is to live in the moment to notice that which makes the mundane and normal extraordinary or beautiful or special.  We can pepper our daily life with simple but extraordinary moments of connection, so a day never really remains \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo. We just have to truly live in that moment, to come out of our busyness and worries, and savour it.  Maybe the hawthorn tree will speak to you if ever you find yourself at Prestonpans train station. Or maybe someone else will your child, your grandchild, your partner, friends, your grandparents, your work colleague, or perhaps your inner self.  Maybe it wasn\u0026rsquot actually the tree which spoke to me. Perhaps it was my inner self. But then again, perhaps it was a speaking hawthorn, and you have to be \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo to hear it!"},{"url":null,"title":"leader-of-councils-conservative-opposition-steps-down-after-health-issues","story":"  Councillor Brian Small, who has held the position since being one of seven Conservative councillors elected in May 2017, stood down for a brief period last year following a severe bout of sepsis before returning to the post.

Councillor Jane Henderson, a North Berwick Coastal ward member who sits on the licensing board, pointed out that the club\u0026rsquos failure to represent itself could prove financially costly as they were not able to challenge conditions attached to the licence.

The Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland  told East Lothian Council the plans to build next to medieval Dirleton Castle, which dates back to the mid 13th century, were too \u0026ldquomodern and suburban.  The association said the new development,\u0026nbspproposed at Castlemains Farm immediately to the east of the castle, would \u0026ldquoirreparably damage the setting of Dirleton, destroying the important edges that define the village and separate it from the surrounding countryside.  And at a meeting of the local authority\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington, councillors voted by seven to four to reject the plans, which had been recommended for approval by their own officers.  Local ward councillor Jane Henderson said that the intervention from APRS had been \u0026ldquocritical as she criticised Historic Environment Scotland, which is responsible for Dirleton Castle, after it\u0026nbspfailed to formally object to the proposals.  The public agency, who were consultees on the application, told the local authority that while they acknowledged the development might have an impact on the castle, which is a scheduled monument, they considered the proposals\u0026nbspnot to have an impact of \u0026ldquonational significance.  Councillor Henderson said: \"I am particularly disappointed in Historic Environment Scotland. How they can hold that name and come through so weakly on the setting of a castle, you have to ask questions about that.  However, the agency said it had already responded to a previous application for housing on the same site which had later been withdrawn.  They said: \u0026ldquoWe were consulted by East Lothian Council on the planning application for Castlemains Farm in January 2018, on the potential impact of this application on the setting of Dirleton Castle and Gardens which is a scheduled monument.  \u0026ldquoThis second planning application addressed the concerns that had been raised when the first planning application was submitted, primarily the impact of the development on the relationship between the castle and the land to the south and east. As a result, we did not object to the application.  \u0026ldquoWe did, however, highlight a risk of impact from landscaping and lighting, and have recommended further mitigation.  Developers Queensberry Properties told the committee they had held extensive consultations with council planners and the local community but they admitted they had come to an impasse with Dirleton Village Association and had to \u0026ldquoagree to disagree.  Their spokesman told the committee that while they wanted the new houses to face outwards on the edge of the village instead of presenting visitors with a view of \u0026ldquogarden sheds and trampolines, the village association wanted the houses to \u0026ldquoturn their back on the outside world.  Architect John Finlay, who helped produce the Dirleton Expects document outlining the village association\u0026rsquos vision for its future, said: \u0026ldquoThe design is as alien as if it had landed from outer space. It even has a suburban road, with all the clutter that entails, in the forefront of the castle.  Martin White from Gullane Area Community Council said the group was opposed to the development because \u0026ldquoyou do not hide castles.  He said: \u0026ldquoDirleton Castle is one of East Lothian\u0026rsquos top five visitor attractions. It may not be of national impact but it certainly matters in East Lothian.  The council received 71 written objections and only one representation supporting the development, which cited a need for affordable housing in the village.  Dirleton Castle is a medieval fortress which dates back to the mid-13th century and has been at the centre of numerous sieges. At one point it was owned by the Ruthvens, who were involved in several plots against Mary Queen of Scots and King James VI.  Councillor Stuart Currie, planning committee member, raised concerns that the development appeared to bear little resemblance to the original development brief for the site that the local authority had consulted on with the community.  However, planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire said the fact those opposing the development did not have the support of Historic Environment Scotland and the council\u0026rsquos own heritage officer led him to back the planning officials\u0026rsquo recommendation to approve it.

NIC chairman Sir John Armitt said the fact the cities occupy the first 25 spots demonstrates the need for major new investment in urban transport networks.  The organisation\u0026rsquos National Infrastructure Assessment recommends that more powers are devolved to metro mayors and local leaders to improve urban transport, backed by \u0026pound43 billion of funding to 2040 on top of current spending plans.

Many leave his restaurant \u0026ndash which is also a soft play area and crazy golf course \u0026ndash satisfied and some have proclaimed his cod and chips to be the best in the popular fishing village, which boasts at least three other chippies.  But the odd unhappy customer has left negative comments on TripAdvisor or Google, only to be receive a snippy response from Mr White who, for reasons he cannot explain, signs himself \u0026ldquoLionel Blair or \u0026ldquoMontgomery Applegate.  These responses have won fans online, with some visiting the chippie on the back of his humour.  When a customer reviewed The Bunker last month and found the product was too greasy with no gluten-free option, Mr White responded with sarcasm: \u0026ldquoYour comments are duly noted sir and from now on we shall be frying our fish and chips in daffodil extract.  \u0026ldquoOnce cooked, the fish will spend 5 minutes in a tumble drier, while at the same time, staff member X will be blow drying the chips, with one of those Dyson hair dryers, you know the one that doesn\u0026rsquot even look like a hair dryer?, until there is no sign of grease whatsoever.  \u0026ldquoThen, and only then, will the plate of Atlantic cod and Northumbrian chipped potatoes be presented to our customers.  A biker\u0026rsquos online review complained about paying \u0026pound4 for chips and mushy peas, and said their group of 10 would not be returning.

In comparison, the overall waiting list for all organs has declined over the same period by 17% \u0026ndash down from 7,335 to 6,013.  NHS Blood and Transplant is calling on people to urgently talk to their families about organ donation this week \u0026ndash which is Organ Donation Week \u0026ndash because a lung transplant is the only long-term hope for everyone on the waiting list.          Organ Donation Week starts today!

Today\u0026rsquos organs donors are mostly over the age of 50 and more likely to have existing health problems. This can make the successful donation and transplantation of more delicate organs such as the heart and lungs less likely.  Another factor is thought to be an increased awareness of the benefits of lung transplants, leading to an increased number of referrals.  But it said family refusal remains the biggest barrier to all forms of organ donation and transplantation.  Although more people are supporting donation than ever, one in three families still decline to donate.  Laura Beattie, 29, from Stretford in Greater Manchester, has cystic fibrosis and was added to the transplant waiting list just over a month ago. Her lung function has declined in the last couple of years and is now at around 24%.  The Manchester United fan now uses oxygen in daily life and also a wheelchair at times when she goes out for more than a few hours. She also requires non-invasive ventilation \u0026ndash airway support administered through a nasal mask \u0026ndash overnight.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove known for more than 20 years that I would need a transplant one day but I was still terrified to be told I was going on the list because it made it real, Ms Beattie said.  \u0026ldquoBut I know it\u0026rsquos the right thing to do. I get breathless even turning over in bed or getting dressed.  \u0026ldquoI could be waiting a short time or a long time, I don\u0026rsquot know. I just try and get on with my life.  \u0026ldquoI really hope more people support and really consider donation because a transplant is my only option now and donation can save so many lives.  Around 17% of people listed for a lung transplant have died a year later.  John Forsythe, NHS Blood and Transplant associate medical director for organ donation and transplantation, said: \u0026ldquoLast year, 65 people died on the lung transplant waiting list and many of those lives could have been saved or transformed had more families said yes to donation.  \u0026ldquoTelling your family what you want also makes things easier at a difficult time.  \u0026ldquoSadly, many donation opportunities are lost every year because families don\u0026rsquot know if their loved one wanted to be a donor or not.

Instead of glorious failure, events conspired to send Shelley Kerr and her players to next summer\u0026rsquos World Cup in France.  The final whistle, and the players\u0026rsquo unbridled joy on learning that Switzerland had simultaneously failed to win in Poland, confirmed Kerr\u0026rsquos long-held belief that it would be the top seeds who faltered at the last hurdle.  The win over Albania at the Lori Borici Stadium was somewhat laboured, but neither the head coach Shelley Kerr nor her players were concerned about that after the team\u0026rsquos historic achievement.  The two results left Scotland on top of Group 2 for the only time since the qualifying campaign began last September. They can now look forward to next summer\u0026rsquos finals in France while the Swiss contemplate the four nation play-offs.  \u0026ldquoYou could see our energy was zapped tonight after the win over Switzerland on Thursday night and the pitch here wasn\u0026rsquot great, Kerr said. \u0026ldquoBut that\u0026rsquos why I knew it would be the same for the Swiss against Poland.  \u0026ldquoThe team are going to celebrate for sure because they deserve it \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos not every day you get to a World Cup, is it?

I\u0026rsquove just told the players to try and win the games and they\u0026rsquove done it magnificently.  Top scorer Jane Ross, who was left out of the starting line-up for the previous two games, returned, while Manchester United\u0026rsquos Lizzie Arnot was also given her first start since returning from an ACL injury in April.  Christie Murray and Claire Emslie dropped down to the bench.  With the home side expected to get as many bodies as possible behind the ball, Scotland\u0026rsquos game plan was to stretch them on both flanks and it didn\u0026rsquot take long to pay off. After nine minutes of probing, Lisa Evans got clear on the left and sent over a cross to the far post which Arnot sent back into the paths of Kim Little and Erin Cuthbert. The Arsenal captain claimed it and crashed a volley past Viona Rexhepi.  It looked to be a non-contest as the Scots created chance after chance but they lacked the sharpness to take advantage. Rexhapi was also doing her part and made a terrific double save from Cuthbert and Ross six minutes after the goal.  The pattern continued until the half hour when the Albanians started to find some confidence. They found an equaliser just before half time, and just minutes after Rexhepi had made an even better save from Emma Mitchell \u0026ndash Megi Doci sending a low shot past Lee Alexander, who had been redundant for most of the 45 minutes.  Left-back Mitchell came even closer with a shot which hit the post and Cuthbert drew out another fine save from Rexhepi, but it was starting to look fraught midway through the second half when the much-needed goal finally arrived.  Caroline Weir took a free kick which her Manchester City team-mate headed back into the path of Ross and the striker scored her 57th, and most important, Scotland goal.  After that there was no way back for Albania, who spent most of the remaining time pinned back in their own half.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In lengthy posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be, if not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to return to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But if this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But if Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":null,"title":"cbi-rejects-sturgeons-plan-to-devolve-immigration","story":"  CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn said the time was \u0026ldquonot right, and firms wanted an integrated system for the whole of the UK, not a regional one.  Ms Fairbairn delivered the message ahead of the CBI Annual Dinner in Glasgow on Thursday, which the First Minister is also due to attend as a top table guest.  However Ms Fairbairn did agree with Ms Sturgeon on a No Deal Brexit being a \u0026ldquocatastrophe, and urged businesses leaders to take a stand against it.  She said it would be so damaging it should be \u0026ldquosimply not an option.  However Theresa May and her ministers insist it remains on the table if the Chequers proposal for a soft Brexit is rejected out-of-hand by the other 27 EU nations.  Ms Fairbairn said the CBI, which speaks on behalf of 190,000 businesses employing nearly 7m people, would speak out clearly on the \u0026ldquothe catastrophic risks of a no-deal exit.  She is expected to say in her speech: \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos what it would be for Scotland. A catastrophe. \u0026ldquoDelays to just-in-time delivery meaning that Scotland\u0026rsquos food exports would not reach markets in peak condition. Barriers to talent stifling Scotland\u0026rsquos professional services firms.  \u0026ldquoScotland\u0026rsquos status as fintech power put at risk by new regulations on data. No-deal is just not an option. Not for the UK, not for Scotland, and not for the EU.  Ms Sturgeon has previously said if Scotland is taken out the EU single market and customs union by Brexit, immigration should be devolved to help cope with the impact on EU citizens and workforce shortfalls.  But on immigration, Ms Fairbairn said: \u0026ldquoScotland has a brilliant and talented workforce. But look at the stats, and it\u0026rsquos also a shrinking workforce. Demographics are not in Scotland\u0026rsquos favour.  \u0026ldquoAdd Brexit uncertainty and a brain-drain to the South East and overseas. And you have a potent mix of problems. The skills shortages are biting. Not in the future, not soon. Right now. So last month the CBI called for a new immigration system. A system that earns public trust while allowing business to attract the people they need.  \u0026ldquoA system that\u0026rsquos open but controlled, too. And we are clear it must work for Scotland.  \u0026ldquoSome have asked - do we need a devolved solution for Scotland? It\u0026rsquos a fair question.  \u0026ldquoBut the businesses I\u0026rsquove spoken to say \u0026ldquonot right now. Let\u0026rsquos get it right for the whole UK.  \u0026ldquoThe better the outcome we get, the less need for iation across the UK.  And the less companies need worry about doubled up systems and extra red tape.  Scottish Secretary David Mundell, who will also be attending the dinner, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom absolutely clear there are no plans to devolve immigration.  \u0026ldquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot part of the Smith Commission [on more powers], and indeed polling in Scotland suggests the public don\u0026rsquot support the devolving of administration.  He said the UK government\u0026rsquos announcement today of a pilot scheme for 2500 extra visas for seasonal agricultural workers showed iation was possible within the UK.  Ms Sturgeon\u0026rsquos official spokesman said: \u0026ldquoWe are clear that there is a weight of evidence that Scotland should be in control of its own immigration policy.  \u0026ldquoWe have seen today a fairly timid move by the UK Government in terms of seasonal workers for the fruit picking sector.  \u0026ldquoI think 2,500 visas for people UK wide doesn\u0027t even begin to address the issue facing the UK as whole far less properly address the issues facing Scotland."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8557029.jpg?type=article-full","title":"aulds-left-with-eight-stores-as-they-shut-18-with-the-loss-of-105-jobs-in-liquidation","story":"  The announcement means the firm will be left with just eight after the chain put its retail business into liquidation last month due to \"unsustainable\" losses.

It also shows the numbers that say they are Roman Catholic has dipped slightly from 13%, 15 years ago to 12% last year.  But those who say they have no religion has shot up from 43% in 2003 to 56% in 2017.  Ian Montagu, senior researcher at the Scottish Centre for Social Research, said: \"This year\u0026rsquos figures reinforce a gradual picture of overall decline in religious identity in Scotland \u0026ndash a decline most keenly felt by the Kirk.\"  He said the four per cent of people aged 18-34 identifying with the Church of Scotland is \"particularly low\". In 2002 it was 14%.  Mr Montagu added: \u0026ldquoAs attitudes in Scotland become more socially liberal on issues like same sex relationships and abortion, church leaders will no doubt be considering how to better connect to a changing society.  \"It will be interesting to see what impact liberalising measures, such as the Church of Scotland\u0026rsquos efforts to allow ministers to conduct same-sex marriages, have upon these numbers in the future.  In June, the largest Protestant church in Northern Ireland voted to sever ties with the Church of Scotland due to what it felt was the Kirk\u0027s more liberal attitude to same-sex relationships.    The unprecedented move by the Presbyterian Church in Ireland means the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland will no longer be invited to the annual meeting of the church\u0027s General Assembly in Belfast. And the PCI will no longer accept invitations.  Survey data also reveals that in 2009, over one in three said they had attended a Church of Scotland at least once a month, but in 2017 it had dropped to one in four, according to the survey. Those who went to a Catholic church at least once a month dipped from 60% nine years ago to 52% last year.  A Catholic Church spokesman said \u0026ldquoWhile it is reassuring to see Catholic figures remaining relatively constant, the decline in other Christian churches is very concerning.  \"An analysis of numbers however should not ignore the significant social capital the Christian church contributes to Scottish society.\"  A Church of Scotland spokeswoman said there were ious surveys and reports on congregational numbers and religious affiliation and \"differing interpretations of their meaning\".  She added: Our view is that we endeavour to be a Christian presence in communities and a force for good and we will continue to focus on that.  \u0026ldquoJesus called every Christian to be faithful to God and to make a positive difference in the world.  \u0026ldquoThat is why throughout history you have found Christians fighting injustice and inequality, being a voice for the poor and standing up for those who otherwise were alone.  \u0026ldquoJesus called this being a light in the darkness.  \u0026ldquoThe Church of Scotland is there to celebrate with individuals and families in the happy times but also to provide support during the difficult and sad times.  \u0026ldquoIrrespective of the Church\u0026rsquos popularity, that calling remains the same and is why today you still find Christians active at all levels of society.  \u0026ldquoWhether we are many or we are few, the church will always seek to be a force for good in society.\"  The Church of Scotland backed a report in May which could lead to same-sex marriages in church.  The General Assembly backed a motion which tasked a committee with drafting church law on the issue.  Its legal questions committee was asked to report back to the annual meeting of the decision-making body in 2020.

Party sources have told The Herald that there is a growing expectation that the deputy leader Jo Swinson, 38, will take Sir Vince\u0026rsquos place within 12 months, barring a snap poll in the wake of Brexit.  Already talk of introducing a Canadian-style plan to open up the leadership to a non-MP appears to have rapidly quietened. One senior party figure branded the proposal \u0026ldquobonkers.  In the speech, at the National Liberal Club in London, Sir Vince will propose the supporters\u0026rsquo scheme to get what were described as \u0026ldquomoderate, liberal-minded voters involved in campaigns such as opposing Brexit.  He will explain that the proposal would mean the new class of supporters would pay nothing to sign up to the party\u0026rsquos values yet enjoy a range of entitlements, including the right to vote for the leadership and to shape the party\u0026rsquos campaigning online.  \u0026ldquoThe Liberal Democrats already have an army of voluntary helpers and deliverers, as well as 200,000 online supporters, who loosely identify with us and campaign with us but, currently, have no say in the direction of the party.  \u0026ldquoWhatever rights our new supporters gain, we as a party aim to be in constant conversation with them, engaging them in campaigns and urging them to begin campaigns of their own. I want these not to be just about stopping things but about growing support for the things that matter to Liberal Democrat voters and to the vast swathe of voters in the centre ground whom we are yet to persuade, Sir Vince is due to say.  He will note that groups like More United, 38 Degrees, Avaaz and Change.org have shown how such regular conversations can happen and help engage hundreds of thousands of people online.  \u0026ldquoI want our party to do that and to offer our movement a political arm within Parliament. So it is not just a protest group banging at the door but a movement with a voice on the inside our parliamentary party.  The party leader will add: \u0026ldquoThe Liberal Democrats are not a socialist party concerned with extreme-left entryism or a right-wing party trying to keep out extreme right-wingers.

But would Press pass muster with those in the trade? More importantly, would it interest those viewers who left papers for the internet years ago? The short answers are no, not really, and maybe, if Bartlett turns the gas up on the drama and eases off on the pondering.  Press is about as true to real newspapers as the sex and revenge drama Doctor Foster was to the life of an average GP.  Among the Acorn Antiques-level bloopers were journalists who typed like YouTube cats, slapping away on their keyboards, unnaturally tidy kitchens, and staffing levels last seen in 1952. At one point an exasperated hack told a contact: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom one of only three investigative reporters left at my paper.  That noise battering the window was a nation\u0026rsquos journalists guffawing as one. Three investigative reporters? Lucky you. Most glaringly of all, there was hardly any ******* swearing.  Bartlett didn\u0026rsquot show much imagination in the stories covered, which were the usual rag bag of Cabinet minister being caught out doing things they should not, MI5 skullduggery, etc, and he reached for the broad brush when it came to the characters: the cocky tabloid editor, the maverick reporter.  The show was saved by the quality of the cast, and the trail of appetising breadcrumbs Bartlett left behind after the first of six episodes. Ben Chaplin, last seen being a very naughty boy in Apple Tree Yard, is terrifically watchable as ego-on-legs editor Duncan Allen, while Charlotte Riley  convinces as the dour deputy news editor who looks like she\u0026rsquos carrying the weight of the world in her backpack.  The possibility of these opposites attracting is promising. Paapa Essiedu is worth keeping an eye on as the office new start who is not too sure if he is in the right business. Then there is the not inconsiderable matter of Duncan\u0026rsquos tangled private life, which included a tall blonde turning up at his door in the middle of the night who did not look like she was there to deliver pizza or give his kitchen the once over with the Mr Muscle. Which, of course, would never happen. The turning up, that is, not the cleaning.  But drama requires a little oomph the way papers need stories, and if the formula worked for Bartlett in Doctor Foster it could do the same here.  Bring on the first blood on the walls dinner party.  After the BBC\u0026rsquos majestic Planet Earth and the Blue Planet, here is your guide to some of the inhabitants of Planet Press and their real-life counterparts in today\u0026rsquos newspaper jungle.  EDITOR  Fiction: Editor of The Herald is the cool, cerebral Amina Chaudhury , while the Post is helmed by lad-about-town Duncan Allen .  Fact: Editors are the silver-backed gorillas of newspapers, much given to beating chests and swinging through newsrooms looking for someone to pummel. There is rarely a female of the species. Will not work for peanuts but expect staff to do so. Often get together with other silverbacks to compare circulation size.  PROPRIETOR  Fiction: The mysterious George Emmerson, given to having quiet chats with editors in the back of his limo, is played by David Suchet of Hercule Poirot fame.  Fact: The real kings of the jungle and the powers behind any newspaper throne. Over the years their ranks have included more than a few rogues who made Charles Foster Kane look like Charles Hawtrey. Today, newspapers are more likely to be owned by a multinational firm with shareholders rather than a sole proprietor. Far less fun, but safer for pensions.  NEWS PUP  Fiction: Going on his first \u0026ldquodeath knock, calling at the door of the recently bereaved, is boy reporter Ed Washburn .  Fact: As in fiction, newcomers to the trade should be possessed of the requisite mix of charm and rat-like cunning. In reality, if working on a London paper, Ed would be an ex-public schoolboy whose uncle, the business editor, owns half of Wiltshire.  INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER  Fiction: Clark Kent lookalike Al Weaver is James Edwards, investigative reporter.  Fact: A rare and fast disappearing breed. Eccentric sorts who grew up with posters of All The President\u0026rsquos Men on their bedroom walls instead of Kylie in gold shorts, they are the true romantics of the profession, the keepers of the flame, and the only hope for humanity. More importantly, they have the filthiest gossip.  NEWS EDITOR  Fiction: The Post\u0026rsquos news ed is played by Shane Zaza and The Herald\u0026rsquos by Charlotte Riley.  Fact: News editors are the meerkats of the trade, much given to popping up from their desk every five seconds to find a reporter they can dragoon into carrying out the editor\u0026rsquos latest insane idea. Highly excitable. On no account feed after midnight or get wet. See Gremlins for handling instructions. Riley also typifies the kind of hard-working woman in newspapers who is twice as good as the men but paid half as much. Not that she is bitter about it. Goes to boxercise in evenings.  EDITOR\u0026rsquoS SECRETARY  Fiction: So far in Press, viewers have only met Lucy , the long-suffering PA to Duncan Allen.  Fact: Outside of the proprietor, the editor\u0026rsquos secretary is the most powerful person in any newspaper and a real tigress. She, and it is always a she, knows where all the bodies are buried. More importantly, she is usually the only grown-up in the building, spending her days dabbing skint knees with Germolene, drying tears before bedtime and sorting toilet accidents.  COMING SOON  The quietly heroic, working all hours production editor who last saw their family six years ago the features editor, usually female but sometimes the odd metrosexual chap sneaks in, which comes in handy when there is mansplaining to be done and the sports editor, possessor of a mind for stats and a six-pack like Winnie  The Pooh."},{"url":null,"title":"tony-blair-says-moderate-labour-may-have-lost-party-to-jeremy-corbyns-left-for-good","story":"  The former prime minister said Labour under Jeremy Corbyn is now a \"different party\" and he hopes it is not \"lost\".  His comments come after another leading figure of the Blair era, Lord Blunkett, warned that the party is facing \"irrelevance\" unless there is a rethink of the \"Corbyn project\".  Mr Blair told the BBC: \"I\u0027ve been a member of the Labour Party for over 40 years. You do feel a strong loyalty and attachment, but at the same time it\u0027s a different party. The question is, can it be taken back?\"  \"This is a different type of Labour Party. Can it be taken back? I don\u0027t know.\"  The former PM\u0027s comments come after Labour activists in Enfield North passed a vote of no confidence in Joan Ryan, a minister in the Blair administration who now chairs Labour Friends of Israel.  Ms Ryan, a vocal critic of Mr Corbyn\u0027s handling of anti-Semitism, blamed the 94-92 defeat on \"Trots, Stalinists, Communists and assorted hard left\".  Writing on Twitter following the vote, she said: \"So lost 92 to 94 votes hardly decisive victory and it never occurred to me that Trots Stalinists Communists and assorted hard left would gave confidence in me. I have none in them.  \"I will be out tomorrow morning working hard for the people of Enfield. Just to be clear I will not be resigning. I am Labour through and through and I will continue to stand up and fight for Labour values.\"  Another former minister in Mr Blair\u0027s government, Frank Field, resigned the party whip after losing a vote of no confidence in his constituency, blaming the anti-Semitism row and allegations of bullying among members.  Another Corbyn critic, Luton South MP Gavin Shuker, also lost a no confidence vote of local activists on Thursday evening.  In a message to constituents, he said: \"It\u0027s not part of any formal procedure, so it changes nothing about my role as Labour MP for Luton South.  \"I\u0027m really sorry a handful of people in the Labour Party want to overturn your vote of confidence in me last year. Their actions say far less about me - and you - than they do about the face of today\u0027s Labour Party.  \"I\u0027ve not changed, but the Labour Party has.\"  Mr Blair said: \"There\u0027s lots of people associated with me who feel that the Labour Party\u0027s lost, that the game\u0027s over. I\u0027m kind of hoping they\u0027re not right.\"  The former PM said the row over anti-Semitism that has engulfed the party is \"ghastly\" and a \"matter of great sadness\".  He said he could not have imagined the row taking place in the way it did \"in the Labour Party I joined, all the way through to this moment\".  \"I can\u0027t imagine that we have had three to four months debating over something where we have profoundly insulted the Jewish community in our country,\" he said.  A Labour Party spokesman said: \"Labour is giving a voice and hope to communities that have been held back and ignored for years.  \"Our policies to end austerity and bring water, energy and rail into public ownership are popular and reflect the mainstream of public opinion.  \"At last year\u0027s election, when all the pundits and critics had written us off, Labour had our biggest increase in vote share since 1945 and deprived Theresa May\u0027s Tories of their majority.\"  Lord Blunkett - a Labour MP for 28 years and a minister for most of Mr Blair\u0027s administration - said he was not sure if he would back the party even if he knew his vote would make the difference between Mr Corbyn becoming prime minister or not.  Asked what he would do in these circumstances, the Labour peer told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: \"It would entirely depend on whether my good friends in the Parliamentary Labour Party and the Commons hadn\u0027t been deselected and were there to ensure that the sane, rational policies of a Labour Party for the future were going to be implemented.\""},{"url":null,"title":"snp-mp-defies-westminster-leader-over-kremlin-tv","story":"  Angus Brendan MacNeil, a member of Westminster\u0026rsquos joint committee on national security strategy, also appeared to question if Russia was behind the Novichok attack in Salisbury.  Theresa May told MPs on Wednesday that two members of the Russian military intelligence service, the GRU, used the rare nerve agent to poison Sergei and Julia Skripal in March.  The new evidence led to calls for Mr Salmond to end his weekly show on RT, which is forced to register in the United States as an arm of the Putin regime.  SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said this week that RT was a \u0026ldquovehicle of the Russian state and advised people not to lend it credibility by appearing on it.  He said: \"I certainly wouldn\u0027t encourage people to be seen on RT. I\u0027ve made it clear that I don\u0027t believe that people should broadcast on RT.  \u0026ldquoI think RT is a vehicle of the Russian state. People need to know exactly what the Russian state are doing, and by extension, RT are part of that.\"  Mr MacNeil, who has appeared on RT several times, including on Mr Salmond\u0026rsquos show, made it clear he would not be heeding his group leader\u0026rsquos warning.  Asked if he was reconsidering his appearances on RT, he told BBC Radio Scotland: \u0026ldquoNo. I think I\u0026rsquoll talk to any media. Many people have issues with the BBC. I\u0026rsquom talking to the BBC just now. And I\u0026rsquoll talk to any media at all if it\u0026rsquos possible.  He was asked if he would appear even if there was clear evidence RT was a tool of the Russian state, as Mr Blackford said, and Russian authorities had poisoned people in the UK.  He replied: \u0026ldquoWell, some people might have clear evidence of work by the secret services of many countries, perhaps even the UK.  \u0026ldquoI think it\u0026rsquos above my pay grade to go round and hold enquiries into every media channel.  Asked if he believed the UK government when it blamed Russia for the Salisbury attack, he merely said that \u0026ldquoif Russia was to blame, there were ways to push back against it.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe best way to counter anybody\u0026rsquos propaganda is to get on and put a different message, and perhaps a difficult message for them as well, and not let them carry on with the propaganda.  \u0026ldquoIf we only talk to our friends, all we will have is a single unitary voice that\u0026rsquos very much a very narrow segment of society, so I think we have to have broader voices.  \u0026ldquoIf that\u0026rsquos happening with Russia, get on to RT and say that\u0026rsquos happening, so that their propaganda - if that is the case - is easily put because you\u0026rsquove got a counter message on RT and not just the message the Russian government would like to hear on RT.  Mr MacNeil, 48, whose Western Isles constituency adjoins Mr Blackford\u0026rsquos Ross, Skye \u0026amp Lochaber seat, has been an MP since 2005, a decade longer than Mr Blackford.  It emerged this week that Mr Salmond\u0027s co-presenter on his RT show, Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh, is to leave the SNP\u0027s ruling body next month.  Ms Ahmed-Sheikh, a former MP who jointly owns the company that makes the show with Mr Salmond, had been women and equalities officer on the SNP\u0027s National Executive Committee for seven years."},{"url":null,"title":"social-value-portal-event-set-to-measure-the-impact-of-businesses-on-communities","story":"  With public finances under increasing pressure and many charities at full stretch the time is right for businesses to step up and do more to contribute to the public good, according to the organisers of The Social Value Gathering.

Guy Battle, chief executive of Social Value Portal says advances have been made, with laws in England and Scotland which encourage government to factor in social value when planning public spending.  \u0026ldquoWith the public sector struggling with the financial burden they are facing businesses really need to step up to the plate, he said. \u0026ldquoSocial value encourages businesses to get involved in delivering services in that space : whether it be community wellbeing, environmental benefit, community businesses or local spend. It encourages businesses to do more than just deliver the contract.  The event at Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Dynamic Earth on Friday September 21st will culminate in a social value marketplace where businesses and communities can come together to find matches between what companies can offer and what their communities need."},{"url":null,"title":"sketch-vince-cable-sets-out-his-vision-for-the-lib-dem-peoples-front-of-great-britain","story":"  The Pythonesque question occurred as Sir Vince Cable[SVC] turned up at the 19th century gentlemen\u0026rsquos club that is the oak-lined, portrait-heavy National Liberal Club in central London to use it as a backdrop to talk about, er, his 21st century vision for modernising those nice Liberal Democrats.  Perhaps somewhat incongruously, just before SVC turned up, there was a blast of a Beach Boys\u0026rsquo track \u0026ndash to remind everyone of their long-departed summer holiday - before we were entertained by the more sombre Vince the Movie.  When the Twinkletoes from Twickenham turned up late in the fine Charlie Kennedy tradition, all the best lines about his expected departure and his planned reforms had slipped out.  One \u0026ldquointeresting proposal, as a party grandee diplomatically described it, was opening up the leadership to non-MPs. Really.  Before he made reference to this, SVC made sure he pointed out to the gaggle of colleagues sitting in front of him that they were wonderfully talented human beings, any one of whom could become the next leader. Honest.  Yet, he insisted, the party had to exploit a wider pool of talent. Senior Lib Dems could be seen shuffling uncomfortably in their seats. Message received and understood.  So who could the next Lib Dem leader be? Michael Palin? Stephen Fry? Gary Lineker?, Brenda from Bristol? Corky the Cat?  Another proposed reform was having registered supporters, who could help online campaigning and vote in any future leadership contest \u0026ndash for free.  SVC, brushing aside fears of entryism, declared: \u0026ldquoWe cannot be afraid of opening windows lest a few flies get in.  Asked if he was worried those horrid Scottish Nats might seek to infiltrate the Lib Dems north of the border to push for independence, he referenced his remark about \u0026ldquonot letting the flies in and insisted there would be safeguards.  SVC spoke of creating a mass movement of like-minded liberals and touched on the idea of a new centre ground party.  But arguing it was easier to work with current party structures, he noted: \u0026ldquoThere is a danger in becoming like the scene in Monty Python\u0026rsquos Life of Brian where the Judean People\u0026rsquos Front refuses to work with the People\u0026rsquos Front of Judea for the most petty of reasons. But this is not a Monty Python sketch, it is the future of our country. Indeed.

Two of its 11 turbines are said to be the most powerful in the world, generating enough energy with a single rotation to power an average home for one day.  The wind farm, situated around 1.5 miles from the shore, is expected to produce enough electricity to meet the demand of almost 80,000 homes a year.  More than 100 business leaders and dignitaries joined Nicola Sturgeon and staff from Swedish-owned Vattenfall at an opening ceremony on board a NorthLink Ferries vessel on Friday.  Ms Sturgeon said: \"I am proud that as part of this groundbreaking project, the world\u0027s most powerful offshore wind turbines are now up and running in Scotland.  \"The European Offshore Wind Deployment Centre will maintain Scotland\u0027s reputation for innovation in low-carbon and renewable energy development and deployment.  \"A single rotation of one of these 8.8mw turbines will generate enough energy to power a home for 24 hours, which truly shows the potential of this technology to strengthen Scotland\u0027s renewable energy-generating capacity in the future.\"  The 11 turbines include two 8.8 megawatt  turbines standing 191 metres tall, which are the most powerful operating anywhere on the planet.  The project has a total capacity of 93.2mw, enough to meet the electricity needs of 70% of households in Aberdeen, industry association RenewableUK said.  The first of the turbine foundations was installed in the seabed in March, with the final turbine put in place at the end of May.  It was connected to the national grid after the laying of more than four miles of high voltage underground cable between Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks\u0027 substation in Dyce and the wind farm\u0027s onshore substation at Blackdog.  The project had faced delays, including a court challenge by Mr Trump, who claimed the turbines would ruin the view from his golf course at Balmedie.  Speaking to the crowd gathered for an inauguration ceremony on the deck of the ferry, Ms Sturgeon added: \"I think it\u0027s fair to say it\u0027s had its opponents along the way.  \"But I hope what we\u0027re seeing today - and I\u0027m going to use this word deliberately - the beauty of what we\u0027re seeing today, will in time be capable of persuading even the sternest critic of this fantastic centre.\"  Ms Sturgeon and Vattenfall president Magnus Hall together pressed a button following a countdown to declare the EOWDC open.  Mr Hall said: \"The innovation we have implemented at the EOWDC - and will continue to demonstrate - will turbocharge the growth of a global, low-cost offshore wind industry. And in doing so, do much to secure a fossil fuel free future for us all.\"  Claire Mack, chief executive of Scottish Renewables, said: \"This project is significant on a global stage. The developments and research which are taking place in Aberdeen place Scotland at the very forefront of offshore wind innovation and cement the city\u0027s reputation as an energy powerhouse.  \"The supply chains which have come together on projects like the European Offshore Wind Deployment Centre, and others including Beatrice and Moray East further north, are already revitalising coastal communities.  \"With 25% of Europe\u0027s offshore wind resource, the deployment of technology like these turbines - the most powerful in the world - presents an enormous opportunity for Scotland.\""},{"url":null,"title":"unspun-the-political-diary","story":"  NICOLA Sturgeon was keen to plug her latest economic wheeze in Tuesday\u0026rsquos programme for government.

Had the change been in place last month, it would have allowed the party to suspend Alex Salmond swiftly after it emerged he faced allegations of sexual misconduct related to 2013.  At the time, the SNP was under intense pressure to suspend the former First Minister, with last year\u0026rsquos suspension of former minister Mark McDonald cited as a precedent.  However Nicola Sturgeon said the SNP had \u0026ldquono legal basis to suspend Mr Salmond as the party had received no complaints about him and had therefore not investigated him.  But the new rules would allow for precautionary suspensions pending investigations.  The move flies in the face of recent criticism from Mr Salmond, who said when he resigned from the SNP that he had \u0026ldquoalways thought it a very poor idea to suspend any party member on the basis of complaints and allegations. Innocent until proven guilty is central to our concept of justice.  Mr Salmond denies criminality.  Under the existing constitution, the SNP National Secretary can only suspend members after concluding they have broken party rules.  But the new constitution says: \u0026ldquoThe National Secretary may suspend a member from exercising any or all rights of membership while investigations are being investigated and considered. In all cases where this action has been taken, the suspension will be regularly reviewed.  The proposed rules create a faster, more \u0026ldquoflexible punishment process.  At present, the party\u0026rsquos notoriously slow disciplinary process can only admonish, suspend or expel members.  In future, members could also have their party rights restricted, be forced to make \u0026ldquoappropriate restorative action, such as an apology, forced to \u0026ldquoundertake appropriate training, or be punished with \u0026ldquoany other proportionate sanction or requirement.  In his introduction to the proposals, National Secretary Angus MacLeod said they would see a \u0026ldquomodernising of our disciplinary processes with an enhanced approach on \u0026ldquobullying, harassment and social media use.  The proposed constitution also beefs up the SNP\u0026rsquos policy-making apparatus, which former deputy Jim Sillars and others have long complained is inadequate.  There would be a new Policy Development Convenor on the SNP\u0026rsquos ruling body, a Policy Development Committee, and members would be encouraged to \u0026ldquouse online forums for initiating policy discussions.

A new consultation proposes a number of changes to the licensing system to protect pets.  Plans include making it more flexible while also imposing tighter rules over how cats, dogs and rabbits are bred.  Ministers want to \u0026ldquocounteract the market incentive towards designer dogs and other pets which are deliberately bred to exaggerate certain features \u0026ndash such as short noses or long ears.  Such breeding \u0026ldquoheightens the risk of harmful genetic conditions and can seriously affect the future health and wellbeing of the animal, the consultation says.  It suggests prohibiting \u0026ldquoany breeding practices which are likely to cause the offspring suffering in later life as a condition of licensing.  Breeds particularly at risk of health problems include pugs, bloodhounds and bulldogs.  Rural affairs minister Mairi Gougeon said: \u0026ldquoThe high demand for particular breeds and \u0026ldquodesigner pets means irresponsible breeders use harmful practices, leading to genetic conditions which seriously affect the future health and wellbeing of these animals, as well as causing distress and veterinary treatment costs for owners.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government believes that irresponsible breeders should be more accountable for their actions, so we will be looking to deter these practices through new licensing conditions, whilst encouraging responsible breeders to continue to follow good breeding practices.  \u0026ldquoWe will also be raising public awareness of the problems that irresponsible breeding can create.  \u0026ldquoUltimately we want a modern licensing system in Scotland to improve conditions for these animals."},{"url":null,"title":"celtic-orders-independent-review-after-crush-before-old-firm-game","story":"  Five people needed medical treatment following the incident in Janefield Street at Parkhead before Sunday\u0026rsquos match against Rangers as fans tried to get into the stadium before kick-off.

The University of Glasgow graduate has been chosen as the recipient of a Breakthrough Prize four decades after the same discovery earned her male collaborator a Nobel Prize, but controversially left her uncredited.  Now Dame Jocelyn wants to use the award money to challenge \u0026ldquounconscious bias in science by funding a scholarship for female and minority students to become physics researchers.  She said: \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot want or need the money myself and it seemed to me that this was perhaps the best use I could put to.  \u0026ldquoThose are the people that tend to be discriminated against through unconscious bias, so I think that\u0026rsquos maybe one of the reasons why there aren\u0026rsquot so many. If they come with some funding with them, then they look much more attractive.  Born in Lurgan, Northern Ireland, Dame Jocelyn\u0026rsquos scientific career began in Glasgow in the 1960s.  She graduated with honours in physics from the University of Glasgow in 1965, before moving on to Cambridge where she made the ground-breaking discovery.  While poring over data from a new radio telescope she helped build, Dame Jocelyn spotted a faint and unusual signal: repeating pulses of radio waves.  She was able to characterise the signal and show it originated from space, eventually identifying it as a rapidly spinning neutron star.  Despite her achievement, Dame Jocelyn previously admitted to feeling like an imposter, revealing that she felt as if the university had \u0026ldquomade a mistake admitting her.  Edward Witten, chairman of the Breakthrough Prize\u0026rsquos selection committee, said: \u0026ldquoJocelyn Bell Burnell\u0026rsquos discovery of pulsars will always stand as one of the great surprises in the history of astronomy.  \u0026ldquoUntil that moment, no-one had any real idea how neutron stars could be observed, if indeed they existed.  Dame Jocelyn will be handed the Breakthrough Prize at a star-studded ceremony in the US in November, 50 years after the discovery. Previous winners include Stephen Hawking and seven scientists behind the discovery of the Higgs boson subatomic particle.  The award also recognises Dame Jocelyn\u0026rsquos scientific leadership. A role model and champion for young students, especially women in science, she has remained immersed in astronomy work, championing science, education and the Stem curriculum.  She was the first female president of the Institute of Physics and the Royal Society of Edinburgh and is currently a visiting professor of astrophysics at the University of Oxford.  This year Bell Burnell was named Chancellor of the University of Dundee after receiving an honourary degree from the institution in 2017. She was also the recipient of an honorary scientific doctorate from the University of Glasgow in the late 90s.  Professor Dame Julia Higgins, president of the Institute of Physics, said: \u0026ldquoThis is an excellent and hugely appropriate acknowledgement of Jocelyn\u0026rsquos work. Her discovery of pulsars still stands as one of the most significant discoveries in physics and inspires scientists the world over.  \u0026ldquoHer example of using insight and tenacity to make a discovery that rings through the ages stands her alongside the greatest of scientists.  \u0026ldquoAlongside her scientific achievement, Jocelyn has become a hugely respected leader in the scientific community. She has been instrumental in making sure the issue of access to science by people from under-represented groups is at the very top of the science community\u0026rsquos agenda.  While the Nobel Prize win left Bell Burnell uncredited for the achievement for most of her career, the scientist is not embittered.  She said: \u0026ldquoI feel I\u0026rsquove done very well out of not getting a Nobel Prize. If you get a Nobel Prize you have this fantastic week and then nobody gives you anything else.  \u0026ldquoIf you don\u0026rsquot get a Nobel Prize, you get everything that moves.

He was born with a kidney condition that meant neither of his organs worked properly.                                                                                                         He underwent surgery at 18 months old and then went for regular checkups to monitor how his kidneys were functioning.  At a routine appointment in October 2014, doctors delivered the news that his kidneys were failing and Nick started dialysis shortly after.He said: “I’d lived with the condition all my life so hearing that I’d need treatment was a shock. “The doctor told me I’d be lucky to make it to Christmas without being on dialysis but I held on until February 2015.                                                                                                        “By the time I went on dialysis, my kidney function had dropped to eight per cent. I thought I was okay but looking back I was constantly tired and agitated. Things were a bit of a struggle.”Nick was determined the dialysis would not take over his life and kept working throughout.He said: “I was team leader at that time for an oil company – in charge of the onshore group.“I was determined to keep on working and have as normal a life as possible but it meant doing dialysis every night after work.“I’d leave home at 7am and not get back until 10pm or 10.30pm every day                                                                                                         “Dialysis was hard. I felt like my life had been put on hold but I knew the treatment was the only thing keeping me alive. “Some days were better than others the staff at the hospital got me through some difficult times.”Despite that, Nick decided to propose to Philippa and booked the wedding at the Winter Gardens in the hope she would say yes.“I left flowers by the kettle one night – happily she said yes,” said Nick.“We’d been together for ten years and she saw me through everything.“She had to put up with an awful lot – the mood swings, not going out because I was too tired all the time – but she still said yes.”The couple got married last August and were on honeymoon when Nick got the call that would transform their lives.He said: “I was really lucky – I was only on the transplant list for two and a half years.“But I didn’t get my hopes up too much until I was taken down to theatre and knew it was going to happen.“I was building myself up for disappointment until that point. It was a really surreal experience.”Happily, the transplant went ahead and Nick woke up to a whole new life.“As soon as I woke up from surgery I instantly felt better,” he said. “Nothing could have prepared me for the difference it made.  “I’d just got married and then I got the gift that I’d waited over two years for.  “To have a life free from dialysis was the best feeling and I felt amazing. I didn’t realise how ill I’d been until I had the transplant and started to feel 100 times better. It was fantastic.”Nick, an electrician by trade, has made the most of his donor’s incredible gift – enjoying life to the full and setting up his own business.He said: “It was something I always wanted to do but would never have been able to achieve on dialysis.“I now have my own electrical business and am working all over Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire.“It’s made a massive difference to Philippa and me too – we can go out and enjoy ourselves now. It’s nice to have that freedom it’s a new life basically.”As for his donor’s family, Nick has written a letter thanking them for his gift.He said: “I know nothing about the person who made my transplant possible but I owe them everything. “They saved my life and are truly my hero. I want their family to know I will be eternally grateful for this incredible gift.”Nick is already on the organ donor register and hopes his story will encourage others to sign up.He added: “It’s quite possibly the most important thing anyone can ever do.”To join the NHS Organ Donor Register, visit weneedeverybody.org                "},{"url":null,"title":"payment phone line down for almost a month","story":"        A north-east MSP has appealed to the Rural Economy Secretary after it emerged a phone line to help farmers navigate government payments has been down for almost a month.

Aberdeenshire Council will carry out work to form a community park and install play equipment, after the initial developer of the site, Avant Homes, failed to install the facilities as required.                                                     The work had been a condition of the planning permission agreed for the site and late last year the council served planning enforcement notices to try to get the work moving.                                                     Other than preliminary works there has been no significant progress from the developer or landowner, so the council will begin work on site from Monday  to deliver the park and play area and seek to recoup the cost.         The lack of community facilities at Kingseat has been an ongoing concern for the local community and Councillors for a number of years.The enforcement notices were served in connection with two breaches of planning control, relating to the storage of spoil/materials and the lack of a play park. The focus is on a fenced-off central area of the site where there was previously a bowling green and open space area within the former hospital complex. This was intended to form part of the open space/facilities for residents within the completed development. Avant Homes had 12 weeks from October 20, 2017 to clear the spoil storage area and create a new open space area, including play equipment.                                                                                                         The notices were not appealed by the developer and the period for compliance expired on February 12.Since then the site has changed ownership to ZTR Investments and Aberdeenshire Council gave the new owners time to comply with the notices, while making alternative arrangements. Aberdeenshire Council’s Head of Planning, Robert Gray, said: “Although some preliminary clearing work was undertaken by the new owners there has been no significant progress in forming the park or installing the play equipment. As such the Council has appointed contractors to complete the works. “The site owners, Kingseat Community Association, Newmachar Community Council and immediate neighbours to the development area have been formally notified of the start date.                                                                                                        “This is the first element of an attempt to facilitate completion of the wider development at Kingseat and deliver some much-needed community facilities for the residents.”The work is expected to take up to 60 days to complete, depending on weather conditions.

A language that official bodies such as the UNESCO insist has been dead since the 1800\u0026rsquos.\u0026ldquoIt wouldn\u0026rsquot be the first time UNESCO has prematurely pronounced a language as dead. Back in 2009 UNESCO declared Manx extinct despite there being over 1500 speakers of Manx.\u0026ldquoUNESCO was forced to change its classification of Manx from \u0026ldquoExtinct to \u0026lsquoEndangered\u0026rsquo after a group of school children wrote to them in Manx asking what language they were writing in if Manx didn\u0026rsquot exist.\u0026ldquoThe more people I talked to the more I came to find that Norn isn\u0026rsquot dead, it has just become lost in our English. When I gave people examples they shrugged them off as \u0026lsquoCaithness Words\u0026rsquo but it is so much more than that it is \u0026lsquoCaithness language\u0026rsquo if only we put our minds and our hearts to it.With her Norn Min series workbooks Grace Hall is spreading the Norn language both within Caithness and outside of the region as well.She added: \u0026ldquoThe Norn Min series has three workbooks published and another two in the pipeline. Copies of the series have sold as far away as America and Sweden.\u0026ldquoIt was just after the publication of Norn Min buk two that I received an email from the University of Bari in Italy as their Minority Languages department was interested in Norn.\u0026ldquoThey asked if they could use the Norn Min series to create an Italian-Norn phrasebook.

Local resident and self-professed \u0026ldquoTrinkie lover Bryan Newlands welcomed the group\u0026rsquos formation, underlining that the pool harboured a lot of memories. \u0026ldquoI used to go there a lot... Even though I lived on the other side of town, every summer myself and a friend would go \u0026ndash even when it was raining, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was a great place as the town didn\u0026rsquot have an indoor swimming pool until 1994. Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to life and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that divides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because if nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Saturday 8 Sep 2018 2:43 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117364.jpg","title":"New service gives job hunters a Fair Start","story":"\u0026nbspScottish Government ViewpointFAIR Start Scotland is the country\u0027s new devolved employment support service.It is focused on supporting unemployed people who have challenges in accessing the labour market for whom work is a realistic prospect.Launched in April, earlier this year, it is an example of one of the first uses of newly devolved powers under the 2016 Scotland Act.The service will run until 2023 and aims to provide tailored, flexible and person-centred support to at least 38,000 people across Scotland who want help to find work, and stay in work.Fair Start Scotland is distinctive in that participation is purely voluntary.This means that people have everything to gain and nothing to lose \u0026ndash choosing to participate will not affect existing benefits or be driven by fear of benefit sanctions.The service is delivered locally, meaning that no participants are left without the support they need.Delivery is over nine geographic areas including the Highlands and reflects local area economies, meeting the needs of employers, disabled people and those at risk of long-term unemployment.Jamie Hepburn, Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, said: \"What\u0027s crucial about Fair Start Scotland is that it treats people with fairness, dignity and respect and that it is focused on the needs of the individual.\"We are dedicated to delivering a high quality employment support service that will lead to real and sustained job outcomes and help people to achieve their full potential.\"As well as meeting the needs of unemployed people, Fair Start Scotland also seeks to help businesses find the skilled and committed employees they need to thrive.\"One of the many now benefitting is Highlander Alan Cairns .He has not worked for over a year and his biggest barriers to work have been low confidence and computer skills but now he has secured 16 hours of work per week.Alan started on the Fair Start Scotland service in the middle of May and has been attending the service for the past 12 weeks.

Like that earlier work, The Katanes Saga is told in an unpretentious, engaging, sometimes blokey style. From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash if it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him returning to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Asleifarson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being knifed in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Saturday 8 Sep 2018 2:43 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of life make life-changing decisions that create a difference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people.

He was a third-year medical student who played rugby with the cycling trio and was also a talented musician. He had also been suffering from depression.The idea of cycling from John O\u0026rsquoGroats to Land\u0026rsquos End came to the trio after they had learned that Marcus had previously done the lengthy cycle, not once but twice.Fenn, a final-year maths student from Sheffield, said that Marcus\u0026rsquos sudden death was a huge shock to us all at the rugby club,and for everyone that knew him.\u0026ldquoHearing the news that he had been suffering from depression was a surprise to all his friends and family, he said.\u0026ldquoIn light of this, Marcus\u0026rsquos family have set up a fund in his name \u0026ndash Marcus in Mind \u0026ndash to raise awareness and prevent this sort of tragedy happening to more young men.Giles, a marine and offshore engineering student from Bridgnorth, Shropshire, added: \u0026ldquoThe three of us felt compelled to do something to help raise awareness of depression and mental health.\u0026ldquoAfter learning at his funeral that Marcus had completed this very cycle ride twice, we knew it would be an appropriate challenge.\u0026ldquoWe are using the social media hashtag #ItsOkNotToBeOk and we\u0026rsquore hoping to remove some of the stigma and get blokes like us opening up about mental health.Given Marcus\u0026rsquos and the trio\u0026rsquos links with rugby, clubs around the UK have been aware of the mental health awareness drive that they\u0026rsquore undertaking,Alex, a marine engineering student from Porthlevan, Cornwall, said: \u0026ldquoWe have been in touch with rugby clubs up and down the country. Our aim is to spread our message far and wide and hope others may cycle with us.\u0026ldquoWhen we discovered depression leading to suicide was the cause of Marcus\u0026rsquos death, we couldn\u0026rsquot believe it.

Brian, who was awarded a British Empire Medal in June this year in recognition of his services to military history in Orkney said: “Many people have dedicated time and energy to gathering photos over a period of 20 years or more and would like to see the collection completed as far as possible for the centenary of the Armistice on 11 November this year.“Having a nearly complete set of images of all the Orcadians lost would be a most poignant way for our community to mark this anniversary and a wonderful resource for future generations.”It’s believed 578 Orcadians died serving in the Great War and the Legion’s collection, available to view on their website, contains photos of just over half — 297 — of those lost.The council’s call comes as part of Orkney’s First World War commemoration programme, which is being coordinated by the council with invaluable contributions and support from local organisations community groups and individuals.As part of a series of events, on November 11, Orkney will participate in a national commemorative event that involves as many photos of local lives lost in the war as can be found and the participation of their families, a further reason for trying to complete the collection.Lucy Gibbon from the council’s Library and Archive service said there may well be much sought-after photos in people’s attics and family memorabilia collections: “Whilst very few people had a camera during the Great War, nearly all towns had photo studios. Most servicemen visited one of these while training in the UK.”“If you know you lost an Orcadian relative in the war, now is a great time to find out more about them. The Orkney Library \u0026amp Archive might have some items to help shed light on their story.”The Legion’s photo archive has been made possible thanks to the generosity and hard work of many — for example around half of the photos have been sourced from The Orcadian, which has published photos sent in by families in a feature called Our Roll of Honour during the Great War.Other notable contributors and donators over the years include Tom Gibson of Rousay, Beatrice Thomson of North Ronaldsay, Mabel Eunson of Deerness and the late Margaret Watters of Stenness, Bill Miller of Stronsay, Phyllis Gee of Flotta, and George Esson who spent two decades visiting families in South Ronaldsay and Burray seeking photos of loved ones lost in the war, and with the help of and David Mackie and Colin Rendall made copies for the Orkney Library and Archive.These and many more contributors are noted on the project’s website — where people can also view images in the collection by Parish and by significant battles.Anyone with photos they believe are not already included in the Legion’s collection is urged to contact Brian Budge on phone 01856 872225 and email brian.budge@btinternet or to drop into the Orkney Library and Archive in Kirkwall.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

With these beach cleans we’re taking that commitment one step further, helping sweep our shorelines for litter and collate vital local data that will be fed back to the Marine Conservation Society.”“The results from previous years’ Great British Beach Cleans are thought to have been instrumental in bringing about environmental legislation such as the plastic bag charge and banning of microplastics in personal care products, so the more local faces that join in, the bigger the potential difference we can all make.”The Great British Beach Clean is organised by the Marine Conservation Society  and takes place annually in September.Scottish Sea Farms are looking for volunteers to take part in their effort.They have asked anyone planning to join in to should register, via https:www.mcsuk.org/beachwatch/events/gbbc, and should wear appropriate clothing with pickers, gloves and bags to be provided.The meeting point of the Echna Loch Bay event, will be at lay-by on the road next to the bay, down the hill from the fossil centre, and the meeting point for the Weyland Bay event will be at the lay-by opposite the sewage treatment works on Carness Road.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

the heart of a Wester Ross community for hundreds of years and saved from an uncertain fate by a determined local campaign has inspired a pair of pals to employ pedal power for a challenge far away from its tranquil setting.Celia Charity and Sara Callaghan, friends and neighbours near Clachan at Lochbroom, will saddle up for a sponsored cycle linking Glasgow and Edinburgh at the weekend \u0026ndash inspired by the antics of another plucky 94-year-old local who hit the headlines with his own fundraising effort at an one of Scotland\u0026rsquos most iconic crossings.Celia and Sara, who both have grown-up families, decided to take on the 45-mile challenge a Cycle Scotland event starting out from Glasgow Green after the effort of another Burma war veteran Donnie Mackenzie who hauled in more than \u0026pound2500 for the church with a walk across the Forth Road Bridge.Clachan Church, believed to have been a site of worship for around 1000 years, has witnessed some of the defining moments of history and been at the centre of many key local events down the centuries. When the kirk on the shores of Lochbroom was put up for sale by the Church of Scotland back in 2016, it\u0026rsquos future looked uncertain.A determined local fundraising drive saw it eventually taken into community ownership by locals who see it as a key hub in the beautiful, remote area.Celia said: \"We saw how well Donnie Mackenzie\u0026rsquos fundraiser for Clachan did and the huge boost it gave everyone involved. Sara and I thought we would enjoy getting fitter, seeing more of our country, and help Clachan at the same time. Since our local Trust became owners on June 22 we straightaway saw the difference it has made to our community. It has become a community focus right from the start.\"With the doors open more often we know there\u0026rsquos someone there and stop for a chat. For those of us living on the no-through road on the west shore of Loch Broom, we pass Clachan every time we go anywhere so it is ideal.\"\"When Clachan opened during the Lochbroom Sheepdog Trials, the trust displayed some local produce, from handloom weaving, cards, honey, handmade books and paintings, to show the range of economic activity in Lochbroom. That is the tip of the iceberg. There\u0026rsquos only a small population but there\u0026rsquos a huge number of people producing high-quality goods \u0026ndash having their work displayed in a public building helps everybody.\"Sara and I are confident that Clachan will be an asset to the Lochbroom community for many years to come so we are asking for sponsorship. This can be done at the New Broom hub in Ullapool and by emailing me at celiajcharity@me. Thank you.\"Kenneth Macleod, an interim trustee of Clachan Lochbroom Heritage Trust, said: \"I have seen the benefit that grows from rescuing a building, improving it and making it available for wider purposes. Of course Clachan continues for the usual church occasions \u0026ndash we want everyone to know that! \u0026ndash whilst extending its usefulness for other appropriate purposes.\"Saturday 8 Sep 2018 2:44 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

We\u0026rsquoll ensure an open competition for all bidders whether public or private sector organisations.\u0026ldquoWe expect the current franchise to end in 2025. The tendering process will begin two years before that.

He can now use Microsoft Outlook and completed his new CV on Microsoft Word and been applying online for jobs.Alan said: \"I\u0027ve attended workshops on confidence building, and digital skills.\"My confidence is improving a lot and so is my computer skills, I have been job searching online and sending emails, I couldn\u0027t do this before.\"* To find out more and check eligibility for the service visit www.mygov.scot/fairstartSaturday 8 Sep 2018 2:44 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

That echoes public concerns which prompted a rethink from Highland Council four years ago.Tarbat Community Council is amongst the latest groups backing Craighill, stating that the TRA site \u0026ldquoshould not feature even as a second choice. It has outlined concerns over the lack of space for future expansion, inadequate room to play and the prospect of \u0026ldquotall and ugly buildings more appropriate to terminals at a second-rate airport.It says that \u0026ldquohuge cost advantages could come from using modular building techniques.The new campus will replace Tain Royal Academy, Craighill Primary, Knockbreck and the St Duthus special school. Parent councils have consistently appealed for improved facilities with the existing Craighill building the lowest scoring in the Highlands for educational suitability and condition.Wendy Hennem, of Tain Royal Academy Parent Council, noted that the Craighill site appeared to be the preferred public choice and that the resounding response from young people is: \u0026ldquoJust get it done.Tain and Easter Ross ward councillor Fiona Robertson told the Journal: \u0026ldquoAs we haven\u0026rsquot reached the deadline yet, I am not privy to the results of the consultation. However, I believe from my work with the stakeholder group and from being amongst the communities, that the Craighill site may be the most popular option. This has always been my preferred option as I believe it is much more suitable for a development of the size of a three to 18 campus.\u0026ldquoWhatever the results, it is important that the community works with Highland Council in order to deliver much-needed new schools for Tain. The extremely poor conditions of our primary and secondary schools in Tain is well known and acknowledged by Highland Council, therefore we all need to work hard to prepare an agreed plan in order to be in a position to apply for government funding later in the year.\u0026ldquoI believe the majority of people in Tain and Easter Ross just want to ensure we get fit for purpose schools in Tain to ensure the best possible educational facilities for our children\u0026rsquos futures.Fellow ward councillor Derek Loudon said: \u0026ldquoStudies by the community council, the Highland Council and the Ross-shire Journal have shown a clear preference for Craighill. There is little public support for the TRA site as all three consultations have shown. I hope we can move on now to get a layout on the Craighill site which is along the lines of the study done by Lachie Stewart [chairman of Tain and Easter Ross Civic Trust] and the community council which takes advantage of the space available to deliver great new buildings for primary, secondary, St Duthus, Gaelic and sports and leisure.\u0026ldquoI believe significant savings on cost, quality and time can be made with new construction techniques which are proven and have worked elsewhere. Let\u0026rsquos work with the Scottish Government and the Scottish Future\u0026rsquos Trust to deliver a great result for the people of Easter Ross.The consultation can be accessed at https:www.highland.gov.uk/downloads/file/19305/proposal_paper_tain_final_240518What do you think?

Mother-of-two Aimee Louise Evans, from Port Talbot, was found dead at her home address in Dalton Road on Saturday, 7 April.             The inquest heard that when police arrived at the property they found the 28-year-old hanged in a bedroom.            PC Clive Morris, of South Wales Police, told the inquest in Swansea that Evans’ three-year-old daughter was also in the house and was looking scruffy. Mr Morris said: “I became increasingly aware of the three-year-old’s well-being – the child had been there for three to four days and she was unkempt. “She was taken to hospital to be checked by a paediatrician.”READ MORE: Learning the lessons of suicidePC Morris said police believed the little girl survived by eating loaves of bread and some butter.             Evans’ son was staying with his natural father in the Bridgend area at the time. Evans had sent a text to her mum, Julie Evans, on Wednesday, April 4, asking her to collect her daughter because she was “ending it”, to which Julie Evans replied by saying “do not be daft” and asking her daughter what the matter was. That was the last time the two of them spoke, PC Morris added, with her mother repeatedly trying to make contact with her daughter over the following days, including visiting the property, but getting no reply. He said there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding Evans’ death, adding that she had no history of mental health problems. Her mother said Aimee was a happy, outgoing individual that showed no signs of depression.             She said her children were always well cared for and that they were always clean, tidy, and well looked after. PC Morris admitted it was “one of the hardest cases I have dealt with”. READ MORE: Comment: We can save more lives if we learn from suicideThe inquest heard she used to drink most evenings and had been subject to domestic violence in previous relationships. Senior coroner Colin Phillips said the post-mortem examination report found the cause of death to be hanging with the toxicology report showing a level of 137mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood.             A sample taken from the eye – which tends to be more accurate in showing the alcohol levels at the time of death – showed a level of 216mg of alcohol per 100ml, he added. The drink-drive limit in the UK is 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood. He recorded a conclusion of suicide.Speaking after the inquest Ms Evans’ friend, Stacey Ansell said: “Aimee is truly missed by many people. “If she knew how many people are heartbroken over her passing she would be overwhelmed. “It deeply saddens me that she felt she couldn’t reach out to any of us.” Evans’ friend Charlene Coulter said: “Aimee was a fun-loving girl who had the biggest heart – she would go out of her way to help anyone and often wore her heart on her sleeve. “She always made time for her close friends and loved nothing more than having a get together. “Aimee’s passing left a massive gap in our lives – she had so much to live for. “I really wish she would have picked up the phone and confided in one of her friends as we would have been there in a second. “Aimee will never be forgotten by any of us – we love and miss her dearly.” If you need confidential support or want to talk, you can call the Samaritans on 116 123  for free around the clock 365 days a year.In Scotland, Breathing Space can be reached on 0800838587A version of this story originally appeared on our sister title The I"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4796669.1536329068!/image/image.jpg","title":"new smacking ban legislation for scotland everything you need to know","story":"                Here is all you need to know about the proposed law change             READ MORE: Smacking to be outlawed in Scotland as ban is backed            READ MORE: Poll: Should smacking be banned in Scotland?What is the current law?Under the Criminal Justice  Act 2003, Scottish law currently prohibits parents from shaking their child, striking their head and from using an \"implement\" during punishment. But defences of \"reasonable chastisement\" or \"justifiable assault\" can be used in court by parents who physically punish their children. Courts determine whether the punishment is \"reasonable\" or \"justifiable\" based on factors such as nature of the punishment inflicted, the circumstances, the physical and mental effect on the child and the child\u0027s age. Aim of the new legislationThe Children   Bill will prohibit the physical punishment of children by parents and others caring for or in charge of children. It will give children equal protection from assault by abolishing the existing defences that parents can use to justify the use of physical force to discipline a child. Those backing the bill say a wider aim of it is to redefine what is acceptable in terms of how to punish children and encourage other methods of parenting.             The legal effectA person charged with assault of a child will no longer have the defence - in either criminal or civil proceedings - that the use of force constituted  \"reasonable chastisement\" or \"justifiable assault.\" Who proposed the new legislation?Highlands and Islands Green MSP John Finnie formally lodged it today at Holyrood.              Next StepsThe bill has been openly backed by the Scottish Government. SNP MSPs will be told by party whips to back the bill and Labour has confirmed its MSPs will also back the measures, meaning the legislation is set to pass at Holyrood in the next year. Part of the bill itself will require Ministers to promote public awareness and understanding about the effect of the new legislation. This may, for example, involve a nationwide publicity campaign aimed at parents and carers, promoting a move towards non-physical methods of child punishment. Who is saying what about the new legislation?Mr Finnie said he was \"delighted\" to be bringing the bill forward today, adding: \"Children deserve the same legal protection from assault that adults enjoy, a position that children\u0026rsquos rights organisations and charities have long been arguing. Substantial academic research from around the world shows that physical punishment does not work and is shown to be counter-productive. My bill aims to support parents to make positive choices.\"He stressed it will not change the way that police and social work deal with assault against children and, rather, would establish the principle that assault can never be \"justifiable.\"               The new legislation has the backing of First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish Police Federation, Barnardo\u0026rsquos Scotland, the Church and Society Council of the Church of Scotland and the NSPCC. And a previous consultation on the bill received more than 650 responses and nearly 75% supported it. A spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives said the current legislation \"works well\" and is \"based on common sense,\" but their members will be given a free vote on the matter. The spokesman added: \"In law there is, quite rightly, a very clear difference between the definitions of violent assault and reasonable chastisement.\"The former is a criminal offence punishable through the courts, the latter is a matter for parents as they decide how to discipline their children.\"Each Scottish Conservative MSP is entitled to vote with their conscience on this issue.\"Other parts of the UKNo other parts of the UK have banned smacking, but proposals are currently going through the Welsh Assembly. A background paper published alongside the bill says the UK is one of only six EU countries to allow smacking. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland parents are allowed to use \u0026ldquoreasonable chastisement as long as they do not leave a mark, swelling, cut or bruise. Scotland would join the many other EU nations with full smacking bans, and the big question now is whether the other UK countries will follow suit.

As it meets again in Manchester for its sesquicentennial congress, it is a something of a paradox for the singular peak organisation of organised labour that it now again faces many of the very same challenges it faced 150 years ago.                Now, in short, work is often poorly paid, employment is increasingly insecure, for many there is not enough of it, and employers usually have the whip hand. This means there is the manifest need for union representation but not the corresponding power of unions to right these wrongs in the labour market and wider society.            Signified by the founding meeting being held in the city’s Mechanics’ Institute, when the TUC was established it was largely for union members who were skilled male workers – those that had trades. But not long after, unskilled workers joined unions which became affiliated to the TUC. And, after them, women workers and public sector workers then also joined the union fold in large numbers.            Such were the numbers in the union movement come the 1960s and 1970s that not only were the TUC’s general secretaries household names but prime ministers, Labour and Conservative, feared and respected them in equal measure. This was the era of “beer and sandwiches” where governments, unions and employers sat down together to discuss economic matters. In this era, the TUC was portrayed as a powerful, if slow and plodding, “old cart horse”.The entry of the Conservatives into Downing Street in May 1979 turned out to be a long and painful period for the TUC and its union affiliates. Membership fell by around a half and doors were closed in their faces by government and employers alike. So, the TUC has struggled to regain and maintain its influence. There was no great fillip during the period of Labour governments from 1997 to 2010. Unions were regarded as unwelcome relatives at a family party even though they sought3 to engage in partnership with employers and widen their bargaining agenda to include skills and training. Despite the age of austerity since the 2007-2008 financial crash and a new younger and woman leader since 2013, the TUC has struggled to play the role in aggregating and mobilising the patent discontent that exists amongst workers and their families as income inequality has continued to grow. Food banks have replaced alms houses while zero-hour contracts are like a modern form of day labouring. The TUC missed the opportunity to forge an alliance between the providers of public services – at least those who are public sector union members – with the users of those services.READ MORE: Brian Monteith: Venezuela offers brutal warning over Corbyn’s LabourThe problems that the TUC and unions today face are three-fold in terms of their renewal and revitalisation. First, unions are still wrongly portrayed by the media and many politicians as generators of conflict so there is hostility. Second, many workers do not know what a union stands for and does, so there is ignorance. And third, many workers think unions are now too weak to help them so there is a perception of powerlessness.There are obvious solutions to these issues in terms of education, media work and becoming more assertive. Each solution has implications for resources – with more resources, the TUC could do more on each of these fronts but currently it is restricted in what it can do.            There is one possible way it could help square the circle though. This is through specifically targeting recruitment of younger workers. In the late 1990s, the TUC led the way by getting its affiliates to spend more resources on recruitment, retention and organising. It set up an Academy to do so. Today, it is aiming to do something similar with younger workers but with less of a physical approach and more of a virtual one.READ MORE: Richard Leonard makes call for stronger workers’ rightsUnionisation rates for younger workers are pitifully low – at less than 10 per cent for 16 to 24-year-olds. Amongst older workers, density is the highest at 30 per cent for those 50 and over. This presents the TUC with an existential crisis – in a generation of two, unions could face literal extinction. The TUC is leading the campaign to convince its affiliates to talk to young workers in a medium and a language that is suited to younger workers, rather than the union themselves. So issues will also include rent, mental health, careers and the like and through the array of new social media platforms.            Targeting younger workers using new technology to communicate new issues is not just a case of “motherhood and apple pie”. Momentum within Labour has shown how purposeful activism can be ignited while Labour itself has demonstrated that having the correct message can lead to widespread connection.But alongside this, the TUC and its unions must also do something else. They must be able to show a hundred-fold more that the cases of successful strikes and other collective actions at McDonald’s, Deliveroo, TGI Friday and Uber – involving predominantly younger workers in low-paid, insecure jobs – are not aberrations. So they must win disputes and be seen to win them. Here, some very small unions  and some very large ones  have shown on occasion what can be achieved. If they can do that, the prospect of an upward virtuous spiral of growing membership and power can come into view. The old carthorse could be transformed into an agile young filly. This would mean the TUC is not just the collective voice for workers’ rights but also the collective enforcer for these rights. It would mean helping lead disputes and organising solidarity for those in dispute so that the sense of the time-honoured slogans of “unity is strength” and “an injury to one is an injury to all” would again be meaningful and manifest. Yet none of this will be easy to achieve without a change in government so much depends upon a Corbyn entering 10 Downing Street to help change the external legal and political environments to enable this to happen.Professor Gregor Gall is an affiliate research associate at Glasgow University"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4796263.1536262195!/image/image.jpg","title":"jim duffy how to change your life in 40 minutes","story":"        The simple things in life we can take for granted.

We can even miss them in an age where technology occupies so much of our time. So, recently I have been getting back to basics. Heck, I even built a small dry stone wall after watching a few ‘how to’ videos. But, bringing it back even further to a pastime that requires no tools, videos or manuals, I want you to re-experience the emotions and thoughts that can fizzle around your mind when you take a walk. Yes, a simple walk. It is truly amazing what you can see when you take the time from your day to put one foot in front of the other and gaze with purpose.            Firstly you need to make a conscious decision to walk on your own. It can be nice and empowering to walk with someone, but you can miss so much as you natter. Being alone with your thoughts as you stride out brings powerful focus on so many things. This is key to a successful, thought-provoking and enjoyable walk.            Next think about how much time you have and want to dedicate to your walk. I would suggest about 40 minutes is a good time, considering how long you can focus for and how beneficial the walk is for your health. Then just head off and walk. No need to jump in a car if you don’t need to. Urban trekking or the bucolic idyll is fine either way.Now that you’re out and about on your walk, it is time to really enjoy it as you stare, scrutinise, interrogate and gaze.READ MORE: New coastal walking trail to open up in scenic southern tip of ScotlandFor ious reasons, we have lost the ability and capacity to focus on the world around us. It is all part and parcel of how technology is killing off human nature. Simply looking at the landscape wherever you are livens up the signals to between your eyes and your brain. From architecture to woodland, there is so much to fathom out. Why did the farmer build a well there? Why did the city fathers use one type of block over another? And so it starts. And you build layer upon layer of questioning and analysis on what is around you. No mobile phones. No listening to music through earbuds. Just utilising and honing your senses.Our sense of sight is a true gift. But, we fail to appreciate what is in front of us a great deal of the time. We see what we need to see. For example, as we navigate around a town or city, we look for the cues that give us pointers like street signs, traffic lights, lane markings, pedestrian crossings. Stop. Go. Turn Left. Wait. And while all this is taking place as we are on autopilot to get to work, to park, to eat, to go home, we have pulled up a metaphysical drawbridge to everything else that exists around us.            Simply by looking up, we can delve into so much more context and history on our walk. Looking up in a city throws up an incredible amount of detail. The complexity of roofing. How the guttering works and drops down on the outside of buildings via pipes deep into the sewer systems. The types of slate that have been laid – everything from Scottish to Spanish – tell a story. Satellite dishes hanging off walls where the phones lines are attached. A whole city exists above the city pavements if you take time to look.READ MORE: Five of the best beach walks in ScotlandConversely on your walk, you can choose to look down instead of straight ahead. Looking down offers an insight into special places that ordinarily one would walk past and miss. In places like Edinburgh there are voluminous garden flats secreted at the side of the pavements. These dwellings run beneath whole tenemented buildings with a dual aspect at the front and back. And as you walk, you can see the stairs leading down to them. It is so easy to miss them. Then you will notice that the pavement you are walking on is above the cavernous store rooms that accompany these garden flats. What a clever use of space by our Victorian city planners. And so it goes on ...Whether you walk straight out and straight back or take a loop, there is always a new sight to pick up on, a new smell to notice.            But, it takes some effort on your behalf. If you have ever tried yoga, then you will understand the energy needed to unthink your current thoughts and focus on your heart beat and get in the moment and in tune with your body.This is exactly what it is like as you forget the rest of what is taking place in your life and focus on your walk. Instead of reflecting on the issues and problems you are facing back home or at work, you are reflecting on the environment around you. And it will throw back observations to you as you question why things are as they are.And then your 40 minutes is up. You arrive back at the house or office with a whole new perspective on life around you. Selfishly, you have re-energised parts of your brain that have been dulled down over time, while benefiting from the exercise you have undertaken with minimal stress and strains on your joints.  You can come back to reality and I guarantee you will feel better in your mind and spirit.

First, do no harm. This advice for those aspiring to become doctors has stood the test of thousands of years for a reason.            Patients must have confidence that when they go to see a doctor they are in safe hands.            And so the grim revelation reported by The Scotsman that a surgical mesh implant had, for the first time, been formally recorded as an underlying cause of a death – that of 75-year-old Eileen Baxter from Loanhead – prompted questions at the highest level yesterday, with calls for First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to set up an urgent review.More than 100,000 of women across the UK have been given the implants over the past two decades, but complaints have been growing from patients who have found themselves in permanent pain – sometimes so bad that they are unable to work or even walk.READ MORE: Mesh implant listed as ‘cause of death’ for first timeUse of the implants, designed to treat pelvic organ prolapse and incontinence, is currently suspended by NHS Scotland, although they can still be used in some cases. Sturgeon told Holyrood that in the six months to March the procedure had been carried out 33 times, compared to more than 11,000 times in the same period of 2013/14. She also pledged to give calls for a review “careful consideration”.            The UK’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency is responsible for deciding which medical devices can be used by the NHS, so it may be the appropriate body to re-examine the safety of the implants.But if the Scottish Government does not hold its own review, it needs to press the MHRA to do so for the sake of future patients and the thousands who already have mesh implants, who will understandably be extremely worried.There are experts who have argued against a complete ban on mesh implants – such as Scotland’s Chief Medical Office, Dr Catherine Calderwood – on the grounds that there is little or no alternative for some patients.And such views need to be taken seriously. It may be that a problem can occur in specific cases for reasons that are not well enough understood.

Green MSP John Finnie is behind the bill, which will remove the defence of “reasonable chastisement” from Scots law which currently allows parents to use physical punishment to discipline youngsters.            The Scottish Government has already confirmed it will back the bill and it was confirmed yesterday that SNP MSPs will not have a “free vote” on the issue and will be told by party whips to back the bill. Labour also said yesterday its MSPs will support the measures, meaning the legislation is certain to pass at Holyrood in the next year.

READ MORE: Campaigners vow to fight ‘interfering’ smacking ban billMr Finnie said: “I am delighted to be formally lodging my bill to give children equal protection from assault in the Scottish Parliament today.            “Children deserve the same legal protection from assault that adults enjoy, a position that children’s rights organisations and charities have long been arguing. Substantial academic research from around the world shows that physical punishment does not work and is shown to be counter-productive. My bill aims to support parents to make positive choices.“The bill will not change the way that police and social work deal with assault against children. Rather it establishes the principle that assault can never be ‘justifiable’.”A consultation has already been undertaken into the Children   Bill earlier this year and received more than 650 responses with almost 75 per cent of those in favour of the legislation.The ban has the backing of the Scottish Police Federation, Barnardo’s Scotland, the Church and Society Council of the Church of Scotland and the NSPCC.            Scotland’s Children’s Commissioner Bruce Adamson also backed the legislation yesterday.“We should never consider the assault of a child for the purposes of punishment to be justifiable,” he said.“Scotland is one of the last countries in Europe to amend its law to protect children, and I welcome the fact that we now have broad political support for the change.”Children’s minister Maree Todd added: “Our vision for Scotland to be the best place in the world for children to grow up. “This bill sends a clear signal that all physical punishment of children is wrong.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4791044.1536352979!/image/image.jpg","title":"tony blair labour different party under corbyn","story":"        Tony Blair has attacked Jeremy Corbyn\u0026#8217s leadership of the Labour Party and questioned whether it can be \u0026#8220taken back\u0026#8221 by moderates.                The former prime minister sparked anger among supporters of the current left-wing leader by saying that under his stewardship it had become a “different party” and he hopes it is not “lost”.            It prompted Jon Lansman, founder of the Corbynite Momentum, movement to say on Twitter that Labour would “never” return to the former PM’s policies and he “was never in the right party”.            However, Lord Blunkett, a former home secretary and leading figure of the Blair era, warned that the party faced “irrelevance” unless there was a rethink of the “Corbyn project”.Mr Blair told the BBC: “I’ve been a member of the Labour Party for over 40 years. You do feel a strong loyalty and attachment, but at the same time it’s a different party. The question is, can it be taken back? This is a different type of Labour Party. Can it be taken back? I don’t know.”The former PM’s comments come after Labour activists in Enfield North passed a vote of no confidence in Joan Ryan, a minister in the Blair administration who now chairs Labour Friends of Israel.Mr Corbyn was in Leicester  on Friday to outline Labour’s plans for the water industry.When told that Mr Blair sees him as an “existential threat” to the party he said: “I’ve been in the Labour party all my life. I am a socialist. I am determined to see a fairer and more equal society for everybody.            “That’s what the Labour party exists for.”Asked on the visit to the Abbey Pump station whether he should heed the words of the three-time election winner, the current Labour leader said: “I simply say this to all Labour party members and all Labour party supporters – if you want to get rid of this Tory government, if you want to live in a society that is fairer, that is more equal, that is more just, then vote Labour and support Labour.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed.

It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame.

The film is then scheduled for general release by makers Netflix on November 9.\nThe Outlaw King, one of the biggest productions made in Scotland, is a historical drama about Robert the Bruce and stars heart-throb Chris Pine in the lead role.\nSecurity was tight while filming was going last September, but teasing clues were left here and there.\nCar parks at the Macdonald Aviemore Highland Resort were commandeered by Winnebago villages for tantalising days where polite security guards could only say there was \"a film being being made\".\nAt one point a beautifully crafted medieval launch glided up and parked itself  at the resort.\nGradually the whole story emerged over the months and now David Mackenzie\u0027s glittering new production is being trumpeted in magazines and on line.\nThe new epic is boosting Scotland\u0027s economy by more than 10 times what the taxpayer has spent on it.\nThe Scottish Government says the film has already generated \u0026pound17.5m and increased employment opportunities nationwide. Cairngorms Business Partnership chief executive Mark Tate said the global exposure provided by such big-budget movies is a huge boost for the local economy.\nThe film itself tells the untold, true story of 14th Century Robert the Bruce who transforms from defeated nobleman to outlaw hero during the oppressive occupation of medieval Scotland by Edward I of England.\nDespite grave consequences, Robert seizes the Scottish crown and rallies an impassioned group of men to fight back against the mighty army of the king and his volatile son, the prince of Wales.\nAlso starring are Scottish actors James Cosmo, Tony Curran, Steven Cree, Chris Fulton and Alistair Mackenzie.\nAnother big-budget movie, Mary Queen of Scots, was also being shot in the strath at the same time.\nThe film, starring Saoirse Ronan, Margot Robbie and David Tennant, is scheduled to be released at the end of this year.\nSaturday 8 Sep 2018 2:45 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117299.jpg","title":"Conservation hub set for expansion","story":"Iain Ramage\n\u0026nbsp\nTHERE was a disappointing response to a recent six-week public consultation to gauge local thinking about a proposed extension of Grantown\u0027s conservation area.\nLess than one per cent of residents offered an opinion. Proposed change will bring a greater number of properties into the protected area and, therefore, under stricter planning controls.\nHowever, Andrew Puls, Highland Council\u0027s principal officer for building conservation and environment, told local councillors meeting in Grantown that from 732 local homes, and after a consultation event attended by 50 people, there were only 12 responses. Opinion was also sought online. There is potential for the amended boundary to generate more planning applications. Parts of Grantown including The Square were designated as a conservation area in 1975. This is the first formal review since that designation.\nThe proposal is to extend the designated area along South High Street and into peripheral areas of the conservation zone. Mr Puls stressed it was not the purpose of a conservation area to prevent development but \"rather to control development to ensure it is appropriately sited and designed\".\nHe said this was aptly demonstrated by a number of new developments consented in recent years. Strong views were expressed \u0026ndash for and against \u0026ndash on the inclusion of the belt of trees to the north and west of Inverallan Church.\nThe trees contribute to the setting of the conservation area, forming a backdrop to the B-listed church \"and provide a natural separation with the later development to the north west\", according to the officer\u0027s report to members.\nThose against the proposed extension cited the project to convert the church for \"community use, part funded by developing housing either side of the church\".\nThere was a sense that including the location within the conservation area would be \"a barrier to this development\".\nConversely, there was support for including the trees because they would be better protected from speculative development.\nThe draft proposals will go to the council\u0027s south planning committee for approval. If adopted, all properties within the conservation area will be notified by letter.\nSaturday 8 Sep 2018 2:45 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117295.jpg","title":"Lack of 999 cover for busy Harley weekend","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nAVIEMORE was covered by only a single-manned ambulance for most of the Harley Davidson Thunder in the Glens rally, it has emerged.\nIt means that a casualty could be attended to but not taken to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness in the event of an emergency until a second ambulance crew had arrived at the scene.\nIt is understood the village only had an ambulance with single crew rather than double crew available last Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday until 5pm.\nThere were an estimated 3000 motorcyclists in the area for the UK\u0027s biggest Harley rally.\nGMB Scotland also said Kingussie only had a single manned crew in operation from just after midnight on Thursday until Sunday morning.\nThe union said the situation is simply not acceptable and poses a real danger.\nAlong with the Strathy, the GMB has been calling for the Scottish Ambulance Service to get rid of the current on-call system and to replace it with 24/7 shifts to bring the Aviemore base into line with most other stations in Scotland.\nJohn Marr, GMB branch secretary, said: \"Only a first responder service would have been able to be provided by an ambulance with single crew.\n\"This would have involved looking after the casualty at the location until back up arrived.\n\"We think it is dangerous and we are stepping up our calls on the government to provide the Scottish Ambulance Service with the funds required to give Badenoch and Strathspey the service the area deserves.\n\"At the moment we are going round in circles asking why there is no 24/7 cover despite Aviemore being one of the busiest tourism spots in the whole of Scotland.\n\"We have repeatedly informed the Scottish Ambulance Service that this is a dangerous situation but nothing is happening.\"\nHighland Council convener and local councillor Bill Lobban, said: \"The current level of ambulance cover is clearly completely unacceptable.\n\"Given our population added to the huge number of visitors we see on a daily basis the Scottish Ambulance Service needs to make sure we have sufficient staff on duty to provide a safe and effective service.

Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association  in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary  Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon. This was then used as a pretext by the RUC to ban the NICRA parade from the Square. \nAbout 2,500 took part in the NICRA march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon. The main speaker was Austin Currie MP, later a Fine Gael TD. Also speaking was Gerry Fitt, West Belfast MP. Fitt who, years later, was lifted into the House of Lords by Margaret Thatcher, declared that they would go on until they had “Civil Rights and a 32-County Republic”.\nBut the real leaders of the Civil Rights Movement which began that day were the rank and file, the ordinary people of Tyrone and beyond who marched for justice and freedom. \nThe first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon was held on 24 August 1968, 50 years ago this week.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27460  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nLet\u0026#039s exceed those who turned out on the very first civil rights march in August 1968 and let\u0026#039s ensure that a very clear and committed demand is presented to the governments - the Irish government as much as the British government - to address those issues of a rights based society that are enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement. - Mitchel McLaughlin\nThis Saturday the 50th anniversary of the first organised civil rights march in the North will be marked with a commemoration march from Coalisland to Dungannon. \nThe original march, held on August 24, 1968, was the first to be organised by the Civil Rights Association in the north, which was founded the previous year to challenge the institutionalised discrimination and injustice of the Six County state. \nIt was stopped at an RUC cordon before it reached its destination at Market Square in Dungannon but the organisers went ahead with their protest and held speeches at sang the civil rights anthem, \u0027We Shall Overcome\u0027, at the police cordon. \nAn estimated 2,500 people took part in the original march fifty years ago. \nThe Coalisland to Dungannon march was followed by a march in Derry on October 5 1968 which was brutally attacked by the RUC. The attack on the marchers was carried out in front of the news cameras, brining global attention to the civil rights campaign and the the discrimination of the unionist regime at Stormont. \n\nThis Saturday\u0027s march, organised by Sinn Féin, is the first in a series of events planned to mark the 50th anniversary of the beginning of the civil rights campaign. \nMid Ulster Sinn Féin MP, Francie Molloy, who helped organise and took part in the original parade 50 years ago, said that the campaign for rights is as relevant now as it was in 1968 and encouraged people to take part in Saturday\u0027s march. \n\"Presently, with the deliberate denial of rights, a shortage of affordable housing and the ongoing issue of constituency boundary proposals, it is clear there is still a job of work to be done,\" he said. \nWith the DUP\u0027s denial of rights to the LGB\u0026ampT community, Irish language speakers and bereaved families awaiting inquests, it is clear the campaign for rights needs to continue in the north. The onset of the Tory Brexit, backed by the DUP, also represents an attack on the rights of people in the north. \nThe main speaker at the end of the commemoration at the Square in Dungannon will be former Sinn Féin MLA Mitchel McLaughlin. \nSpeaking ahead of Saturday\u0027s march, the former Northern Assembly Speaker called for a huge turnout. \"Let\u0027s exceed those who turned out on the very first civil rights march in August 1968 and let\u0027s ensure that a very clear and committed demand is presented to the governments - the Irish government as much as the British government - to address those issues of a rights based society that are enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement,\" he said. \nThe parade will begin in Coalisland at 3pm on Saturday and make its way to Dungannon. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27461  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\n“The denial of rights, equality and respect is as wrong today as it was fifty years ago. - Mitchel McLaughlin\nHundreds of people took part in a commemoration in Tyrone yesterday to mark the 50th anniversary of the first civil rights march to be held in the north. \nThe march retraced the steps of the original march from Coalisland to Dungannon and was attended by Sinn Féin representatives from across the north. \nIt was led by Mid Ulster Sinn Féin MP Francie Molloy, who took part in the original march 50 years ago as a steward. \nMarchers carried replicas of the posters carried by the original march, reading \u0027One man, one vote,\u0027 \u0027Equal housing now\u0027 as well as banners referring to the Caledon housing protest which was the motivation for the march. \nContemporary posters on the threat posed to Brexit to rights were also carried by marchers. \n\nIn 1968 the original march was stopped before it reached the Square in Dungannon by the RUC because loyalist protestors staged a counter demonstration. \nThis time, however, the march reached its destination where speeches were made by Francie Molloy, local MLA Colm Gildernew and Fermanagh/South Tyrone MP Michelle Gildernew. \nThe main speaker of the march was veteran republican and civil rights activist Mictchel McLaughlin. \nIn his speech, the former Assembly Speaker said tat much has changed in the last five decades and that we are on the verge of a major shift towards Irish unity. \n\"The Orange state is now gone and we now have a peaceful and democratic way forward. \n“This is a very different place than it was in 1968 and I am convinced that we are now on the verge of another seismic shift towards a new, agreed and united Ireland that will provide a prosperous and shared future for all our citizens,\" he said. \n\nBut Mr McLaughlin also warned that our rights are still under threat today from Brexit and the right wing alliance between the Tories and the DUP. \n“My deep concern is that there are still people who want to deny rights and equality to their fellow citizens today. \n\"People in the north still face attacks on their electoral and civil rights, alongside the continued denial of rights to LGBTQ couples, women, Irish language speakers, and bereaved families seeking a coroner’s inquest.\n“Today, we are experiencing an unacceptable blockade on rights, imposed by the DUP and facilitated by the British government.\n“Rights are also under threat by a right-wing Tory Brexit and there are unwelcome echoes of gerrymandering and the hollowing out of democracy by the recent Boundary Commission proposals.\n“The denial of rights, equality and respect is as wrong today as it was fifty years ago,\" he added. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27462  ","story":"Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O\u0026#039Neill.\n Michael McMonagle\n\n“We must specifically acknowledge the damage done by the Catholic Church to the lives of many women and children in the mother and baby homes, the Magdalene Laundries and a succession of abuse scandals and cover ups.- Michelle O\u0026#039Neill\nThe visit to Ireland by Pope Francis this weekend is an opportunity for the Catholic church to address the ongoing legacy of abuse, Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O\u0027Neill has said. \nMichelle O\u0027Neill made the comments ahead of the historic visit to Ireland of Pope Francis this weekend to attend the World Meeting of Families which is being held in Dublin.

The march was blocked by the RUC at Thomas Street from entering Dungannon’s Market Square, subsequently leading to the second Civil Rights march in Derry’s Duke Street on 5th October 1968.\n\"The first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades,\" he said.\nOver 2,500 took part in the first civil rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon.\nThis would evidently change politics here forever - this was very much a campaign organised by people, from all backgrounds and none. \nProminent republicans were also central to the organisation of demonstrations, including the now Mid Ulster MP, Francie Molloy and the late Stan Corrigan.\nReflecting on the first civil rights march, 50 years on, Colm Gildernew said the first civil rights march should act as a rallying cry to those of us who seek to promote rights, equality and respect for all in society today.\n\"We are currently experiencing an unacceptable blockade on a swathe of rights-based issues by the DUP, including Irish language, marriage equality, women’s health, and legacy rights.  \n\"There are huge concerns arising from Brexit and the recent Boundary Commission proposals, seen by many as a new attempt to gerrymander the north.

They were on active service and at Drumnakilly, close to their homes, they were ambushed and shot dead by a unit of the British Army’s SAS regiment. The Volunteers were brothers Gerard and Martin Harte and Brian Mullin.\nThe SAS killings brought to an end a month which had been one of the most intense and tragic of the war in Ireland. It began on 1 August with the IRA bombing of Inglis Barracks in London, close to Margaret Thatcher’s Finchley constituency. It was the first IRA attack in England since the bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the Tory Party conference four years earlier. A British solider was killed in the Inglis Barracks blast. In the following days, the IRA killed three British soldiers and an RUC detective in the North. \n\nOn 8 August, two young nationalist men were murdered by a loyalist death squad in Belfast. There were two more such sectarian killings of young nationalist men in Belfast, on 17 and 18 August. On 20 August, eight British soldiers were killed at Ballygawley, County Tyrone, when the IRA bombed a bus carrying members of the Light Infantry Regiment returning from England. On 31 August, two civilians were killed in Derry after they triggered an IRA booby-trap bomb intended for British forces. \nPolitically this period was dominated by the issue of extradition and, on 27 August, Robert Russell, one of the IRA prisoners who broke out of the H-Blocks in the mass escape of 1983, was handed across the border to the RUC. This was despite widespread protests, including public dissent from within Fianna Fáil.\nIt was on the Long Bog Road at Drumnakilly, four miles outside Omagh, that the three IRA Volunteers met their deaths.\nAt 4pm on 30 August, they were ambushed by British forces who poured a hail of bullets into their car. The RUC and British Army immediately sealed off the area and the bodies of the three men were left at the scene, within the cordon and inaccessible to grieving relatives, until the following afternoon. \n\nGerard Harte  was the eldest of the three Volunteers and was an experienced IRA activist. With his brother, Martin, he was a prominent member of the Loughmacrory St Theresa’s GAA Club, where he organised youth teams. \nMartin Harte was just 21 but had been in the IRA for four years at the time of his death. A talented football player, he had captained the Loughmacrory team. He was the father of a three-month-old son and, to compound the tragedy, his widow was Briege Mullin, sister of his friend and comrade Brian Mullin. \nVolunteer Brian Mullin  had been singled out for particular harassment by British forces. He was arrested and interrogated in Gough Barrack on numerous occasions and a few weeks before his death he and his brothers were beaten by crown forces outside their family home.\n\n\nHundreds of British soldiers and RUC members saturated the Tyrone countryside as the three Volunteers were laid to rest. Speaking at the graveside of the Harte brothers, Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Volunteers were “good, decent, patriotic freedom fighters driven to fight for justice”. \nVolunteers Brian Mullin, Gerard Harte and Martin Harte were killed on 30 August 1988, 30 years ago this week.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27466  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\n“The policy of this government is failing the homeless, failing those renting and those who strive to own a home.

The excellent work done by Barrister Mark Bassett covers EU and Irish law and is unambiguous - with political will, this can be done,\" she said. \nMartina Anderson said that senior figures in the EU, as well as leading representatives from both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have already indicated support for the proposal. \n\"The European Parliament emphatically endorsed a resolution calling for democratic and social rights to be upheld in the north post-Brexit. The Parliament’s Coordinator on Brexit, Guy Verhofstadt supports continued representation for the north, as does the Fianna Fáil leader and Fine Gael MEP Seán Kelly believes it is worth considering,\" she explained. \nSinn Féin recently made a submission to the Constitutional Commission set up to examine the boundaries of European Parliament constituencies which called for the creation of a new constituency in the north and Martina Anderson explained this legal opinion reinforces that submission. \n The Sinn Féin MEP made a direct appeal to An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to uphold the rights of Irish citizens in the north. \n“An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar stated that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish government.

This is the most common form of food poisoning in the UK. \n  \nWe have heavily invested in research throughout the production chain and we have already implemented new ideas such as hot water heating, double barrier changing facilities in each house and other technologies which we firmly believe have had a major impact in reducing the number of our birds which can become infected with Campylobacter. \n  \nFurthermore, we are focusing on excellence in biosecurity and innovative processing technologies.\n  \n\n  \nOngoing challenges\n  \n\n  \nControlling infectious disease in poultry is an ongoing challenge Moy Park face, in particular avian influenza . To address this, they have upgraded their AI contingency planning, rewriting the rulebook in the past year to ensure they have a robust plan in place.\n  \nWe have to think carefully how we would react and prevent spread if AI came in to Northern Ireland and together with agencies and Government departments we exchange views regularly with working groups, in order to remain on top of this key issue, Peter said.\n  \n\n  \nCareer Highlight\n  \n\n  \nOver his 40 years with the company Peter said a key highlight has been promoting ownership and pride with the people he works closely with.\n  \nA back to basics approach is one of my fundamental pillars, and I still firmly believe that bird husbandry and welfare are key to producing a high-quality product.\n  \nThere are endless opportunities for those considering a career in agriculture and food production, and as my wife and son also work in the poultry industry, I can definitely vouch for that!\n  \nAs the world population continues to expand, the demand for goods also increases and food production, and those working in the industry, will have to keep up with this development.\n  \nBy strengthening our production capabilities over the past number of years, we are well placed to meet this demand, with poultry a healthy and versatile source of protein which is also good value for money.\n  \n\n  \nPositive outlook\n  \n\n  \nPeter concluded: As I look back on my time in the industry and at Moy Park, I’ve always started each morning the same way, and I think it has stood me in good stead!\n  \nThe first thing I think of is ‘today will bring a new challenge, a new opportunity and I will most likely learn something new’ as every day is a school day!”\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_995387.jpg--.jpg?1535635242000\n","title":"superb gcse results for dunclug college","story":"  \nDUNCLUG College is celebrating historic levels of achievement at GCSE level. \n  \nAll students, including those with ious learning challenges sat a minimum of 7 GCSE subjects, including the compulsory core of English, Maths and Science and a range of GCSE optional choices in a balance of General and Applied courses.\n  \n Many gifted and competitive students sat 8, 9 or 10 subjects.

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

grateful family of a Ballymoney schoolboy whose life was saved by his older brother\u0027s bone marrow have spoken publicly for the first time.\nA year after seven-year-old Caden Moore received a transplant at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children from his 11-year-old brother Ben their proud mother Sabrina has agreed to share their inspiring story.\nSabrina and her husband Bryan are hoping their unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Register.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Chronicle, teacher Sabrina said: It\u0027s been the toughest year of our lives but what a difference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such life-changing procedures in the same hospital, on the same day, is something we could never have imagined. Caden is improving every day and Ben has never looked back.

We have come close in the past, making it to the quarter-finals and the semi-finals, so to go one better this season is a great feeling.\n\u0026#8220There is a real buzz and a belief in the team that we can go and win the Irish Cup in our first final.\n\u0026#8220We have gone up against teams from all over the Province this season to get to the final.\n\u0026#8220We didn\u0027t know too much about any of them, they were all an unknown quantity, but we played to our strengths and we have been rewarded.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus      return false     else if        your_email.focus      return false     else if        friends_name.focus      return false     else if        friends_email.focus      return false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random return false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n       .ready .click .hide          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.fadeIn          return false                .click .parents.fadeOut          return false                    */       ]]\n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n                           username.focus            return false           else if              password.focus            return false           else                      ]]\n      \n      \"\n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n               return false\" title=\"View The Leader online!\"\n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n banner\" title=\"Advertise with Us\" /\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n          ?

The Ballymoney man lost his father, Mervyn Robinson, to the\u0026#160 North West 200 in 1980, while in July his cousin, William Dunlop, was killed during free practice at the Skerries 100 near Dublin.\nAll of these setbacks forced a re-think, says Robinson. My main reason for quitting the sport was my wee boy, Max, he told Chronicle Sport.\n\u0026#8220Road racing is getting very dangerous and there have been too many accidents recently, so I\u0027m not prepared to take the chance any more.\n\u0026#8220My main fear is getting caught up in something outside of my control like, like an accident happening in front of me, or a bike seizing or something.\n\u0026#8220William\u0027s death affected me big time, to be honest I felt like packing it in immediately.\n\u0026#8220The\u0026#160 circumstances surrounding William\u0027s death were just awful. The fact he left behind a\u0026#160 young daughter and Janine [his partner] had a second baby on the way made it so horrible for us all to deal with.\n\u0026#8220I thought about it and I decided I wanted to do myself some justice and finish off the season before calling it a day.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus      return false     else if        your_email.focus      return false     else if        friends_name.focus      return false     else if        friends_email.focus      return false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random return false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field -

outside belfast to pay 17 more for gas","story":"\nTowns outside Belfast will be paying 17% more for gas prices following Firmus Energy\u0026#8217s tariff hike next month.\n\n                \nTen Town areas include Craigavon, Antrim, Armagh, Ballymena, Ballymoney, Banbridge, Coleraine, Limavady, Derry/Londonderry and Newry.\n\n\n\nThis is a further blow for consumers\n\nThe Consumer Council\n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nFirmus Energy is to increase gas prices by 12% in the Ten Towns area from 1 October 2018. The Consumer Council has branded the increase ‘unwelcome’ and called for more gas licence holders to enter the market so create more competition.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe council is urging the 38,000 natural gas domestic and business customers to consider ways to save on household energy bills.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nAn annual bill for a typical Firmus Energy customer in the Ten Towns areas using 12,000 kWh on a Pay As You Go meter will increase from £594 to £666, an increase of £72. Whereas the annual bill for a typical Firmus Energy customer in the Greater Belfast area using 12,000 kWh on a Pay As You Go meter will increase from £539 to £604, an increase of £65.\n\nGas prices in Ten Towns will be around 17% more expensive than Belfast, based on SSE Airtricity’s Pay As You Go tariff.\n\n“This is a further blow for consumers following recent electricity tariff increases by the three largest electricity suppliers in Northern Ireland,” said a NI Consumer Council spokesperson.\n\nRichard Williams, Head of Energy Policy at The Consumer Council, said: “This is unwelcome news for Firmus Energy customers, following a 6.8% increase in the Ten Towns area earlier this year. However, we are aware the main driver is the significant rise in global gas costs since the tariff was last set in April. From 1 October, the annual bill for a typical Firmus Energy customer in Ten Towns will increase by £72 a year to £666. It is the sole supplier of gas in the Ten Towns. We would like to see other gas licence holders enter the market so that consumers there can benefit from competition.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8628181.1536329418!/image/image.jpg","title":"candlelight vigil in memory of cameron truesdale","story":"\nA candlelight vigil is to be held in Waringstown tomorrow night  in memory of Cameron Truesdale.\n\n                \nThe teenager  died on Wednesday night after a 20-month battle with cancer.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe vigil will begin at 8pm in Waringstown Park, in the village near Lurgan.

the particular period of history.\n“The crew work so quickly to recreate the time and place,” he said. “We have had some of the corridors repainted, signage put up and some of our music rooms have been transformed to look like the Olympic Village were the skaters stayed – complete with itineraries on the walls and training timetables.\n“We are delighted that St Mary’s was chosen for the film project and look forward to seeing the school on the big screen.”\nFilming is continuing on the film with a release date expected in the autumn.\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"well not be derailed by latest mod stunt","story":"\n\nTHE\n Ballymurphy Massacre families have said that the latest ‘stunt’ by the British Ministry of Defence will not derail their much anticipated inquest into the murder of there loved ones.\n\nA preliminary inquest into the atrocity takes place at 2pm today  at Belfast’s High Court.\nLast week the MoD handed over a database containing almost 5,000 names of former soldiers to the Coroner’s Office.\n\nThe spreadsheet contains 1,366 names from the Parachute Regiment, 1,542 names from the Queen’s Regiment and eight names from the Queen’s Division. A further 1,492 names appear to be duplicates, meaning ‘when an individual has multiple regiments, or units on their Record of Service. \n\nThe Coroner’s Office had been attempting to trace former soldiers who may have  been in Ballymurphy during the three days in August 1971 when ten people were shot dead and one died of a heart attack.\nHowever, just days before the inquest was due to begin into the killings 47-year-ago the database containing nearly 5,000 names landed on the Coroner’s desk.\n\nSpeaking to the Andersonstown News Ballymurphy Massacre Families spokesperson John Teggart said: “Six working days before the start of our inquest and they  send this letter, this has been done before with the recent UVF story to attempt to delay our inquest.\n\n“Vital inquest resources are being used up here and that shouldn’t be happening, these stunts are nothing but a waste of time. We would now ask for more resources to be released on the back of this. All they  are attempting to do here is swamp the system days before we are due in court.\n\n“The families are devastated, we were and still are working towards this date, the Coroner  has been very focused in the lead up to this, she is now obliged to look at this list. We hope that it can be done in a speedy fashion.\n\n“We were prepared, we knew it wouldn’t be straight forward, when you’re working with the MoD the resources they have and the dirty deals they’ve been up to all along are well known. They’ve been sitting on their hands this entire time probably thinking they’d pull a stunt like this closer to the time [of the inquest], but to do it six days beforehand is utterly despicable.”\n\nMr Teggart continued: “Sure look at the UVF stunt a while ago, that was done to take the focus off the Paras and the Queen’s [regiment] another dirty tactic and I’d be confident that the MoD had a hand in it. \n\n“The UVF certainly weren’t out to help us that time and now the MoD have decided to swamp the inquest.”\n\nDiscussing what now needs to happen Mr Teggart said: “We need to remain focused and keep on track, we’ve had setbacks before and we’ve dealt with them, we will certainly deal with this one.\n\n“I hope there will be no delay we have a preliminary hearing on Thursday, the Coroner is demanding an explanation, she wants to know why this database has suddenly turned up and rightly so. \n\n“Our inquest is set to last 3-4 months, hopefully this database can be looked at in line with this time-frame so we aren’t setback.\n\n“When we were given a date for our inquest 18 months ago we clapped in the court, that’s unheard of. You now have good, independent people within the courts, the MoD have seen this so the only way they could try and delay this is with the dirty deals that they are doing now. \n\n“Bottom line is, the families are ready to go, the Coroner is ready to go, all the work’s done, the schedule has been set out, justice needs to be served.\u0026#8221\n"},{"url":null,"title":"bridge from northern ireland to scotland is a serious idea says professor","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It definitely can be done economically. \n\n\"There is concern about the cost of the project, but you know what they say you can have three economists you’d have four conclusions.  \n\n\"There are opinions either way about whether it can stack up or not.\"\n\nAt the conference Professor Dunlop also released the first artist impression of what the bridge might look like. \n\n\n\n\nWhy £15bn bridge to Scotland could be the answer to Brexit conundrum\n\n\n\n\n\nBoris Johnson backs bridge linking Northern Ireland and Scotland\n\n\n\n\nThe catalyst for the proposed bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland came from a speech made by Boris Johnson in January 2018 while he was the Foreign Secretary, in which he floated the idea of a 22-mile bridge across the English Channel to France - something he said would improve transport links after Brexit. \n\nProfessor Dunlop said the proposal wasn\u0027t feasible as the stretch between the United Kingdom and France is one of the busiest shipping channels in the world, but was asked shortly afterwards by Scottish newspaper The National if a similar project between Scotland and Northern Ireland was a possibility. \n\nHe laid out two proposals for the route - one from Larne and Portpatrick  or a crossing between the Mull of Kintyrne and Torr Head .\n\n\"One haulier I was speaking to was making dozens of trips across from Northern Ireland to Scotland every year and the cost of that was £600 each time. So when you take personalised stories like this you can see how the financial benefit would add up,\" Professor Dunlop said. \n\nThe proposal received a boost in March after a spokesman for the Scottish Government said it would \"initiate discussions to explore improving connectivity\" between the island of Ireland and Scotland, adding it was important \"that all options are fully considered\" \n\nDUP leader Arlene Foster and MP Sammy Wilson have both previously voiced their support for the project.  \n\nThe idea was also supported by former Foreign Secretary, who has called for it to be considered \"seriously\".  \n"},{"url":null,"title":"european heritage open days history opens up to northern ireland public","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

For Moravians, the burial ground was known as \"Gods Acre\" and had a strict layout. Men were buried to the left and women to the right of a central path. All the headstones were of the same shape and design - the Moravians believe that everyone is equal in death - and were laid almost flat on the ground.\n\nBelfast: Next door to the Belfast Harbour Commissioner\u0027s Office you will find Sinclair Seamen’s Church, a unique maritime-inspired church. Built in 1853 as a tribute to the city\u0027s seafaring traditions, its interior features a pulpit shaped like a ship\u0027s prow, the bell from 19th Century-built battleship HMS Hood and lifeboat-shaped collection boxes.\n\nDown: Grey Abbey is the oldest example of Gothic architecture in Ireland founded in 1193 by John De Courcy. In the 17th century the abbey ruins were acquired by the Montgomery family, who still live in the grounds to this day.\n\nFermanagh: Enniskillen is Ireland’s only island town and Castle Coole is regarded as the finest country house in Ireland. The house itself has no back door which is said to be a deliberate omission in order to discourage salesmen from calling.\n\nTo find out more about the list of those properties open in your area for European Heritage Open Days 2018 and to get involved visit \nwww.discovernorthernireland/events/European-Heritage-Open-Days/\n.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"jonathan bell i was not told about spike in applications for rhi scheme","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It is not a media sensational platform\nSir Patrick Coghlin\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the start of Friday’s hearing, Sir Patrick Coghlin warned that the inquiry is not a “media sensational platform”.\n\n“There is no open invitation to witnesses to come along and use the hearings for the purpose of publishing material to which they object or take offence for reasons which are irrelevant to the inquiry,” he said.\n\n“It is not a media sensational platform.”\n\nThe warning came after a reference was made on Thursday to allegations of sexual misbehaviour by DUP ministers.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts travel updates","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

who hails from the same area of Palm Beach where the house was sold - have now moved into a new home once owned by golf legend Ernie Els in nearby Jupiter.\n\nRory and Erica married in April last year at Ashford Castle in Cong, Co Mayo.\n\nThe couple first met when the stunning New Yorker was working manager of championship volunteer operations for the Professional Golf Association of America.\n\nShe famously woke McIlroy up after he had slept in during the Ryder Cup in 2012.\n\nThe new owner of the former McIlroy mansion, which the golfer originally paid £7.2m for, has not been revealed.\n\nIn 2013, McIlroy sold a five-bedroom house with its own golf driving range and putting green at Moneyreagh, Co Down, for £2m. \n\nThe 14-acre estate also boasted five bedrooms and a gymnasium.\n\nIn 2014 the golfer bought a property in Holywood through Simon Brien Residential estate agents.\n\nHe also snapped up a three-storey building there, described as having been sub-divided into five apartments.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"test shows some northern ireland meat had up to four animals in it","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

tests on meat from Northern Ireland, England and Wales 145 were partly or wholly made up of unspecified meat. \n\nSome samples contained DNA from up to four different animals and others contained no meat from animals that were advertised. \n\nLamb was the meat mostly likely to be contaminated, followed by beef and goat, while cow DNA was the most commonly found contaminant in other meat.  \n\nMince meat as the most commonly contaminated product followed by sausages, kebabs and restaurant curries.\n\nSamples came from 487 different locations including restaurants and supermarkets.\n\nA number of the samples came from Northern Ireland.\n\nThe BBC revealed that 73 of the contaminated samples came from retailers across three supermarkets. 50 samples came from restaurants and 22 from food manufacturing or processing plants.\n\nOstrich DNA was found in one of the samples.\n\nThe majority of samples were tested for common food DNA such as cow, pig, sheep, goat, horse, chicken and turkey.\n\nThe FSA said that other animal DNA could have been prevent but not identified during testing as it was not being looked for.\n\nLocal authorities gathered the samples from businesses before sending them for analysis, this data was then sent to the FSA.\n\nThe FSA said that the level of contamination present suggested it was deliberate, with over 1% of a animal\u0027s DNA counting as deliberate. \n\nHowever the FSA said the results were \"not representative of the wider food industry\".\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37289182.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/freederrycorner.jpg","title":"trust apologises after pink free derry wall for organ donor

It would be hilarious but for the money involved and the questions it raises about competence, cronyism and ethical behaviour at the highest levels of government. \n\nWe had allegations that former minister Jonathan Bell had tried to break his spad\u0027s finger and swung a punch at him. We heard that his former spad Timothy Cairns told him \"Listen to me, big b***s\" during a row witnessed by senior civil servants. \n\nThere were lurid suggestions of sexual misconduct made about two of Mr Bell\u0027s ministerial colleagues. \n\nThere was evidence that Mr Bell was unable to adequately discharge his duties the morning after a late night in New York. \n\nThere were claims that Mr Cairns answered to other spads rather than his ministerial boss and that some of them had families who stood to gain from RHI. \n\nAll this, before we even consider Mr Bell alleging that the Executive\u0027s spin doctor David Gordon characterised him as a \"monster\" who needed to be put to sleep and that a senior journalist was advising the DUP about how to attack him. \n\nThe former permanent secretary of his department stated that colleagues at Invest NI had complained of Minister Bell\u0027s \"limited contribution to Northern Ireland\u0027s interests regarding foreign direct investment and trade\" and the risk of him \"making inappropriate or unhelpful comments\".\n\nAfter a trade delegation he was due to lead to the US on St Patrick\u0027s Day was dropped, it was further stated that he delayed providing routine information to OfM/DfM and travel authorisation for Invest NI staff out of pique. \n\nMost of those settling in to watch the live feed were expecting to hear a Northern Irish version of Yes Minister. What they got sounded more like a particularly fractious episode of the Jeremy Kyle Show with the DUP family at war. \n\nDuring the hearing it appeared that Mr Bell\u0027s memory of key events and grasp of detail is far from perfect, that he made secret recordings of conversations with civil servants and party colleagues, and that spads rather than he made key decisions. \n\nRegardless of the veracity of any of the claims, the rest of us are left wondering about the ethics and integrity of those who govern us. \n\nSadly, the civil service does not emerge well either. \n\nThe people running the RHI scheme appeared not to be able to spot basic flaws. The unit was under-resourced, no staff had specialist knowledge of a complex field and personnel changes meant that there was no continuity as the crisis unfolded. \n\nMost people will be shocked and bewildered by all of this. Of course, the media can distort and sensationalise stories. But this one gets worse if you follow the live coverage and read all the documents. \n\nWe have no government. But if and when we do, there is no case for dancing in the streets. \n\nCivil servants and ministers will have much to prove. We need to trust that civil servants have the competence to manage large budgets, ministers the ability to lead them, and that unelected party officials are controlled by ministers, not the other way around. Until that confidence is restored, providing Stormont with yet more power would be unthinkable. \n\nNick Garbutt runs Nick Garbutt PR\n"},{"url":null,"title":"leo varadkar rejects reports of preparations for border checks","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

this week that the Revenue Commissioners were formulating plans with Government officials for full customs checks amid fears the EU and the UK will fail to reach an agreement.\n\nLeo Varadkar was speaking at the end of a parliamentary party meeting in Co Galway, on the same day as EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said Theresa May’s Brexit plans were not acceptable to Brussels.\n\n\n\nThe direction we’ve given to Revenue is not to prepare for customs posts on the land border between Ireland and Northern Ireland\nLeo Varadkar\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n“The direction we’ve given to Revenue is not to prepare for customs posts on the land border between Ireland and Northern Ireland because that’s something we’re not contemplating,” Mr Varadkar said.\n\nHe added: “If the Revenue Commissioners are in any way trying to put in any physical infrastructure then that is news to me and I really don’t believe that’s happening.”\n\nThe Taoiseach said it was important to make a distinction between the land border between Northern Ireland and Ireland and the ports, where the Government could not “countenance” a hard border being introduced, and airports, where custom controls may be needed if a pre-trade agreement was not reached with the UK.\n\nMr Varadkar said there would be an intensification in the next phase of the Brexit talks in the coming weeks and he hoped a deal would be made by the October deadline or by November at the latest.\n\nWhen it came to the common travel area, Mr Varadkar said he had no concerns.\n\n“I am confident that no matter what happens, the common travel area will remain in place because both UK and Ireland want that for each other’s citizens,” he said.\n\n“It benefits citizens in both countries and the European Union has taken the view that we can continue that.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"secretary of states announcement of civil servant decisions is of greater significance","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo

Of much greater significance than the cash crowd-pleaser was the Secretary of State\u0027s announcement of legislation to allow civil servants to take the decisions MLAs ought to be making.\n\nIndirect rule.\n\nIf I was a civil servant I\u0027d be asking for a cut of the £13,000 being taken from one of those poor MLAs. Civil servants will soon be effectively moonlighting as Executive ministers. And we all thought double-jobbing had ended.\n\nBradley\u0027s actions are an obvious attempt to keep Stormont open as a bit more than a tourist attraction.\n\nAllowing civil servants to make decisions avoids the dreaded direct rule label. It keeps alive the possibility of a return to devolved government until there really does have to be an election, in 2022. \n\nAnd even then, we could have a fantasy election to an Assembly that doesn\u0027t exist: 2003 all over again. Rule by civil service decree is profoundly undemocratic. Those elected by no-one will be making important decisions that affect everyone.\n\nGovernance transfers to the unelected and unaccountable. The main means of citizen redress will be via the courts. \u0027First Minister Sterling\u0027 - a job he does not seek and in which he ought not to be placed - will take decisions without democratic mandate.\n\nWhether the quality of civil service rule will improve matters is unclear. A fair chunk of the RHI evidence suggests a body struggling with the complexities of the legislation - even if it ought to have been mainly a cut-and-paste from the Westminster model - and failing to warn hapless ministers as trouble developed.\n\nIn its defence, the civil service appeared short-staffed and overworked - problems now multiplied several-fold by the Secretary of State\u0027s promise of more roles.\n\nThe costs of a full Assembly dissolution would be personal as well as political. When the Assembly was created in 1998-99, it was not the main source of livelihood for many MLAs. Few had expected its formation and many had other jobs.\n\nAfter years of relative stability from 2007-16, it has become the main source of income for most members .\n\nSo sympathy is due to those MLAs who are blameless in the institutional collapse and diligent in their constituency duties. As my Liverpool colleague Sean Haughey has shown in the Journal of Legislative Studies, MLAs spend a big proportion of their work  on constituency activity. \n\nThere\u0027s also much to be said for working from home. But when the university term starts, I wouldn\u0027t get 35p let alone £35K for long if I played truant. And members of a legislative assembly need to be just that.\n\nReducing salaries can concentrate minds but not change them. It may make MLAs thrifty with the weekly shopping but paying people £13,000 less will not alter their views on an Irish Language Act, same-sex marriage, abortion, Brexit, blame for RHI, whatever. \n\nUltimately political will not fiscal rectitude will determine the Assembly\u0027s future. There remains the strong suspicions that the DUP is, for now, comfortable with political arrangements - no worries for the DUP nine, erstwhile 10, given their prospering at Westminster - whilst Northern Ireland\u0027s institutions are not Sinn Fein\u0027s ultimate concern anyway.\n\nLogically, there is no reason why the Assembly cannot be reconstituted to deal with schools, hospitals and other matters, even if its members are still arguing over the dead-end of identity politics and wrestling over social issues. \n\nAn incremental way forward would be for the Assembly to revive but confine legislation initially to agreed ring-fenced issues - baby steps back to the full model. But don\u0027t expect anything prior to the RHI verdict anyway. \n\nPublic support for the Assembly - but not the current fake one - remains high, despite the cynicism over MLA pay. Credible immediate alternatives remain in short supply. \n\nDirect rule? Non-runner for nationalists. \n\nTransfer of powers to local councils? 11 mini-Stormonts. \n\nJoint authority or unity? Unionist uproar. \n\nAt its brief best, the Assembly was passing nearly as much legislation as its counterparts in Scotland and Wales. Yesterday\u0027s nod towards a \u0027pay-per-legislation\u0027 model will not, alone, restore its fortunes, but at least a potential Guinness World Record - for Secretary of State indecision - has been avoided - for now. \n\nJon Tonge is Professor of Politics at the University of Liverpool\n"},{"url":null,"title":"celtic orders independent review after prematch crush","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

following the incident in Janefield Street at Parkhead before Sunday’s match against Rangers as fans tried to get into the stadium before kick-off.\n\nCeltic apologised for the incident earlier this week, and has held talks with police about what happened.\n\nThe club has now ordered an independent review which will look at factors such as what may have contributed to the incident and improvements that could be made to stop anything like that happening again.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nThere was a police presence outside Parkhead before the first Old Firm game of the season \n\n\n\n\nIn a statement, Celtic FC said: “Following the events prior to kick-off at the match on Sunday 2 September, the Club has instructed Fairhurst, consultants specialising in sports event safety management, to conduct an independent review to identify the contributory factors to the incident, any issues that require to be addressed and what improvements might be made to prevent a recurrence.\n\n“The Club has requested that Fairhurst consider feedback from supporters who attended the match.\n\n“Any supporters who attended the match and would like to provide information to Fairhurst, please do so direct to 020918feedback@fairhurst.\n\n“Any information already provided to the Club will be passed on to Fairhurst.”\n\nOne person was taken to hospital after falling from a wall while four others were treated by first-aiders at the scene on Sunday.\n\nPolice said they held “constructive” talks with Celtic chiefs on Tuesday and said they will continue to work with Celtic and with the supporters to learn from events on Sunday and to improve future policing and stewarding operations.\n\nThe force said it has found no evidence to support suggestions that the gate on Janefield Street was closed at any time in the lead-up to kick-off.\n\nPolice said that officers and stewards acted quickly to stop more people entering Janefield Street and that without their actions the outcome could have been “far more serious”.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"kyle walker is on a oneman mission to nutmeg all of his england teammates","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC

What’s interesting about Brand New Roman is that when you smash so many of these brands together they start to lose their powerful brand connotations in fascinating ways,” said Hello Velocity creative director Lukas Bentel.\n\n“The sheer density overrides all the extra brand identity associations each symbol usually carries.” \n\nWeirdly, working out which brand is responsible for each letter is part of the attraction in reading things written in Brands New Roman. \n\nAnd it takes on a whole new twist when the font is used to rewrite recognisable logos using the alternative lettering.\n\nFacebook is recreated with the Amazon A – complete with arrow – the Internet Explorer E, B from Beats and the Kellogg’s K.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther leading brands have been similarly redrafted.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“In the end, I think that Brand New Roman is pretty aesthetically compelling, which makes sense given all the time, money and design that has gone into crafting each of these logos for the purposes of standing out,” added Bentel. \n\n“With Brand New Roman we are making them work together.” \n\nThe font has already been used to make a T-shirt.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo have a play around with font, visit the \nBrand New Roman\n website.\n\nSome letters change when combined with others, for instance a single o is different to a double oo. \n\nHello Velocity described the font building as a “time-intensive process”. \n\nIt had to cut some slack to find a logo which carried a recognisable standalone I. It opted for the capital version from IBM while the lowercase is taken from iomega – the predecessor of Lenovo. \n"},{"url":null,"title":"people share the cunning ways they have been duped by their pets","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

A thin layer of dust is visible on Curiosity, the result of a storm that enveloped Mars this summer. \n\nThe darkish sky indicates dust still clogging the atmosphere in August, when the panorama was shot by Curiosity’s mast camera. The rover had just drilled for a new rock sample.\n\nCuriosity is nuclear-powered and therefore unaffected by the lack of sunlight. \n\n\nTake a look at a 360º panorama of Vera Rubin Ridge on Mars, taken as the \n@MarsCuriosity\n rover surveyed its surroundings on the Red Planet during the fading global dust storm.

His charmingly naïve character is the perfect contrast to the outrageous Derry girls, whose antics inevitably lead to mayhem wherever they go.\n\nThe show has already garnered the attention of the critics, picking up a string of awards including two Irish Film and TV Awards, an Edinburgh TV Award, and scooping the Radio Times Comedy Champion award. And the second series promises to be just as successful with its winning combination of cringe-inducing 90’s nostalgia and biting comedy.\n\nThe cast are now looking forward to getting back together in the coming weeks, having been caught up in the whirlwind of publicity surrounding the show. As an honorary Derry girl, Dylan has already been immersed in the local culture thanks to his co-stars, and is looking forward to his return to the city. Invited by Derry City and Strabane District Council to present this year’s Fashion Fest event, Dylan will have the opportunity to impress a whole host of Derry girls at the North West’s premiere fashion showcase event.\n\nWhile he admits he isn’t a quite style icon, the popular actor, who hails from Reigate, is already planning his outfit – but promises he won’t be out to steal the show.\n\n“I can’t wait to get back to Derry, I had such a good time when I was there filming with the cast and crew,” he insists. “I love Ireland and having the opportunity to spend some time there filming in Derry and Belfast has been a real experience.”\n\nWhen he first received the script for Derry Girls, Dylan says he just knew it was going to be big – but didn’t realise just quite how big. “When I read it I loved it right away, I thought it was hilarious,” he recalls. “I just knew when I was on set with the cast and crew that it was going to be something pretty special. But I didn’t think it would be breaking records to the extent that it is – I had thought we might pick up about 500k viewers – but not 2.5million. That’s just phenomenal.”\n\nThe cast and crew had the chance to travel round a number of locations in Derry and also Belfast where they had access to a studio. And Dylan managed to sample a bit of the famous local hospitality while he was here – but not too much he insists. “The girls did take me out a bit in Derry so I got to try out some of the local bars and the nightlife, and the local music – but I’m not a big drinker. I was very responsible I promise.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\n“The nightlife is just amazing over there, I really enjoyed it, and I’m looking forward to seeing a bit more when I get back. I absolutely love the banter and the Irish sense of humour, that’s what makes the place for me. The girls have all taken me to meet their families and made me feel really welcome.”\n\nHis character James certainly won’t be setting many trends but what about Dylan’s own style? The former Hollyoaks actor is quietly confident that he can hold his own at Fashion Fest. But he won’t be trying out any Blue Steel moves of his own.\n\n“I’m on it – but I would say I will play it safe and go for a nice suit on the night. I think fashion is all relative really – it’s all about your own perceptions. I quite like vintage styles myself, 50’s, 60’s era - nothing too loud. Though I do quite like a Hawaiian shirt. I’ve got quite a cool military jacket which I like and a nice Harrington jacket which is a bit James Dean. I like to keep things simple - I won’t be out to steal the show.”\n\nDerry Girls serves as a painful reminder of some of the fashion crazes we would all rather forget from the 90’s, with shell suits, crunchy perms and bomber jackets galore. In terms of his own fashion faux pas however Dylan has emerged virtually unscathed so far in the family photo album.\n\n“I don’t think I’ve ever worn anything I’m really ashamed of,” he admits. “I’m very partial to pink though, so I have worn pink shirts or pink jumpers which can be really hard to pull off. But I think I handled it,” he laughs.\n\n“This is my first official Fashion event so I’m really looking forward to it. Perhaps I’ll pick up a few tips while I’m there. Going from my past experiences out in Derry I know it will definitely be a great night out.”\n\nYou can catch up with Dylan Llewellyn at the Guildhall, where the Fashion Showcase event will be dazzling audiences with an array of classic and contemporary couture on October 13th, including a collection by celebrity stylist and esteemed fashion designer Kate Halfpenny. The London based designer counts celebrities such as Rihanna, Erin O Connor and Kate Moss among her clients and will be closing the show with her luxury brand Halfpenny London, showing pieces from her bridal collection as well as her \u0027Black Edit Collection\u0027.\n\nYou can find out more about Fashion Fest and purchase tickets for the event at \nwww.derrystrabane/fashionfest\n Follow us on Instagram @FashionFestDerry\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"first look plans new lidl store site crescent link area derry","story":"\nTHE supermarket giant Lidl is inviting members of the public to attend a consultation event in Derry today where plans for a massive new store in the Waterside area will be on display.\n\nLidl is planning to open a second store in Derry on the Crescent Link, at an area of land close to the Kilfennan Link Roundabout.\n\nToday’s event, which will be held at the Crescent Community and Cultural Centre in Sperrin Park, is the first of three public events being held to discuss the plans.\n\nToday’s drop-in session will run from 11am to 1pm, with the second event to be at the same venue from 4pm to 7pm, next Thursday, September 13.\n\nThat will be followed by an event scheduled to be held in the Waterfoot Hotel on Wednesday, September 28, where the plans will be on show.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nThe news comes after the Derry News revealed in August of last year that Lidl was planning to replace its existing store on the Buncrana Road with a new store a short distance away at the junction of Buncrana Road and the Springtown Road.\n\nThe proposed new modern store will be located at 6 Springtown Drive, at vacant lands bounded by the Springtown Road and Buncrana Road.\n\nThe new store would be larger, have a wider range of goods and increased car parking space.\n\nSpeaking ahead of today’s event, the DUP Waterside councillor David Ramsey urged people to attend the upcoming events so that they had the ‘chance to have their say’ on the plans.\n\n“This is a very significant development planned for a key site in the Waterside and I would urge people to go along to at least one of these events and ensure their opinions are heard,” he said.\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"a man from llandrindod wells had his life saved twice in one month by the wales air ambulance in welshpool","story":"\nLeft to right: Pilot, James Benson, pictured alongside Critical Care Practitione\u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gtr Kate Humphries, Gr\u0026ltspan class=truncate-full-screen\u0026gtant Withington and Critical Care Doctor Scott Farmery. \u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8492487/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" height=\"\"\n                                                                                                                        \nA man from Llandrindod Wells had his life saved twice in one month by the Wales Air Ambulance\n\nGrant and his family visiting the Welshpool airbase.

Only five players attended a pre-season meeting and Down took the field for their National League opener with barely 15 players.\n\nHowever, Rooney\u0026rsquos infectious enthusiasm has transformed Down and three months later the girls find themselves preparing for an All-Ireland showdown.\n\nSport is such a conundrum. All who have been involved in sport at any level can testify to the many frustrating and heartbreaking defeats sporadically interrupted by moments of sheer elation.\n\nIt\u0026rsquos these infrequent moments that keep players and coaches going year in year out in search of just one more. A half, a game even a season can be changed on a block, tackle, score or win and the momentum gathered can be infectious.\u0026nbsp\n\nA group, seemingly going nowhere except deeper into the abyss are suddenly galvanised, working for one another as if their lives depended on it. Success is like a lightning bolt. It can strike when you least expect it and you must keep the energy and drive going. You have to strike when the iron is hot.\n\nYet, as we all know, fairy tale endings only become fairy tale endings when the underdog performs to their very best and leaves the field of play with no regrets.\n\nOn their day the Down girls are a match for anyone as they have proved a number of times this year and they have also shown that when their backs are against the wall they can and have turned games around.\u0026nbsp\n\nDown have talented players all over the park. They will be led by Clonduff sisters Sara Louise and Fionnuala Carr, who were both on the side that won the All-Ireland Junior crown at Croke Park in 2014.\n\nThrow in in Bredagh\u0026rsquos Catherine Rocks, Liatroim\u0026rsquos Aimee McAleenan and Dearbhla Magee and you have the nucleus of an attack-minded side.\u0026nbsp\n\nHowever, Portaferry\u0026rsquos twin terrors Niamh Mallon \u0026mdash skipper of the 2014 side \u0026mdash and Saoirse Sands are the jewels in the Down crown and they have the potential to cut any defence to shreds and no better place to do that than Croke Park on Sunday.\n\nThere were plenty of raised eyebrows when Down got the better of Tipperary thanks to a 58th minute goal from Sara Louise Carr to reach the Liberty Insurance All-Ireland Intermediate final for the first time in 20 years.\n\nIt may have been a surprise, but there were indications that the Mourne girls were making real progress as the summer evolved.\n\nAdmittedly, the league was a disaster, as they lost all five outings, but then they got the better of Derry in the Ulster final. They followed that up with a draw against the much-fancied Oak Leafers in the opening round of the All-Ireland Championship.\n\nThat laid the platform for the rest of the campaign and they defeated Laois to bag the runners-up spot in Group 1 behind Cork, who had overcome all before them.\n\nTipperary topped Group 2 and were six points clear at half-time in the semi-final, but with the experiment of deploying Fionnuala Carr at full forward dispensed with, there was an immediate improvement as the Clonduff colossus began to exert greater influence from centre back. Nicole Kelly put the shackles on the dangerous Nicola Treacy too.\n\nMeanwhile, Niamh Mallon was busily keeping the umpire busy as she racked up nine points, seven from placed balls. That brought Down in touch and Sara Louise Carr, who got married earlier this year, pounced for the definitive goal to go with her earlier two points from play.\n\nCork will be desperate to get over the line having lost the last two deciders, including last year\u0026rsquos to Meath after a replay.\u0026nbsp\n\nMuch like their senior counterparts, they have cruised through to the final, finishing the group phase with a positive scoring differential of 65 points, compared to Down\u0026rsquos -2. Indeed, the Rebels were 12-point victors when the teams met in P\u0026aacuteirc Esler in July.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe Leesiders possess a lot of firepower with Finola Neville, Caroline Sugrue and Katelyn Hickey well able to hit the target. Minor star Cliona Healy came off the bench to have a big impact in the semi-final win over Galway, scoring three points in as many minutes soon after her second-half introduction to edge the Leesiders clear and finishing with four.\n\nHealy wasn\u0026rsquot involved when the Leesiders garnered the Division 2 League title, but she and a handful of other colleagues from the All-Ireland-winning Minor Championship side have made the step up and with that sort of ability to be called upon, they will be hard to beat.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Arts Centre launches new programme  ","story":"\t\t\t\nDOWN Arts Centre has announced its latest arts programme.\n\nThe new-look autumn guide, covering September to December, is brimming with a huge range of exhibitions, music, theatre, comedy, talks, classes and workshops.\n\nA ied season of live performances gets off to a comedic start with Owen O\u0026rsquoNeill\u0026rsquos new one man play, \u0026lsquoTen Songs To Die For\u0026rsquo.\u0026nbsp Also billed for the autumn are local comedians Shane Todd with his hilarious brand new stand-up show \u0026lsquoHero\u0026rsquo and Kevin McAleer \u0026mdash a comedy apparition not to be missed.\n\nMusical highlights include celtic and country classics including the Leading Ladies, charismatic singer songwriter Grainne Duffy and the ever popular Illegals with Niamh Kavanagh.\n\nNew to Down Arts Centre is local musician Tony Wright who will provide a unique night of story and song with a killer sound track.\u0026nbsp\n\nAlso not to be missed is The \u0026lsquoLegend of Luke Kelly\u0026rsquo, a spectacular tribute to the greatest folk artist of the 20th century, a definite must-see for all fans.

community service dedicated to eighth century replica monument  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA REPLICA of St Patrick\u0026rsquos Cross at Down Cathedral has been formally unveiled following a cross-community dedication service.\n\nThe replica eighth century cross \u0026mdash which stands an imposing 12-feet high and weighs five tonnes \u0026mdash is located just yards from where the patron saint is buried on the historic Hill of Down, with the Mournes in the distance providing a stunning back.\n\nBishops from the Church of Ireland and Catholic communities took part in last Friday afternoon\u0026rsquos service and they were joined by local clergy and monks from the Holy Cross Monastery in Rostrevor.\n\nFriday\u0026rsquos ceremony had been pencilled in for earlier in the summer but had to be postponed following the discovery of medieval human remains while contractors were preparing the ground for the installation of the cross, carved from Mourne granite excavated from Thomas\u0026rsquo Mountain high up in the mountain range.\n\nThe intricately designed structure was manufactured by the Kilkeel firm of McConnell Brothers and representatives from the firm were joined by Church of Ireland Bishop Harold Miller, Down and Connor Bishop Noel Treanor, the Dean of Down, the Very Rev Henry Hull, and members of the Cathedral Chapter.\n\nDean Hull, who led the short service of dedication, said the ceremony marked a very special day and was delighted a number of people heavily involved in the project were present, including Dr Mike King from the Down County Museum.\n\nDean Hull explained that Dr King played a key role initiating the replica cross project, financed by Newry, Mourne and Down Council.\n\n\u0026ldquoMike worked hard along with others to bring about the cross which replicates one that was in place around 800AD. Inside Down Cathedral, there are some old stones and through research, Mike discovered they were in fact part of the original St Patrick\u0026rsquos Cross, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoIn some old drawings of the cathedral you can see broken portions of the cross which marked nearby St Patrick\u0026rsquos grave. Obviously this old Celtic cross had fallen down and was broken with some pieces placed inside the church.\n\nDean Hull said Dr King, with the help of Philip Armstrong, redesigned the replica cross based on drawings and sketches and eventually, through the help of McConnell Brothers, the imposing replica cross was produced.\n\nThose in attendance at the dedication ceremony were told that the source of the granite used to make the replica cross was most probably the same as that from which the original was made, Dean Hull said the cross is at the heart of the Christian faith and that because Jesus died on the cross, people are reconciled to God and find forgiveness.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoWe are reconciled to God but through the cross we can be reconciled to each other, with the cross reminding us of our common faith as Christians. It is lovely today that Christians from different traditions are able to stand around this cross today because the cross is a symbol of Christian unity and it reminds us that we have one faith, he continued.\n\nDean Hull said when people look at the cross and reflect back to Patrick and to the days of an undivided church, they are reminded that despite all has happened, \u0026ldquowe are still one in Christ with the cross a symbol of what people have in common\u0026nbsp \u0026mdash Christian unity.\n\nConcluding before the start of a short religious dedication service, Dean Hull thanked the Lecale and Down Historical Society which helped with the restoration project and the former Down Council and current Newry, Mourne and Down Council for their support.\n\nDean Hull\u0026rsquos words were reflected by Bishop Miller, who said a prayer as part of the dedication service along with Bishop Treanor.\n\nThe clerics then gathered at the base of the sculpture where they placed their palms over the imprint of a hand in the cross\u0026rsquos base and were joined by Bishop Grant Le Marque, former Anglican Bishop of the Horn of Africa, who was visiting the Down and Dromore Diocese.\n\n\u0026ldquoHere we have Christian hands together, said Bishop Miller, encouraging other people from all over the world to visit the cathedral to make the same gesture.\n\nHe added: \u0026ldquoThe cross is never just something at a distance it is the very heart of our faith in Christ, our relationship with Christ and our salvation in Christ.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Delight after new Translink bus service is extended to Clough  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA NEW bus service is operating in Clough.\n\nThe Downpatrick to Ballykinlar service is being extended to Clough from this month.

A super effort. The only other male junior, Oliver Robinson,\u0026nbsp did a double. The U-13 boys 100m in 15.15 and a strong run in the 1500m saw him finish in 5\u0026rsquo40.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\n\nA promising start to his career as a Year 8 athlete. The sole senior of the night was Davy Foster in 1,500m running a fast 4\u0026rsquo50. Maybe Davy will stick to these faster shorter distances to try and keep up with his daughters.\n\nGirls galore\n\nTwo of the aforementioned Foster girls competed in the U-11 girls\u0026rsquo 1200m. In a competitive race Jodi hit the finish line in 4\u0026rsquo17 then not far behind was the always-smiling Kari in an impressive time of 4\u0026rsquo43. They both also tried the long jump.\u0026nbsp\n\nIn the U-13 girls\u0026rsquo 100m EDAC had three runners. Heat one saw Kara Trainor finish well in second place in 15.01. In heat three we saw Lauren Madine win in\u0026nbsp a new PB time of 14.16 and Anna Gardiner come home in 15.67 with Lauren taking the overall win and gold medal for the distance.\u0026nbsp\n\nKara\u0026rsquos time placed her sixth overall. It was pleasing to see them follow the lead of the younger girls by trying a field event as well, in this case the discus. Commendable enthusiasm!\n\nFab five females\n\nThe U-13 girls\u0026rsquo 1500m saw a large field of 14 athletes, five of which were EDAC runners and which also included the top class City of Lisburn athlete Katie McCleery, who is ranked in the top 10 in the UK for her age category over this distance.\u0026nbsp\n\nMcCleery made her intentions clear from the start as she immediately hit the front. Lauren decided to track her run and see how she went and was closely followed by Anna Gardiner, Lucy Foster, Kara Trainor and Emily Burns.\u0026nbsp\n\nAll five EDAC athletes looked superb over the three and three-quarter laps. On the last bend McCleery tried to hold on, but Lauren moved up another gear waiting and cruised past to take first place with 100m to run and crossed the line in a superb time of 4\u0026rsquo57 which is a PB by 18 seconds and puts Lauren 8th in the UK for her age for 2018. That was an outstanding performance.\n\nAnna Gardiner was the next EDAC athlete to finish in 5\u0026rsquo05 which is also a significant PB.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\n\nThe PBs were coming thick and fast as Lucy Foster came home in 5\u0026rsquo17 which was 12 seconds better than her previous best. The ever-improving duo of Kara Trainor and Emily Burns battled it out to the end and almost needed a photo finish to separate them \u0026mdash their times were\u0026nbsp 5.41.34 and 5.41.90. This race was really exciting to watch with brilliant efforts from all the girls. By filling first, third, fourth, seventh and eighth places, in the field of 14, there is surely cause for celebration at the depth of talent within the EDAC ranks.\n\nIcing on the cake\n\nLast girl to race was U-15 rising star Kirsti Foster in the 1500m. The girls were mixed with a strong U-15 boys\u0026rsquo field and Kirsti did not take the race lightly, despite carrying a slight niggle from hockey.\u0026nbsp\n\nShe dominated the girls\u0026rsquo field and beat some of the boys too in her race to finish a strong 5\u0026rsquo12 to provide a fitting finale to the night and to the track season.\n\nLaganside 10k\n\nPaula Radcliffe was obviously the star of the show, but EDAC had a few sparkling performances themselves.\u0026nbsp\n\nPaul Lloyd led the troops home and despite narrowly missing out on the elusive sub 40, he felt that he had given his all in the fast-paced race. His time of 40.08 is tantalisingly close and his consistency has to be commended.\u0026nbsp\n\nPhillip Vint, another man who rarely misses a weekend race, came next in 41.10 with Liam Keenan not far behind in 41.36. Gavin Hynds in 41.45 had plenty to celebrate as this was a PB and proves that marathon training doesn\u0026rsquot always slow you down and must be great morale booster for him.\u0026nbsp\n\nDeirdre v Paula?\n\nDeirdre Weatherall finished in 42.08 and was slightly disappointed with that. However, she was cheered up by the fact that Paula Radcliffe had decided to run in the pack and was seen in chat with ious folk en route.\u0026nbsp\n\nThis gave Deirdre the chance to have a sprint finish to the line with the women\u0026rsquos marathon world record holder.\n\nPaula also has European and World Championship medals too numerous to mention as well the accolade of four times Olympian. Many would defer to such greatness, but Deirdre is well known for her fresh-faced enthusiasm and took no time to decide that having a result sheet with her name one place ahead of Paula\u0026rsquos was an opportunity unlikely to be repeated.\n\nAfter reading on Wikipedia that Deirdre is described as the foremost tragic heroine in Irish legend and probably its best-known figure in modern times, she could probably argue that Paula should have been in awe of her rather than the other way round.\n\nThis is the spirit that is key to Deirdre\u0026rsquos rise in the ranks and long may it continue.\n\nLiam Smyth \u0026mdash veteran in terms of longevity in these events clocked up a respectable 44.42. Behind him another historic event was unfolding.\n\nGavin McConvey came in to the finish line in 53.51 declaring that the last time he saw a sub 54 minute 10K was in 2004. Not bad going Gavin, keep it up.\u0026nbsp\n\nRoisin Gaffney, another reliable EDAC runner, finished in 54.09 and for once found, despite her love of the sun, that the heat was oppressive and was glad to be done.\n\nDonal at the double\n\nDonal Smith headed to Kildare on Saturday to take part in an a 5k run in aid of the Injured Jockeys\u0026rsquo Fund - but having discovered that there was a 10K race nearby he decided in true horse lovers\u0026rsquo form to hedge his bets and do both. He did say afterwards that it was a lot for one day and he may need a few rest days, but knowing Donal, that won\u0026rsquot last for long.\n\nNo one from the club made their way to Derry on Sunday morning for the Waterside Half Marathon which this year was also the NI and Ulster Half Marathon Championships.\n\nWhat\u0026rsquos ahead?\n\nThis will probably come too late for regular readers of the weekly papers, but Tuesday is the night for the annual trek to Castlewellan for the lung busting, for some, Mill Hill Mile Challenge.\u0026nbsp\n\nThis is a race that is, or should be, on everybody\u0026rsquos bucket list so if you\u0026rsquore going don t\u0026rsquo forget you must register online beforehand.

They were freed on bail later that evening.\n\nAiring last November, the Alex Gibney-directed documentary was a hard-hitting examination of claims of state collusion in the murders, which broke new ground by publicly naming alleged suspects.\n\nThe six men killed in Loughinisland were Adrian Rogan, Barney Green, Dan McCreanor, Eamon Byrne, Malcolm Jenkinson and Patsy O\u0026rsquoHare.\n\nClare Rogan, wife of Adrian Rogan, said the families would not be deterred in their search for truth and justice.\n\n\u0026ldquoWe are shocked and appalled at the arrest of two journalists related to the No Stone Unturned documentary, which exposed the extent of state collusion between the state and loyalist paramilitaries in Loughinisland, she said.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe British government have systematically denied and continue to cover up its role in the murder of six people in the Heights Bar.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoThese arrests show the lengths of desperation that the British government and state forces are prepared to go to, in order to stifle the truth about what happened in Loughinisland.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe Police Ombudsman\u0026rsquos report into Loughinisland murders was one of the most damning expositions of state collusion in mass murder ever published.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoOur families, and many other families across the island, some of whom have been denied the basic right to an inquest, have campaigned for many years against state collusion and for truth and justice for our loved ones.\n\nSouth Down Sinn F\u0026eacutein MP Chris Hazzard has thanked those who came out to stand with the Loughinisland families on Friday night.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe arrests of two leading investigative journalists who helped lift the lid on collusion following the 1994 Loughinisland murders through \u0026lsquoNo Stone Unturned\u0026rsquo has re-opened many wounds for the families of those murdered, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoThat truth would never have been possible without journalists like Barry and Trevor who acted always with integrity.

The boys stumbled on a giant puff-ball while holidaying at Cargagh Lane, Ballyculter, and since then they have discovered that it makes good eating.\n\nIndeed, they have already munched their way through half of the puff-ball, a perfect example of Calvatia Gigantea, which is very rare.\n\n\u0026ldquoAt first we had no idea what it was, said 14 year-old Michael. \u0026ldquoWe thought it had come from outer space.\n\nSixteen year-old brother Peter said: \u0026ldquoCuriosity forded us to taste it and we have now eaten more than half of it.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt is delicious when you try it in egg and breadcrumbs \u0026mdash it tastes like mushrooms. We were extremely lucky to find it because this has been a very bad year for fungi.\n\nDOWNPATRICK \u0026mdash The Eastern Health and Social Services Board has renewed its commitment to the building of a new general hospital in Downpatrick.\n\nSir Thomas Brown, Board chairman, told a local deputation this week that plans for the hospital had not been abandoned.\n\nSir Thomas gave the assurance to a five-man deputation from the Down District Health and Social Services Committee.\n\nAfterwards Mr O F Adams, committee chairman, said he accepted this as a \u0026ldquoclear statement of Board policy which will remain unaltered unless specific proposals to the contrary are put the Board.\n\nAnother committee member, Mr Cecil Maxwell, said he was \u0026ldquovery satisfied with the outcome of the meeting.\n\nNEWCASTLE \u0026mdash The special fireworks fiesta at Newcastle on Friday night drew big crowds to Donard Park. The display was organised by Down District Council as part of their Percy French festival and more than \u0026pound500 worth of fireworks were used.\n\nBilly Caughey was the master of ceremonies for the evening and introduced several bands who played selections prior to the display.\n\nCROSSGAR \u0026mdash Mr James Mejury, founder of the family motor business in Crossgar, died at his home this week. He was 80. A native of Ballyronan, Derry, he moved with his family from Belfast to Shrigley after the outbreak of the last war and began his business in Killyleagh Street, Crossgar.\n\nHis conscientiousness at work meant that 12-hour days were common place. The solution of customers\u0026rsquo problems were his delight.\n\nDRUMAROAD \u0026mdash Gene Fitzpatrick, voted Ulster\u0026rsquos top cabaret artist, is to compere a grand iety concert organised by St Patrick\u0026rsquos Scouts and Cubs in Drumaroad Hall next Tuesday night. A top class line-up includes Fergie, Houl Yer Whist, Dominic Hughes and a local supporting cast.\n\nDuring the past few months the boys and their leaders have been very busy. The cubs spent a very enjoyable five days at Clare, while 30 miles away the scouts were on a ten-day camp at Birr, Co Offaly.\n\nThe scouts won the Diocesan Shield and represented Dromore diocese a few weeks ago at the Melviin Trophy in Dublin where they gained considerable success.\n\nKILLINCHY \u0026mdash A harvest fair in Killinchy Presbyterian Church Hall on Saturday afternoon raised \u0026pound1,300 for church funds. There was a high standard of entries for the ious classes for bread, cakes, fruit and vegetables and sales were also good.\n\nThe crowds seemed to enjoy a iety of sideshows on the football pitch where darts shooting and beanbag games contributed to the fun.\u0026nbsp\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Local minister gets in tune for marathon on the organ  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA PLUMP cushion will be the Rev Mark Spratt\u0026rsquos best friend as he undertakes a 12-hour music marathon.\n\nThe minister of Kilmore Presbyterian Church, near Crossgar, is once again preparing to play an organ and piano non-stop to raise funds for the church.\n\nHe will be playing hundreds of psalms, hymns, spiritual songs, church music, classical pieces along with wedding favourites from 9am-9pm on Saturday, September 15.\u0026nbsp\n\nIt will the second time since 2014 that Mr Spratt will take to the keyboards to raise money for the Drumaghlis Road church where he is Director of Music.\n\nA renowned organist, Mr Spratt told the Recorder: \u0026ldquoI did a 12-hour marathon before in 2014 and that time we raised just over \u0026pound2,000 for the Women\u0026rsquos Association and other church activities.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis time it\u0026rsquos to raise money for repairs to the church\u0026rsquos roof and other property matters and I\u0026rsquoll be happy with whatever the community is able to give.\n\nMr Spratt has successfully completed two other music marathons for Bangor Presbyterian Church where he was part of the ministry team before he moved to Kilmore.

She said people expect the politicians to be at work and backed the clamour for them to engage in meaningful talks on the way forward and get back into government.\n\nThe Dundrum woman said the event, alongside those held in other towns, was designed to send a clear message that people have had enough and want the MLAs back in Stormont working for those who voted for them.\n\nJoan hopes the We Deserve Better campaign is something that will focus a lot of minds, explaining people are aware that some MLAs who want to get back to Stormont as part of a functioning Executive, but this has not been possible as result of the political leadership vacuum due to the DUP and Sinn Fein being unable to agree a way forward.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt feels as if we have been putting up with the impasse but there is momentum for change. Hopefully this movement will be able to grow and put some pressure on the politicians to get back, she continued.\n\n\u0026ldquoA lot of people have said that maybe we should do this again and last week I encouraged those in attendance to take photographs and send them to their MLAs to show the support there is for them to get back to work.\n\nJoan said the simple message from last week\u0026rsquos meeting to the politicians was: \u0026ldquoWe elected you, get back to work.\n\nShe added: \u0026ldquoThe politicians are in effect our employees, we elected them to do a job for us and at the minute they are not delivering.

His greeting at a youth Mass in Galway where he declared \u0026lsquoyoung people of Ireland, I love you\u0026rsquo became a stand out moment, replayed on television on countless occasions since. My own childhood involved attending Mass at the Graan and serving as an altar boy in St Michael\u0026rsquos Church in Enniskillen with many of my primary school classmates. We were lucky too that for much of my childhood our pastoral leadership was led by Father Brian D\u0026rsquoArcy who preached a message of tolerance, diversity in the church, compassion for the complexities of life and the experiences that shape them. Even when a stream of disturbing disclosures arose that challenged the Church and its response to clerical abuse and coverup, Father Brian\u0026rsquos consistently strong and unequivocal demand for accountability, truth, justice and recovery for victims offered a pathway for the institutional church to remain connected with its members.\n  My own life journey took me to Dublin in 1999 and what I discovered very quickly was that the message of compassion, openness and truth that I had faithfully followed and listened to every Sunday did not reflect the views and actions of the hierarchy either in Ireland or in the Vatican. Like many people of faith I found this not just challenging but chilling.\u0026nbsp\n  As I embarked on a legal career in human rights law I spent many days hearing story after story of adults recalling their experiences of abuse and brutal actions at the hands of clergy and lay people at the Residential Institutions Redress Board.\u0026nbsp\n  Those stories will never leave me. Sine then, the full impact of church and state abuse has come through my office door clerical sexual abuse, church authority cover ups, Magdalene laundries, the cruel operation of mother and baby homes, where many single mothers lost their babies to a regime of illegal adoptions and told they had committed a mortal sin. We have been witness to church intolerance towards lone parents, women, advocates of shared education, access to certain healthcare services, separated couples and the LGBT community.\n  And so when I was given a ticket to the Pope\u0026rsquos Mass last weekend I thought long and hard about attending. I could see that for many people of faith this was an opportunity to gather as a church community and celebrate their faith, their God and their Christianity.\u0026nbsp\n  On the other hand I could see that for many victims of the Church the Pope\u0026rsquos visit resurrected those deep seated and enduring feelings of hurt, trauma and damage that has never been properly addressed with actions.\u0026nbsp\n  So many victims have said to me that the abuse itself is not nearly as bad as the culture of cover up, the systemic efforts to sideline and disbelieve victims, to hide evidence and wrongdoers from a process that would lead to truth, justice and love for the victim and their families.\u0026nbsp\n  So I ended up last Sunday foregoing the papal Mass and standing for truth with nearly 10,000 other citizens in Dublin City Centre. It was a personal choice. I am glad now I made that choice. I am sad that the Vatican and the leadership of the Church still don\u0026rsquot get it. Still don\u0026rsquot acknowledge that abuse wasn\u0026rsquot simply perpetrated on children by individual wrongdoers but that their many violations were facilitated, covered up and enabled by Bishops, Archbishops and Cardinals all the way to the Vatican.\n  Ireland has changed utterly since 1979. It is reflected in all the societal changes that have taken place in the last thirty nine years. It is reflected in the fact that the people of Dublin were much more interested and welcoming of the Queen than the Pope.\u0026nbsp\n  It turns out that Pope John Paul was wrong when he said back in 1979 that he loved the young people of Ireland. The Church showed anything but love to all those they have hurt and damaged.\u0026nbsp\n  They have even now showed a lamentable lack of capacity to lead, to acknowledge, to take ownership of their failings and to take actions rather than deliver honeyed words. This visit was a massive opportunity to reverse the damage caused. The opportunity has been missed.\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

This year the RUAS are delighted to welcome Paul Trapp, who is travelling from Wisconsin, USA, to judge. The event is also a great chance to interact with 200 dairy related trade exhibitors on the most relevant technological advances, difficulties and solutions in the industry. \u0026nbsp\n  Rhonda Geary, Operations Director, RUAS said: \u0026ldquo2015 saw the move of Winter Fair to our new purpose built exhibition venue, Eikon Exhibition Centre at Balmoral Park. The move has worked brilliantly and attracted one of the largest attendances to date. In preparation for the 31st Winter Fair we have increased the livestock accommodation and now have stalling, washing and milking facilities for 200 cattle. There is 4750m2 of exhibition space and a full house of 200 trade stands. \u0026nbsp\n  During the Winter Fair there is a busy Seminar Suite with talks presented every half hour from 11am until 3.30pm.\n  Dr. John Bailey from AFBI will speak about better phosphorous management, Bobby Irwin of United Feeds presents a paper on getting the lactation to the right start and Roberta Simmons of the YFCU and Barclay Bell, President of the UFU will speak about succession on farms.\n  CAFRE\u0026rsquos Martin Mulholland will be advising on feed efficiency this winter, making optimum use of grass silage \u0026nbspwhile Christopher Osborne form the UFU will speak about dairy commodity markets and the prospects for 2017.\n  Dr. Sam Strain and Sharon Verner from the Animal Health and Welfare Northern Ireland will look at improved biosecurity and BVD while Jessica Sloss from Red Tractor, speaks about the farm assurance scheme.\n  The live calf rearing demonstration will be making a return for the 2016 Show. \u0026nbspGorteade Cow Care owned by Barry O\u0026rsquoLoughlin will be displaying a fully functioning calf igloo with veranda and Heatwave ad lib calf feeder.\u0026nbsp\n  One of the innovative technological features at next week\u0026rsquos Winter Fair will be the Northern Ireland launch of the CalfApp and Calf Cloud by Volac which won gold at Eurotier in Hannover. It gives information about changes in drinking pattern and fluid intakes and monitors calf health.\n  The launch of the Winter Fair was held at Draynes Farm, near Lisburn, where Michael Drayne led a tour of agricultural journalists and industry representatives around his farm and milk bottling plant. The milk botting plant began when his father began with a horse and cart. Now the business has a fleet of vans distributing milk and dairy produces to customers in four counties. However their products are supplied to customers across Ireland through the Henderson Food Service and other companies.\n  The borehole gives Draynes Farm a constant supply of water which is also useful to soften the mains water for washing.\n  A 50KVA solar panel plant has been installed on the roofs of some of the buildings.\n  Draynes Farm processes 5m litres of milk per year and operates Monday to Friday with their own supply of 1.2 million litres of farm milk held over the weekend until the beginning of a new week. A total of 35 staff are employed in all departments.\n  The Draynes Farm dairy herd uses three Lely Astronaut A4 milking robots. The cows visit the robots on average 3.1 times per day averaging 33 litres per day with some exceeding 50litres.
