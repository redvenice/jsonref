From Anne Booth and Robyn Wilson-Owen, Bloom (Tiny Owl) is a story of hope, persistence and finding love in small things. Every day, a little girl speaks to a beautiful flower on her way to school, telling it how much she loves it, until the possessive gardener sends her away. Unable to understand why the flower then closes, he tries to make it bloom again – but only when he asks the girl’s advice will the flower again share its beauty. Wilson-Owen’s delicate illustrations are the perfect complement to Booth’s poetic text, with echoes of The Selfish Giant.The tender simplicity of the tiny While We Can’t Hug (Faber), meanwhile, pairs Eoin McLaughlin’s text with Polly Dunbar’s rosy-cheeked images. Hedgehog and Tortoise, who love hugging, are not able to touch for a while – but Owl reminds them that a wave, a funny face, a letter, a shared song or a painting are wonderful ways to show love.There is heartbreak and resolution in The Perfect Shelter (Little Tiger) by Clare Helen Welsh and Åsa Gilland, in which two sisters create a blissful den in the woods. When one sister gets ill, the other feels sad, angry, sometimes overwhelmed – but eventually they make another perfect shelter somewhere new in this hope-filled book.John Bond’s single-minded bunny returns in Mini Rabbit Must Help (HarperCollins). Mini Rabbit is determined to post Mother Rabbit’s very important letter, but first he must pack his snack – and his slime. Will he catch the bus in time? There are eyewateringly bright landscapes, a comic series of misadventures and a final sting in the tale.For five-plus, especially those feeling restless, the Little People Big Dreams Journal (Quarto) invites children to draw, colour and catalogue their strengths and ambitions alongside images and quotations.

Make the days count.”Children who like to travel via books will enjoy Maggie Li’s Big City Atlas (Pavilion), an absorbingly detailed guide to 28 world cities accompanied by a cheery penguin tour guide and boasting a nice balance of funny trivia and weightier facts.\u0026nbspPoetry lovers of all ages, especially those with a lunar fascination, must snap up Dom Conlon’s This Rock, That Rock (Troika). It commemorates 50 years since the Apollo 11 landing with 50 poems dedicated to the moon – dazzlingly playful and thought-provoking, with atmospheric illustrations by Viviane Schwarz.\u0026nbspEight-plus readers with a taste for adventure and science will immerse themselves in the Uncommoners author Jennifer Bell’s exciting new Wonderscape (Walker). When an explosion startles Arthur, Ren and Cecily on their way to school, they don’t expect to be swept into an adventure game on a ship captained by Isaac Newton. Guided by heroes including the environmental activist Wangari Maathai and Mary Shelley, the three must play their way home in order to save their future.From the debut author Elle McNicoll comes A Kind of Spark (Knights Of), the powerful story of an autistic girl called Addie and her determination to win a memorial for the women executed as witches in her small Scottish village. McNicoll, who is neuroergent herself, evokes Addie’s kinship for the women who “didn’t fit” with vivid immediacy, as well as her bond with her older sister. This intensely readable little book punches well above its weight.\u0026nbspFinally, Kacen Callender’s poignant King and the Dragonflies (Scholastic) is a story of grief, growth and hard-won understanding.

Leading crime writers reveal how they came up with their most famous creations, what it’s like to live with them over decades and if they’ll last the distance“I’ve been doing it 24 years now and I couldn’t do it any more,” says Lee Child as he hands over the reins of his Jack Reacher series to his brother Andrew Grant. He’s not the first to tire of his most famous creation. By 1938, Agatha Christie had grown entirely sick of Hercule Poirot, asking: “Why did I ever invent this detestable bombastic, tiresome little creature? Eternally straightening things, eternally boasting, eternally twirling his moustache and tilting his egg-shaped head.” And nearly 50 years earlier, Arthur Conan Doyle was equally wearied by Sherlock Holmes: “I think of slaying Holmes … winding him up for good,” he told his mother.Creating a long-running series featuring a much-loved character can be both a blessing and a curse. As time passes in the real world, the writer has to decide how to deal with a fictional timeline. Is it best to age a hero in real time – Ruth Rendell had Inspector Wexford still solving crimes in his retirement – or to let the world move on but keep your hero young, as Patricia Cornwell does with Kay Scarpetta, who remains around 40 years old for ever ? And how does the character develop as social mores change? Writing about police can be a challenge now. As Attica Locke says of her Texas ranger in her Highway 59 series, “writing a cop is something I thought I’d never do”.In the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests, John Connolly argues that “a mistrust of the police – a mistrust of the establishment, really – runs through the private eye genre”. “The police represent the law, but the private eye represents the possibility of justice, particularly for those for whom the forces of law and order refuse to stand up: women, minorities, immigrants. For me, a conception of social justice lies at the very heart of the genre.” Sara Paretsky sees crime fiction as the form “where law, justice and society come together in a natural way – that is, you can write about them without being polemical or didactic”. Child says his plots have always “included corrupt, negligent and deficient police departments and federal agencies”. Twenty years ago, though, “people would write to me and say, c’mon, that wouldn’t happen. Now no one says that. Clearly reality is slowly dawning.” Then there’s the question of how, or indeed whether, to draw a series to a close. Christie kills off Poirot in Curtain, and Conan Doyle did his best to wave farewell to Holmes, sending him plummeting to his doom down the Reichenbach Falls.Readers were distraught the author quietly rejoiced – “I hold that it was not murder, but justifiable homicide in self-defence, since, if I had not killed him, he would certainly have killed me” – but by 1903, he’d resurrected him, with fans discovering in a new short story that Holmes hadn’t really died – he’d merely been fooling his enemies.To avoid any such reversals, the late Andrea Camilleri wrote the final novel in his Inspector Montalbano series 14 years ago, giving it to his publisher for safekeeping: “When I get fed up with him or am not able to write any more, I’ll tell the publisher: publish that book. Sherlock Holmes was recovered … but it will not be possible to recover Montalbano. In that last book, he’s really finished.” But what of today’s detectives? How do their authors coexist with their characters over years – sometimes decades – and what lies ahead?If you study English literature you’re taught the character must change and go on a journey. I want very much the opposite. As a reader I love series for the familiarity, so I’ve put effort into stopping Reacher from changing.The best thing to do is not to get too close to the character. I need to like him less than you’re going to like him. That’s what keeps him alive and honest and authentic. There are many series where the author clearly falls in love with the character and starts to be too protective. I’ve always been very hardhearted. I don’t like Reacher that much I’m in total control of him. I’m the only person in the world he’s scared of.Initially I had the idea that in the last book, he would die in a blaze of glory or noble self-sacrifice. I even had a title, Die Lonely. But it dawned on me that would be gratuitously cruel to the reader who had supported him for so long.So I thought maybe we could have a metaphorical version, where he’s heading for the bus depot to leave town but stops and thinks, “maybe I’ll stay here and adopt a dog”. But I moved through that and thought: “Let’s let Andrew keep it going.” He really is me 15 years ago, still full of energy, still full of ideas, and so I think this is the perfect solution. I will always continue to tell these stories in my head.I never had any intention of doing a series. And then I went to work in television and it was fun to hang out with characters for a long period of time. Darren was the last piece of the puzzle. I was infinitely more interested in location and in telling a very Texas story, in particular a story about Highway 59, which is a route through the eastern part of the state. All of my family are from little towns along this highway, and my idea was that every book would be about a different town and a different crime, but I didn’t have anyone at the centre of it, and I had to figure out who that would be.So I’m thinking of a character who could be involved in crimes across the state. Who could that be? Is it a lawyer, is it a PI, who has that kind of range? And I went: “Oh! A Texas ranger – that’s literally what they do, range.” Once I knew I wanted to write about a ranger I had to educate myself, and get comfortable with the idea. I’m married to a criminal defence attorney, I’m a black American, my whole thing was that I don’t see the world through a cop’s eyes, what am I going to do? Then I read a book called Ghettoside by Jill Leovy, which is about police failing to catch and prosecute people who commit crimes against black life. In it there’s a black cop who works with the police in south LA, and his approach is: “I wear the badge in order to protect the black folk who live in this neighbourhood.” And when I read that, it’s like my mind could shift, and I could understand writing a black cop. I also gave him all the same ambivalence I have about law enforcement.I have a sense this series is four books. It blows my mind to think of writing these for ever, it terrifies me. I know what Darren will be up against in book four, but I don’t know how the whole thing ends.I had the idea for a psychological profiler. I thought if I made the liaison in the police a female officer that would give it added tension. At the time there really weren’t many women in senior positions. I didn’t know at that point it would be a series but as I progressed through the novel it seemed to me that not only were Tony Hill and Carol Jordan interesting characters, the jobs they did meant I could draw in other topics.If I’d thought it was going to be a long-running series I would probably have set it in a real city. Writing in a fictional city gives you lots of opportunities – when you want a premier league football team you just stick it down in the middle – but you never have that same sense of solidity. But I made the decision because I knew that this novel was going to be critical of the police and I really didn’t want to get done for speeding.I feel an affection for Tony and Carol, a sympathy for what they’ve been through. Who knows how old they are? They’ve probably aged about one year for every book, rather than in real time. It’s fiction and I can do what I want. I guess they’re about mid-40s.The one thing I’ve promised readers is that I won’t kill either of them. But I’ve never had an overall arc. Can you imagine being Sue Grafton and sitting down and writing A Is for Alibi and thinking: “Well only 25 to go?”The spark for Charlie Parker was an image of a man going to visit the grave of his wife and child, flowers in the back of the car. For me the big thing was letting the characters grow older. You can take the Patricia Cornwell route, which is to keep your characters a certain age all the way through but the series can’t really develop if you do that because you’re just going to keep repeating certain tropes, the character is set in aspic. The other option is to do what somebody like James Lee Burke has done with Robicheaux, who ages with the writer effectively. Robicheaux is into his early 70s, so the books become meditations on mortality.As the characters age, the nuances, the textures of the books change. There’s a misapprehension about mystery fiction, which is that people read for plot. They don’t – the plots really don’t change much. There’s a murder. There’s an investigation. There’s a solution, however partial. Plot is what characters do and language is the expression of that, and so for a mystery series what keeps people coming back is the pleasure of spending time with those characters.If my doctor said don’t go booking any holidays after November, I know how I would choose to end the series. For the moment, though, I still like looking at the world through his eyes.I had this idea for three women who were doing environmental surveys in Northumberland. I killed one of them off, and about a third of the way through, because I don’t plot at all, I got really stuck. That’s when Vera appeared like magic, through a door in a funeral home, fully formed with her name, looking more like a bag lady than a detective. I hadn’t planned her. But of course characters don’t come out of nowhere, so I think she came from the spinsters that I knew in the small town where I grew up – very strong, very competent, didn’t care what they looked like.Once she’d appeared I wanted to write more about her, and about the places in the north of England where I lived: the vast empty inland hills, and Hadrian’s Wall, the beaches and castles and post-industrial communities. Vera’s definitely not ageing in real time. In my head she’s in her mid-to-late 50s and she was that 21 years ago. The world around her goes forward in real time.With my Shetland Island series, I knew that I was only going to do eight books, because Shetland doesn’t have that variety of landscape or community and there are only 23,000 people who live on the islands. You can’t kill them all. So I knew that towards the end of books seven and eight, I had to be thinking about how it was going to end.I would struggle to write just one series with one character. I can come to the end of a Vera book now and think I’m going to find out a little more about Matthew Venn, my new character. He comes from north Devon, which is where I grew up. He is gay. He’s got a husband, and he comes back to Devon because of his husband’s job. It was a bit daunting starting a new series, but I’m just starting the second Matthew book. It’s great to write about a happy marriage. I’ve never done that before.Ex-con Zaq Khan and his best friend Jags are drawn from me and my friends. I grew up in Ealing and hung out a lot in Southall. It was a really colourful area, and there were two authors who made me think I wanted to set a story there. The first was Elmore Leonard his heroes aren’t always policemen, sometimes they’re just ordinary people, sometimes they’re small-time criminals, and I thought “Wow, you don’t have to write from the detective’s perspective if you’re writing a crime novel.” And then I read Walter Mosley’s Easy Rawlins books, set in the black community in LA in the 1940s, and I saw you could tell those stories through a character of colour. It was the sort of book I was hoping someone would write, but no one had done it.Even though Zaq is done for a violent crime, he’s the main character and I wanted people to root for him and empathise with him. It was about allowing the reader to see that he’s not a bad person and he has a moral code he wants to do the right thing. I wrote Brothers in Blood as a standalone. It got rejected by about 30 publishers, basically down to it being too Asian, so I self-published it, and then it got picked up by Dialogue.The second book, Stone Cold Trouble, is out in September. It’s set a few months after the first. When I’m writing the next book I’ll have to be referencing the lockdown and Covid-19. I may do that but in a very light way.I had an idea of writing about contemporary Edinburgh and trying to show its darker side, and I thought a cop was a good way to do that. By book number four, I thought: Oh, this guy is sticking around. Mainly because I enjoy spending time with him – he’s a complex character. And because a detective is a very good way of looking at society. I wanted to take on politics and issues to do with people feeling dispossessed or disenfranchised. Rebus would allow me to look at the world, from the people who’ve got everything down to the people who’ve got nothing.I made the decision early on that he would age more or less in real time. And there are problems with that, as I’ve discovered. He had to retire. He retired twice, in fact. He retired at the end of Exit Music because he had hit the mandatory retirement age for police detectives in Scotland. I found a way to keep him in the force working as a civilian for a while. Then even that had to come to an end.But I keep finding things for him to do. I’m writing one at the moment. He’s got health issues now but he’s still getting into trouble and mysteries are still there to be solved. Maybe this is the final book. I have no idea until I get to the end. It was something that I had wanted to do ever since I first read Raymond Chandler. In six of his seven novels, it’s a woman who’s sexually active who turns out to be the main villain. And I just was tired of this femme fatale idea in a lot of crime fiction, that women who use their bodies to try to get good boys to do bad things inevitably come to a terrible end.I was working in the corporate world in the financial services industry, for a real pill of a guy, and I was looking out at the dead trees in Grant Park and the balloon over my head was saying something unprintable while my lips were saying something sweetly soothing to the male vanity. And at that moment, really, quite truly, VI came to me. I thought, she is someone who says what’s in the balloon over her head. She is not interested in making nice. She’s facing the challenges that women did face in the 1980s, being pioneers in occupations that had been shut off to women over the centuries.When I started, I wanted her to age in real time. As time passed, I’ve stopped her age around 50 because I just don’t want VI to be helpless. As the world becomes an ever more shocking place, it’s important to me to have someone who’s really vibrant and not going to be mowed down. Physically she has to be very tough as well.People in the industry talk about the character being your “brand”. Well, thank you, she is not Pampers or a tampon, she is a person alive in my imagination, not a commodity to be bought and sold by other people.I always knew I was going to write a series. I wanted to look at the period of British rule in India between 1919 and independence and in my head, rather naively, I thought, right, I’m going to do one a year: 1919 all the way to 1947. Four and a half books in, am I going to? I doubt it.Sam Wyndham and Surendranath Banerjee came to me as a package. That’s partly because they’re really just different aspects of my own personality. Sam is my jaded Scottish side even though he’s English he has a very Glaswegian, gallows humour. Suren is my Indian side, my more questioning side. When you grow up between different cultures, you have this inner dialogue that just goes on constantly.I’ve always known that there will be a falling out between the two. I’d like to see Suren as the first non-white chief of police in Calcutta, in independent India, but there’s a long way to go before that. The story I really want to tell is 1943, the story of the Bengal famine. I don’t feel confident enough to write it yet. It’s such an emotive subject, I think you need to have a readership with you, to tackle issues like that.When I started out, Sam and Suren were essentially tools to tell the story of colonial India but they’ve become so much more to me. I never thought I would fall in love with them the way I have. I’m not sure I could kill them off, it would feel a bit like amputating part of myself. I’d like to see them have a long, happy retirement one day.Nobody expected that the television series Prime Suspect would become such a monster hit. I went to the Met and said: “Do you have any high-ranking female plain clothes detectives?” I was told “Yes, we have three.” One of them, a DCI, was called Jackie Malton, and I followed her for months. She was determined I would get it right, and she opened up avenues which, without her, I never could have got to. Now I’m writing a new series about DC Jack Warr. You don’t want to create something that everyone says: “Seen it, heard it, boring.” I began to notice how often in fiction we were seeing troubled heads of departments: a DI with a marriage problem, a drink problem, drugs problems, his wife was leaving him, his daughter was a heroin addict. So I wanted to create somebody who was a perfectly happy, lovely guy. No problems whatsoever, a great relationship, adores his parents. I wanted to write a character who you saw going through the process of learning to be a detective.I was a journalist covering real detectives, and at night trying to write fiction about detectives. In 1988, I spent a week with the head of the homicide squad in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The next thing I wrote ended up being the first Harry Bosch book. I loved reading series, so writing one was my goal in life. I really set the character up so that I could write more about him. I gave him an unsolved mystery in his life, his mother’s murder.I’d clearly said in that first book that he was 42 years old, and my plan was to write in real time so he’d really age. If I’d had any inkling that I’d be writing about this guy for 25 years or more, I would have made him younger. But I’ve stuck with that and now teamed him up with a younger detective, I think that’s one way of keeping it going. He’s not going out to pasture, but it’s been five years or more since he’s actually been a real cop, because it’s not believable that some 70-year-old guy would still have a badge and a gun and work for the LAPD.Really I wanted the first Tom Thorne book, Sleepyhead, to be about the victim of a particular crime, so I just sort of dumped this copper on the page without thinking too much more about it. I never dreamed I’d be writing about him 20 years later.Maybe I should have made him a little bit younger but I thought he’d be easier to write if he was the same age as me. I’ve slowed him down a bit. Also I’ve stopped specifying when a book is set because I realised quite early on that you can get into trouble. If you’re writing about a real city – the books are set very much in a real London – you can be quickly overtaken by events. The book I have coming out this year is a prequel, so I’ve been able to go back and set it in the mid-1990s, with Thorne as a much younger man. That’s been hugely liberating, not just because of the fact that I’m writing about a world that isn’t dominated by CCTV and the internet.It will end when I’m not interested in writing about it. I don’t see him running an antiques shop in the Cotswolds but I would fight shy of killing him off. He’s someone I’m incredibly close to and I don’t want to think about his end more than I do my own. If he was going to go, he would be listening to George Jones or Hank Williams while watching Spurs. I was on my way to Australia back in 1997, and I had promised an editor I’d write something. She wanted me to write about my band at the time but I had five weeks in Australia and thought I would write a short crime novel so I needed a protagonist for that. I sat on the plane to Sydney and came up with Harry. I didn’t put much analysis into it. It was more instinct – I knew I wanted a character that was partly a traditional, hard-boiled detective, combined with characters I knew from my own life. I had no idea he would be with me for so long – I thought it was a one-off.It’s easier the more I write about him – I get to know him and I know my readers know him. There will always be emotional and psychological contradictions which make him interesting to me. As you get older you’re more interested in your old friends than getting new friends, and it’s a bit the same with Harry.I have a clear idea for the storyline of his life.

Covid-19 reveals how vital social institutions have been demolishedIn recent years loneliness has been much in the news. Prior to Covid-19 it was regularly described as an epidemic. Now that we are in the middle of a real global health crisis the language has changed. For some people, most likely those with secure incomes and comfortable homes, social distancing and enforced isolation bring “solitude”, a much happier condition than loneliness. The contrast is insisted on, and social media crowded with people discovering the joys of solitariness. Sara Maitland, who lives alone in rural south-west Scotland, has instructed us to “savour solitude, it is not the same as loneliness”.The solitudeloneliness distinction is modern, a product of the late 19th century. For millennia “solitude” did service for both. In 1621 the Oxford don Robert Burton, in his Anatomy of Melancholy, summed up centuries of thinking when he described solitude as a scene both of “profitable Meditation and Contemplation” and debilitating depression. The ambiguity was not incidental even the most beneficial solitudes were said to carry serious risks. Religious solitaries were prone to acedia (a mixture of ennui and gloom). Reclusive scholars and poets struggled with “fevered imaginings”. Robinson Crusoe’s solitude was marked by stoical busyness and spiritual enlightenment, but also by overwhelming misery at his aloneness. Solitude is both eternal and protean it is far more various in its forms and meanings than is captured by the solitude-loneliness opposition. It is also political – and never more so than now.In 1951 Hannah Arendt produced one of the most compelling versions of the solitude-loneliness distinction. In The Origins of Totalitarianism she described solitude as being “alone together with oneself”, a self-companionship rooted in the thinking process which, following Socrates, she defined as internal dialogue. The rise of totalitarian terror replaced this “two-in-one” solitude with loneliness, as terrorised people became “isolated against each other”, and deserted by their alter egos as rational thought gave way to ruthless totalitarian logic: a simultaneous loss of “self and the world”. Totalitarianism fostered an absolute loneliness: “destructive of all human living-together”.For Masha Gessen, writing recently for the New Yorker, Arendt’s account has a “piercing resonance” with our current situation. While the US is not a totalitarian regime, at least not yet, Gessen nonetheless finds much to fear politically from quarantine isolation which, as in Arendt’s account, has disconnected her from her thinking self, leaving her in a “sad and stupid” state of lonely passivity. Public space has become treacherous collective action very hazardous. “What happens to politics at a time like this?”In the weeks since Gessen’s article appeared, the police killing of George Floyd has brought angry multitudes on to city streets all over the world. The majority are young, many are wearing face masks. They are nonetheless risking their health black lives matter too much to stay away. And what does their bravery earn from our UK government? Yet another official inquiry, the seventh in two decades, this one headed by a Johnson loyalist who declares that institutional racism does not exist. Again: “What happens to politics at a time like this?”For Arendt and Gessen, loneliness comes when people lose contact with their thinking selves, when terror and panic replace solitary thought. But this is too cerebral. Liveable solitude is underpinned by care. The classic account of this comes from the British psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott. In 1958 Winnicott described the capacity to tolerate solitude, or even to enjoy it, as a developmental achievement of early childhood, acquired through the experience of receiving care from a parental figure, usually the mother. As a small child matures, this caring figure is internalised to serve as an inner presence, a self-companion, when the child is alone. To be “alone” is a “two-in-one” condition, to adapt Arendt’s phrase. “The state of being alone,” Winnicott writes, “paradoxically always implies that someone else is there.” For a person who has had no reliable carer, solitude is unendurable. “A person may be in solitary confinement and not be able to be alone. How greatly he must suffer is beyond the imagination.”Today many people are suffering in just this way. Some have never received the care that makes aloneness tolerable, while many others find the care-giving presence crumbling under the pressure of enforced isolation. People with chronic illness or disabilities homeless people and those with psychological disorders older people in care homes: here we have a loneliness crisis. The historian of loneliness Fred Cooper warns that for many Britons Covid-19 is an “existential threat”, pitching them into deadly isolation. Cut off from friends, family, anyone who makes them feel part of a shared humanity, people are losing a lifeline with vital psychological significance. “Support bubbles” may be mitigating this for some, but they bring risks and are not available to many of the neediest. Mental health providers are hearing much about this suicide rates are climbing.But there is another level of loneliness today, one affecting everyone in this country, as we look to our government to get us through this crisis, and find no care at all.As with Trump in the US, the care-lessness of Boris Johnson, Dominic Cummings and their cheering squad can be seen as an “existential threat” to every Briton. Tens of thousands have not survived this threat, and many more will die from it or emerge damaged in a host of ways. The unconscionable delay in lockdown, followed now by rapid easing contrary to scientific advice infected hospital patients returned to care homes the fiascos surrounding PPE and test-and-trace the disproportionate number of deaths of BAME people, many of whom work in frontline services: the realities are terrifying, and the terror goes deep, exposing our vulnerability not just to disease but to the heartlessness of the powerful. The dangers of solitude are real. Care, past and present, mitigates them. Contemplating the likelihood of a second wave of Covid-19, we are collectively lonely. Long years of neoliberal austerity have paved the way, asset-stripping the NHS and care services, hollowing out the welfare state.The pre-Covid loneliness “epidemic” was mostly a proxy for this assault on care. According to David Vincent, author of the recent A History of Solitude, rates of self-reported loneliness among older people have changed little over the last 60 years. There has been an increase in life changes (of jobs, marital status, geographic location) that can trigger bouts of loneliness, especially among younger people, but even here the figures are far below those publicised by media and government. So why the headlines about loneliness as the “plague of our times”? The answer lies with the demolition of services and institutions that have the public good as a core value, from youth clubs and day centres to public libraries and, above all, “social care”. The hypocrisy of governments that talk about loneliness while systematically destroying key sources of social connectedness is breathtaking.Now we have a genuine loneliness crisis. And in this crisis, we are turning to each other. The huge upwelling of mutual aid and volunteer action across Britain has been wonderful to witness, as civil society seeks to provide what the government does not, from food and other essentials to psychological support and PPE for health and care workers. Black Lives Matter has brought solidarity to the streets. Kindness to strangers is everywhere, except among those whose commercial interests this government serves – corporations, banks, profiteering landlords – who are urged to show “compassion” at this difficult time. Flying pigs come to mind.Shokoufeh Sakhi is an Iranian exile in Canada who in the 1980s spent eight years in a Tehran prison, two in solitary confinement. Sakhi has blogged about the emotional connections that allowed her to survive those years. Locked down recently in Toronto, she has reflected on how caring about people during the pandemic has meant physically distancing ourselves from them while remaining aware of their needs: “When was the last time we collectively stayed conscious for this long about the effects of our actions on other people? Can we give that proper recognition? Recognising the presence of an ancient feeling, our care for others? In this are the seeds of our empowerment and a global solidarity.”• Barbara Taylor is principal investigator on the Wellcome Trust funded research project, Pathologies of Solitude, 18th–21st Century."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/606251d90364b42e2749cfe3d7907bcdb302b90d/0_923_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=316ea882b18fbf49247efd1826e9a9b7","title":"back to work businesses gear up for life after lockdown","story":"Concerns over personal safety remain for some traders, while others show steely optimismPubs, restaurants, cafes and hairdressers in England will reopen on 4 July and business owners have been preparing with a mix of excitement and trepidation.“We’re in the entertainment business,” says chef Mitch Tonks. “We create restaurants so that people can relax and have a wonderful time.“I said to my team, if the regulations are goggles and masks and gloves, we will not open a single restaurant until that time has passed. I don’t want it to be a functional experience.”Tonks co-owns the award-winning Seahorse in Dartmouth, Devon, and eight Rockfish restaurants across the south-west of England.Last week he had a group Zoom call with Boris Johnson to talk about the challenges facing rural businesses: “We were all saying the same thing: we are used to looking after people. Just let us do that.“I felt like he was listening. He was very interested to hear what we had to say. My thing was: you need to tell people they can go back to pubs and restaurants as soon as possible. You need to tell us what the rules of the game are as soon as possible.”On 4 July, the Plymouth Rockfish will reopen as “the canary” to test customer and staff reaction to the changes he and his team have made. The menu will be written on the paper tablecloths. “We have cards that the guest fills in and hands to the server so it makes it good fun, like a dim sum restaurant.” A watchful “covid monitor” in a white T-shirt will guide customers and clean constantly. Customers on the covered terrace will order and pay via an app. The menu is shorter, to make preparation simpler for the kitchen staff.”They are aiming to do 80 covers rather than 120. “We are probably not going to be turning tables very quickly so in revenue terms we are going to be looking at half what we normally take.” It’s all about winning back diners’ confidence, he says – and making it a better place for his staff.The Seahorse will open on 9 July for dinner outdoors: “We’ve created a beach club-type outdoor space on the embankment looking over the river: 24 covers, dinner only, bar selling rosé, chilled music.” Rockfishes in Exmouth, Exeter and Poole will reopen around 20 July. They’ve invested in marquees and stretch tents to protect diners from the unpredictable British summer.All 174 staff have been on furlough since they closed on 20 March. Tonks has been locked down with three of his five grown-up children in Brixham, next to the fish market that supplies all his restaurants. His daughter Sadie teaches yoga on Zoom and he’s been cooking with his son Ben, a sous chef at the Seahorse.“There were times of depression. Now I’m euphoric. I used the time to read a lot and establish new habits. I never really had a rhythm to my day in the past. I just got up and went to work early all day. I really have loved the time. It’s been a chance for the world to pause. You just can’t overestimate those benefits.”“It’s been fraught over the last few months,” said D’Lima, who runs a pub close to Heathrow airport, near Hounslow. “I’m looking forward to seeing everyone and doing a job and service that I love, but I’m apprehensive as to how I’ll survive.”With his trade closely related to that of the airport, which will not return to full capacity for some time, the landlord said that government support schemes have only allowed him to stay afloat without earning an income.From next week, customers will be greeted at the door and directed to tables but he expressed fears that some people may not be comfortable sharing their details with him, as mandated.“I wouldn’t want to give my personal details to strangers,” D’Lima said. “But we’ll have to, though we’re unsure about how to quite to do it. We’re seeking advice from the brewery.”And he questioned how any pub could be profitable if they needed to be full to do so. “Strict guidelines might mean having to turn people away if we’re busy and that’s not what anyone wants.”He is looking forward to the reopening, but still laments the closure of pubs in the first place: “A sensible environment for people to responsibly drink was taken away.”When the lockdown hit, nearly all of Borg-Neal’s 984 staff were furloughed but most are now preparing to return for the grand reopening on 4 July.Even so, he says, reopening with restrictions on capacity due to physical distancing is a voyage into a perilous unknown.“We’re better suited than most because we have big pubs with a lot of tables and it’s sit-down oriented. We’re not in London and we’ve got big gardens. But I see it being a slower recovery for some parts of London and cities.Precautions such as these are one reason why he thinks the government should look to ease restrictions further. “Pubs are safer than what’s happening now, with people gathering in public places with booze, with no toilets, no hand sanitiser and so on.“The restrictions are understandable but we don’t know how necessary they are. We operated until 20 March and not one of my employees caught Covid-19. We had implemented extra cleaning and hand sanitiser.“If we can show quickly that everything is working well and there isn’t a spike in cases, they could ease restrictions so that other jobs can be saved.”Borg-Neal fears parts of the pub industry will not survive but says the government has options available to save jobs in the hospitality industry. “The biggest single thing they could do is to get rid of VAT on food. That would also save much of the restaurant business, which is run on very tight margins.”Sachdeva is nervous about reopening next week. The shop and cafe had not been open long and was only beginning to become successful before being forced to close. “There’s a lot of anxiety around, it won’t be the same,” she says.“There’s still a lot of fear, especially for the elderly and before lockdown it was mostly older people who would come into the cafe.”Describing lockdown as “nerve racking”, Sachdeva says she started a takeaway cake service but had to stop as there weren’t enough regular orders – leading to high wastage – and that she was worried about footfall.The cafe normally has seating for about 24 people, including some outside space, but Sachdeva – who secured a grant from one of the government’s schemes – thinks she will have to reduce that by half to follow the 1-metre distancing rule.And she is acutely aware of risk for business owners. “You need a high footfall to get back on track and see any profits, and then there’s the fear of a second wave,” she says. “I am concerned about my safety, but we can’t afford not to open.”“We’ve had to create a priority booking list,” says Fox, of his main clients. “Everyone wants an appointment on the first day back.”He says that the salon struggled to get support throughout the lockdown and eventually received a bounce-back loan. Now, attention has turned to making everything as safe as possible.“We’ve looked at what nurses wear, since we touch the head, and have gone for visors, gloves, aprons and masks as a standard, with the client also wearing a mask, a freshly laundered gown and shoe covers.” Staff and clients will also have a temperature test, he adds.However, Fox believes the government would have been wise to allow the return of salons and barbers earlier – due to the huge demand for haircuts.“Everyone is desperate for a haircut and some hairdressers have been breaking the rules. The longer the government left it, the more they pushed it underground,” he says.In just over a week during March, Côte transformed itself from a 96-strong brasserie chain to a home delivery service. As lockdown kicked off, 100 staff started creating ready meal versions of customer favourites including beef bourguignon and chocolate mousse, and set up online sales of wines, fresh meats and cheese.Alex Scrimgeour, the chief executive of Côte, says they have taken thousands of orders, and have also had inquiries from supermarkets and others wanting to take on the range. But the initiative has made only a small contribution to offsetting the closure of Côte’s restaurants for three months. The vast majority of its 3,000 staff have been on furlough as the group battles to stay afloat.Scrimgeour says it will take time to bring staff back. “People’s habits have changed in lockdown. I don’t think the minute restaurants open they will be filled with people coming in the same numbers as before.” He believes the elderly, vulnerable and those who are just afraid will take some persuading to return.Scrimgeour says government guidance is vague and leaves questions about the details of operating. “A lot of things are not thought through, and it’s going to be very challenging,” he says.More restaurants will gradually reopen through July and August but Scrimgeour says it is “up in the air” whether all 96 outlets will finally reopen. “It depends on trade and conversations with landlords,” he says.“The government has done an excellent job of terrifying the consumer,” he says. “It is going to take a long time to heal.”Joliffe says he was given the go-ahead to reopen on Tuesday. “There’ll be lots of maintenance work, grass and hedge cutting to be done.”He and his wife, Sharon, did not qualify for the furlough scheme as they work seasonally and were set to take up their new job at the beginning of April.To make ends meet, while receiving jobseeker’s allowance, Joliffe applied for at least three jobs a week and renewed his forklift licence. But he could not find a job until this week, and now, like delayed buses, two have come at once.“It’s taken me all this time to get a part-time cleaning job in a supermarket and now I don’t need it,” he says, adding that he was looking forward to returning to work outdoors.“Its bit of a godsend now, as we were thinking if lockdown went further into the season, everything would have taken a big turn. So it’s a good result today.”While all cafes can reopen from the first weekend of July, many of those with outdoor areas have been serving drinks and snacks for several weeks.“We pulled ourselves up by the bootstraps, worked 19-hour days, created an NHS flower display, cracked the tunes on and smashed it to best of our ability,” says Peacock.Being forced to close at the beginning of lockdown was distressing for her, since the cafe is not just a business but the bedrock of a community.“People are still saying ‘We’re so delighted to see you back Kate, it’s like a sense of normality returning’,” she says, adding that she plays Bob Marley’s track Three Little Birds about 20 times a day.“The fact my music is on, the doors are open and kids can enjoy an ice-cream, it makes people realise everything is going to be all right in the end.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea71181729c5c6e10f5513e6d6fae1987783c8ca/0_165_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d659f21e2af53b88951f1b85c903b088","title":"britain public toilets coronavirus private interests","story":"Coronavirus has highlighted the lack of facilities – and revealed a nation in which private interest trumps public comfortIt was early in my son’s life and I was killing time with him in Bristol, a city we didn’t live in, while his mother was with his grandmother in hospital. This was to become a common state of affairs in the months that followed, with many hours wiled away walking the streets of St Pauls or the paths of Brandon Hill.On one of those first excursions we found ourselves on Clifton Down, a bottle of expressed milk in my bag. In the first stages of fatherhood, I was just getting used to changing his nappy anywhere and everywhere – and realising that, with my own weak bladder and history of irritable bowel syndrome, I was also in need, I mashed “public toilet” into Google Maps and found that there was one half a mile away.What I found when I got to this place, my baby sleeping in his buggy, were some ruined, Grade II-listed Victorian urinals, still apparently in operation. Stepping into them – which wasn’t easy – was like discovering a lost settlement, a place whose once grand edifices had been eaten away by rubbish and weeds. In short, here was a public convenience that had been more or less abandoned, like so many others.The state of a nation’s public services, from its health system all the way to its toilets, tells you a lot about its priorities. As with so many aspects of our society, the coronavirus pandemic has revealed to many what was already obvious to plenty: that after 40 years of neoliberalism and a decade of Tory austerity, Britain is a place in which private interest trumps public comfort.Coronavirus closed the UK’s public toilets – and many remain closed – but with the average English council already only running 15 toilets per every 12,500 citizens, what’s noticeable is how unnoticeable these pandemic closures seem. What has changed dramatically in the months of lockdown is that the cafes and shops that largely provided people with access to a toilet – usually following the spending of money – were suddenly out of bounds and the absence of toilets was clearly exposed. Public toilets have long since fallen victim to government cuts, with the assumption being that the private sector would profit from meeting the need. Now the pandemic has ripped off this private plaster and the wound beneath is revealed.Hoping to provide some light in the darkness, a series of apps, including Lockdown Loo, have sprung up, crowdsourcing information on toilets that are currently available to use – be they reopened council-run toilets, or ones in pubs, cafes and train stations. The Lockdown Loo map has been visited almost 600,000 times since its launch in mid-June, and it is instructive to note who is accessing it. “We didn’t realise at the start,” co-founder Thomas Riley told me, “but the site seems most popular with women, those who are older, have medical conditions and young families. We list places with baby changing facilities.”Roaming the streets of Bristol with my son, before and during the pandemic, I’ve found myself doing what many others can’t do so easily: I’ve broken the law by pissing in parks and scrapyards, my son in his buggy or strapped to my chest an unwitting accomplice to my heinous crimes. If I wasn’t an able-bodied cis man, this would either be much harder or it would be impossible. If I weren’t a white man, I would most likely attract far more attention and would, if discovered by law enforcement officers, find it far harder to talk my way out of trouble. If I was homeless, and had no access to a public facility, it would be used as an excuse to remove me from public land.A society’s provision of public toilets may seem like a small thing but it cuts to the heart of almost everything. When out in the world, at some point everybody needs to use the toilet. Yet so often in this country we have to pay money for the privilege of doing something we have no real control over, particularly – and really this list could be endless – if we are disabled, or on our period, or pregnant, or with a baby, or suffer from a digestive disease.What we have in the demise of public toilets in Britain is a story with which we are becoming more and more familiar – a story about a place that sold off public space to private interests. In much of the rest of the world, the idea that you would have to buy something or even simply feel ashamed to ask to use the toilets in a cafe or some similar establishment is anathema. In the UK, a nation of shopkeepers, the birthplace of modern capitalism, we are used to seeing signs that say: “Toilets for paying customers only.” Workers in cafes, pubs and restaurants are often told not to let anyone use the toilets for free – though the idea that this is a luxury one must pay for seems now to have trickled down to all of us.• Oscar Rickett is a journalist and writer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/185f5d8db953310dfe67c12c02bb603aa52857d4/0_82_6016_3609/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73324e3e9ce732d0ca334990b68f2a03","title":"tell us how do you feel about cinemas museums and galleries reopening","story":"We’d like to hear your thoughts about returning to cultural venues in England after the coronavirus lockdown Cinemas, museums and art galleries in England will be able to re-open on 4 July after the easing of lockdown rules.Theatres and concert halls can also open their doors again, but only to show previous works on a screen.

Exam results are published in August, meaning those who missed out on their required grades face a frantic scramble to join clearing and find another course. Teacher grade predictions are notoriously inaccurate, adding to confusion for students and admissions staff.Under the proposed change, school leavers and other applicants would only proceed with final university applications after their exam results, meaning they would have a clear understanding of the courses for which they qualify.Ministers including Williamson are understood to believe that post-results applications would benefit disadvantaged young people, including students from black and minority ethnic (BAME) groups.Predicted grades are often unreliable. Research from the Sutton Trust has shown that disadvantaged students tend to receive lower predicted A-level grades.Ministers also want to give the government more direct oversight of the entry path to higher education, doing away with what they consider to be a bureaucratic tangle of predicted grades and conditional and unconditional offers that has grown up around the current system.It comes as the business secretary, Alok Sharma, is to announce extra financial support for universities, including £200m to fund research posts likely to suffer from cuts stemming from the coronavirus pandemic, and loans to cover losses from falling international student fees. Further support, bringing forward additional research and development funding that was budgeted for next year, is expected to be announced soon.Williamson and the DfE are preparing to publish new proposals for skills, further education and apprenticeships in the next few weeks, culminating in a white paper intended to rebalance post-18 education away from universities and higher education and towards further education, which is being given a higher priority by both the department and Downing Street.For the higher education sector, a strategy paper is being drawn up to include the push towards post-qualification admissions and other proposals aimed at improving the prospects of disadvantaged applicants.A number of vice-chancellors also fear that the government wants to clamp down on student numbers taking humanities courses, especially those with a track record of low graduate earnings.A document discussed within the DfE this month, seen by the , outlines a number of models for ministers and policymakers. All the options assume post-qualification admissions as a starting point, suggesting that Williamson and others are determined to make the change that the sector has resisted for many years.The model of pre-qualification applications and post-results offers is also closest to that likely to be proposed by the Universities UK group, which is also holding its own consultation. A DfE spokesperson said: “We do not comment on leaks and will not be drawn on speculation.”Those analysing the plans suggested that moving the start of university terms to January would promote fairness and transparency as well as a “strong social mobility narrative”. The long gap following the end of exams would allow universities to run courses to prepare students for higher education, as well as opportunities for applicants to attend open days and consider their options.Supporters of the move to a January start said it would have less “negative impact” on the mental health of students, although would also leave many at a loose end in summer and autumn, “particularly for those disadvantaged students who are likely to need to take paid work in this time”.Of the other options, the proposal for a 12-week application window between July and October would pile pressure on schools, exam boards and Ofqual, with less time to teach A-level and other qualifications and less time to mark exams, “and we do not know at this stage whether this would be feasible,” the analysis noted.The DfE push for post-qualification admissions is the latest in a long line of attempts going back to 2006. On each occasion, the status quo has remained intact after opposition from universities and school leaders. Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson’s chief adviser, is said to have opposed the proposals during his time as an adviser to Michael Gove at the DfE.Williamson’s efforts to press ahead with the reforms come amid government frustration with the Office for Students (OfS), the higher education regulator for England. In February the OfS launched its own consultation on the admissions process but that has since been paused because of the coronavirus outbreak, with no deadline set, leaving ministers with little to work on.Earlier this week Sir Michael Barber, executive chair of the OfS, announced his retirement when his term expires next year. Barber was keen to be reappointed for another four-year term but stepped down after the DfE’s unhappiness with the OfS’s performance became apparent.The new post-18 education policy proposals came as Williamson wants to move beyond the coronavirus pandemic aftermath, with measures to improve the status and attractiveness of further education, which it regards as a more cost-effective means of meeting the UK labour market’s skills shortage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68219b4efb61dd1d1676bb0db7238a633826e666/0_152_4287_2572/master/4287.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2fa93b27762c9bb4b9b22646d2ecf7de","title":"sevenoaks school rewrites predicted grades policy","story":" revealed teachers were asked to exaggerate projections for studentsSevenoaks school has rewritten its policy on predicted grades, it said on Friday, after the  revealed it had been asking teachers to exaggerate Ucas predictions for some of its lowest-performing students for many years.The development came after the  reported on Wednesday that the £38,000-a-year school’s staff handbook set out a policy of asking teachers to boost Ucas predictions for some of the lowest-achieving students each year to help them secure university offers.On Friday, the Charity Commission said that it would be “engaging” with trustees over “governance concerns” and Ucas said that it had issued the school with a reminder of its guidelines.The school – which says that it continues to “refute any suggestion that we would unfairly exaggerate Ucas predictions” – said that governors had reviewed its approach to predicted grades and it was now “implementing changes to the staff handbook so there can be no doubt that the school follows Ucas principles”.It is understood that the Charity Commission engaged with the school after a broad set of concerns including predictions were flagged to the regulator. The regulator is not directly responsible for exam issues. The school said it was “cooperating fully” with the body.Meanwhile, Ucas said that it had reminded the school of its guidelines after it was made aware of the school’s approach to predicted grades. This was understood to have been before the  report.The school documents seen by the  say that predictions for the international baccalaureate (IB) exams, which the school uses instead of A-levels, may be increased “to facilitate an application to a more selective universitycourse”. But the Ucas guidelines say that “predicted grades should be set in isolation of an applicant’s university or college choice(s)”.After the  story was published, parents and alumni received a letter from the acting headteacher, Theresa Homewood, seeking to reassure them over the school’s approach to predicted grades.While it did not dispute the details of the documents it said it wanted to “ensure there is no confusion as to our approach and processes”, and that the school “refutes any suggestion that we would unfairly exaggerate Ucas predictions”.But on Thursday it amended its position and indicated that it had inadvertently provided an incorrect figure, meaning it could not say that its predictions significantly outperformed national comparators that year. The school later apologised to parents for the error, which it said was “an honest mistake which we thought was correct at the time and was identified by us not a third party”.Amid warnings from academics and former teachers that such issues were commonplace in the private school sector, the Department for Education was also critical of the approach and warned: “Schools should not be inflating predicted grades … If this is not the case in any school, we expect them to change their policies.”The IB organisation, which regulates a separate set of predictions used to help set grade boundaries and not usually a part of university admissions, said it had examined the last five years of predictions and “confirms that all of these are in line with the … results achieved”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd49446539bba926e4bc85768093b81f9b30e221/0_214_6434_3860/master/6434.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a95c92d49872bacd6594d26875592fe","title":"payback time academics plan to launch free black university in uk","story":"Melz Owusu has crowdfunded £60,000 to start a decolonised institution. Will existing universities agree to help fund it? Melz Owusu has addressed research seminars, given a TED Talk and performed raps at academic conferences to try to decolonise higher education.But eventually the Phd student and former sabbatical officer at the Leeds University union came to a realisation: “I was like, hmm, this idea of transforming the university from the inside and having a decolonised curriculum isn’t going to happen with the way the structures of the university are.” After listening to the experiences of black students, Owusu began to see the problem was that universities are “built on colonisation – the money, buildings, architecture – everything is colonial”.This sparked the idea of a Free Black University to “redistribute knowledge” and place black students and a decolonised curriculum at its heart, rather than as an add-on. A GoFundMe campaign launched to finance the project has raised more than £60,000 since being set up this month, and won backing from both the University and College Union and National Union of Students.Owusu, who studied politics and philosophy at Leeds and will start a PhD in epistemic justice at the University of Cambridge in October, is “super-excited” at the success of the fundraising campaign, which aims to raise £250,000 to get the project up and running by the autumn.Most of the money so far has come from large numbers of inidual donations, ranging from £5 up to a few hundred pounds, with larger sums gathered through fundraising events.A key aim, however, is to persuade universities to “redistribute” money to the initiative by making an annual donation. The Free Black University will benefit their students and the community as a whole, says Osuwu. Campaigns along these lines by student activists have already started at Manchester, Manchester politan, Leeds, Exeter and UCL.Owusu sees this as a way not only for institutions to fulfil their promises to current black students, but as payback for the role they have played in the progress of racism, from benefiting from donations by slave owners to developing the study of eugenics.“A lot of universities we have seen with Black Lives Matter have been putting out statements about ‘we’re in support of black lives’ but we hear from black students all the time that they leave university traumatised,” says Owusu. “They fail. They experience racism all the time and the university doesn’t necessarily deal with that in the best way, or deal with it at all.”The idea for the free university had been brewing for a while but the recent surge of interest in Black Lives Matter, following the death of George Floyd, has brought it to a head, says Osuwu. “It feels like there is a growth of collective understanding of how deeply racism is entrenched in our society and realising how little has been done to challenge that at the core.“We decided to launch it at this moment because, one, it was ready to be launched and, two, the world’s eyes are on how do we actually make black lives matter, and one of the ways I think that will happen is through transformative education.”A small team of PhD students, recent graduates and student activists is putting together the project with the aim of having a legal structure in place before October. The plan is to deliver open-access online lectures exploring radical and transformational topics, build an online library of radical readings, develop a journal and podcast, provide a members’ space for black academics who need support, and hold an annual conference bringing together black radical thinkers.The curriculum will be centred around sociological, historical and philosophical approaches to black liberation but could move into more scientific and creative areas. Eventually, applying for degree-awarding powers may be an option, so long as those involved feel it is possible to do without becoming institutionalised.An important element of the project will be a space of community and care for black students, connecting them with black therapists, counsellors and community healers to offer a range of support. Members of black and minority-ethnic communities are at greater risk of developing mental health conditions, with some research suggesting that experiencing racism can increase the chances of developing depression.In the longer term, with enough money, the aim is to have a physical hub including teaching rooms, a bookshop, restaurant and healing areas in one of London’s most erse neighbourhoods, such as Brixton or Lewisham.While other races will be able to benefit from the open-access resources provided, the main focus of the project will be the black community, to make up for the fact, Owusu says, that “black students and the black community in general have not been able to access the current spaces that are within academia in a fair and consistent and safe way”.Jo Grady, general secretary of UCU, says: “The reason this campaign is really important and has received so much support, particularly from black scholars and students in academia, is they know how difficult it is and how damaging it is for your own sense of self worth to navigate through a university system that is at best ambivalent towards you, and at worst openly hostile.”Fope Olaleye, NUS black students officer, says: “We welcome the Free Black University as it will fill a gap for black students within a sector in urgent need of change.“We would invite higher and further education providers to put their money where their mouth is and financially support it.”But Deborah Gabriel, founder of Black British Academics, a network of scholars committed to enhancing racial equity in higher education, is not convinced it is the answer. “While there is certainly merit in finding solutions to the prevalence of white privilege and systemic racism outside the present system, I think that the notion of a ‘free’ university is perhaps overly optimistic,” she says. “Sadly, nothing is free and therefore such a model would be unsustainable.”A more realistic response, she says, would be to establish partnerships between UK higher education institutions and the historically black colleges and universities in the US, which, although founded as a result of segregation, now tend to produce black graduates who do better than those from mainstream institutions “because of the sense of worth, value and belonging”.A spokesman for Universities UK says many institutions are already developing a more inclusive programme of learning, which includes reviewing their curriculums and reassessing reading lists, as well as conducting liberation or decolonisation activities.But Owusu argues a more radical approach is needed – a “reprieve” and a space where the black community can find “access to a curriculum and teaching staff where everyone looks like them”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1e4f2bdba1b9408ff1951eba887769448748aef/0_0_5760_3840/master/5760.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=4f5fbec304a6c83f90a4a5ea8ee8ef97","title":"streaming gaslighting films the invisible man","story":"The Invisible Man, now available to stream, is the latest in cinema’s chilling tradition of psychodramas, from Gaslight to The Girl on the TrainIn the before times, when films were still being released in cinemas, The Invisible Man staked an early claim as the year’s best mainstream blockbuster. A steely, sharp-witted reimagination of a dusty old Universal fantasy franchise, Leigh Whannell’s film succeeded by flipping audience expectations of whose story to tell from its far-fetched premise: not the millionaire playboy scientist who discovers ingenious means of invisibility, but the ordinary, unassuming woman – played with frenzied commitment by Elisabeth Moss – he chooses to torment with these powers, in ways only she can see and feel.Now out on streaming and DVD, it’s a horror film that assumes the victim’s perspective in ways both bracing and classical: there may be a rich tradition of imperilled horror heroines pursued by violent, insistent men, but The Invisible Man builds her plight as a thoroughly era-attuned meditation on toxic masculinity and the difficulty that victimised women often have in being believed. Among its many virtues, Whannell’s film offers a perfect metaphorical primer on the concept of “gaslighting” – a buzzword often thrown about these days to refer to any form of lying. Its true meaning, that of undermining someone’s trust in their own sanity, is a rather more subtle, insidious process, presented here to maximum claustrophobic effect.Cinema, of course, has a rich tradition of gaslighting thrillers, beginning with the one that popularised the term in the first place. The Invisible Man carries no small amount of DNA from Gaslight, the 1940s psychodrama based on a Patrick Hamilton play, with its Victorian story of a dastardly husband manipulating his new bride’s psyche, beginning with the simple hiding and moving of objects in the home. It was filmed twice in four years: the original British version from 1940 (available on Amazon) is tighter and a little more ghoulish, but the 1944 Hollywood remake (on Chili) benefits from swoonily lush production values and the Oscar-winning emotional turbulence of Ingrid Bergman’s performance: gaslighting has certainly never been more beautiful than it is here.The gaslit woman has subsequently become a regular trope in Hollywood suspense and horror cinema. In 1964, Bette Davis’s doddery heiress was cunningly tilted toward madness by her wily, money-grubbing cousin Olivia de Havilland in Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte (on iTunes), a shadowy, slow-burning slab of Southern gothic that has aged rather elegantly. It was intended as a follow-up to Whatever Happened to Baby Jane until Joan Crawford declined to work with Davis again: instead, Crawford opted to play the hysterically gaslit, axe-murdering protagonist of Strait-Jacket (on Amazon), an unabashed B-movie that exploits the most lurid (not to mention ableist) possibilities of the premise: “Warning! Strait-Jacket vividly depicts axe murders!” screamed the poster, so you know where you are with this one. But it’s a high-camp hoot.Gaslighting stories aren’t limited to the thriller genre, of course. Humidly expanded by Tennessee Williams and Gore Vidal from a one-act play by the former, Suddenly, Last Summer (on Amazon) proved it could be the foundation of full-blown melodrama. Wealthy dowager Katharine Hepburn is so desperate to refute the mental stability of her psychologically fragile niece Elizabeth Taylor – and thus suppress a supposedly unsavoury family secret – that she pushes for a lobotomy. It’s deliciously overheated stuff, but the performances give it cruel emotional weight. Fast-forwarding to the 1980s, Overboard (on iTunes) attempted the unlikely balancing act of a gaslighting romcom, as snooty rich girl Goldie Hawn is afflicted with the kind of convenient movie amnesia that makes it a cinch for opportunistic carpenter Kurt Russell to swan in and claim he was her husband all along. The film relies on the couple’s sparky chemistry to make it seem cuter than it is: perhaps it should have been a thriller after all.Recently, the gaslighting trope has returned to its more familiar context. Angelina Jolie in Clint Eastwood’s handsome, mournful Changeling (on Netflix) and Emily Blunt in the glossy trash ersion The Girl on the Train (on Amazon) both get put through the ringer, encouraged by patriarchal authorities to disbelieve their own eyes. In Steven Soderbergh’s grimy, gripping Unsane (free on Amazon Prime), Claire Foy is scammed into entering an institution, made to wonder if she belongs there or not. The fast-progressing conversation around mental health is taking this subgenre into new, more nuanced territory – though as The Invisible Man shows tensely, movie gaslighters will thrive as long as women aren’t believed.Also new on streaming and DVDEurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga (Netflix) Since coronavirus put paid to this year’s Eurovision song contest, superfans of the annual kitsch extravaganza will have to make do with Will Ferrell’s all-star sendup.

Four years on from the victory over England in Nice, he talks about the experience of playing in the tournament.I didn’t feel nerves. There’s always a butterfly in the stomach but I was just looking forward to it. We were making history, so what’s the point in being nervous? You have to remember that it’s football. It’s the thing we love, and we were going to do it against the best teams in Europe, in a tournament, for the first time in Iceland’s history. That’s something to enjoy, not get nervous about.It was a bittersweet moment when I found out I was in the squad for Euro 2016. I was relieved to be included, but my uncle, Gunnleifur Gunnleifsson, was left out. It came as a shock. He was devastated and I was devastated for him. He had been in the national team for such a long time and the Euros would have been the perfect ending.Two years later, when the squad for the 2018 World Cup was announced, I was eating lunch at the salt-distribution company I was working at. I had moved back to Valur by then. They are semi-professional and training doesn’t start until five o’clock. I was going crazy at home and needed something to fill the day, so I got a job at my friend’s company.We opened the Euros against Portugal. I knew I would be up against Cristiano Ronaldo. I don’t usually focus too much on my opponent before a match, but I’d probably watched Ronaldo play about 300 times. My WhatsApp profile photo is of Ronaldo grasping at my shorts as I ran past him in a qualification match before Euro 2012. I might find a space on the wall for it when I quit football.The match finished 1-1. It was crucial to get that first goal of the tournament and finish the match feeling positive. If we had lost heavily … well, you just don’t know. It could have been devastating.We heard about Ronaldo’s comments when we were back in the dressing room. He had criticised our “small mentality” and defensive football. He said we’d go nowhere in the tournament. We laughed it off. For us, it was a case of “job done” when we heard that. We knew if he was complaining about our approach, it was because he was unhappy with the result and his own performance. We drove back to our training base at Annecy with any doubts gone. We felt like we could achieve something in France.A win against Austria sent us into the knockout stages and a match against England. Playing them in a tournament was a massive deal. The English league is the one Icelanders watch above all others. We all support a team. We all have an opinion. I’m a Leeds United supporter. It’s been a rough few years. Most of my family are Liverpool – my grandfathers, my mum, my wife. I have my dad to blame for following Leeds. He chose them in the early 1970s. English matches were available on Icelandic TV back then, but only one week after they were played. Leeds won the league in 1992, when I was eight. I thought they would be an easy team to support. My last trip to Elland Road was a 0-0 draw with Barnsley, so I got that wrong.There was no apprehension in the days leading up to the England match. Just excitement. Perhaps that was because of the clear message from our coaches Lars Lagerbäck and Heimir Hallgrimsson: England were overrated. It wasn’t about belittling or disrespecting England we knew they had good players. But Lars and Heimir made us believe that we, as a unit, were just as good. England might have the star players and the inidual skill, but we were the better team.Lars added fuel to the fire when he told us in a team meeting that Roy Hodgson had not been at the Stade de France to watch our final group match, instead choosing to take his assistant on a cruise on the Seine. We didn’t quite go as far as to stick it to the dressing-room wall, but we certainly used it as motivation.We made the worst possible start. After three minutes Raheem Sterling drifted inside off my wing. I should have kept an eye on him. I was ball-watching for a second too long. All of a sudden he was in front of me. He took the ball around Hannes and won a penalty, which Rooney scored. Maybe, at that moment, England thought the game was over and that goals two and three would come by themselves. Maybe they relaxed too much.Two minutes later, we were level. Our old friend came to the rescue: the long-throw routine. Aron threw it to Kári, who nodded it on for Ragnar Sigurdsson to score. It was important to get that equaliser quickly. It’s in our nature, too. We’ve always been good at resetting after we concede or score a goal. We reset and continue as if nothing had happened. A lot of small teams would have given up but it didn’t matter to us. We always needed to score at some point if we were going to win the game.We made it 2-1 soon after. Kolbeinn Sigthorsson scored after the ball slipped through Joe Hart’s fingers. Part of me wanted Hart to parry the ball because I was waiting just to his left, ready to score the rebound!We could see in the England players’ eyes that they were stressed and frightened. “What will the press say if we lose to Iceland?” That was probably what they were thinking. The first 80 minutes in Nice were the easiest of the tournament. Everything we did worked perfectly. Every single one of us played to our full potential. I felt like England were never going to score and that’s an amazing feeling. We limited them to long shots and created more chances of our own even I had one with my mighty left foot.Things changed when Marcus Rashford came on with 10 minutes remaining. He was fresh and our legs were tired. Rashford kept picking the ball up in the space between Joey Gudmundsson and me. I couldn’t go all the way up to meet him because I would have left space behind me, and if Joey had dropped deeper, their left-back would have been free. So every time Rashford got the ball, he was able to work up some pace. We barely managed to stop him. If I were the England coach, and it’s easy to be wise with hindsight, I would have brought Rashford on earlier. He blew up the game. If he had been there from the 70th minute, he may well have created something.But he didn’t. The final whistle blew. It was another of those blackout moments. We were in our own half when the referee ended the game and the Iceland fans were at the other end. I sprinted straight over and started celebrating. The English didn’t even cross my mind. One player came over to shake our hands and thank us for the game. I think it was Danny Rose. The rest just lay on the grass. The England shirt seemed pretty heavy.After the initial joy had faded it was time for the ‘Viking clap’. There’s nothing like it. It brings the players and the fans together in a unique way. There were some pretty good ones throughout the tournament but this one was special. I will never forget the Euros.

Will out of body gestation ever replace the experience of human birth?The lamb is sleeping. It lies on its side, eyes shut, ears folded back and twitching. It swallows, wriggles and shuffles its gangly legs. Its crooked half-smile makes it look content, as if dreaming about gambolling in a grassy field. But this lamb is too tiny to venture out. Its eyes cannot open. It is hairless its skin gathers in pink rolls at its neck. It hasn’t been born yet, but here it is, at 111 days’ gestation, totally separate from its mother, alive and kicking in a research lab in Philadelphia. It is submerged in fluid, floating inside a transparent plastic bag, its umbilical cord connected to a nexus of bright blood-filled tubes. This is a foetus growing inside an artificial womb. In another four weeks, the bag will be unzipped and the lamb will be born.When I first see images of the Philadelphia lambs on my laptop, I think of the foetus fields in The Matrix, where motherless babies are farmed in pods on an industrial scale. But this is not a substitute for full gestation. The lambs didn’t grow in the bags from conception they were taken from their mothers’ wombs by caesarean section, then submerged in the Biobag, at a gestational age equivalent to 23-24 weeks in humans. This isn’t a replacement for pregnancy yet, but it is certainly the beginning.The team who made these artificial wombs say they are driven only by the desire to save the most vulnerable humans on Earth. Emily Partridge, Marcus Davey and Alan Flake are neonatologists, developmental physiologists and surgeons who work with extremely premature babies at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). After three years of tweaking, their latest prototype is designed to give babies born too soon a greater chance of survival than ever before.The Biobag was born into public consciousness in April 2017, when the CHOP team published their research in the journal Nature Communications. They had found a way to gestate sheep foetuses outside maternal bodies foetuses that would eventually become lambs no different from those that had grown in ewes’ wombs. (Sheep are the go-to animals in obstetric research because they have a long gestation period and the foetuses are around the same size as ours.)Their invention consists of a replacement placenta: an oxygenator plugged into the lamb’s umbilical cord, which also removes carbon dioxide and delivers nutrients. Blood is pumped entirely by the beating of the foetus’s heart, just as it would be in the womb. The bag acts like an amniotic sac filled with warm, sterile, lab-made fluid that the lamb breathes and swallows, just as a human foetus would.CHOP’s communications department released a very slick short film, Recreating The Womb, to coincide with the paper’s release. There is not a foetus in sight. Instead there are neat diagrams of lambs in Biobag systems, slightly awkward footage of Partridge, Flake and Davey pretending to do lambless lamb research in a pristine lab and heartbreaking clips of impossibly small super-premature babies. Then there are carefully edited interviews with the team. “In the future, we envision the system will be in the neonatal intensive care unit and will look pretty much like a traditional incubator,” Davey says. The Biobags would be kept in a darkened environment to mimic the human womb, but the babies would be visible as never before: “Parents can actually look at their foetus in real time,” Flake adds.Normal human pregnancy is 40 weeks any baby born before 37 weeks is considered premature. The 23-24-week period is the border of viability, after which modern medicine currently has a hope of keeping babies alive, and doctors will attempt to resuscitate a newborn. To the NHS, a baby born dead at 24 weeks is classed as a stillbirth, whereas a dead baby born at 23 weeks and six days is a miscarriage. It is a brutal boundary.Incubators deal with some of the functions a premature newborn needs help with, but they don’t allow for the process of gestation to continue the Biobag does, treating the baby as a foetus who has not yet been born. Women at risk of going into very early labour could have their babies transferred into an artificial womb. It sounds extreme, but if it could mean a healthy future instead of illness and disability, who could deny it to them?The CHOP researchers want their device to be seen as ethically unremarkable. “Our goal is not to extend the limits of viability, but to offer the potential for improved outcomes for those infants already being routinely resuscitated,” their paper says. Extending the current limits of a foetus’s viability would create an ethical minefield. The legal abortion limit in the UK was brought down from 28 to 24 weeks in 1990 because advances in neonatal care meant foetuses born then were more likely to live. If artificial wombs help ever smaller babies survive, that could have profound implications for women. But women are not mentioned in CHOP’s work.The application to patent the Biobag, filed in 2014, is revealing. There’s no coyness about extending the limits of human viability here: it explicitly says possible “subjects” include “pre-viable foetuses (eg 20–24 weeks)”.I am not allowed to go to Philadelphia to see the team’s work. I so nearly was: Flake told me I was welcome, and we fixed a date. But then I was suddenly unwelcome. They want to be able to put human babies inside the Biobag within a couple of years, and the prospect of my visit had made the legal department twitchy. “There is a lot of caution to do anything that could jeopardise FDA approval,” a press officer told me.“This is not a new field,” says Matt Kemp, wearily. He runs the perinatal lab at the Women \u0026amp Infants Research Foundation (WIRF) in Western Australia, and his team’s artificial womb, Ex-Vivo Uterine Environment or EVE therapy, reported its first great successes in a paper published a few months after CHOP’s. The Biobag stole EVE’s thunder, and though Kemp makes little reference to it, he does sound somewhat narked.“The Karolinska Institute in Sweden published a paper in 1958 showing the use of this sort of platform with pre-viable human foetuses,” he says. “Groups in Canada in the early 60s experimented with sheep using this system. As early as 1963, the Japanese did seminal work in the field... Anyone who tells you they have done this for the first time is being disingenuous.” He doesn’t name names.There is no patent application for EVE (“It’s not patentable,” Kemp says, exasperated, “this has all been in the public domain since 1958”), so he is happy to answer questions – unless they are about the reason he decided to name his artificial womb after the first woman and the mother of mankind. He doesn’t want to get drawn into discussions about the symbolism of his work: “It was just a convenient way of describing it, I guess.”Kemp has been developing EVE since 2013, with researchers at Tohoku University hospital in Sendai, Japan. No official images have been released, but I found a YouTube video uploaded to the WIRF channel. It looked as if it wasn’t supposed to be online (and has since been removed): it was clearly filmed on a phone and had had only 56 views in a year. After CHOP’s carefully sanitised images, this 44-second clip made my jaw drop.It begins with beeping monitors in a neonatal intensive care unit a healthy heartbeat thumping in red on a black screen. The camera pans to an incubator beside it and instead of a baby there is a lamb, its chest rising and falling, lying in yellowish fluid in a transparent bag from which protrudes a mass of tubes, like veins filled with blood. This is what an artificial womb really looks like.The big difference between the work of WIRF and CHOP is the age of the lambs. The youngest foetus put into the Biobag was 106 days EVE’s was 95. Kemp is cautious about translating this into human terms, but it’s between 21 and 23 weeks. No one else has ever reported working with foetuses this young. And while CHOP grew their lambs for several weeks, often to term, and let some live, Kemp’s team kept them in the artificial womb for a week, then killed all of them to analyse their organs. He says they could easily have kept them alive for longer: “These are stable, healthy animals.”Even in a week, the lambs change dramatically, putting on weight and flexing and swallowing. “I’ve never been pregnant,” Kemp says, “but my wife says a foetus does those movements. It kicks, has a wee wiggle and goes back to sleep.”But clinical trials involving human babies are a long way off. “Anyone who tells you they are going to be doing this in two years either has a wealth of data that is not in the public domain or is being a bit sensationalist.”Is he talking about anyone in particular?“I am not,” he says firmly. “All the experiments to date have been done on foetuses that come from healthy pregnancies. That’s simply not the case for a 21- or 22-week human foetus. These are not going to be healthy babies. Getting this into clinical use is going to be incredibly difficult. To create an argument an ethical committee will buy, you’ve got to have an odds-on chance of delivering an outcome far better than the technology currently in use,” he says. “What is the likely first demographic? A very sick 21-week foetus.”This floors me. I lost a baby at 20 weeks – a son, who would have been my second child. There was nothing wrong with him. He was perfect. I got appendicitis when I was nearly 19 weeks pregnant. I spent a week in hospital while obstetricians and gynaecologists scanned and poked, trying to work out why I was ill. And then I went into labour. It happens: if you are pregnant, a serious infection can cause your cervix to open. In between contractions, the obstetrician told me if I had been 24 weeks pregnant, everything would have been different. Even though my son was a proper baby, who was wrapped up and given to me to hold, he died while I was giving birth to him. A miscarriage, not a stillbirth.This happened three years ago. Since then, I’ve had my appendix out, and had a daughter. But, like anyone who has lost a baby, I will always be haunted by what could have been done differently. If an artificial womb might save the life of a very sick 21-week-old foetus, could it also save a 20-week-old who was perfectly healthy, but unlucky enough to be inside a woman who was ill?I swallow hard. “If the first time you put a human foetus in your system,” I say, “it will be one not viable otherwise, questions will come up about pushing the boundaries of viability. Can’t you imagine parents of even more premature babies wanting their child to have any chance an artificial womb might offer?”“This is a really easy question,” he says. “This is a human – or a foetus, or a baby – that’s sick. If you had a three-year-old that was unwell and somebody was developing a new therapy, would you have any qualms about that?”“So there you go. From our perspective, this is no different.”In other words, so long as they have a chance to save a baby’s life, they will try to do it. But there are limits.“We don’t think we are shifting the border of viability further and further: if you can’t get a catheter in and the heart is not sufficiently developed to drive blood through the system, it’s not going to work. So any concerns about harvesting eggs and putting them into these artificial devices are completely abrogated by that. It’s just not practically possible.”As we get better at extending the lives of embryos outside the womb, and keeping ever more premature babies alive, there will come a time when those two points meet. The obstacles will be legal and ethical, not technological. IVF was once science fiction, then an ethical conundrum, then the cutting edge of assisted reproduction. Now it’s a normal part of making families. Once bags and tubes can replace a womb, pregnancy and birth will be fundamentally redefined. If gestation no longer has to take place inside a woman’s body, it will no longer be female. And the meaning of motherhood will also be changed, for ever.“Pregnancy is barbaric,” Dr Anna Smajdor declares. “If there were any disease that caused the same problems, we would regard it as very serious.” I am sitting in her office at the University of Oslo, opposite a calendar featuring photographs of her cats. She is a bioethicist and associate professor of practical philosophy, but has the air of a mischievous teenager.“The number of women who suffer tears and incontinence, and things that damage them for the rest of their lives is really high, yet it’s not adequately recognised,” she continues. “This is all tied up with the strong value we attach not just to motherhood, but to giving birth.”I’ve been eager to meet Smajdor since I read her groundbreaking academic papers on artificial wombs. She argues that ectogenesis – reproduction outside the human body – would allow reproductive labour to be redistributed fairly in society, so there is a moral imperative for more research.“There’s an unquestioned assumption that women will have babies, and a failure to notice how bizarre it is that we have to produce new human beings out of our own bodies. And how dangerous that is.”To demonstrate her point, she tells me about a colleague having a wisdom tooth out. Smajdor suggested they film it, as a beautiful experience to savour: “Here it comes! And look, here’s the stitching! Wow – you did that without any painkillers!”The comparison is completely perverse, but I can see her point. Our attitude to birth is very strange. There is blood, pain and stitching even if it all goes well, and we are meant to ignore it. Maternal mortality and stillbirth rates are going down globally, but Smajdor says that isn’t necessarily all good news. “The more medicine advances, the more women get scathed. I see a trajectory towards knowing so much about the foetus, and what’s good or bad for it, that women become almost ectogenetic gestators themselves, their whole function about maximising what’s good for the baby.”I have definitely felt like an ectogenetic gestator. I have had to lie back while a 20cm needle was plunged into my belly so doctors could extract my son’s DNA because something on a scan made them think he might have Down’s syndrome. (He didn’t, but then I got appendicitis.) I have had to stop myself from gagging while forcing down a cloying glucose concoction because a late scan of my daughter showed I might have gestational diabetes. (I didn’t.) I have had to lie with my legs clamped apart while a surgeon stitched up my cervix because a scan showed I was at risk of going into another early labour. Being pregnant is a remarkable experience, and I loved carrying my first child, but I have never felt more like a thing, being acted upon purely because my very dedicated doctors knew too much about what might be going on inside me.Smajdor was “not very surprised” when she saw CHOP’s lambs. “Those people were clever in their – ” she chooses the word carefully – “marketing. And, of course, being unwilling to talk about ectogenesis is part of the PR approach.” Instead of pouring resources into saving premature babies, she says we should be growing them in artificial wombs from the start, “because it’s a trauma for the foetus, being removed from the uterus, even if it then goes into a Biobag and survives”.Smajdor uses provocative ideas to raise difficult questions. It works: she has made me think about how messed up our notions of what “normal” childbirth, pregnancy and motherhood are.If perfect ectogenesis could ever exist, there is a long list of women who would want to use it: women with epilepsy, bipolar disorder or cancer, for whom pregnancy would mean risking either their own or their foetuses’ lives by stopping or starting medication women who have had their wombs removed for medical reasons. Ectogenesis will also help women in circumstances much less likely to attract public sympathy: social surrogacy clients and older women, whose male equivalents have babies without a thought. You could conceive an embryo while you’re young and grow it in a bag after you retire.But perhaps the people most likely to be emancipated by this technology are those not born female: single men, gay men and trans women desperate for their own biological children. I ask Smajdor about the benefits of ectogenesis for them.“I don’t support anyone’s right to have a child. I support people’s right not to have their body interfered with.” Then she leaves the world of philosophical logic for a moment. “Assuming we could get perfect ectogenesis, it seems like a thing we should do, in a fully just society. The problem is that our societies are not fully just. In a society that believes natural reproduction is the most amazing part of a woman’s life, ectogenesis is going to be very problematic, and more likely to be used in ways that are detrimental to women.”“What kind of ways?”“When we talk about rescuing very premature babies, there’s a risk of a desire to rescue babies because their mother is not fit to carry the foetus,” Smajdor says. Across the world, inappropriate behaviour during pregnancy is increasingly viewed as child abuse. Since the 50s, dozens of US states have prosecuted women for using drugs while pregnant. If you can save a baby from the dangers of premature birth, would you not be prepared to save it from a reckless mother? It’s easy to imagine a future where the kind of “help” already offered by employers in Silicon Valley and beyond, enabling staff to freeze their eggs so they can focus on their careers, might include the option to grow their babies in an artificial womb. Using a real womb, inside the body, could ultimately become a sign of poverty, of chaotic lives, of unplanned pregnancy, or of being a borderline-dangerous “freebirther”, choosing to have a baby without any medical input.The greatest existential threat faced by unborn babies today doesn’t come from women “unfit” to be pregnant, but from unwilling mothers. Once a woman’s body is no longer the incubator, abortion can be both pro-choice and pro-life. In the ectogenetic future, foetuses aborted by mothers who didn’t want them to exist could be “rescued” and adopted. In that world, some women might seek out backstreet abortions that would end their babies’ lives, rather than legal ones that would allow them to live. It’s a horrifying thought. But it could happen if the foetus’s right to life trumps that of a woman to refuse to become a mother.Artificial wombs will be an incredibly powerful new technology. How that power will manifest itself depends on who is demanding, making, controlling and paying for the technology. Once IVF became mainstream, research into treating fertility problems such as blocked fallopian tubes all but stopped. Why bother, if the problem can be circumvented by assisted reproduction? The same could happen with research that makes it easier and safer for women to have babies without being sliced, probed and torn. What’s the point, if the solution is already there?Women gain so much more than we lose by bearing children: the creative power of being a mother, the right to choose whether to become a parent at all. Can the freedom to have babies without being pregnant be worth sacrificing any of this?Full ectogenesis will not exist for decades, but artificial wombs are coming. We need to ensure that, when they do arrive, it’s in a society that values women for more than just their reproductive capacity, and that they are put to use for the benefit of people who can’t be pregnant for biological rather than social reasons. We do still have time. But the race to innovate means maybe not enough.“This certainly is a project that would have sounded more like science fiction,” Emily Partridge says at the end of the CHOP video. “But over three years of doggedly pursuing it, it has become very real.” • This is an edited extract from Sex Robots \u0026amp Vegan Meat: Adventures At The Frontier Of Birth, Food, Sex \u0026amp Death, by Jenny Kleeman, published on 9 July by Picador at £16.99.

That it would have been my first is for me is matter of some regret as I have spent a long career trying to shoot a mix of all things British, and in particular iconic British events. How I managed to miss this festival is almost beyond me, given its significance in the British social calendar. I do have an excuse though, as the last weekend of June is always the AGM of Magnum, the cooperative that I am a member of, and I always felt obliged and keen to attend.So for the 50th festival I had planned to go, but as we all know it was cancelled. However, I thought it would be interesting to tour the site just before the festival would have opened, to see how it looks.I am being taken around by John from the press office, and the first thing to remember is that this is a large, busy and working farm. I photograph Steven, the farm manager, cleaning his tractor, and there are nearby piles of manure, and in front of the skeleton of the Pyramid stage is a large herd of friesian cows where normally you would see many thousands of dancing, waving festivalgoers.The other first impression is that the site is huge. This will not be news to regular attendees, but to this Glasto virgin it amazing to see the scale of it all. We pass the staff canteen, which serves 20,000 meals a day we see assorted landmark sites like the Greenpeace boat and the stone circle. We visit a site called Permaculture, where John picks some raspberries: normally at this time of year it would be a thriving market garden.All around the site are remains of the assorted attractions waiting to be brought back to life in a year’s time. There is a sense of melancholy about the whole site.We go back to base and meet Emily, and a few moments later Michael comes by in his bright red Land Rover. He is a pretty nimble 85-year-old. I explain I have taken his photo a few times and say the last time was when he opened a summer fete at an old people’s home in nearby Shepton Mallet. He says: ‘That’s the sort of thing I do!’ I shoot their portrait in front of the door to one of the farm barns.The tour continues and I go to an area with dozens of skips and many refuse lorries, a reminder that at the festival peak this is a community of more than a quarter of a million people, with all the servicing this entails. There are piles of old oil barrels which are the litter bins, which are freshly painted every year but are now looking a bit sad. I go to the festival workshop barn, where Rob is employed year-round to build and maintain the festival infrastructure.I hope to be back next year, to see the real thing in full operation, but I am grateful to have had this chance to first see the lay of the land."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a60f05aa288f6e8ad19c8517743a20a714f335c/0_0_1280_870/master/1280.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8e30d3a4b5d990ec2f2137421daa8152 1440w","title":"after a decade of austerity what now","story":"Columnist John Harris has spent the past decade touring the country and reporting on what devastating budget cuts have meant to communities.

It’s bolting an unproven technology on to a mega-constellation that’s designed to do something else. It’s a tech and business gamble.”Giles Thorne, a research analyst at Jeffries, agreed. “This situation is nonsensical to me,” he said. “This situation looks like nationalism trumping solid industrial policy.”Every major positioning system currently in use – America’s GPS, Russia’s Glonass, China’s BeiDou, and Galileo, the EU project that the UK helped design before losing access to due to Brexit – is in a medium Earth orbit, Thorne said, approximately 20,000km from Earth. OneWeb’s satellites, 74 of which have already been launched, are in a low Earth orbit, just 1,200km up.Bowen said: “If you want to replace GPS for military-grade systems, where you need encrypted, secure signals that are precise to centimetres, I’m not sure you can do that on satellites as small as OneWeb’s.”Rather than being selected for the quality of the offering, Thorne suggested the investment was made to suit “a nationalist agenda”. OneWeb is nominally a UK business, with a UK HQ and spectrum rights registered in the UK through Ofcom.“Let’s give the government the benefit of the doubt: if the output the government wants is a UK-branded positioning system, a projection of UK power around the world and supporting the UK satellite industry base, then it is probably quicker and cheaper to smash the square peg of OneWeb into the round hole of a Galileo replacement than it is to do it from scratch,” said Thorne.On Friday evening a government spokesperson said: “We have made clear our ambitions for space and are developing a new national space strategy to bring long-term strategic and commercial benefits to the UK. We are in regular discussions with the space industry as part of this work.”OneWeb filed for bankruptcy in March in the US, where most of its operations are located, after failing to secure new funding.Previously, the UK aimed to build its own global navigation satellite system, which independent experts estimatedwould cost £3bn-£4bn. In December 2018, Theresa May, the then prime minister, said the UK expected to work with the US and other “Five Eyes” partners – a term for the multilateral intelligence agreement – to do so. But in May this year that project was put on hold, just weeks before a feasibility study into the scheme was due to be published, as its estimated cost ballooned to £5bn."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b57f0af9c657f86e7c4482870af6c907bf9da399/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ba0efbea693f30a80893b97fe363b30","title":"lions 2021 tour of south africa should be a year away covid 19 permitting","story":"Tour is only eight matches and has many uncertainties, but if Warren Gatland assembles the right pack – with Maro Itoje a possible captain – the prospects are mouth-wateringExactly a year from now – assuming their tour window is unchanged – the British and Irish Lions will be packing their bags for a trip like no other. Not only will the Lions’ expedition to southern Africa consist of only eight games but they are planning for it in the middle of a global pandemic. Warren Gatland, as head coach, must feel like the pilot of a light aircraft seeking to land on a tiny strip of grass beneath a range of vast, forbidding mountains.Given we barely know what next week will hold – never mind 2021 – it is important not to get too carried away. What looks obvious now may look absurdly fanciful in 12 months. And how, exactly, is a player supposed to lay down a strong early marker to tackle the world champions when there has been no competitive rugby in the northern hemisphere for months? Almost everyone is a relatively unknown quantity. This creates an obvious inherent danger: picking on reputation is never the recipe for a properly roaring Lions team.Almost every successful party has had bolters who emerged at the 11th hour who would have predicted that Peter O’Mahony would end up captaining the Lions in the first Test in New Zealand in 2017 with Ben Te’o in midfield or – going a little further back – that John Bentley, Tom Smith and Matt Dawson would play such pivotal roles on tour in South Africa in 1997?On the other hand, Gatland and his assistants no longer have the luxury of half a dozen fixtures before the first Test in which to experiment. The 2021 tourists are currently due to set off only 24 hours after the Premiership final, with their first game against the Stormers in Cape Town taking place six days later. While there is a warm-up game against Japan pencilled in for Murrayfield on that same weekend in late June, the entire party will barely have time to clock Table Mountain before they are into the thick of it.No gentle looseners on this tour, then. And that is before you consider two of the three Tests will be at altitude and the touring side’s players having played rugby, with little in the way of a proper break, since the previous August. Or the fact their coach is currently based in New Zealand and his planned advance recce to South Africa has had to be cancelled. Zoom has its advantages but the logistical challenges are already mounting.Three particular areas, one suspects, will make or break the Test series. The first is assembling a pack that can withstand the physicality that is assuredly coming. As the Springboks underlined in last year’s World Cup final demolition of England, they are not afraid to play to their strengths. If beasting the Lions up front becomes the primary objective so be it. Gatland will need durable warriors and defensive powerhouses but he will also need some dynamism. Setting out simply to soak up punishment will not be enough.The second will surround his blend of playmakers. In certain positions the Lions are spoiled for choice, not least in the back five of the scrum, where even a fit Billy Vunipola will have to crank things up to make the tour, never mind the Test side. Taulupe Faletau, Caelan Doris, Tom Curry, Dan Leavy, Jamie Ritchie, Sam Underhill, Justin Tipuric, Ross Moriarty, Hamish Watson, Sam Simmonds: even before you get to young guns such as Ellis Jenkins and Jack Willis or a wildcard like Exeter’s hard-hitting giant, Dave Ewers, there are umpteen options.At half-back, though, the Lions will need a pairing capable, at the very least, of matching Faf de Klerk and Handré Pollard. If Owen Farrell is to be deployed at inside-centre and it ends up being a tour too far for Johnny Sexton, Gatland must decide whether or not to lob the tactical keys to the gifted Finn Russell. The Scottish fly-half could be a match-winner but only if he feels trusted and is surrounded by the right lieutenants. It puts an even greater onus on finding a tactically excellent scrum-half with a strong kicking game and a complementary midfield combo. Easier, perhaps, to start with Farrell, Dan Biggar or George Ford at No 10 and invite Russell to rip it up in midweek, particularly if Racing 92 are involved in the Top 14 play-offs. Simpler but a potentially significant waste of talent.And as Gatland begins to weigh up his best No 9 candidates – opportunity could knock for John Cooney and Tomos Williams should Conor Murray and Rhys Webb not rediscover their best form by Christmas – there is also the small but crucial task of picking his assistants. His trusted recent comrades – Rob Howley, Shaun Edwards and Steve Borthwick – all currently have other priorities while Andy Farrell, Ireland’s head coach, may also feel the need to concentrate on his day job. If Scotland’s Gregor Townsend were to be involved, would that be guaranteed to bring the best out of Russell?It would not be the biggest shock if Gatland concludes that in England’s John Mitchell and Matt Proudfoot, a former Scotland international prop, he has two candidates with so much detailed knowledge of South Africa and their players that it would be foolhardy to ignore them. Invite Stuart Lancaster, with his English and Irish connections, and Sam Warburton to be backs coach and breakdown coach respectively and he would have almost every base covered.Which leaves perhaps the most straightforward decision of the lot: a skipper with the respect of both sides, certain to make the Test team and capable of being the kind of inspirational figure rugby badly needs right now. Alun Wyn Jones and Owen Farrell will be in the conversation but even Gatland himself has already name-checked Maro Itoje. The sight of Itoje shaking hands with Siya Kolisi before the first Test of the series, at the 90,000-plus capacity Soccer City stadium on the edge of Soweto, would be hugely symbolic and give every pathetic racist out there a conspicuous hand-off. Covid‑19 permitting, the 2021 Lions tour will be brief but, potentially, very special."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/943a0d60a987c05bc2a59f471ae2207a3d6fceba/0_143_4284_2570/master/4284.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=7df33245f855434a7d18c2c8f386d090","title":"arizona joins texas halting reopening amid surge covid coronavirus cases","story":"Experts say there’s evidence Covid-19 is making a comeback, including rising deaths and hospitalizations in parts of the USThe number of confirmed new coronavirus cases per day in the US hit an all-time high of 40,000 according to figures released by Johns Hopkins on Friday, eclipsing the mark first set during one of the deadliest stretches in late April. It’s a resurgence that has led some governors to backtrack or at least pause the reopening of their states.The news came as the governor of Texas ordered the closing of all bars again and scaled back restaurant dining, in the biggest retreat yet by any state after business reopening.The move was quickly followed by Florida also announcing bars immediately have to stop serving alcohol.Halsey Beshears, the head of Florida’s department of business and professional regulatinon, said the policy would be in effect “immediately.”The announcement came less than an hour after the Florida department of health reported that the state confirmed 8,942 new cases of coronavirus yesterday, breaking a record set earlier this week.On Thursday, Texas had paused its reopening process and was swiftly followed by Arizona, as both states saw a surge of new infections. Florida and California are also seeing record increases.While the national increase is believed to reflect, in part, greatly expanded testing, experts say there is ample evidence the virus is making a comeback, including rising deaths and hospitalizations in parts of the country, especially in the south and west. The number of confirmed infections soared past the previous high set on 24 Aprilof 36,400, according to the count kept by Johns Hopkins University.Deaths from the coronavirus in the US are down to around 600 per day, compared with about 2,200 in mid-April.Some experts have expressed doubt that deaths will return to that level, in part because of advances in treatment and prevention but also because a large share of the new infections are in younger adults, who are more likely than older ones to survive, although officials have warned that younger people are at risk of then passing the virus on to older friends and relatives who will be less resilient.The virus is blamed for 124,000 deaths in the US and 2.4m confirmed infections nationwide, by Johns Hopkins’ count.But US health officials said on Thursday that the true number of Americans infected is about 20 million, or almost 10 times higher. Worldwide, the virus has claimed close to a half-million lives, according to Johns Hopkins.On Friday, Texas governor Greg Abbott ordered a sharp reversal on reopening. He had pursued one of the most aggressive reopening schedules of any state and had not only resisted calls to order the wearing of masks but had refused until last week to let local governments take such measures.“It is clear that the rise in cases is largely driven by certain types of activities, including Texans congregating in bars,” he said. “The actions in this executive order are essential to our mission to swiftly contain this virus and protect public health.”And on Friday, just before the first White House coronavirus taskforce briefing in two months, the White House confirmed reports that Trump canceled his weekend trip his private golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.He was severely criticized last month, when he went golfing over Memorial Day weekend as the US coronavirus death toll neared 100,000.And there had been questions raised about whether Trump would have to self-quarantine in New Jersey because the state is currently requiring those who travel from states with high levels of community spread of coronavirus to do so for 14 days.Earlier this week, Trump traveled to Arizona, which was included on New Jersey’s list of affected states.Health experts warned earlier on Friday that the US was not doing enough testing for Covid-19 and that simply pausing reopening plans in some states – as others continue to press ahead – would not be enough to stem the spread of the disease.“Pausing reopening is not enough. We have got to try to put the horse back in the barn, as it were. We need to start to reverse the opening-up,” Ashish Jha, director of Harvard University’s Global Health Institute, told ABC on Friday morning.He warned that hospitals face being overwhelmed unless leaders take stronger measures to slow the spread.Jha urged more testing, saying the US was not doing enough, even though it is performing an estimated 500,000 tests per day, after the CDC on Thursday said that there were likely an estimated 10 times as many Americans who have or have had coronavirus than current statistics show.“They are missing cases because there is not enough testing. They are way below where they need to be,” said Jha.Jha urged Americans to wear face masks in public. “It’s a pretty small step to take to make sure our hospitals don’t get overwhelmed,” he said. Jha said masks do help prevent the spread, despite a high-profile anti-mask backlash in some parts of the country.Arizona governor Doug Ducey, a Republican, on Thursday declared his state “on pause” as hospitals accelerate toward capacity.Many governors are retreating to measures they once resisted and striking a more urgent tone.“I think they’re going to have to,” said Dr Mark McClellan, former head of the Food and Drug Administration. “It doesn’t take most people in a community getting sick to overwhelm healthcare systems.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed8610ecce102bb5c379846353a3fdd70db4f118/1310_634_4700_2819/master/4700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ef2a7d10e06d20f41857a1da9176b9c","title":"angela merkel uk must live with consequences of weaker ties to eu brexit","story":"German leader signals trade compromise less likely as she hardens tone on no-deal Brexit The UK will have to “live with the consequences” of Boris Johnson ditching Theresa May’s plan to maintain close economic ties with the EU after Brexit, Angela Merkel has said, hardening her tone over the prospect of a no-deal scenario at the end of the year.After more than three years in which the German chancellor repeatedly emphasised her openness to a deal that would maintain the UK’s current flows of trade with the bloc, she suggested the door leading to such a compromise had now closed.“We need to let go of the idea that it is for us to define what Britain should want,” Merkel said in a wide-ranging interview with a small group of European newspapers, including the . “That is for Britain to define – and we, the EU27, will respond appropriately.”Speaking days before Germany takes over the EU rotating presidency, Merkel made clear that her priority was instead to push through a pandemic rescue plan to stop Europe’s economy sliding into the worst slump since the 1930s.Coming in the week of the fourth anniversary of the Brexit referendum, the change of rhetoric from within the chancellory also appears to quash renewed speculation in the British press that Merkel could seek to soften Brussel’s red lines to secure a last-minute deal.“With Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the British government wants to define for itself what relationship it will have with us after the country leaves,” Merkel said. “It will then have to live with the consequences, of course, that is to say with a less closely interconnected economy.“If Britain does not want to have rules on the environment and the labour market or social standards that compare with those of the EU, our relations will be less close. That will mean it does not want standards to go on developing along parallel lines.”Negotiations between the UK and EU are in deadlock over whether Britain needs to tie itself to the EU’s developing state aid rules and common environmental, social and labour standards in return for a zero-tariff trade deal.Merkel’s ambassador in Brussels, Michael Clauss, recently said he expected Brexit to command most of the political attention in the autumn, fanning British hopes that Germany’s six-month EU council presidency could push the negotiations back to the top of the political agenda before the extension period ends on 31 December.After 47 years and 30 days it was all over. As the clock struck 11pm on 31 January 2020, the UK was officially orced from the EU and began trying to carve out a new global role as a sovereign nation. It was a union that got off to a tricky start and continued to be marked by the UK’s sometimes conflicted relationship with its neighbours.The French president, Charles de Gaulle, vetoes Britain’s entry to EEC, accusing the UK of a “deep-seated hostility” towards the European project.With Sir Edward Heath having signed the accession treaty the previous year, the UK enters the EEC in an official ceremony complete with a torch-lit rally, dickie-bowed officials and a procession of political leaders, including former prime ministers Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home.Margaret Thatcher negotiated what became known as the UK rebate with other EU members after the iron lady marched into the former French royal palace at Fontainebleau to demand “our own money back” claiming for every £2 contributed we get only £1 back” despite being one of the “three poorer” members of the community.It was a move that sowed the seeds of Tory Euroscepticism that was to later cause the Brexit schism in the party.\u0026nbspCollapse of Berlin wall and fall of communism in eastern Europe, which would later lead to expansion of EU.Divisions between the UK and the EU deepened with Thatcher telling the Commons in an infamous speech it was ‘no, no, no’ to what she saw as Delors’ continued power grab. Rupert Murdoch’s Sun newspaper ratchets up its opposition to Europe with a two-fingered “Up yours Delors” front page.A collapse in the pound forced prime minister John Major and the then chancellor Norman Lamont to pull the UK out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism.On 1 January, customs checks and duties were removed across the bloc. Thatcher hailed the vision of “a single market without barriers – visible or invisible – giving you direct and unhindered access to the purchasing power of over 300 million of the world’s wealthiest and most prosperous people.Tory rebels vote against the treaty that paved the way for the creation of the European Union. John Major won the vote the following day in a pyrrhic victory.\u0026nbspTony Blair patches up the relationship. Signs up to social charter and workers\u0027 rights.Nigel Farage elected an MEP and immediately goes on the offensive in Brussels. “Our interests are best served by not being a member of this club,” he said in his maiden speech. “The level playing field is about as level as the decks of the Titanic after it hit an iceberg.”Chancellor Gordon Brown decides the UK will not join the euro.EU enlarges to to include eight countries of the former eastern bloc including Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.EU expands again, allowing Romania and Bulgaria into the club.Anti-immigration hysteria seems to take hold with references to “cockroches” by Katie Hopkins in the Sun and tabloid headlines such as “How many more can we take?” and “Calais crisis: send in the dogs”.David Cameron returns from Brussels with an EU reform package - but it isn\u0027t enough to appease the Eurosceptic wing of his own partyThe UK votes to leave the European Union, triggering David Cameron\u0027s resignation and paving the way for Theresa May to become prime ministerAfter years of parliamentary impasse during Theresa May\u0027s attempt to get a deal agreed, the UK leaves the EU.But in the interview, held around the enormous circular conference table inside Merkel’s chancellory in order to meet physical distancing rules, the German leader vowed to spend most of her political energy during the presidency on rallying EU member states around a joint economic response to “a challenge of unprecedented dimensions” posed by the Covid-19 pandemic.The coronavirus crisis, which comes in the 15th and final full year of Merkel’s stint at the top of German politics, has not just led to a remarkable upswing for her personal approval ratings, but also an extraordinary pivot away from her conservative party’s deeply ingrained fiscal restraint.On 18 May, Merkel surprised even party colleagues in her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) by teaming up with Emmanuel Macron to push for a European recovery fund worth €500bn (£448bn).In front of journalists from the Europa group of newspapers, including the , Germany’s Süddeutsche Zeitung, France’s Le Monde, Spain’s La Vanguardia, Italy’s La Stampa and Poland’s Polityka, Merkel said Germany was right to be prepared for “an extraordinary act of solidarity”.“In a crisis of this magnitude, each and every one of us is expected to do what needs to be done. What needs to be done in this case is something extraordinary. Germany had a low debt ratio and can afford, in this extraordinary situation, to take on some more debt. It is also very important to us to keep the programme within the bounds of the European treaties. We have found a way to do that.”Her goal, Merkel said, was for the EU’s response to eventually match the multilateral response to the 2008 financial crisis. “These days, we have to do all we can to stop ourselves collapsing into protectionism. If Europe wants to be heard, then it needs to set a good example.”Merkel and Macron’s initiative faces resistance from Austria, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands. Even if they can sway the “frugal four”, in the coming months there is likely to be a scramble for access to recovery packag funds.“Because of the different degrees of damage inflicted by the pandemic, the distribution has to be based on a different formula from the one applied to normal European budgets,” said Merkel. “I hope that this argument will be accepted. This unusual challenge requires us to take an unusual path.“For countries which are already heavily in debt, more borrowing makes less sense than grants. I am working to convince the remaining countries which have so far been in favour of loans but against grants.”Some suggest Merkel’s seeming reinvention from arch-austerian to big spender has been forced by the German constitutional court’s ruling on 5 May, questioning the legality of the European Central Bank’s bond-buying programme, and thus the entirety of the EU’s legal regime.“Without a doubt, European law has precedence over national law – but that does not tell us where the realm of European law begins and ends,” said Merkel. “The essence of the European Union lies in the member states transferring powers. In the borderland between the spheres of jurisdiction of national and European law, friction can occur if the European level defines its limits more broadly than, for example, the German Parliament does. That’s what we are seeing in the ECB case.”While the ruling of the constitutional court in Karlsruhe represented “a conflict”, Merkel said, it did not fundamentally challenge the legal order of the EU: “That is the nature of the beast, since a nation state will always be able to lay claim to particular powers unless all powers are transferred to the European institutions, which is surely not going to happen.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6b0133fad044783951a97015706a67fecb37f59/0_134_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=fe8d4d5deb081a622d57a7abf65724b3","title":"it looks like a gameshow russias pseudo vote on putins term limits","story":"Get-out-the-vote effort includes prize giveaways while campaign avoids focus on presidentThe people of Moscow received text messages this week telling them they had been registered to win “millions of prizes”.The catch? They have to vote on constitutional amendments that include allowing Vladimir Putin to remain in the Kremlin potentially until 2036.Organisers of Russia’s pseudo-referendum to amend the constitution – originally scheduled for 22 April but delayed owing to the coronavirus outbreak – appear to be making up the rules as they go along.In a single vote, Russians must choose whether to support a package of amendments that include pension and minimum wage boosts, a modest reorganisation of government, a constitutional mention of “faith in god”, a ban on gay marriage, exhortations to preserve Russian history, and a ban on top officials holding dual citizenship.Ads for the vote barely mention that it will also reset term limits for Putin, who has ruled since 2000. It is not an official referendum and the rules are custom-designed. Unlike in normal elections, voting is allowed online and takes place over a week, between 25 June and 1 July. As Russia continues to grapple with the coronavirus, some voting officials have decided it is safer to collect ballots outdoors, planting ballot boxes on tree stumps, in the boots of cars, in public buses and on plastic patio furniture.The referendum is both momentous and absurd. Russians can endorse (or oppose) a plan to let Putin run for two more terms, potentially prolonging his rule beyond that of Stalin, and then win a washing machine or a hairdryer.“It looks like a gameshow but I’m telling everybody I know to take this seriously, it’s enough to make you lose your mind,” said Oleg Kharlamov, a laboratory technician from Moscow who said he intended to vote against the amendments. The vote would help determine “who’s in charge for the next generation, and if we complain, they will say … ‘you voted for it’,” he said.Boris Yeltsin sacks his cabinet and appoints Putin, a political neophyte who headed the main successor to the KGB, as his acting prime minister and heir apparent.Yeltsin stuns Russia and the world by using his traditional new year message to announce his resignation and hand his sweeping powers, including the nuclear suitcase, to Putin.Putin is prevented by the constitution from running for a third term as president. The First deputy prime minister Dmitry Medvedev is elected in his stead. One of his earliest moves is to appoint Putin as prime minister, leaving little doubt that the two men plan, at the very least, to run Russia in tandem.Russia holds a yesno referendum on various topics including a proposal to amend the constitution to allow Putin to seek another two terms in the Kremlin.The raffles and prize giveaways are just part of a broad get-out-the-vote effort endorsed by the government. Companies have authorised their own prize giveaways that could allow them to track employee voting, while government workers such as teachers and doctors – some of whom are busy fighting the coronavirus outbreak – are reportedly being urged to cast ballots, in systematic attempts to boost turnout.Meanwhile, Instagram and TikTok influencers claim they have been offered millions of roubles by shady middlemen to urge their young followers to vote.Analysts say the Kremlin has concluded that the rescheduled referendum had to happen now, after Russia had declared victory over the coronavirus (despite more than 7,000 new cases a day still being reported) and before the effects of a battered economy or a potential second wave further sour public opinion.There are broad concerns that the results will be manipulated, particularly with limited scope to monitor polling places and online voting. Pavel Lobkov, a reporter for TV Rain, managed to vote in person at a polling station and then online on Thursday as the polls opened, effectively casting two ballots. Election officials said his extra vote would be discounted.There is almost no likelihood the vote will fail. Weeks before the vote, publishers had begun stocking Moscow bookstores with copies of the amended constitution.Rather than an emphatic public endorsement of Putin, the vote has more resembled a chore that must be done.“It will be something that the bureaucratic machine will be happy to get off its chest. ‘We’re done, now let’s forget about it,’” said Yekaterina Schulmann, a Moscow-based political scientist. She added that the vote was more of a burden on the Kremlin’s political resources than a chance to win a new political mandate. “It will not be the source of additional legitimacy to the political regime or to the president inidually.”The government campaign has avoided reminding Russians that they are potentially endorsing Putin’s right to rule until 2036, which Schulmann said was most isive amendment. Instead, billboards have urged Russians to “preserve family values” or featured images of the poet Alexander Pushkin saying “protect our language and culture”. Putin himself dangled the possibility of amending the constitution in 2012 but then boasted at his restraint in leaving the country’s founding document untouched. When he returned to the idea in the last year, advisors understood that the campaign would be isive. But despite calling for the referendum, Putin has exhibited a characteristic disdain for campaign politics, barely advocating for his own measures.The vote was targeted at stabilising elite circles, argued Stanovaya. “He needs a reference that he can show his elites and say: ‘I have public support to rule for as long as I believe I need to. No one of you has the right to discuss successors.”There remains debate over whether Putin will actually return for terms five and six or simply wants to avoid becoming a lame duck. As he himself argued during a TV interview last week, his potential return will put to bed discussions of a possible successor for the coming four years. Or 10. Or 16."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/641c936e1b234f9bdf92bb369b280870083346bd/2511_2012_2184_1311/master/2184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f31aac69b43943db9c89cff5afdc31c7","title":"three more midlands meat factory workers test positive for coronavirus","story":"Health officials in England and Wales monitoring new cases linked to food processing plants Another three cases of coronavirus have been confirmed at a meat processing factory in the Midlands.Tulip Ltd confirmed on Friday that three employees, including two from the same household, had tested positive after a fresh batch of tests were carried out on more than 100 staff on Monday.All three, alongside other employees who may have been infected during close contact, are isolating at home.The company said it was continuing to work with Public Health England Midlands, the Health and Safety Executive, the local NHS and Sandwell council, after confirmation of other coronavirus cases last week.Dr Lisa McNally, Sandwell’s director of public health, said: “We have now proactively tested 104 staff at Tulip Ltd for coronavirus and have had three positive cases.

It draws much of its support from rural areas and small towns.Trzaskowski, of the Civic Platform party, which governed Poland prior to the PiS victory in 2015, has campaigned under the slogan “We have had enough” and promised a more inclusive and tolerant form of politics. “It’s time to say no lies and propaganda, and to fight for sincerity,” he told a crowd in the city of Wrocław while on the campaign trail.A source in his camp said Trzaskowski would be willing to cooperate with PiS if he won, but only if the government acceded to key demands such as reform of public television, which has functioned as a campaign booster for Duda in recent weeks.The election was meant to take place in May but was postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Since then, Duda’s commanding lead in the polls has steadily dwindled, leading to an increase in homophobic rhetoric from his campaign in an attempt to boost support in the Catholic conservative PiS heartlands. Public television and PiS-friendly media outlets have attacked Trzaskowski as an “extremist candidate” over his support for LGBT rights during his time as mayor.Duda unveiled a campaign pledge to “defend children from LGBT ideology” and has even compared the so-called “ideology” to communism. Przemysław Czarnek, a PiS MP and member of Duda’s campaign team, said: “Let’s stop listening to these idiocies about human rights. These people are not equal with normal people.”Duda later attempted to row back from some of the more extreme rhetoric after it appeared to be doing him more electoral harm than good. Instead, his team hoped that an endorsement from Donald Trump would give him a last-minute lift. Duda travelled to Washington on Wednesday for a meeting at the White House, becoming the first head of state Trump has received since the start of the pandemic, in a surprisingly brazen endorsement of Duda just days before the election.In the end, Duda left the US with friendly words from Trump that the meeting would “reaffirm our vital alliance” but almost nothing in the way of concrete commitments that he could sell at home.Duda’s administration had hoped that Trump would announce an increase in the US military presence in Poland, a move that would have been popular among large numbers of Poles who are wary of the threat from Russia and generally pro-American. Instead, Trump merely hinted that some of the troops he has threatened to withdraw from Germany could be stationed in Poland, without making a firm commitment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3414b98b80c1b48b0ecddf6cc1a847c3e63632cc/50_458_5899_3540/master/5899.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca0b4718330c5c38b949ae6c72100f9a","title":"us restricts visas for chinese officials over hong kong freedoms","story":"Secretary of state Mike Pompeo says visa restrictions apply to ‘current and former’ communist party officials, but does not name them The US secretary of state Mike Pompeo has said Washington will impose visa restrictions on Chinese officials responsible for restricting freedoms in Hong Kong, but he did not name any of those targeted.The move on Friday comes ahead of a three-day meeting of China’s parliament from Sunday, which is expected to enact new national security legislation for Hong Kong that has alarmed foreign governments and democracy activists.The US visa restrictions apply to “current and former” Chinese communist party officials “believed to be responsible for, or complicit in, undermining Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy,” Pompeo said, without naming them.Last month, President Trump responded to China’s plans by saying he was initiating a process to eliminate special economic treatment that has allowed Hong Kong to remain a global financial centre since its handover by Britain in 1997.Pompeo’s announcement represents the first concrete US step in response to China’s moves, but Bonnie Glaser, an Asia expert at Washington’s Center for Strategic and International Studies, said visa restrictions were largely symbolic and the fact that no names were given could lessen their impact.A state department spokeswoman said relatives of designees could also be barred. A Bloomberg columnist quoted a department official as saying the number of officials targeted was “in the single digits”.Chinese embassy spokeswoman Fang Hong said China “opposes the US side’s wrongful decisions,” and added that China’s legislation targeted only “a very narrow category of acts that seriously jeopardise national security”.“We urge the US to immediately correct its mistakes, withdraw the decisions and stop interfering in China’s domestic affairs,” she said.Wall Street’s major indexes tumbled on Friday after a Wall Street Journal article said US “meddling” on issues like Hong Kong and Taiwan could jeopardise Chinese purchases under a the trade deal Trump agreed with China in January, spooking investors already worried about a surge in coronavirus cases.Pompeo’s announcement comes at a time of intensified US rhetoric against Beijing as Trump campaigns for re-election. Opinion polls have shown voters increasingly embittered toward China, especially over the coronavirus.“President Trump promised to punish the Chinese communist party officials who were responsible for eviscerating Hong Kong’s freedoms. Today, we are taking action to do just that,” Pompeo said.He accused China of pressuring local authorities to arrest pro-democracy activists and disqualify electoral candidates, and added: “The United States will continue to review its authorities to respond to these concerns.”Pompeo said last week Washington would treat Hong Kong as a Chinese city rather than an autonomous one to the extent that China treated the territory as a Chinese city. He said Hong Kong elections due in September would show China’s intentions.On Thursday, the US senate approved a bill that would impose mandatory sanctions on people or companies that back efforts to restrict Hong Kong’s autonomy. It includes secondary sanctions on banks that do business with anyone backing any crackdown on the territory’s autonomy.A Hong Kong government spokesman called the legislation unacceptable, China’s official Xinhua news agency said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08b1f34dab873da39def03b61cae4b908e1244e9/0_8_2739_1643/master/2739.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebe92d3952a06f1a59cba88e8dd2a1cc","title":"andrzej krauze europe easing lockdown cartoon social distancing","story":"While many Europeans would like life to return to normal in the holiday season, anxiety and confusion surround the rules on social distancing"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce47f250edcb439b3a624bd44b84633e064d7f58/0_233_6131_3678/master/6131.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d6c3c1dc6c358b28b868014f078a80c","title":"coronavirus live news us records biggest daily case rise as australia continues cluster testing blitz brazil eu travel ban us","story":"US records highest daily new infections Brazil records nearly 47,000 new cases Covid cases with unknown source rise in Melbourne.

But in a small neighbourhood in north London, the brutal injustice of Covid-19 was laid bare.At least 36 residents have died in Church End, a small, deprived estate in north Brent with a large British-Somali population. Locals believe the cluster, which is the second worst in England and Wales, according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics, does not account for the true scale of the devastation, as it does not factor in people who work in Church End but live nearby.Read more from my report on the impact of coronavirus in the London Borough of Brent, which has the highest age-standardised coronavirus death rate in England and Wales. The Swiss pharmaceutical firm Roche is unable to meet demand for molecular tests to identify active Covid-19 infections, its chairman told the Swiss daily Tagesanzeiger.‘The demand exceeds our production,’ Christoph Franz was quoted as saying in Saturday’s paper. The decision on where tests were shipped to depended, among other things, on infection rates and the availability of diagnostic equipment.Demand for its antibody tests, which determine whether people have ever been infected with the coronavirus, can be met as Roche has been boosting production, he said.The drugmaker has said that it aims to more than double production of antibody tests to well over 100m a month by the end of the year.Franz said that Roche had started research on a potential drug to treat Covid-19 but added that these efforts were at a very early stage.India has passed half a million coronavirus infections as experts advise the government to prioritise reducing mortality over containing the spread of the virus. It comes as surging infections in Brazil and the United States pushed global cases toward 10 million.India’s federal health ministry reported 17,000 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, taking the country’s total infections past 500,000, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. Infections were surging in major cities including the capital, Delhi.Experts advising the government have said the authorities should now prioritise reducing mortality over stopping the spread of Covid-19.“Our focus should be on preventing deaths and not really getting bogged down because of the numbers. Numbers are going to increase,” said Dr Manoj Murhekar, a member of India’s main coronavirus taskforce and director of the National Institute of Epidemiology.Train and bus firms in the UK are trying to find a route back to viability amid the Covid-19 crisis.Gwyn Topham, the ’s transport correspondent, reports:UK rail requires at least £4bn in annual subsidy in normal times, when fares bring in almost £1bn per month. But fare income has now shrunk dramatically. Each passenger journey, on average, has cost the public purse around £100 since lockdown. The question of what value the Treasury is getting for its money will increasingly need answering should it continue to advise people to avoid public transport because of Covid-19.As a senior government official in rail, who asked to be unnamed, put it: “Either the government picks up the difference or things stop running.” What will happen? “I don’t know. It’s an awful situation.”Hotels and ashrams are being repurposed for coronavirus care in Delhi, India, following a surge of coronavirus cases. Staff at the luxury Suryaa hotel used to wear bright saris as they welcomed guests. Now they must don medical suits and handle gurneys as New Delhi desperately prepares for a predicted surge in coronavirus cases in the coming weeks.The pandemic is still raging in India with more than half a million cases. The capital, home to 25 million people, is the country’s worst-hit city - its hospitals at breaking point and authorities reaching deep to confront the crisis.“For doctors and nurses it is a part of their lives. For us this is a totally new experience and a very difficult one at that,” said Ritu Yadav, operations manager at the five-star Suryaa, as staff in masks rush to deep clean the building.“We have got training from the hospital on how to wear the PPE and then take it off but this is something I never thought I would have to do when I chose hospitality as my career.”Delhi, home to some of India’s most crowded slums, has around 75,000 cases so far, but the city government predicts this will soar to half a million by the end of July.With newspapers full of reports about patients being turned away from overflowing hospitals, Delhi told the city’s hotels earlier this month they would be roped in to provide hospital care.It is also converting wedding halls, and has several hundred repurposed railway coaches standing by - without air conditioning despite outside temperatures over 40C (105F).The Delhi authorities have even started converting a spiritual centre or ashram into a coronavirus isolation facility and hospital with 10,000 beds, many made of cardboard.Greek tourism minister Haris Theoharis indicated it could be up to three weeks before his country is happy to open up an air bridge to the UK.PA Media reports that he told BBC Breakfast:We’re currently consulting with our health experts, but I think given the fact that the UK is in the right direction, it’s a matter of a few days or a few weeks to ensure that all restrictions are lifted.So I feel the way things are now - and we always have to put this asterisk that the health situation has to continue to be on the same track as it is now - that we can certainly lift the restrictions in the next few days or, you know, two to three weeks.As soon as we have more clarity, we’ll be able to convey the right dates and the right message so that’s why it’s not easy for me to pinpoint exact dates. I’m just giving you the feeling of the advice that we get from the experts currently.He said Greece is looking forward to hosting British holidaymakers again when the time comes. He added: “Our friends from the UK are always welcome in our country.”Here’s an explainer on what air bridges are, where will they cover and how they could affect you. Russia reported 6,852 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, a figure that keeps the daily rise below 7,000 for a second day in a row for the first time since late April. The new cases take the cumulative nationwide tally to 627,646, according to a report by Reuters. The country’s coronavirus response centre said 188 people had died of the virus in the last 24 hours, bringing the death toll to 8,969. Indonesia reported 1,385 new coronavirus infections. The health ministry said there were 37 new coronavirus deaths.Afghanistan has recorded its lowest number of daily infections of Covid-19 since 1 May, as Kabul paused testing due to a problem in its laboratories and the remote province of Khost recorded its worst day of the crisis.It comes as the number of confirmed deaths from Covid-19 passes 700, but experts fear that the actual number of deaths is much higher than official figures show.The health ministry, which has admitted that it has a lack of testing capacity, recorded 165 new cases from 529 tests in the last 24 hours, taking the total number of confirmed infections to 30,616. The number of deaths has risen by 20 to 703.The war-torn country has tested 70,087 people since the outbreak began. There have been 10,674 recoveries and 19 patients are in critical condition, according to the health ministry.The capital, Kabul, paused the testing process due to a problem in its Covid-19 laboratories, according to the health ministry. Kabul has been the country’s worst affected area for both the number of confirmed infections and deaths, with 12,546 cases and 156 deaths.Khost recorded its worst day after nine patients died overnight and all of its 10 tests came back positive. A mortar shell fired by the Taliban hit a home in Khost’s Domanda district, and killed four children, the interior ministry said on Saturday. Tariq Arian, the ministry’s spokesman, said five more were injured in the attack. The Khost governor’s spokesman said the dead were all from a single family. War rages across the country and, according to the local media, 15 provinces were battlefields in the last 24 hours. The country’s Independent Human Rights Commission said two of its employees were killed in an explosion this morning in Kabul.

The Czech Republic has recorded its highest daily rise in cases since early April, reporting 168 new cases as the country starts a two-month summer holiday season.Reuters reports the country’s health ministry said the eastern Karvina region was the most affected by the rise in cases. The agency reports: Friday was the last day of school for most children and students, with their families getting ready for the holidays. Many Czechs will spend their holidays in the country rather than going abroad due to concerns about the virus and travel restrictions.As of Saturday morning, the country of 10.7 million had reported a total of 11,038 coronavirus cases, with 349 deaths. Here’s a very quick summary of new coronavirus cases reported across Australia today.Only two states reported new cases. New South Wales reported six and Victoria reported 41.There are 10 suburbs in Melbourne that are the focus for a testing blitz that has seen almost 22,000 tests carried out in the past 24 hours.Those suburbs are Keilor Downs, Broadmeadows, Maidstone, Albanvale, Sunshine West, Hallam, Brunswick West, Fawkner, Reservoir and Pakenham.The state of South Australia has reported no new cases of Covid-19 over the last 24 hours and has no active cases.But more than 250 Australians flew in from Mumbai on Saturday, via Singapore, and were starting two weeks of quarantine in an Adelaide hotel. The state’s health minister, Stephen Wade, said on Friday the state could see some new cases among those repatriated from India."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f134cdbf097995186ccf78f6b3f7d82a1db5804/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca888a6142f7427eb20069937c8684b5","title":"nine points up on europe data shows uk increase in lgbtq harassment","story":"Before 51st anniversary of Stonewall riots, survey reveals rise in incidents of violence LGBTQ+ people in the UK and across Europe still face high levels of discrimination in all aspects of everyday life, according to a survey conducted last month by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA). The survey – the largest of its kind ever conducted – focused on the social experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and intersex people in 30 European countries, and found that little progress has been made over the past seven years. Before the anniversary of the Stonewall riots, at the end of a Pride month marked by the cancellation of public events in light of the Covid-19 pandemic, we take a look at what the results reveal about the issues facing LGBTQ+ people in the UK.The European averages hide significant differences between the countries, and an increase in overall negative statistics appears to be linked to the adoption of actively discriminatory policies introduced in recent years across the continent. The study shows that trans and intersex respondents face even higher levels of prejudice than other categories: since 2012 they have experienced a disproportionate rise in discrimination and violence in all areas of daily life. In the UK, discrimination in the workplace in particular remains significantly high.Miltos Pavlou, the survey’s programme manager at the FRA, told the  that the results hinted at “a strong claim of trans people to participate in the labour market and in everyday life, and to be protected from discrimination”, as well as more openness by trans people about their gender identity.Like most respondents across Europe, people in the UK who say the situation has deteriorated blame “negative public discourse by politicians andor political parties”, as well as “lack of enforcement of existing law and policies” as the main contributing factors.New legislation introducing compulsory relationships education for primary school pupils and relationships and sex education for secondary pupils is due to come into force in England from September 2020.Bradlow hailed the introduction of the new regulations as a historic moment: “A whole generation will attend schools that not only accept LGBTQ people and same-sex relationships, but also celebrate and offer support on issues that young LGBTQ people face. Just think of the change that inclusive education will bring to the lives of so many young people.”The FRA survey’s full results can be accessed through their online data explorer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e66095eef528002831fac4e99023fe4cd7c16d3d/0_0_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cb5a9af8f4ac55c3e0eaa2de5753670","title":"gen z on challenging stereotypes i only saw muslim women on arabic channels","story":"Writer Ayat Mohamed is 18 and, like all of us, she’s an inidual with many aspects. So why is it so hard for her to find people to identify with in the media?I’m a Gen Z Muslim woman with immigrant parents and I don’t fit many stereotypes. Other stereotypes fit me alarmingly well: I think rice is one of God’s greatest creations, I talk too much, I care about my hair too much – which is even worse as nobody outside my household sees it.I also care about climate change, animal exploitation, mental health, respect, feminism and more. I’m multidimensional, and I don’t see myself represented enough.Representation has the power to implant views and stereotypes into mainstream consciousness, for better or for worse. We all need role models and there are lots of us who are being let down.It’s up to all of us to fix that. Starting now. Here, five people reveal how they’re breaking boundaries in race, mental health, body image, religion and age representation ...Malin Andersson“Mental health representation will make us all stronger,” says Malin Andersson, a mental health advocate and TV personality.I talk about grief, depression, body positivity, and domestic violence on my Instagram to open up those conversations. I get about a thousand messages a day from people saying I’ve helped them, so I know I’m raising awareness.Speaking up, especially when you show your vulnerability, can make people feel less alone and encourage them to share their experiences too. The more we talk about mental health issues, the more we take away their shame and stigma. We create space to be ourselves without being scared of what others will think. I hope this will lead to better representation of mental health issues.Dr Fatumina Said Abukar“I experienced racism because of a lack of representation,” says Dr Fatumina Said Abukar, an award-winning UCL scientist, model and Stem ersity advocate.I grew up in a small village where my family were the only people of colour, and I experienced a lot of racism.People threw eggs at me and beat me up, and I faced racial slurs. I’m frustrated when I walk into ersity shoots and I’m the only person of colour. When you only have one token figure it’s impossible for them to represent their whole community. This can lead to them being attacked by their own community if they do or say something wrong. I want to see different types of beauty in the media.Stephanie Yeboah“If I’d seen someone who looked like me, I would’ve had less self-hate issues,” says body positivity blogger Stephanie Yeboah.“I grew up feeling uncomfortable in my own skin. I’ve always been into fashion, but I felt like I had to hide that because there were few plus-size-friendly shops. I hated myself and dieted constantly. After university, I went to New York and met a group of women who were all bigger than me – yet confident and effervescent. Inspired, I posted a full-length picture of myself on social media.I was shocked at how positive people were. This generation is so lucky to have role models like Lizzo – I would’ve had less self-hate issues if I’d seen her when I was growing up. The body positive movement was created to celebrate women whose bodies aren’t seen by society as beautiful, so I’d like to see more variety of body shapes in the media.Zaynab Shaikh“Muslim women need better representation in fashion,” says hijabi model Zaynab Shaikh.Muslim women aren’t represented enough. Take fashion: few fashion brands care about Muslim women who want to dress modestly. Shopping is difficult because everything is too tight, sheer or has cut-outs. Just: no.Now, young people ask me how they can start modelling, which is so nice because when I grew up I only saw Muslim women on Arabic channels.Zahra Mohamed“Young people deserve people who look like them,” says Zahra Mohamed, Ayat’s 15-year-old sister.Representation affects young people and the adults we become. I have an issue with adult actors playing teens on screen as they create unrealistic expectations of how we should look, which has led to a rise in eating disorders, depression and anxiety.I like TikTok because it’s full of normal people. Instagram is full of heavily filtered influencers who I can’t relate to. It’s not fair that teens have to obsess over their appearance. Let young people enjoy being teenagers so we can enjoy adulthood.If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this article, the people featured recommend these Instagram accounts: @bodyposipanda @i_weigh @mattzhaig @crazyheadcomics @muslimgirl @the_indian_feminist @privtoprog @Ayat_Zaman"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4289604.1593185836!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"q a do we know yet where abroad we can go on summer holiday","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t‘Imagine if you went to Greece and all was rosy as your plane took off but while you were lounging on a Cretan beach, a spike in Covid-19 infections was reported there.’ File photograph: Getty Are we any the wiser on whether we can holiday\u0026nbspoverseas this summer?Well, to borrow a couple of lines from Dr Seuss, we are all still “in a most useless place, the waiting place” and when it comes to “the places you’ll go”, we still don’t really know.What? I thought there were big developments this week?Yes and no. But mostly no. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has outlined a map of sorts for the resumption of foreign travel, but the reality is we still don’t know whether we are coming or going or what’s going to be happening in the weeks ahead. Or at least we don’t know very much more than we did at the start of the month.What did the Taoiseach say this week?He announced that from July 9th there will be air bridges between Ireland and some other countries and people will be able to travel to and from those countries without having to undergo a 14-day quarantine and with the permission of the Department of Foreign Affairs. The list of countries will be co-ordinated at European Union level.And where are these countries?Oh we don’t know. We won’t know what countries are on the so-called Green List for some time yet and maybe not until just before July 9th. The Taoiseach also said he needed “to caution people, that list of countries will be reviewed and it may change every two weeks. So we may see it getting longer but if a country ends up having a second wave or there are spikes then they may be taken off that list of countries.”So how can I plan my holiday?You can’t actually, or at least not with any degree of certainty.Can you guess what countries are likely to be one the list?Ah yeah. We can always try, although to be honest there probably will not be that many in the first instance. Travel experts and people close to those who stalk the corridors of power have suggested that Spain, Portugal, Malta, Greece and Croatia are likely to be among the EU countries that feature. Other countries including Finland and the Baltic states also have low levels of virus transmission today and would most likely be accommodated also. But as they are not primary, or even secondary, holiday destinations for Irish people the level of traffic to such destinations is likely to be small.What criteria will be used to decide the Green List?According to Government officials, the precise criteria is still being worked on but key elements are likely to be the reproduction rate of the virus in each country, level of community transmission and numbers hospitalised, and mortality rate along with measures that are in place in countries to contain the virus.Will the United Kingdom be on the list?This is a tricky one in an Irish context. Had you asked this question a couple of weeks ago, the answer would have been a definite maybe as officials were humming and hawing about allowing resumption of unfettered travel between here and there. It would have been deemed politically wise, not least because of the common travel area, to do that.But attitudes on this side of the Irish Sea have hardened in recent days and the chances of the UK being included on any good-to-go list in the near future is pretty much zero. That means people who travel from the UK to the Republic will be forced to spend two weeks in quarantine while a travel advisory against going to the UK from the Republic is likely to remain in place. On Thursday the Taoiseach said if a decision was to be made on list of accepted countries today, the Government would not be removing the 14-day quarantine requirement on travel between Ireland and the UK.Is that extreme given they are our closest neighbour and huge market for our tourism?If there was any doubts in official circles about leaving the UK out in the cold, they would have been removed this week after images of overcrowding and general chaos on the beaches around Bournemouth started circulating. The celebrations around Anfield after Liverpool won their first league title in 30 years will not have done much to create the impression that Britain has the whole social distancing thing under control either.Hang on. Isn’t Northern Ireland in the UK? What about that?That is a very good question. Of course Northern Ireland is part of the UK but it is also part of the island of Ireland and so it is exempt from any of the restrictions that are imposed on Britain, which means people from Northern Ireland are able to travel freely to the Republic.So can I fly from London to Belfast, then take the train to Dublin?Yes. And there is absolutely no way that channel of entry can be closed unless the new government feels inclined to rip up the Belfast Agreement as one source said on Friday. And that is not going to happen.Remind me again what the restrictions are now? Well the Department of Foreign Affairs is advising against all non-essential travel while everyone arriving in the State at its airports or ports must fill in a passenger locator form to allow authorities to check if iniduals are self-isolating for 14 days as advised and for contact tracing purposes.What happens if I don’t want to do that?People who do not fill out the passenger locator form or who provide false details can face a fine of €2,500 or a prison term of six months.Could I take a chance and go to a country\u0026nbspnot on the Green List?You could. As it stands there are plenty of flights to countries that are not likely to be on any list in the near future. You can also fly to the United States today – or at least there are planes leaving here and flying there. But does that mean you can fly to those countries? Not really. First, if you do it will be at your own risk and invalidate any travel insurance policy you have. When it comes to the United States, that country has barred entry to Irish citizens. But while the planes might be leaving Ireland you have an Irish passport so will not be allowed on it. Oh, and when you come back you will have to do the quarantine thing also which, after what we have all been through, does not sound like a lot of fun.What was that you said about travel insurance?If you travel to any country against official advice then you automatically invalidate any travel insurance you might have . If you’re travelling within the European Union and you have a European Health Insurance Card then you’ll be treated in the whatever country you are in as a citizen of that country. But if you are the victim of a robbery or any other crime or need to be repatriated or suffer any other mishap you’re on your own.Okay, back up. Varadkar said the Green List was a movable feast. What if a country is taken off the list while I am there?What, indeed. Imagine if you went to Greece and all was rosy as your plane took off but while you were lounging on a Cretan beach, a spike in Covid-19 infections was reported there. Under the as yet unwritten rules, Greece might be whisked off the list and you would have to quarantine upon your return, if you could get home. Government officials are working at how to square this circle and are said to be struggling to see how this might be managed to everyone’s benefit.Why would anyone travel with such doubt hanging over the trip?There is still considerable confusion and mounting concern about spikes in Covid-19 in other countries. So many people may decide that it might be as well off giving up on overseas travel this summer. And the Government would probably be delighted by this outcome. Why not just say no non-essential overseas travel until October?Because travel is a two-way street. The Government in general and the Department of Transport and Tourism in particular is walking a thin line here. They have to factor in public health concerns and the economy. There is a tourism sector here that is worth billions and an aviation sector on its knees. The Government is keen to allow visitors come, safely, to this country but not so keen to see many thousands of people leaving and rubbing shoulders with potentially infected people overseas before coming home and bringing the virus with them.Will opening our borders to travel not increase the risk of the virus spiking here?\u0026nbspIt will and the Government is aware of the dangers of importing new cases of Covid-19 into parts of Ireland that have been clear for weeks if the doors are opened to overseas tourists too quickly. “That would be the nightmare scenario,” according to one official.But airlines are flying, right?Well, they certainly have plans to and the charge to take to the air again is being led by Ryanair. It said it has seen a “surge” of bookings from Irish holiday makers for July and August with people seeking to fly to the sun. It is, however, worth pointing out that while the airline talks about a surge in new bookings, many of the seats on flights bound to Spain, Portugal and Italy this summer will have been sold to Irish families who had plans in place long before the pandemic hit.If restrictions remain and flights take off, will people get their money back?No. Under the rules if a plane takes off and a passenger follows official guidance and avoids non-essential travel overseas then they are regarded as a no-show and are not entitled to any money back.And what will travel look like when it restarts?Passengers will be asked to wear face masks for a start. DAA, the State company responsible for Cork and Dublin airports, says public access to terminals will be limited to passengers, travellers will have to maintain the 2m social distance and there will be constant reminders about hand washing. DAA has installed more than 960 hand sanitisers in Dublin and Cork and there will be hundreds of Plexiglass screens at close-contact points. DAA has also said it will regularly deep clean and disinfect all hard surfaces, including trays, handrails and self-service kiosks, while paying close attention to places where passengers congregate. Masks are likely to be a requirement on board planes.Will air bridges apply to other parts of the world?Things are moving slowly and travelling within the EU is probably the best Irish people can hope for in the weeks ahead. Places like Dubai may also open for business in early phases of the resumption of travel.What about the US? Are we likely to see an air bridge to that country?That certainly seems unlikely in the short term. Covid-19 is not under control there and its leading public health official, Dr Anthony Fauci, indicated last week that that US restrictions on international travel could remain in place for months and perhaps until a vaccine is developed. And on Friday holiday company TUI announced it had cancelled all holidays to Florida for its Irish customers up to the end of November “due to the ongoing uncertainty around international travel restrictions and the unprecedented impact of Covid-19”.

Illustration by Michael Viney “I was trying to remember today how the colours are banded on the puffin’s curious triangular bill: was it red-yellow-blue or blue-yellow-red? So I descended the northern cliff for a closer look at them.“I was not put off by its precipitous plunge and the boiling of the sea below, but made my way down cautiously, kicking my boots well in at every step. At about a hundred feet down I found myself at the flight-level of the puffins.“These gay little auks fly in wide ellipses between cliff and sea, seeming without purpose and indefinitely, but it is not easy to follow an inidual puffin for their whole circuit of a teeming merry-go-round.“They were flying so close to me today, within a yard or so, that I could see them glance at me as they passed. Their flight is quicker than one thinks for all its apparent whirring clumsiness, so that trying to note the permutation of their bill colours was like trying to read the title on a revolving gramophone record...”That was me, a mere half-century ago, a solitary young eccentric camped on a Blasket island and pursuing this trivial and risky impulse. Why not stay on the clifftop, lying among the sea-pinks, to watch them perch outside their burrows in the evening sun? I must have forgotten my binoculars. Puffins, one of many of the world’s declining seabirds, are receiving much more necessary and serious attention. Like others – petrels and shearwaters, for example – who visit land only to breed, nesting in burrows and crevices and using darkness to dodge their predators, they invite challenging questions. How many are there, where do they go in winter, and what threatens their populations?The latest report on our breeding seabirds, from the National Parks and Wildlife Service, speaks of the “cryptic breeding ecology” of this 20 per cent of burrow-nesters and waits on the results of ongoing surveys.In the last big census attempt, Seabird 2000, many Irish islands proved too hard to land on or were beyond the capacity to organise. Puffins, in particular, were nesting on dangerously steep slopes and inaccessible clifftops. Playing tapes of recorded calls brought responses from most of the “apparently occupied burrows”, numbering more than 16,000.Since then, more intensive and hi-tech surveys by researchers at University College Cork suggest that some population figures for burrow-nesters have been gross underestimates. UCC’s Gavin Arneill and a fieldwork team found almost 4,000 pairs of storm petrels nesting on High Island, off Connemara, compared with the Seabird estimate of 22.UCC’s Dr Mark Jessop, an Australian zoologist, has worked with colleagues to track the winter travels of Irish puffins, their bright summer colours dulled or discarded. Tagging dispersing birds with GPS locators, he found puffins from Skellig Michael flying the Atlantic as far as Canada and Greenland to feed on shoals of oil-rich capelin.In 2017 came an international study, led by Oxford University and involving UCC, that had tracked 270 birds from 13 puffin colonies in North America, Norway, Iceland, Greenland and Ireland. While US puffins migrated several hundred kilometres at most, birds from Ireland travelled up to 4,700km on return flights across the Atlantic.This, Jessop says, could leave the puffins too tired to breed when they arrive, barely able to lay one egg and forage food for a single chick. This could help to explain falling numbers at many Irish colonies.Floating on the tidesAnother recent study, by UCC researchers and the Zoological Society of London, found that puffins from colonies at the Saltee islands, Co Wexford, use strong tidal currents to float, rather than fly, between areas where they could e most successfully for sand eels. This saves them substantial energy.On the Great Saltee Island – a special area of conservation for birds – predation by rats has reduced breeding puffins from 2,000 to 50 birds. On the more remote and rat-free puffin cliffs, the main predators of eggs and chicks are the great black-backed gulls, breeding elsewhere on the island.Storm petrels and shearwaters return from fishing to feed their chicks under cover of darkness. But puffins bring beakfuls of sand-eels to the burrow by day and roost offshore at night. The single chick, however, takes its crucial first journey to the sea under darkness, having been left alone to get hungry.A witness to this was the Welsh ornithologist Ronald Lockley. In his classic Letters from Stockholm (1947), he told of measuring the period of the parents’ desertion by pushing matchsticks upright in the mouths of marked burrows.At length, in late July or August, several days after the last flattening of the matchsticks, the chicks emerged at night “to blunder onwards and downwards until they could at last flutter over the cliffs to the sea”."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"One Change: We may be at the beginning of a new era with changes starting to happenFriends of the Irish Environment challenges Government\u0026rsquos National Mitigation PlanFrench president created convention in April 2019 in response to gilets jaunes revolt"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climate"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Damien EagersPA WireThe make-up of the new Fianna Fáil-Fine Gael-Green Party Cabinet will be keenly watched, with work not yet fully completed on the exact structures of the government departments the new batch of ministers will occupy. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael will each have six full Cabinet ministers and the Greens will have three. Each party will also have a so-called “super junior” minister. A super junior is a junior minister who sits at the Cabinet table but does not have voting rights. Office of the TánaisteMr Martin will become taoiseach and the Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar will take over the position of tánaiste. Mr Varadkar is tipped to take over a beefed-up Department of Jobs, potentially taking the tourism element of the Department of Transport, which will be reconfigured. He will also have an Office of the Tánaiste in Government Buildings. Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe is set to remain in position with Fianna Fáil’s Michael McGrath taking over the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. Fine Gael is also expected to hold on to the Department of Foreign Affairs, with Simon Coveney remaining in situ in Iveagh House. Which party gets the Department of Health was not yet clear on Friday night, but it is expected that Simon Harris, the current senior minister in that department, will remain in Cabinet. It is understood that Fine Gael will hold on to the Department of Justice. Outgoing Minister for Business Heather Humphreys is also seen as likely to remain at Cabinet. Those tipped for promotion from within the Fine Gael ranks are Meath East TD Helen McEntee, the outgoing Minister for European Affairs, a junior minister slot, and Galway West TD Hildegarde Naughton, who chaired the Oireachtas all party committee on climate change in the last Dáil. Internal Fine Gael speculation is that either Ms McEntee or Ms Naughton will take a full Cabinet position, with the other taking a super junior slot. Fianna Fáil will take the Department of Housing, and Darragh O’Brien, the party’s housing spokesman, is tipped for that slot, although Offaly TD Barry Cowen was also previously housing spokesman. Some sources said Fianna Fail was in line for the Department of Agriculture but others said Fine Gael may hold on to it. Fianna Fáil deputy leader Dara Calleary will hope for a substantial portfolio too and it was not clear on Friday night if a full Cabinet post for the higher education sector will be created as Mr Martin had previously promised. There was intense speculation within Fianna Fáil on Friday night on the future of Dublin Bay South TD Jim O’Callaghan, with suggestions he could be left out of Cabinet if Fine Gael takes the justice portfolio as expected. Fianna Fáil will take the position of government chief whip, with Dublin West TD Jack Chambers mentioned in connection with that job. Fine Gael will be allocated the position of deputy whip and the Greens will get assistant whip. The Department of Rural Affairs is slated for abolition, although it is not clear where its responsibilities will be transferred to. Rotating attorney generalMr Martin on Friday night confirmed that the position of attorney general will also be rotated between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, in tandem with the position of taoiseach rotating. Galway East TD Anne Rabbitte and Kerry TD Norma Foley are also mentioned as potential Cabinet or super-junior appointments. Education spokesman Thomas Byrne will also be hoping for a position. It is not yet clear which parties will take the Department of Education – although Green Party leader Catherine Martin is linked with it and was education spokeswoman in the last Dáil – and Social Protection. The Greens are also linked to a newly-created Department of Children, Disability and Equality, with Dublin West TD Roderic O’Gorman seen as one of the frontrunners for the third Green Cabinet position after Mr Ryan and Ms Martin. It is understood, however, that responsibility for the direct provision system will remain within the Department of Justice. A new Department of Climate, Energy, Transport and Natural Resources will be created, although its name is expected to be tidied up. Mr Ryan is widely expected to get this job. A super-junior minister for roads will also be appointed to balance out the Greens but it is not clear yet if Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil will take this. Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy is not expected to be a senior or junior minister and is instead tipped to take on a new party role linking the Fine Gael organisation and the Fine Gael parliamentary party.The best news and analysis from the campaign trailStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4289644.1593207962!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"developer wants indemnity in exchange for 1m to fix faults residents told","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSimonsridge: Investigations  revealed ‘a significant number of fire safety deficiencies with workmanship and building materials’. Photograph: Nick BradshawThe developer of hundreds of Dublin apartments affected by building defects is withholding a €1 million contribution to fixing the faults, and demanding an indemnity from future litigation before paying any money over, owners of the apartments have been told.Simonsridge in Sandyford in south Dublin, which consists of 632 apartments, was built in 2006 by developer Shannon Homes. Issues first came to light last year after a preliminary investigation uncovered a range of potential fire safety issues in common areas, as well as other structural and fire-stopping elements.According to correspondence sent to apartment owners at Simonsridge in March of this year Shannon Homes had agreed, following an “intensive negotiation process”, to contribute €1 million towards the fire remediation process at the apartments.The development’s owners management company (OMC) – a legal entity composed of all the apartment owners in a development, which is in charge of running apartment blocks – told owners: “This is one million euros of hard cash that will be handed to the OMC with immediate effect, to apply to our fire remediation project.”According to the letter, it was hoped at the time that the contribution from Shannon Homes, in addition to a €2,000 levy placed on all apartment owners would “be sufficient to make all of our apartments fire-safe, and to make all of our apartments sellable”. Some works, funded by the levy, are already underway at the apartments.However, in an email sent to all apartment owners on Monday night, Simonsridge OMC wrote that it is “encountering significant difficulty finalising matters with Shannon Homes”.“Specifically, Shannon Homes now require that 100 per cent of OMC members vote to accept an indemnity to Shannon Homes with respect to any future litigation from owners in consideration of the payment of the €1 million,” the email states.“As you will no doubt appreciate, this request is unrealistic as none of us knows what the future might hold in respect to our development. It is also a major deviation from the agreement made,” the directors of the OMC told residents.Neither Shannon Homes nor the OMC responded to requests for comment made a number of times this week.The March correspondence to the apartment owners also reveals the terms of a deal which it is claimed had been struck between the developer and the OMC.Common areasAs part of the agreement, a Shannon Homes subsidiary involved in the development would be “allowed to proceed with their strike-off application”, which apartment owners had objected to. Common areas in the development which were still owned by the developer would be transferred to the OMC. The apartment owners would also give an undertaking not to make a submission to An Bórd Pleanála regarding a nearby project currently being developed by Shannon Homes, the 496-unit Taylor’s Lane project.Concerns about the development were initially raised last year after a preliminary investigation uncovered a range of potential fire-safety issues. These issues were passed on to Dublin Fire Brigade, which in turn asked Shannon Homes to undertake a full investigation at the scheme.Later investigations on a sample of apartments revealed “a significant number of fire-safety deficiencies with workmanship and building materials”. A report on the development found that a fire could spread and breach protected hallways within apartments in less than 30 minutes.Pipes passing through compartment levels of apartments were not fitted with fire-rated collars and “internal protected hallways do not extend to the underside of the concrete slab above”.The cost of remediating the issues was estimated at up to €14,000 for each apartment, with up to another €30,000 for remedies to each of 32 common areas, meaning repairs could cost up to €10 million. However, the report noted that significant cost savings could likely be achieved.In November, apartment owners at the Sandyford development voted to accept a €2,000 levy per apartment, to be imposed in two tranches. They have been told that they face a second levy to fix the defects if Shannon Homes does not come forward with a contribution.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4289799.1593202890!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government considering purchase of military jet aircraft","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t    Six RAF Typhoons   headed towards counties Derry and Donegal to intercept these Russian Tupolev aircraft  on March 7th, forcing them to alter course. Photograph: RAFPA WireThe Government is considering the purchase of military jet aircraft that would have the capacity to intercept high-altitude planes and fully police Irish skies. A new five-year Defence Forces investment strategy document has said that “future projects at a preplanning stage” include the potential for “air combat interceptors”. Such aircraft are designed to scramble quickly when there is a need to intercept unwelcome or unidentified planes which could include foreign military or hijacked airliners. Although no decisions have been made on whether to pursue such high-end military hardware, it would require a major financial commitment potentially running into hundreds of millions of euro.Expensive ground radar equipment would also be required to detect encroaching traffic in Irish airspace.“Consideration of Air Combat Interceptors would be dependent on additional funding,” the Defence Forces – Equipment Development Plan 2020-24 document, published on Friday, states. High-speed aircraftUnlike most EU countries, Ireland does not have the capacity to fully secure its airspace by intercepting high-speed aircraft. A Defence Forces spokesman said “such a capability is being kept under review, and is based on threat assessment, but budget has not been allocated for this at this time. Such an aircraft would be capable of policing all airborne craft in Irish sovereign airspace, particularly those that are fast moving.”A spokeswoman for the Department of Defence said it is a “proposal that needs to be developed and scoped out”. “The assessment would consider the demands that may be made of such interceptors and the military capabilities it would be expected to be able to supply, together with the associated technical specification and capability requirements.“This utility would have to be assessed against the significant investment of public funds, in respect of the initial investment and ongoing operational costs.”The Air Corps has previously used both the De Havilland Vampire, a British jet fighter, and the French-designed Fouga Magister jet trainer aircraft. It also continues to operate the Ministerial Air Transport Service jet aircraft however, the type of plane under consideration would represent a major upgrade in technology. Earlier this year Maj Gen Ralph James, who retired as head of the Air Corps in 2015, said the State would need about 16 jet fighters with three crews each to implement a full air-defence capability. CertificationHe said each pilot would need up to 400 hours behind the controls of the jet before earning fast-response certification. A jet programme of this kind would likely cost well in excess of €1 billion.Any such cost would impact the decision-making process – particularly given the cost to the State of the Covid-19 crisis. However, the question of airspace security is not academic. Last March, a number of Russian Tupolev TU-95 “Bear” bombers, also used as long-range maritime patrol planes, entered Irish airspace. In response, six Royal Air Force Typhoons were scrambled from bases in Scotland and England and headed towards counties Derry and Donegal to intercept, forcing them to alter course. Quick-reaction aircraft from Nato allies Norway and France also took part in the response.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4289807.1593245613!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"%C3%B3 broin says nomination of sinn f%C3%A9in s paddy holohan for mayor wrong","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald: she said  Paddy Holohan’s comments were “beyond offensive”. Photograph: Getty ImagesSinn Féin’s Eoin Ó Broin has said it was “wrong” that councillor and former MMA fighter Paddy Holohan, who was suspended by the party in January, was being put forward for nomination as mayor of South Dublin County Council.On Friday night, Sinn Féin said it was “not aware” Mr Holohan’s name was being put forward.In January, Mr Holohan made headlines after he questioned Leo Varadkar’s links to Ireland because of his Indian ancestry, and then made a series of highly-criticised remarks about women.In a podcast interview the Sinn Féin councillor claimed that he had heard of “loads of” underage girls pursuing men and then blackmailing them. There were, he said “some f***ing scum women out there”.Speaking then, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald launched disciplinary proceedings, saying Mr Holohan’s comments were “beyond offensive” and “vile”.“I actually find them upsetting,” she said.In a social media post on Friday evening Mr Holohan declared that he had been nominated to run as a a candidate to become mayor of south Dublin by his fellow party colleagues, though it is not clear if he had the support of all.“Honoured to be nominated in the running for mayor of south Dublin by my Sinn Féin comrades, congratulations to the incoming mayor and a job well done to outgoing mayor @vickicasserly,” he declared on Instagram.On Saturday morning, Mr Ó Broin, the party’s housing spokesman, said he was “not happy” Mr Holohan’s name was put forward.“ It was the wrong decision of councillors to nominate him,” the Dublin Mid West TD said. “The judgement of councillors was very very poor. It wasn’t the right choice.On Friday night, a Sinn Féin spokesman said the party was “not aware of his nomination”, and that nominations for council positions were “a matter for council groups”.A spokesman for the party confirmed on Friday that Mr Holohan had been “recently readmitted to membership having serviced a five-month suspension”. No public announcement of his return was made.Criticising the nomination as “insensitive”, Fine Gael councillor James Geoghegan said it was “deeply disappointing” that Sinn Féin would nominate a candidate who had displayed ethnic prejudices towards our Taoiseach”.Further actionMr Geoghegan noted that the outcome of Sinn Féin’s internal party investigation into Mr Holohan’s comments had never been made public, and it was not known whether further action had been taken against him.He called on Ms McDonald to clarify whether she supported the nomination, and to pledge that her party would “not honour or reward public representatives who display prejudice of any form”.Social Democrats councillor Chris Pender tweeted that the decision to nominate Mr Holohan was “disgusting”, and criticised the four Sinn Féin councillors who voted for him to run in the mayoral race.SDLP Belfast city councillor Séamas de Faoite tweeted “homophobia, misogyny and racism are not qualities of a first citizen in any part of our capital”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4289640.1593200573!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus holohan beyond nervous about increase in overseas travel","story":"Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan has said he is “beyond nervous” about any increase in overseas travel that could contribute to a resurgence in Covid-19 infections.Public health advice continues to advise against non-essential international travel and against tourists coming here, he said.He told a National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) briefing on Friday that, in relation to people’s holiday planning, “my advice is to listen to us and not to the airlines”.Dr Holohan urged people to “staycation” this summer and said he, if he gets a break, intends to “spend money in this country, supporting activity in this country”.Asked about plans to draw up a “green list” of other countries with which travel would be allowed after July 9th, he said that if it were being drawn up today, many European countries would not appear on the list. Meanwhile, many countries that would make it onto the list were not the countries that people typically visited for holidays.The incidence of Covid-19 in Ireland was low and falling, he said, but this was not the case in many other countries. The State had the third-greatest fall in incidence of Covid-19 in Europe over the past 14 days, behind Finland and Estonia, according to figures presented at the briefing.Officials expressed concern about an increase in new cases linked to foreign travel – 13 over the past two weeks, or 6 per cent of the total. The countries involved included India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, the US, the UK, Spain and Portugal.Dr Holohan said a “green list” would have to be based on “trustworthy” and verifiable information shared at European level about incidence of coronavirus in different countries.Public health messagingDr Holohan also expressed concern that the public health message was not getting through to some people, commenting that he had travelled home on Thursday evening via Dublin’s Grand Canal: “A lot of people were wedged in beside each other as if nothing was going on.”A further three deaths of patients with Covid-19 were reported by Nphet on Friday. This leaves the total number of Covid-19 deaths in the Republic at 1,730.Nphet also reported another 11 confirmed cases of the disease, bringing to 25,414 the total number of confirmed cases since the outbreak began here at the end of February.Transmission of the virus in the community continues to be at a very low level, according to Prof Philip Nolan, chair of the Nphet epidemiological modelling advisory group.All the indicators of the spread of the disease in Ireland are very positive and stable, or even in decline, Prof Nolan said.The average number of new cases has declined to nine per day from 15-20 a week earlier, while the number of people in hospital as a result of the virus has declined from 40 to just in excess of 20.Not only had cases not increased since Covid-19 lockdown restrictions were eased on June 8th, but they have declined, he said.However, Prof Nolan expressed concern about the rising proportion of young people affected by the virus under-40s now account for more than half of all new cases.One further coronavirus-related death and four new cases were reported in Northern Ireland on Friday.Tracker appMeanwhile, the Health Service Executive published design and data privacy documents on Friday ahead of the launch of its Covid-19 tracker app.The smartphone app, which is designed to aid the contact tracing process, will become available next week.Minister for Health Simon Harris announced €2.4 million in funding for international clinical trials of potential new treatments for Covid-19, with patients to be recruited from next week. The Government has formally signed up to the World Health Organisation’s Solidarity research collaboration. The trial has to date recruited more than 5,000 patients across 35 countries.

It will have to be rebuilding and rebooting the economy and trying to provide the supports that are necessary.”A range of measures will be announced in July to build on existing supports, requiring legislation in some areas, he added. “There is a new €2 billion credit guarantee scheme to provide working capital for businesses that legislation needs to pass to get that up and running into effect, provision for the warehousing of tax liabilities for small businesses so that they don’t incur penalties or interest charges, that too needs to be passed.“We will look to build on some of the existing grant supports and the loan schemes that are there, try to improve them where we can, we will also look to accelerate the capital investment programme for our country as an important stimulus.“We will need to set out a future plan and pathway for the income supports that are there at the moment — both the pandemic payment, but also the wage subsidy scheme because employers need to plan for the future, so I think it is about providing certainty on all these issues and as the months go by we will be working on a more long term, national economic recovery plan and the intention would be for that to be introduced on Budget Day come October, so that is a huge amount of work ahead.”Meanwhile Green Party TD Ossian Smyth has said he was not surprised at the scale of the endorsement of the programme for government by his party’s members.“It was better that there was a clear result,” he told RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland. He said he was glad that there was such a clear endorsement.Mr Smyth defended the length of the count of Green Party votes. “We wanted to be seen to be fair.” When asked if he thought the party would lose members because of the vote, he said no and that the TDs who had opposed the programme for government had already indicated that they will work to implement the programme.Fine Gael’s Martin Heydon acknowledged that there had been much “soul searching” among members of the party for whom the prospect of coalition with Fianna Fáil “did not sit well”.He had no doubt that the three parties would all come together to deliver the “very ambitious” programme and that the government would last five years. “I trust Fianna Fáil and the Green Party to buy into this wholeheartedly, to have a genuine approach to this partnership.”The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4290528.1593254139!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miche%C3%A1l martin nominated for position of taoiseach as d%C3%A1il sits at convention centre","story":"Rather than the traditional Leinster House setting, TDs have gathered in the National Convention Centre in Dublin which is large enough to allow for social distancing required during the coronavirus pandemic\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFianna Fáil Leader Micheál Martin arrives at the Convention Centre in Dublin. Photograph: Alan Betson The Dáil is meeting this morning and Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin is expected to be elected Taoiseach, heading a new coalition government involving his party, Fine Gael and the Green Party. Rather than the traditional Leinster House setting, TDs have gathered in the National Convention Centre in Dublin which is large enough to allow for social distancing required during the coronavirus pandemic.The new Kerry TD Norma Foley has proposed Mr Martin be nominated for the position of Taoiseach.She said that as a minister in a number of portfolios, he had left a “lasting and positive legacy”.Ms Foley, who had nominated Mr Martin when the new Dáil first met in February, quoted Noel Browne from 1969 when Sean Lemass was nominated for taoiseach in a contentious debate, when he said: “You must give credit to the man”.And she said of Mr Martin: “You must give credit to the man”. He had been a reforming and progressive minister for education and created the first programme of support for children with autism, along with many other initiatives, she said.He had delivered a positive, progressive programme of change in his ministerial roles in Health, Enterprise and Foreign Affairs.Mr Martin’s nomination was seconded by Cork East TD James O’Connor, who said the Fianna Fáil leader would show his qualities of leadership and work in the service of democratic tradition.Sinn Féin’s finance spokesman Pearse Doherty said he was proposing his party leader Mary Lou McDonald “because I want change”.Mr Doherty said nobody but Ms McDonald could lead a government for change. Her nomination was seconded by Galway TD Maireád Farrell.Ms McDonald reiterated her statement that her party would provide the most effective opposition in the history of the State. She said people voted for a new direction in unprecedented numbers in February’s General Election, and said Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael had excluded Sinn Féin from talks on government formation.Insisting that the vote for Sinn Féin in February was not a protest vote, she described it as one driven by kindness and rooted in common sense.Outgoing Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said his party Fine Gael will not be nominating anyone for the position. The Fine Gael leader is set to return as Taoiseach in December 2022, under an agreement struck between the parties.He said he believed Civil War politics ended a long time ago in the country, “but today civil war politics has ended in our parliament”.He pointed to Fine Gael’s unprecedented third term in office and an opportunity to protect what had been delivered and improve on mistakes.He said that a majority was more than 50 per cent and Fine Gael, Fianna Fail and the Green party had secured more than 50 per cent of the votes in the General Election on February 8th.Mr Varadkar spoke critically of Sinn Féin. “They’re willing to get into power with Fianna Fáil and they’re willing to get into power with Fine Gael and they were probably willing to get into power with both, but when the Green party did this they were selling out.”Green leader Eamon Ryan Green party leader Eamon Ryan described Mr Martin as a man perfectly qualified to lead the new Government, describing him as calm in a crisis, forward-looking and with a good sense of humour.Mr Martin had social justice “at his core” and was not closed to new ideas and new ways of doing things, Mr Ryan said.He emphasised the importance of investing in a new energy system and “managing our own resources for our wealth and security into the future”.Labour leader Alan Kelly said there was one final step for Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael to take and that was to merge because there was “not a scintilla of difference between them” and he said today represented an historic re-alignment of Irish politics.Mr Kelly wished Mr Martin well but said he wanted to put Mr Martin on notice that “we will hold you to account”, and that a cleaner future for all depended first on building a fairer future for all. He said the opportunities presented by the pandemic should not be ignored as he said the Irish people “had a glimpse of a single tier health system”.Mr Kelly said the nominated of Ms McDonald as Taoiseach was “unworthy of support”. Mr Kelly dismissed Ms McDonald’s nomination and said it was not backed up by a real programme for government. He said she yearned for opposition and her nomination could not be supported.Earlier, Ceann Comhairle Sean O Fearghaíl told the sitting: “It has taken us a long time to get here.”He told TDs they all “know the challenges that lie ahead and we must continue to protect our people” and promote society and “rebuild out damaged economy,He said “together I firmly believe we are up to the challenge.”Mr O Fearghaíl described the assembly an effective demonstration in social distancing.As expected there have been just two nominees - Mr Martin and Ms McDonald. In the wake of the agreement by the three parties, confirmed by their members last night, the election of Mr Martin as Taoiseach is a foregone conclusion later, though all parties and groups in the Dáil will make their observations on the nominees. Mr Martin will have the support of Fianna Fail, Fine Gael and Green TDs, as well as some Independents, it is expected. Independent Tipperary TD Michael Lowry has this morning confirmed he will vote for Mr Martin as Taoiseach today. Following his election, the Dáil will be adjourned and Mr Martin will travel to Áras an Uachtaráin where he will be presented with his seal of office and formally appointed by President Michael D Higgins. It is at this moment that Mr Varadkar ceases to be Taoiseach, and Mr Martin takes over the role.Mr Martin will then return to Government Buildings, where he will - in consultation with his two partners, Mr Varadkar and Mr Ryan - choose his Cabinet. TDs will be invited to meet their party leaders and informed of their impending promotion. Once this process has been completed - and it is seldom without hiccups - the Dáil will reconvene and the Cabinet will enter the chamber behind the new Taoiseach. After more speeches, the Dáil will vote to accept the nominations of the Cabinet.Following this vote, the Dáil will adjourn again and the ministers will travel to Dublin Castle - instead of the Áras - where they will be formally presented with their seals by the President. This will be followed by the first meeting of the new Cabinet. Mr Martin is also expected to name his 11 nominees to the Seanad - shared out between the three parties today - enabling the Seanad to meet on Monday at the Convention Centre with its full complement and vote to renew the Offences Against the State Act. The Dáil is expected to meet again on Tuesday.The sitting began at 10.30am.It is also expected Mr Martin will announce his 11 nominees to the Seanad – as agreed with Mr Ryan and Mr Varadkar – which will enable the Upper House to meet on Monday and pass a vote renewing the Offences Against the State Act. Unless such a vote is passed by midnight on Monday, some sections of the anti-terror and anti-gangland legislation will lapse."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Many were struck as they were planting seeds across Bihar state in east of countryThe decades-long project sees a constellation of 35 satellites circling the Earth to rival the US-owned Global Positioning System (GPS)Regime rows back on threat to deploy troops near border amid rising tensionsOfficials prepare \u0026lsquoretaliatory punishment\u0026rsquo after anti-North balloons arrived from SouthBan on cruise ships extended beyond June 30th cases increase as more citizens return homeCovid-19 outbreak in staff at Tyson foods in Arkansas sparks Beijing U-turn on policyChina says draft law is aimed at separatist activity, subversion, terrorism and collusion abroadChina may have shut down its controversial re-education camps, but minorities are still persecutedSamira Imin\u0026rsquos father was incarcerated for three years in XinjiangDelhi says Chinese dammed a river and lay in wait for clash in which 20 Indians diedCases widely seen as Chinese \u0026lsquohostage diplomacy\u0026rsquo following arrest of Huawei\u0026rsquos chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou in VancouverInvestigators say they have found gun and are talking to two \u0026lsquopeople of interest\u0026rsquoTensions remain high despite two governments agreeing to de-escalate confrontationAustralia says it will not name country responsibleKim Yo-jong\u0026rsquos criticism of Seoul illustrates her seniority and potential to become rulerBatons wrapped in barbed wire used in high-altitude brawl in which 20 Indian soldiers diedNZ officials tracing 320 people regarded as \u0026lsquoclose contacts\u0026rsquo of pair who returned from UKClash on Himalayan border is the most serious since 1967, why now and what next?Any moves to invalidate peace deals posemajor setback to Moon\u0026rsquos efforts for more lasting reconciliation with NorthFirst loss of life in area for decades as \u0026lsquoviolent face-off\u0026rsquo between troops elevates disputeStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Thousands of children could die from preventable diseases because of dire state of healthcare, UN warnsArab world unites in opposition and warns of dire consequences if annexation proceedsOnly under-65s can take part and pilgrims will be quarantined before and after pilgrimageWorld community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideBritish-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Police and security force officers killed in roadside bomb and gun battleHealth authorities confirm more than 3,000 new cases on two consecutive daysOpponents warn that US-backed plan would lead to independent Palestinian stateWar and coronavirus-ravaged country to get $1.35bn from UN and Saudi ArabiaTension rises in region with Israel planning to extend sovereignty to Jewish settlementsGiven lack of other options, authorities used restrictions as main tool to fight pandemicFormer cabinet minister Saad al-Jabri was strategic architect of Saudi counter-terrorism effortsPrime minister claims allegations are a \u0026lsquodeep-state\u0026rsquo, left-wing political witch-huntLong-serving politician will become first sitting prime minister in Israel\u0026rsquos history to stand trialStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this.

Under the current rules, drivers whose MOT runs out in September won’t have to get their vehicles tested until March 2021.However, driving associations have warned that the easing of lockdown on July 4 could see hundreds of thousands of unsafe cars back on the roads.Figures obtained by Motorway from the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) show only 2.1 million MOTs were carried out in April and May, compared to 7.1 million in the same time period in 2019.DVSA figures show on average one third of vehicles fail their MOT on first inspection, meaning that around 1.6 million unsafe cars could now have valid MOTs.Sources told The  that ministers are considering whether to end the scheme early as lockdown unwinds.Edmund King, President of the AA, said he wanted to see the scheme brought to an end within two months as the current exemption “could lead to many more unsafe cars on the road”He said: “We believe the Government is right to reconsider the reintroduction of light vehicle MOTs.“We think they should amend the end date of these regulations, with the effect of reintroducing mandatory MOT testing from the amended end date.”Mr King’s call was backed by the RAC, which said polling showed only one in seven (14 per cent) of its members were intending to let their MOT run to the full six month extension period, with nearly half 44 per cent planning to get their vehicle checked as normal.The Government also faced calls to reverse the policy from garage owners, who said their businesses could easily be made covid-secure.Stuart James, chief executive of the Independent Garages Association said the extensions should end before cars started to flood back onto the roads with further lockdown easing planned on July 4.He said: “Now is the time to end the extension. People are being encouraged to use their cars to go shopping and go on days out to boost the economy, rather than use public transport. However, the MOT extension has been in place since March and we now have a situation where there are approximately 1.6 million unroadworthy cars in use on our roads.”Following the calls, a spokesman for the Department for Transport, said: “Vehicle owners have been granted a 6-month exemption from MOT testing, to enable vital services to continue, frontline workers to get to work, and to help people to get essential food and medicine during the COVID-19 outbreak.“It is still incumbent on vehicle-owners to ensure their vehicle is roadworthy and safe to use, even if they have been granted an exemption. Even with the 6 month extension to MOT checks, people can still take their vehicle in for an MOT test before then if they would prefer to“The duration of the changes to MOTs remain under review and we will work closely with the industry on future changes to the current exemption.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"exclusive half uks imported covid 19 infections pakistan","story":"Half of Britain’s imported coronavirus cases originate from Pakistan, The  understands, amid calls for tougher quarantine checks on arrivals from high risk countries.More than 65,000 people have travelled to Britain on 190 flights since March 1 from Pakistan, which is reporting 4,000 Covid-19 cases a day, and has seen a new spike in the disease after easing its lockdown measures. Most are thought to have UK passports.Data from Public Health England (PHE) shows that 30 cases of coronavirus in people who have travelled from Pakistan since June 4, which is understood to represent half of the incidents of imported infection.With up to two flights a day from Pakistan, there have been reports of some arrivals almost instantly going to hospital for intensive care, amid concerns that the influx has led to localised clusters.Officials are understood to be worried it could lead to a backlash against Britain, through it creating a backdoor for infections into Europe as the UK prepares to open air bridges.Officials are concerned that countries like Portugal may be importing cases from Brazil, but does not wish to say so explicitly because of our own colonial links.Bharat Pankhania, a quarantine expert at Exeter University’s medical school, said the Government needed to concentrate its resources on screening iniduals from high risk countries rather than a blanket light-touch quarantine where no-one is tested or physically supervised in the community.As soon as a country reaches a set threshold, then special screening and tests are done on all inidual arrivals at the border. If they are staying in Bath, for example, then the local public health director is alerted and they are subject to on-the-door checks by his or her team, he said.Concerns that passengers from Pakistan were spreading coronavirus saw one of the world\u0027s biggest long haul airlines suspend flights from the country this week.Dubai carrier Emirates suspended flights out of Pakistan after some 30 passengers on a June 22 flight to Hong Kong tested positive for Covid-19. Etihad and Fly Dubai also suspended flights out of Pakistan.This week, South Korea\u0027s government temporarily banned most people from Pakistan and Bangladesh from entering after it recorded increases in coronavirus cases from those countries.Ten players of Pakistan\u0027s cricket team supposed to take part in an upcoming series in England tested positive this week for Covid-19.British officials are understood to have repeatedly urged Pakistan to enact tougher controls on its flights as cases have grown.Pakistan International Airlines, the national carrier, said it had been flying direct to and from the UK since early April. At first irregular flights were organised according to demand to repatriate British and Pakistani nationals, with up to a dozen trips per week. In the past week the airline has resumed a more regular schedule flying daily to either London or Manchester.A spokesman said passengers were screened in Pakistan with heat sensors and had to wear masks. Anyone recording a high temperature during screening was not allowed on board.Officials estimate that at any one time there are some 100,000 British nationals in Pakistan, most of them dual nationals. Some 25,000 British nationals were repatriated from Pakistan between April 4 and May 13, almost all of them British Pakistanis.A Government spokesman said: The new health measures at the border are informed by science, backed by the public and designed to keep us all safe. We are seeing a high level of compliance and we expect this to continue as the vast majority of people will play their part to help stop the spread of this disease.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"headteacher suspended saying teachers sat home nothing lockdown","story":"When Pauline Wood, a primary school headteacher from Teeside, agreed to be interviewed by her local radio station, she did not intend to be anything other than truthful.But just two days after her interview, in which she said that some of her teachers were “sat at home doing nothing” during lockdown, she was shocked to learn she had been suspended.During her appearance on BBC Radio Newcastle earlier this month, Mrs Wood was asked if all teachers had been working hard while schools have been closed.She replied: “You can’t lump everyone together as if they are all one type…some teachers are coming up with the most imaginative, amazing things…and other people do sit at home doing nothing. I won’t defend those people.”When asked whether that included teachers at her own school, she said: “Yes, I think it’s time we talked about the elephant in the room in some of this.”Mrs Wood told the radio show that while “a lot can be done” by headteachers to motivate staff to work, it is a complex situation with “lots of HR rules, regulations, unions and people can say all reasons why they can and can’t work”.Two days after the interview she was suspended by the chair of governors who told her she had bought the school into disrepute.Mrs Wood told The Daily  that she stood by her comments, adding that headteachers around the country will agree with her but feel they have to “kowtow” to the unions and their local council in order to keep their jobs.“I have broad shoulders, I am not going to lie,” Mrs Wood said. “But the barriers for most heads are too great. There is a lot of pressure to toe the party line and there are lots of heads who think it’s not worth raising their head above the parapet.”She described how problems with staff began earlier this month, when she asked teachers to come for three days a week rather than two as more vulnerable children took up places at school. “We thought this was a perfectly reasonable request but a small minority of teachers didn’t like it,” she said.“They started getting in touch with their union who spoke to the council and they bent the ear of the chair of governors who agreed to it.” Mrs Wood said that teachers are “paid to work five days a week and should be acting as role models to children.“I have always promoted a hard work ethic, a no excuses and no quitting culture,” she said. “I always want to lead by example but this flies in the face of that.So I am not just going to say nothing”. Mrs Wood, who was due to stand down as head at the end of this academic year, said that her treatment has been a “bitter pill to swallow”. During her 15 years as head at Grange Park Primary, Mrs Wood transformed the school from being rated by Ofsted as “inadequate” to “outstanding”.The school, which is in a deprived community and has 40 per cent of pupils on free school meals, is one of the best performing in the country for maths and phonics.Over 100 headteachers from schools around the country have come to visit Grange Park primary in recent years to learn from its approach to boosting attainment among disadvantaged children, and Mrs Wood has been invited to give lectures about how to turn around underperforming schools.The school\u0027s most recent Ofsted report, from 2011, said that the “relentless” way Mrs Wood and her leadership team “pursue excellence and improvement has had an extremely positive impact on pupils’ results. Grange Park Primary School declined to comment.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"maxine peake vs laurence fox reveals double standards chattering","story":"The trouble with double-standards in the age of mass communication is that everybody can see them. Where once an inidual, institution or movement might have hoped to conceal their hypocrisies, now they are there for everyone to witness. So it is with the case of Maxine Peake. This week, the actress made headlines because of an interview in which she alleged that the Israelis taught the US police how to kill George Floyd. The problem is that it is a lie. Even the far-Left, anti-Israel group Amnesty – widely alleged to be the source of the story – has denied that it is true. It is simple anti-Zionism reheated to suit the current moment.So perhaps it isn’t surprising that a Jeremy Corbyn protégée like Rebecca Long-Bailey should have retweeted the interview in which Peake made this claim. Apart from its racism, the interview included the standard actress stuff about the wonders of Corbynism and the importance of bringing down capitalism. They aren’t fools, these actresses. They know that if there’s one way that their profession will be reinvigorated, post-lockdown, it will be through the obliteration of the market economy. But Labour is now in new hands. And Keir Starmer swiftly sacked Long-Bailey. While his predecessor said there was no place for racism at the top of Labour, Starmer has done something to prove it.But the question I want answered is: where is Equity, the actors’ union? Earlier this year, after the actor Laurence Fox appeared on Question Time, the union (of which he is not even a member) denounced him. Fox’s crime was to say that he didn’t think Britain was a racist country. For this, Equity branded him a “disgrace”. Actor after actor lined up to condemn him and lobby to make sure he never worked again. After Fox took legal action and forced an apology out of Equity, the entire “race equality committee” of the union resigned.Perhaps this is why Equity have been so silent on Peake. Because there is no one left to do the full witch-dunking denunciation act. Or perhaps the silence is explained in another way. The same way that one might explain the silence of the actors and celebs who clambered over each other to denounce Fox. Could it be that most people in the acting and celebrity worlds are happy with someone who promotes conspiracy theories, so long as it is wrapped up in the fashionable idiot language of anti-capitalism and “equality”?I suspect so. In which case I would strongly recommend that Peake and her colleagues mull on something. What Fox said on Question Time reflects the sentiment of the vast majority of the British public. What Peake said reflects the views of a small group of malcontents who the public has rejected at the ballot box every time we have had the chance. So here is the thing, my actor-y friends. It’s not the public who are living in some hyper-partisan, out-of-touch bubble. It’s you. And we can see you very well.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"radio 4s today programme downgrades editor role","story":"BBC Radio 4’s flagship Today programme is to lose its editor, downgrading the role to an “executive editor” with less power to set the agenda.The job specification was quietly changed earlier this year. It means that one of the most prized jobs in news broadcasting will now be “toothless”, according to one insider, with major decisions made by upper layers of management.In a change of strategy that will please No 10, the number of live interviews with politicians conducted by Today’s roster of presenters will be cut. Instead, the programme will often take a pooled interview, carried out by a BBC news correspondent such as Laura Kuenssberg and shared between a number of shows across radio and television.The changes are part of the corporation’s plans to centralise its newsgathering operation in an effort to save £80 million, by reducing the number of stories produced by the BBC and the number of journalists deployed.However, the result is that the autonomy of inidual shows will be reduced. Today staff fear it will weaken the programme, which was the subject of a No 10 boycott at the beginning of the year.“This used to be considered a plum job. But an executive editor will be essentially toothless,” a source said. One staff member said: “Using centralised interviews will weaken the Today programme, no question about it. Ministers won’t need a boycott - they’ll be able to say that there’s no need to appear on the programme because they’ve already done their one BBC interview of the day and that can be shared around.”Another insider said: “An editor should be free to choose the stories that go on the programme and decide how they are going to be covered. To reduce that role is ridiculous.”The second round of interviews begins next week. The BBC has struggled to attract candidates from outside the organisation.Internal applicants are said to include Owenna Griffiths, editor of Radio 4’s PM Richard Frediani, executive editor of BBC Breakfast Adam Cumiskey, chief programme producer on Newsnight and John Neal, editor of The Andrew Marr Show.Another female candidate pulled out of the process after it was made clear how little power the role now carries.The advertisement for the executive editor role stresses the need for “collaboration” with other BBC editors.It is understood that candidates have also been asked in interviews how they will manage redundancies, as part of the culling of 450 jobs in the news ision.The outgoing editor, Sarah Sands, handed in her notice in January, a day after the centralisation plans were unveiled by the BBC’s head of news, Fran Unsworth.Announcing the changes, Unsworth unveiled graphs and pie charts demonstrating the new “commissioning points” that will help to set the news agenda as part of “a modern newsroom that is built for the future and not the past”.Changes to the newsgathering operation are part of an £80 million cuts programme. Unsworth said the BBC’s priority was to aim news coverage at under-35s, and to plough more resources into online.The Today job spec says the successful applicant “will be tasked with maximising the impact of Today journalism, increasing the listening time of existing listeners and attracting new audiences”.It asks for “resilience, confidence, assured leadership with excellent communication skills, an enthusiasm for collaboration with other editors, and a commitment to managing and developing a first rate team.”The job offers “a flexible 35-hour working week for work-life balance”.The appointee will take up their role in September. Today remains Radio 4’s most popular programme, with around seven million listeners.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"emmanuel macron facing green wave big cities frances municipal","story":"Emmanuel Macron risks falling foul of a “Green wave” in France’s municipal elections runoff on Sunday as ecologists join forces with the Left and cash in on a slump in support for the president’s ruling party and an underperforming far-Right.Amid health and climate concerns, French Greens could clinch control of a string of cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants in what they hope will offer a “historic” boost two years ahead of presidential elections.Chief among the potential scalps is Lyon, France’s third-largest city, once a Macron stronghold and long the fiefdom of the president’s former interior minister, Gérard Collomb.In power since 2001, Mr Collomb briefly vacated the mayoral position to join the Macron cabinet but stepped down to fight to retain Lyon.  However, in a first-round coup de theatre, the Green candidate Grégory Doucet came first.As in several other big French towns, he is banking on second-round success by teaming up with a host of Left-wing parties, from Socialists to the hard-Left France Unbowed, LFI.The strategy, which detractors have likened to a watermelon (green outside, red inside), has been adopted in numerous towns around the country. It has left the Macron camp with little alternative but to ally with local Right-wing candidates from the conservative Republicans Party.Mr Doucet said a Green-led victory in Lyon would be “historic” because “never has a city of this size been run by an ecologist administration. There are no examples of other cities in France, Europe or the world.”The biggest French town to date to go Green is Grenoble, southeastern France.Marseille, France’s second-largest city in population terms, could also see a Green lead a Left-wing alliance to victory thus ending the 25-year reign of Right-wing veteran Jean-Claude Gaudin and his Republicans Party.A host of others are in the offing, including Toulouse, Tours, Bordeaux, Besançon, Strasbourg, Annecy and Orléans.Julien Bayou, general secretary of the national Green Party, EELV, said a strong showing would bolster Green prospects for the 2022 presidential elections, with the likely candidate MEP Yannick Jadot.“If on Sunday, ecology manages to succeed in big French towns, obviously the way people look at the presidential elections can change,” he said.The Macron camp, meanwhile, is facing humiliation notably in Paris, where incumbent Socialist Anne Hidalgo is arch-favourite after joining forces with the Greens.The president had hoped that local elections would shore up the grassroots base that his fledgling centrist party, LREM, lacks ahead of his 2022 re-election bid.After a long Left-wing reign, Paris looked ripe for the taking as a third of Parisians voted LREM in last year’s European elections.However, after the official Macron candidate crashed out over a sex tape scandal, his stand-in, former health minister Agnes Buzyn, is polling more than 20 points behind Ms Hidalgo. Right-winger Rachida Dati is polling to finish second.As one LREM MP put it: ”We had gold in our hands and we turned it to lead.”Mr Macron is expected to order a reshuffle after the ballot that may see him drop his popular prime minister, Edouard Philippe, who is running for mayor in Le Havre.As for Marine Le Pen’s far-Right National Rally, RN, the party is pinning its hopes on victory in Perpignan, southwestern France, where party number two Louis Aliot - Ms Le Pen’s former boyfriend - is tipped to topple local conservative baron Jean-Marc Pujol despite others dropping out to block him.If he succeeds, it would be the first town of over 100,000 to veer far-Right since Toulon in 1995.Perpignan would be a convenient fig leaf for the RN which despite reclaiming seven towns in round one, could end up with half its current number of councillors nationwide.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/06/24/16/coronavirus-lockdown-internet-use.jpg","title":"coronavirus internet use uk lockdown facebook google","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.\u0027Lockdown\u0026nbspmay leave a lasting digital legacy,\u0027 says Ofcom\u0027s director of strategy and researchPeople in the UK have been spending record amounts of time on the internet during the coronavirus lockdown, new data has revealed.In April 2020, UK adults spent longer than four hours online each day – more than a quarter of their waking life.It marks an increase of more than half an hour since January and means people now spend substantially more time online than watching television or listening to the radio.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe figures were revealed in Ofcom’s Online Nation report, which detailed the habits and trends of internet users between November 2019 and April 2020.People aged 18 to 24 were the most heavy users, clocking an average of more than five hours spent online per day.A large portion of the study focussed on internet habits in 2019, which revealed that technology giants now control an even greater share of internet traffic.The research by the regulator showed that more than a third of time spent online was spent on sites owned by either Facebook or Google.The shift towards platforms like Facebook-owned WhatsApp and Messenger appears to have been accelerated during lockdown, with nearly half of all adults using the messaging apps to make video calls at least once a week.Data shows Trump is wrong about US doing more Covid-19 testingOfcom\u0027s research found that the use of video calling services doubled to 70 per cent of the population during the lockdown, as people sought new ways to stay in touch.One of the biggest benefiters from this trend has been the app Zoom, which saw a huge surge in new users at the start of the lockdown.Lockdown may leave a lasting digital legacy, said Yij-Choung Teh, Ofcom\u0027s director of strategy and research.Coronavirus has radically changed the way we live, work and communicate online, with millions of people using online video services for the first time.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The lost item posed no risk to the astronauts, spacewalk or the station, Nasa said.Nasa renaming headquarters in honour of first black female engineerSpacewalking astronauts wear a wrist mirror on each sleeve to get better views while working. The mirror is just 5 inches by 3 inches, and together with its band has a mass of barely one-tenth of a pound.Cassidy and Bob Behnken, who followed him out without mishap, were conducting the first of at least four spacewalks to replace the last bunch of old station batteries.Once the six new lithium-ion batteries are installed, the orbiting lab should be good for the rest of its operational life, according to NASA. The big, boxy batteries — more powerful and efficient than the old nickel-hydrogen batteries coming out — keep the station humming when it\u0027s on the night side of Earth.The battery replacements began in 2017, with previous crews putting in 18 lithium-ion batteries, half as many as the old ones replaced.Cassidy and Behnken have six more to plug in before the job is complete. It\u0027s cumbersome work: Each battery is about a yard (meter) tall and wide, with a mass of 400 pounds (180 kilograms).Their spacewalks are expected to continue through July before Behnken returns to Earth in August aboard a SpaceX Dragon capsule.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Two of the stores – in Ross-on-Wye and Leominster – reopened on Monday 15 June.“Being able to shop in person, especially at smaller independents, is a joy,” owner Andy Rossiter, pictured above, says. “I think lockdown made a lot of people realise that they don’t want all their shopping to just land at their door, but booksellers also know they need to work hard for their audience. It’s not simply a case of just opening your doors.”Rossiter has been busy preparing the stores, moving fixtures and checkouts so that staff and customers can socially distance while browsing for books.Carry out a risk assessment: employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions.Maintain social distancing: employers should redesign workspaces to maintain social distancing between people and stagger start times.Manage transmission risk:\u0026nbspemployers should look into putting barriers in shared spaces, creating workplace shift patterns or fixed teams.Reinforcing cleaning processes: workplaces should be cleaned more frequently, paying close attention to\u0026nbspdoor handles and keyboards.“We have installed Perspex screens at till points, bought hand sanitiser stations for the entrances to our stores and placed tape and signage throughout so we can clearly indicate the social distancing rules within our stores,” he says.The bookshops have reopened with less members of staff and they have limited their opening hours from their pre-lockdown seven days to just five. Rossiter has also been consulting staff and getting their input on the UK Government’s coronavirus advice.“Our trade body, the Booksellers Association, has been brilliant at reading and interpreting this advice to make it bookshop-specific and releasing it in digestible and accessible weekly bulletins, he says.“Booksellers love serving customers, and we’ve been serving our local community for a decade, so seeing those regulars again and having that relationship start to return to normal will be fantastic.Surinder Josan, owner of All Seasons DIY, a family-run shop, explains how he has used strict safe workplace measures to keep his shop doors open and his businesses afloat.“All Seasons DIY is a family-run shop which was established over 40 years ago, run by myself, my wife, and my mother. My son and daughter work in the shop around their university studies as well,” Josan, below, says.The family decided to shut the shop when school closures were announced. But after just a week they decided to reopen the business in order to serve the local community, who relied on the store for essential food and other items.“In order to reopen, we had to reassess how we both serve and interact with our customers,” Josan explains. “We adopted several new measures to comply with social distancing to keep both ourselves and our customers safe.”These new measures they adopted included safe distance markers outside the shop, to limit the number of people in store at any one time, installing screens at the checkout areas, encouraging contactless payments, lowering the minimum card spend to £1, and offering hand wipes to customers.“The number of customers who have come in and complimented us for it is unbelievable. They say when they come here they feel really safe,” Josan adds.Blend Coffee Co is an independent coffee shop based in Portslade, East Sussex, near Brighton. The two directors behind the business, Oli Crawley and Tom Jennion, have introduced a range of measures so they could confidently reopen for staff and customers.“Our primary concern is to keep people safe, so to make sure our coffee shop was ready to be reopened we implemented a number of safer working measures,” says Crawley.These new measures included a deep clean of the shop prior to reopening, implementation of a new ordering layout and adopting a new policy which stipulates that no customers are allowed inside the store.Working alongside Crawley and Jennion are a further three members of staff.“Only the directors returned to work to alleviate any pressure on our barista team feeling they need to work,” says Crawley. “This also allows an operational analysis of all our new protocols to ensure they are efficient and safe.”The checkout system has now been moved to the front of the shop, Blend now only accepts card payments and there is a new waiting area outside the shop.This plan was developed after we undertook a risk assessment and analysis of the premises to ensure that customer-staff interaction could be maintained and sustained in a safe manner. We ran a test prior to reopening to ensure that our new measures would work and allow us and our customers to stay safe,” adds Crawley.For further information from the UK Government on how employers, employees and the self-employed can return to work safely, click hereThis is Government advice for EnglandWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms.Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort.

Today there was also evidence of drug use.  “Thank you to the park rangers who are also working tirelessly to clear the mess around the ground and park generally.”A suitcase, parasol and fridge were among items abandoned on beaches in Durdle Door, Dorset, where volunteers filled more than 30 bags with rubbish. Dorset councillor Laura Miller tweeted: “Is it still ‘iconic’? Just in from volunteer litter picking. 30 bin bags and counting. Nearly in tears at the state of our home.”She also shared an image of what she described as human faeces on pebbles near where her children swim at Lulworth Cove. The Conservative councillor said she was spat at by someone while directing traffic on Wednesday as the roads to Durdle Door and West Lulworth were closed off after car parks quickly filled up. Police imposed a dispersal order at Hove Lawns, in Sussex, after a fight reportedly broke out as hundreds of, mostly young, people gathered on Wednesday evening.Jo Shiner, temporary Chief Constable of Sussex Police, described the incident as “shocking behaviour impacting upon everyone trying to be responsible in challenging times”. She warned: “Sussex Police will take positive action but I would urge young people to think about their behaviour. A criminal record will not help you get a job in the future.” Video journalist Eddie Mitchell shared footage on Twitter showing several police cars lined up along the seafront as uniformed officers herded crowds away.Police in Merseyside also imposed a 48-hour dispersal order lasting until Friday after large crowds turned up at Formby Beach, on the Sefton coastline.

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

You don’t know what ingredients you’re going to be working with, so you have to think on your feet.” The father of two, who dedicates 20 hours a week, added that the biggest thing he had learnt was the power of “working together”.“For a group of people who don’t know each other, we just get on with it, working flat out. No one is being paid, we’re just working for a great cause. It has been extraordinary.”How to support our campaignBid on Sir Peter Blake’s artwork in Help the Hungry auction, say stars4.3 million meals to be delivered as Help The Hungry appeal passes £7mJoanne Karbritz, 47, works up to five hours a day, four days a week at OneStonegrove community centre. The former Oxfam shop worker, who has high-functioning autism, said that because of her condition, having a “structured day” is incredibly important. “Without routine, I can’t cope,” she said. “I would not be here if it wasn’t for this project.”Ms Karbritz, who is also anorexic, said working with food had been transformative. “Working to create healthy, nutritious food everyday has changed my relationship with it. I have also learned how to cook, whereas before I lived out of tins.”Mariana Bassi Da Silva, a software developer, wanted to volunteer as she was not working due to the pandemic. A keen cook, the 34-year-old volunteered for OneStonegrove and said the project had helped develop her love of cooking. The Brazilian-Italian, who moved to London seven years ago, said the greatest impact the project has had on her was the sense of “belonging”.“It is hard to settle in when you move,” she said. “Here, I have a community. The people have been really welcoming of me into their community.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But\u0026nbspthe unprecedented circumstances could not dampen spirits, Colin Drury findsThe Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism. To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Not long after Liverpool had won their last league title back in 1990, Harvey Morrison’s older brother mentioned to the then 12-year-old how the club’s northwest rivals Manchester United had not been champions for more than 20 years.“I said to him, ‘Twenty years? That’s ancient history’,” he recalls today. “I went, ‘That could never happen to us’.”The Anfield season ticket-holder thought about this conversation while sat alone on his doorstep at 1am on Friday morning.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThree hours earlier, the Reds – once the dominant force in English football – had been crowned champions for the first time since that 1990 success.In the celebrations that followed, almost everyone on Morrison’s Bootle street flooded into their gardens to sing and cheer. Most put up flags and bunting. Harvey’s son, 7-year-old Tom, brought out a life-sized cutout of Mo Salah and stuck it in the front lawn. Someone a couple of roads along was letting off fireworks.Liverpool fans celebrate winning first title in 30 years“But when it was all done and we’d got the kids in bed, I just needed a moment to myself,” says the father-of-two.He sat out in the warm night with his last beer of the evening. “I was trying to savour it, mate,” he says. “Thirty years I’ve been waiting for this. It was overwhelming.”Did he cry? “No comment. Let’s just say I was emotional.”Such stories – of cheers, beers and tears – come thick and fast in Liverpool on Friday, the day after the glorious night before.This may be a country still officially in coronavirus lockdown – the pubs were shut and Anfield remained locked up – but such restrictions did not dampen spirits here. An estimated 2,000 fans had turned up at the stadium to toast the title on Thursday night, while hundreds more had descended on the squares and parks of the city centre. Those who followed lockdown guidelines and stayed at home – the majority it’s worth saying – turned suburban streets into late-night carnivals.“Come head, mate,” one lad, Mike Pinnington, a 21-year-old railway worker, had told The Independent in the city’s Concert Square. “It would have had to be the plague to stop us having a bevvy a night like this.”By the next day, it was clear this was not a unique view: after three decades – as well as a wait of 14 weeks while the season was suspended due to the Covid-19 crisis – the release was palpable. On Friday, Liverpool was a city of sore heads and shadows lifted.“When I was leaving the house this morning, I saw a neighbour just getting home,” said Morrison, a council transport officer, as we spoke in the city’s Liverpool One complex. “That was 9am. I’m not sure where he’d been all night. He wasn’t in the best state to talk.”The unbridled joy was perhaps because this felt bigger than mere sport.Liverpool is a place whose identity is entwined with its club. For it not to have topped the English league for 30 years was a burden here. In a city which has long struggled with deprivation – one in three children live in poverty in Merseyside according to a 2019 report – the fall from grace of their mighty football club had felt, to many, like insult added to injury.“It’s massive,” said Scott Craven, a 21-year-old joiner. “It puts a spring in the city’s step. You look round and people are happy.”Even Evertonians? “They might as well be happy about it because they’re never going to win the league themselves.”Many believed that this was now the beginning of a new golden period for the Reds.“The start of an era,” as Mo Abdul, a research scientist who spent the night with hundreds of fans gathered outside St Luke’s bombed-out church, put it.That may be but some fear it may also be the start of a second coronavirus spike. Concerns have already been raised that the spontaneous gatherings – where social distancing was decidedly not observed – could ultimately end up going down in history as a series of super-spreader events. Certainly, city authorities and club manager Jurgen Klopp have now urged fans (again) to hold off holding further celebrations.“I agree with that,” said Abdul, 25. “Perhaps there should have been more social distancing last night. But I think people got caught up in the moment. We’re a city obsessed with football. No one’s saying there should be a bus parade until it’s safe but this was just a release, I think.”It was a view shared by Carl McDonald, a Liverpool fan and A\u0026ampE care assistant who had been working the night shift at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital.“We had a couple of people come in who’d been hurt falling off things they’d been climbing,” the 38-year-old said with a shrug: “It happens”.As a supporter and NHS worker, how did he feel about the mass celebrations? “I’d preferred them not to have happened,” he replied. “I’ve seen what coronavirus does to you. But people have been waiting to win the Premiership for so long – I think it would have been hard to stop.”He himself was able to keep up with the night’s unfolding events because patients across his wards were listening to the all-important Man City match. It was their defeat to Chelsea which sealed the Reds title. “I had to stop myself shouting out when Chelsea scored,” he noted.Katrina and Abigail Baybutt had no such concerns.The mother and daughter – who have travelled across Europe supporting the club – watched the game at home. “We were pretty loud, pretty hyper,” said Katrina, a 42-year-old accounts officer and mother-of-three. “Jumping around the living room, texting friends, singing.”The kids, she means? “Mainly the kids, but perhaps me a little bit too.”Yet she admitted – in common with most fans here – that there was a tinge of sadness that this was not a normal season that the club will ultimately end up being presented with the trophy at a game which fans cannot attend. “It’s a real shame,” she said.“But it’s okay,” perked up Abigail, 14, as the pair started to make their way in to the Liverpool store. “It means we’ll just have to win it again next year.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Despite the vast differences between the two situations, Fawcett’s extensive military experiences and qualifications have helped him and his team develop a robust response to the Covid-19 crisis.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I was the only doctor there for about 300 people, which was quite an eye-opening experience,” says Fawcett of his first stint in Afghanistan in 2007 as part of the Army Reserves. Working at the Role 2E Field Hospital in Camp Bastion and at the Forward Operating Base, Fawcett provided key treatment on the Afghanistan frontline.On his second stint in 2007, he spent three months in Camp Bastion as a Trauma Team Leader, and on his third tour in 2011, he was the clinical lead for the Medical Emergency Response Team, a four-person medical team operating from a Chinook flying over Afghanistan, picking up wounded soldiers on the battlefield.What’s more, Fawcett – who also counts a role with the Midlands Air Ambulance Charity as a helicopter doctor amongst his impressive repertoire – has completed an MSc in Disaster Healthcare. Playing an instrumental part of Stoke hospital’s response to the Coronavirus pandemic is just one more string to his bow.“I was able to take a lot of stuff I learnt and apply it from the very start,” Fawcett says of putting his Masters in Disaster Healthcare into practise. “Before the patients even get to the emergency department, we make sure there’s clear boundaries, and patients are directed to the right areas to avoid any cross-contamination.”His army tours also contributed: “Looking at the designs of how they set up field hospitals and stuff helps,” he adds. “And working with international colleagues – it’s good to get a non-UK perspective on how other countries deal with certain circumstances.”This involved an overhaul of the whole emergency area and its processes. “We now run two emergency medicine departments out of one department,” he explains. “We’ve had to basically split the whole department in half.”Now, Stoke hospital features red zones and green zones: the former is for those displaying potential Covid symptoms and the latter is for those who aren’t. As such, the pathways and patient-flow of the hospital have had to be changed to avoid any instances of contact between these areas.“We have separate ambulance entrances for red and green patients. We have two resuscitation departments, two areas for major patients, two areas for walk-in patients, two minor injuries areas, two paediatrics departments, as well as designing alternative pathways to try and stream those patients that don’t have to come through the emergency department to other places.” he explains, noting how such isions have had to be executed throughout the whole hospital to prevent crowding and maintain social distancing.The task may have been monumental, but Fawcett takes pride in the hospital’s response: “This is what we’ve always trained for and it’s been good to see how us as an emergency department have responded to it. We’ve ensured patient safety and staff safety has always been at the forefront.”Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Here are some of the measures that schools are implementing to make the transition easier for pupils, staff and parentsIn association with the UK GovernmentHinchingbrooke School is an academy school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, with more than 1,900 pupils and 200 staff. Teachers started welcoming back A-level students last week.“We’ve only had the Year 12s in so far, but for them it was really clear they were delighted to be back,” says Mark Patterson, school principal, pictured above. “You could see it on their faces. It’s getting back to some sense of routine, structure and normality.He continues: “I think a lot of them have been surprised by how much they’ve missed school. I think if you’d asked them before lockdown ‘Would you like a week off?’, they’d have said ‘Please!’. I bet if you asked them now, they’d say ‘Can I come back?’. I think the parents and students now realise how important school is.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPrior to the return, teachers organised a virtual assembly for Year 10 and 12 pupils, and sent a booklet home detailing the new guidelines which would be in place.5 back-to-school tips for parents\u0026nbsp“Don\u0027t give them a lot of small instructions – recognise your child would have had an enormous amount of\u0026nbspinstructions during the course of the day.”“If you are rewarding your child\u0027s behaviour, it\u0027s very important to do it every time.”“For a child who\u0027s been finding it tough,\u0026nbsptalking to another child who\u0027s been in the same situation is by far the best way of letting it out.”“It\u0027s important to encourage a child to work for themselves and get on with their own inner task.”New measures include red circles marked on the ground that are two metres apart and one-way systems throughout the school.“We’ve reorganised all the classrooms that we’re using so the desks and chairs are two metres apart,” Patterson explains. “We’ve got designated areas set aside at break and lunchtime for each group to go to, and we’ve got signage around the school reminding everybody of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand washing and keeping their distance.”Implementing new measuresRheeya Makwana is one of the Year 12 students who has returned to Hinchingbrooke. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom,” she says. “The structure was really good and I felt like I learned a lot more being back at school. I came home in such a good mood.”Rheeya’s father Yogesh Makwana did have some initial worries about his daughter returning to school: “There’s always some concern, but all the communication from school has been excellent in the build up to it and all the measures that have been put in place have reassured us. If you offered our 13-year-old the chance to go back to school tomorrow, he’d do it in a heartbeat. He misses his classes the social interaction. He loves PE and he does so much at school that he misses.Year 10 pupils Vahine and Lucia will also be returning to the school this week. “The twins are really looking forward to it,” says their mother, Alesia Dickinson. “They’ve been messaging all their friends to find out what group they’re in. Less than a week after we said yes to going back we found out what bubbles they were in and we had clear guidelines about times, rooms and what they can expect when they go back to school. They’re raring to go.”Both Makwana and Dickinson agree that their children have missed the structure of school lessons and that the transition back to the classroom has been easier than expected. “I think it’s a positive thing,” says Dickinson. “I think it’s a step in the right direction. We need to let the children start that process.”Going back to Embark schoolsTrust leader at Embark Matthew Crawford, pictured below, has been welcoming back primary pupils to the Federation’s schools across Derbyshire.“The feedback we have had so far from all the schools across the Trust is that it’s going really well in terms of welcoming the children back,” he says. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all. Each school has done a risk assessment based on what they can do.”Most Embark schools are now back at around 25-30 per cent capacity, Crawford says. It\u0027s up from around two per cent when lockdown began, when it was just key workers’ children and more vulnerable pupils in the classroom.“It’s lovely to hear the children playing and see schools becoming vibrant again,” he adds. “As soon as lockdown began, we started work on our Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme, a nine-stage support package to welcome children back safely.”Keyworker Vicki Ellis has two children who have returned to one of Embark\u0027s schools Richardson Endowed Primary - Amelia in Year 3 and Darcey in Year 1, pictured below.The first day the girls were back I was wondering how they were all day. I knew the school had done everything possible to welcome the children back in a happy, positive way but I worried whether Amelia and Darcey were enjoying themselves. But when they came home they were so happy to have had that day at school – and eager to go back next day. Crawford explains that the school has tried to make the transition back to the classroom as fun as possible for the children: “We’re following the guidelines but in a way that’s fun for the children. We aren’t marking big Xs on the floor. Some of our schools, for example, are painting snakes in bright colours to show the way.”Embark has also shared its programme with schools as far as Devon, Durham, South Gloucestershire and Wales.“It’s a suite of resources and activities that schools can adapt to their own settings, taking the bits that work for them,” explains Crawford. “It’s lovely that the brilliant work of our staff is making a difference and impacting the lives of millions of children across the country, not just the 3,000 within our Trust.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

A group of mercenaries recently hired by the internationally recognised Libyan government were in hospital with serious chest infections. Panic rippled through the ranks that it was the deadly coronavirus. No measures had been taken when they started their long trip from northern Syria via Turkey to Tripoli. No one had self-isolated, worn a mask or had a test.“We tried to find out more information but couldn’t,” said one fighter, among an estimated 6,000 Syrians employed to support Libya’s Government of National Accord (GNA), which is backed by Turkey. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe said his commanders were tightlipped about the incident. The GNA denied the rumours in a statement to The Independent. Instead its officials have blamed their foes – the forces of renegade general Khalifa Haftar – of spreading Covid-19 through their own foreign mercenaries. “There are no precautions taken here for fighters, it’s like coronavirus doesn’t exist,” the fighter lamented.  Wars have ravaged healthcare systems across the Middle East and North Africa, leaving several countries extremely susceptible to outbreaks of Covid-19. But world health officials are now concerned about a new secret spreader of the disease: combatants. Over the past few months, as the pandemic swept across the globe, swathes of soldiers, fighters and mercenaries from countries such as Syria, Turkey, Iran and Iraq have been deployed to frontlines across the region, despite the fact that their cross-border journeys break international lockdowns and travel restrictions.Little to no care has been taken to mitigate this potentially devastating transmission of the disease even though many of these countries are among the most vulnerable to the pandemic. The secretive nature of their movement makes contact tracing impossible.  Officials from the World Health Organisation and other United Nations bodies have all sounded the alarm, telling The Independent that with such little information and testing, there is no way to accurately measure what damage might have been done. They say local efforts to stamp out the disease will be undermined by the continued international movement of troops, prolonging and deepening existing outbreaks or even creating new clusters. “Clearly you want to control public health measures at border crossings, airports and ports,” said Richard Brennan, acting regional emergency director for WHO’s eastern Mediterranean regional office. “Ideally, you would be screening people and enforcing quarantines.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Now there are armed groups coming in, without screening, no quarantining and no tracking in the country. This is exactly the kind of the way the disease can spread unchecked.” He said it was a problem across the region, made worse by the fact that combatants then moved around the countries they had travelled to.  Libya, meanwhile, has morphed into the world’s newest proxy war with a huge influx of combatants into the country despite coronavirus lockdowns. UN investigators, those across Libya and Syria as well as the fighters themselves, estimate that well over 10,000 Syrians fighters have travelled to fight on both sides of Libya’s conflict since January. That deployment accelerated through the spring just as Covid-19 gripped the world. Thousands of Syrians from opposition areas sent to fight for the GNA have travelled through Turkey, a country with one of the worst outbreaks in the region. Turkey has had more than 190,000 Covid-19 cases and 5,000 deaths. A new brigade of Syrian fighters reportedly arrived just last week, according to sources in Syria and Libya.  UN investigators, meanwhile, say at least 2,000 Syrians from pro-regime areas have been hired via Russian companies to fight for General Haftar in the east of the country. The Independent was able to track a surge in recruitment of Syrian mercenaries to General Haftar’s ranks as late as mid-May in the middle of the pandemic. Forces allegedly continue to be recruited this week. On Wednesday, Libya’s National Centre for Disease Control announced its biggest daily increase yet in coronavirus infections and deaths. Nearly 700 cases have now been counted, and 18 deaths.But without proper contact tracing and tests, it is impossible to confirm the true rate of the outbreak in Libya or whether there is a link between the flood of foreign troops and the spike in cases. There is already little capacity to do that in many places like Libya. Now there are armed groups coming in, without screening, no quarantining and no tracking in the country, this is exactly the kind of the way the disease can spread uncheckedHowever, UN officials have warned the cross-border movement of combatants poses a substantial risk for the country where hospitals have been bombed, and there are shortages of personal protective equipment, ventilators and Covid-19 tests. “Our view is that Libya has not reached the peak of the threat of the coronavirus,” Stephanie Williams, deputy chief of the UN’s support mission in Libya (Unsmil) told The Independent. “There’s not enough testing. There is minimal containment. Yet there are continuing flights into Libya.” Health officials have expressed similar concerns about foreign troops travelling to fight in other parts of the region, including in Syria’s own deeply complex civil war.Turkey has deployed troops to opposition-held areas of Syria since 2016 to back rebels against President Bashar al-Assad, who is supported by Iran, Russia and Iranian-backed paramilitary groups from Lebanon and Iraq. Thousands of Turkish troops, police, municipal officials, and employees of the government and charities cross in and out of Syria every day. Rahmi Dogan, the governor of the southern province of Hatay, admitted at the start of the month that 140 soldiers and police officers working in the opposition-held Syrian cities of Afrin and Idlib, had contracted the coronavirus. Libya’s general Haftar swindled out of millions by western mercenariesThe news, reported in both Turkish and Syrian media, has sparked panic among Syrian residents and fighters in the Idlib and western Aleppo area, where there is a woeful lack of personal protective equipment, ventilators and just one testing machine for the four million people who live there. Many civilians are displaced from other parts of Syria and so live in overcrowded, unhygienic camps, leaving them particularly vulnerable to the disease. The Turkish authorities have maintained that they immediately isolated and evacuated those in northern Syria who contracted the coronavirus. They promised to minimise troop movement in the operation zone.But within the war-ravaged area, Syrian residents say vulnerable families have no access to healthcare and so are keeping their distance from Turkish soldiers.“We are afraid of transmission of Covid-19, the virus can only have come to the north of Syria when the Turkish units switch shifts,” said Mohamed Abdullah, one Syrian rebel. “There were cases detected in Afrin and Mastuma camp.”Meanwhile, in regime-held areas of Deir Ezzor to the east, there have been multiple unconfirmed reports about outbreaks of Covid-19 among forces that hail from Iran and Iraq, two countries that are struggling to stamp out huge outbreaks. Daniel al-Furati, who is from Deir Ezzor, said over the last few months crossings with Iraq “remain entirely open” for Iranian and Iraqi militiamen who are fighting on the side of the Syrian regime.“Those groups came into contact with the local pro-government brigades,” he said. “They are infected and transmit the coronavirus to the population there.”Deir Ezzor 24, a local activist collective, also reported this phenomenon. They accused Assad’s forces of enforcing a “media blackout” on the origins of Covid-19 infections there.Without testing it is again impossible to confirm. The Syrian regime has denied outbreaks in the eastern border area.Far from addressing public health concerns of combatants flowing in and out of warzones during the pandemic, belligerents are trading accusations over the spreading of the coronavirus.  Libyan health officials in Tripoli have repeatedly accused Haftar’s Libyan Arab Armed Forces (LAAF) of spreading the virus through its mercenaries, which according to the United States Africa Command and UN investigators include 2,000 Russians, 2,000 Syrians and 2,000 Sudanese. GNA health ministry spokesperson Ameen al-Hashimi told The Independent that the authorities had been anxiously following dozens of flights allegedly carrying Syrian and possibly Russian mercenaries from Syria to east Libya this year.“When we contacted the health authorities in the east they said that their troops were not subject to any health analyses or quarantines and were sent directly to the frontlines in west Libya, which poses a danger to citizens,” Mr Hashimi said.He said sources in the east had also told them several foreign nationals including Russians and Syrians had been isolated over the last few months with Covid-19 symptoms. The LAAF, which vehemently denies having foreign fighters among its ranks, threw similar accusations at the GNA, saying it was “ironic” that the Tripoli government was complaining about the coronavirus.“We are worried about the virus among the Syrian mercenaries the GNA has deployed,” one LAAF spokesman told The Independent. He said that they had received reports of at least 17 Syrian mercenaries being hospitalised with the virus two months ago, echoing rumours The Independent had also been told.  The tidal surge of forces has not abated. Sources in northern Syria told The Independent that hundreds of Syrian fighters had crossed into Turkey ready to be sent to Tripoli for the GNA in the coming days – despite a recent surge in coronavirus in Turkey over the last few weeks. Syrian fighters already in Libya said there was regular back and forth between the two countries as brigades were sent home and fresh recruits were brought over in a kind of “changing of the guard”. This was also reported by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which claimed as many as 1,800 have arrived in Turkey to undergo military training ready to fly to Libya while 2,600 have returned to Syria from Libya this month alone. “No one cares about coronavirus here,” said one Syrian mercenary in west Libya. “We had no lockdown, no measures in place, no masks, no testing, no hand sanitisers. It’s like it didn’t happen.”While anyone can spread coronavirus, Covid-19 symptoms tend to most badly afflict the elderly and the infirm, while mostly sparing the young athletic men in their 20s and 30s who make up the bulk of warriors in combat zones.  Another asked about coronavirus measures was sanguine. “It isn’t something we are thinking about,” he said. “We are more worried about being shot.” Read the first part of the Soldiers of Misfortune series here: Libya’s beleaguered general Haftar swindled out of millions by western mercenaries and businessmen, and the second part here: Inside the murky world of Libya’s mercenariessoldiers of misfortune\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Moreover, it was returning with two invaluable pieces of cargo. On the flight to Ulaanbaatar were 255 Mongolian citizens, stranded in the US since the pandemic struck. Along with them were several boxes of dinosaur fossils, more than 65 million years old, illicitly obtained and now being returned to their rightful home. The fossils, of creatures such as Tarbosaurus bataar, a relative of Tyrannosaurus rex, had been originally found in the vast Gobi desert, known by palaeontologists around the world. It was there in the 1920s and 1930s that American explorer Roy Chapman Andrews found the first fossilised dinosaur egg, and with it proof that dinosaurs were reptiles. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesYet, while the whip-carrying Andrews, said to be the true-life inspiration for Steven Spielberg’s Indiana Jones and who died in 1960, obtained permission for his expeditions from the Mongolian government, many who followed – either in person, or through intermediaries – did not. The fossils packed into the hold of the Mongolian Airlines plane, among them two fossilised skulls of Tarbosaurus bataar, represented the latest success in a decade-long effort to locate and repatriate artefacts she passionately believes belong in her native Mongolia.“I really want dinosaur fossils that are from Mongolia to be displayed in Mongolia, and for the public to learn about their cultural heritage.”She adds “They have a lack of knowledge and they’re not appreciating this heritage as much as they should have been. Because of that, we are facing this problem of people selling fossils for money.”Bolortsetseg’s work has seen her travel the United States, working with both the government of Mongolia and officials from the the US Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) responsible for the investigation of stolen items. On several occasions, she has acted as an expert witness in court cases, where lawyers for the Mongolian government sought to prove items were genuine. She has done so as dinosaur fossils, perhaps as a result of films such as Jurassic Park, which Spielberg also directed, have become increasingly sought after, often as status symbols. In 2015, actor Nicolas Cage voluntarily handed over a Tarbosaurus bataar skull he had bought in auction in 2007, and for which he had paid $276,000, outbidding Leonardo DiCaprio among others. Cage did so after prosecutors in New York filed a civil forfeiture claim, saying the item had been obtained illegally.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailPart of the challenge for people such as Bolortsetseg is that since 1990, when Mongolia established a democracy after six-decades of Soviet-controlled rule, her nation has become increasingly open to the outside world. While Mongolia has had laws dating back to 1924 that make fossil collection or removal illegal, collectors and enthusiasts have taken advantage of the increased ease of access to the world’s most sparsely populated nation and its cultural treasures.Two areas in particular, the Flaming Cliffs, and the Nemegt Basin, both in the southern Ömnögovi Province, have attracted huge interest.Bolortsegtseg Minjin on the repatriation of Mongolian dinosaurs“When you open up, it’s not just well-wishers who arrive, but also those looking to make quick money,” says Yondon Otgonbayar, Mongolia’s US ambassador, who travelled to Seattle to oversee both the arrival of the PPE equipment, and the return of the fossils. “Now we’re are working to recover those stolen items.”Bolortsetseg estimates in the past decade she has helped repatriate more than 50 inidual dinosaur fossils or collections, that were flown back in four shipments, Sunday’s being the most recent. Several legal actions to recover other fossils are ongoing.Other than of the skull bought by Nicolas Cage, the most high-profile involved an entire Tyrannosaurus bataar skeleton, obtained among a number of dinosaur fossils by a Florida collector, Eric Prokopi, and put up for sale in New York city for $1m in 2012.Prokopi would eventually plead guilty, as part of a deal with federal prosecutors, to illegally smuggling dinosaur fossils and give up several other skeletons in his possession. The skull bought by Cage had in fact been originally been obtained by a gallery in Beverly Hills, IM Chait. The gallery had bought a number of items from Prokopi, who initially argued he had committed no crime because the fossils had been brought to the US from the UK, rather than directly from Mongolia. He was jailed for three months.“Each of these fossils represents a culturally and scientifically important artifact looted from its rightful owner,” said then Manhattan prosecutor Preet Bharara. He called Prokopi a “one-man black market in prehistoric fossils”.The pieces returned this week followed investigations by ICE agents in several locations across the country. Bolortsetseg said three separate legal actions were involved.“In 2012, officers in New York, Wyoming and Salt Lake City initiated cultural property investigations related to the sale of dinosaur fossils that originated in Mongolia,” says ICE spokesperson Kate Pote. “Mongolian patrimony laws prohibit the export and private ownership of any prehistoric dinosaur fossil or specimen.”Pope says a fourth case, again involving Prokopi, was in the process of being resolved and ICE planned to “release this fossil to Mongolia in the coming months”. It is unclear whether Prokopi, the subject of a book, The Dinosaur Artist: Obsession, Betrayal, and the Quest for Earth’s Ultimate Trophy, by Paige Williams, was directly inspired by Roy Chapman Andrews, who launched three separate expeditions to Mongolia, in the capacity as an explorer for New York’s American Museum of Natural History (AMNH), where he started his career in 1906 mopping the floors. He would later graduate to the taxidermy department before travelling through Mongolia on US-made cars he imported for the purpose. “I wanted to go everywhere. I would have started on a day’s notice for the North Pole or the South, to the jungle or the desert,” he wrote in Under a Lucky Star, one of a dozen books. To some, such as the Roy Chapman Andrews Society, established in the explorer’s birthplace of Beloit, Wisconsin, Andrews was a pioneering hero, who auctioned off some of the eggs he brought back to the US in order to fund subsequent expeditions. In 1935, he became director of the prestigious AMNH, where a number of his Mongolian dinosaur finds are still on display.Others, including Bolortsetseg, say his actions took place in a less informed era. “Hero is not the word,” she says. His intention may have been good, she adds, but “this whole thing happened around the time of a colonial mindset”.(Neither the society or the AMNH responded to enquiries.)Indeed, the repatriation of items to Mongolia comes amid a broader cultural reckoning, with many nations, and their museums, being pressured to return items collected, or looted, depending on one\u0027s perspective, during colonial times. Last year, the authors of an influential report accused the British Museum of acting like an “an ostrich with its head in the sand” over the issue.In Mongolia, over the last decade there has been an urgency to use the publicity created by the return of the dinosaur fossils to educate people about their heritage. A museum was specially constructed to house the fossils.Among those who supported this was Oyungerel Tsedevdamba, a writer and activist and onetime minister of culture, sport and tourism.Speaking from Ulaanbaatar, Oyungerel tells The Independent that one of the challenges in educating Mongolians was the historic views of bones as something unclean. Oyungerel, who grew up in a nomadic herding community, says children are taught to keep away from the bones of dead animals, as they may be harbouring disease.Steadily, she says, people are learning that unlike the bones they may encounter on the steppes, the dinosaur remains are fossilised items, like stone.Bolortsetseg says few things give her more pleasure that travelling around Mongolia in a mobile museum to show the fossils to children and their parents, and to tell them where they come from.She has so far visited 10 of its 22 provinces.“The kids are really excited. Some of them say they’ve seen dinosaur movies, but they think dinosaurs are from America,” she says.“And I said, no, the movie’s made in America, but the dinosaur was actually found in your back yard.”She adds: “I say ‘You know the Velociraptor’. Velociraptor is from Jurassic Park, and I play them the video. And I say ‘This dinosaur is from your back yard’.“Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

There have been more than 170 new cases of Covid-19 since last week, marking the biggest increase since the virus\u0027s spread was close to being eliminated in April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

You can now at last be within ft in of someone outside your immediate household! What’s more, from July , you will be able to eat in restaurants, have a drink and, of course, continue shopping.⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesWhat you won’t be able to do, unless you are very fortunate, is to get your children into school, which says something about our national priorities. Make no mistake about it, this is a “national emergency”. Education should have the upfront priority that we rightly give the NHS and saving our economy. The failure since the beginning of March to plan ahead for getting all schools and all youngsters back into the classroom has been reprehensible.I say all schools because the majority have been open for the children of key workers and for children designated as vulnerable.Many teachers have been doing a first-class job trying to keep in touch with children at home, providing them with online tuition, homework and marking. But there is still time to mobilise all the necessary resources to make it possible to get children back to school for at least a couple of weeks before the end of this term.Yes, it would involve finding extra premises for schools with inadequate space. Yes, we would have to appeal to teachers who have recently retired to come back for perhaps a few hours a week. Yes, we would need to employ supply teachers.In addition we could use university students, who won’t be finding summer jobs any time soon, to assist.Of course, we don’t have that reliable summer weather that will allow teaching outside on a regular basis, butDenmark can place many lessons in an outside setting, we can.If the French, Lord help us, can get their schools mobilised and back to full operation, we can. Their trade unions are far more bolshy than ours, and teachers regrettably much less well paid.So we need a combination of creativity, imagination and drive to get pupils back. We need to rebuild the confidence of parents and staff that they are highly unlikely to contract the virus from the children, or of the children passing it on to each other.That way, we can have ironed out the glitches and be ready in September to be absolutely on the ball. Small group tutoring for recovery programmes, mentoring not just organised centrally, but co-ordinated locally.For anyone who doesn’t believe that two or three weeks matter in terms of education, when children have been out of school since the middle of March, then think again. This is about equality, narrowing the gap between the haves and have-nots, and opening a window on the world. But it is also more than that. It’s a place of social interaction, of well-being and of safety. Don’t take my word for it. Take the word of the Royal College of Paediatricians, the people whose whole le is spent on the well-being of children. They are very clear: Schools must , children need each other as well as their teachers.The recognition of the importance of schools was something I was proud to oversee in , when the incoming government’s priority slogan was, “education, education, education”.Don’t get me wrong. The belated announcement last week of a one per cent uplt for all schools and a £million pot for an online recovery programme is extremely welcome. A pity, therefore, that in making a really great announcement, the Government managed not to put any money aside for the  to -year-olds in further education, who are surely the target group we would want to be helping the most.So, thank you to all those who have done everything they can to keep the wheels on the cart over the past dficult three and a half months. But now we need both national leadership and local organisation. To use an old adage, we need to think national but we need to act local. Education trusts, local authorities, teachers’ unions and all those committed to the future of this nation should want to come together to make it work.In the next ten days, while the Government thinks about its advice, others can get on with the job. Take what is working best and spread it.What can work in France or Denmark or Germany can certainly work here. We are not out of the woods yet, but we can take logical, rational and brave decisions. That is what leadership is all about.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Prime Minister announced that we were at last allowed out of our Great British Hibernation.We can go to the pub, buy useless tat in shops and queue up for plaster lawn ornaments from garden centres. We can have the in-laws round to visit! Yoot!⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesBoris says that his decision was made on good scientic advice. Hmm, maybe. It is true that the infection rate for Covid has been dropping rapidly for some time. But it’s still there, still hanging around with mischief on its mind. All it takes is one person in a gathering of  or  at some pizza joint and that infection rate will be up again quickly enough.In some of the countries that have released their people from lockdown, a second spike has occurred.In Germany the famous “R” rate for infection is well above the dreaded one. South Korea and Spain have seen new outbreaks, too.But the truth is Boris didn’t have much of an option. The public is bored stf and the economy is wrecked.I suspect the decision was arrived at on those grounds, rather than strictly on the science. Everyone wants to go out and spend money. I am not sure why they do.  There were good things about lockdown — and it taught us one or two truths about ourselves.It was a pleasure to hear the birds singing, for example. A real delight to see the roads free from traffic. The skies are full of swts and swallows instead of the incessant airline flights. The quality of the air we breathe improved hugely as a result. So did the water quality of rivers and streams.We went out much, much less. As a consequence, many people saved an awful lot of money because they weren’t wasting it on buying rubbish from shops.People learned to cook — and ate home-prepared meals with their families. The truth is, in normal times, we eat out far more often than is good for us, financially or otherwise. And we shopped locally — the corner stores did a roaring trade — and less often, thus saving carbon emissions.Employers discovered that people could work from home perfectly well. Hopefully this will persuade some to scale back their offices and give people the chance to work from home.Imagine how many homes could be created from disused offices! We wouldn’t have to pave over half the country to sort out our housing crisis. Imagine cutting out the daily commute for ever!We didn’t have to hug people. Indeed, we were barred by law from hugging people. Or kissing them on the bloody cheek, like everyone in the media world does. That, by itself, was a huge bonus for me.My wish is that we take some of that stuff from lockdown and make it the new normal. Live at a quieter, gentler pace. Continue to eat at home — and support our local corner shops. Use the car less. Spend less money on a whole load of b******s we don’t really need. Use aeroplanes not at all, preferably. Right now, the Government has given us licence to go out and do stuff.Here’s my plea. Let’s do a bit less stuff than we used to. Let’s remain kind of half in and half out of lockdown. Whether Covid is still around or not. We’ll end up happier as a result.ONE thing Captain Tom showed us, as he walked around his garden as he approached the age of , is that it’s never too late to make a dference.Bob Dylan is just a young whippersnapper by Tom’s standards.But at the age of  he has just made his finest album in at least three decades, and probably more.

Or indeed paws – werewolves do not have a good record of using hand-sanitiser.”By contrast, zombies were praised for their social-distancing technique. “Whenever you see them they are always walking two metres apart with their hands outstretched and bits of flesh falling off their faces,” the same scientist probably added.A spokesman for the National Association of Lycanthropescommented: “This is typical of the prejudice we werewolves face and amounts to discrimination.

The Seventies brought Led Zeppelin and countless rock bands, it gave us heavy metal and punk and Joy Division pretty much all at the same time.The biggest-selling album of the Eighties, Michael Jackson’s Thriller, was actually written by a bloke from Hull, while British greats as erse as Duran Duran and The Smiths ruled the waves.In the Cool Britannia of the Nineties, when Britpop was ringing out of radio networks worldwide, even American stars such as Madonna sought help from British producers such as Nellee Hooper and William Orbit.Then there were the Spice Girls. And Coldplay. Now we’ve got Ed Sheeran and Adele. And it doesn’t stop with artists. Love him or hate him, Simon Cowell’s TV programmes are another British global music phenomenon.But it’s live music where Britain really dominates today. Glastonbury should be taking place this weekend.I’ve played at just about every major festival on the planet, from Coachella in the US to Fuji Rock in Japan, but there is nowhere to touch Glastonbury.It is, quite simply, the greatest show on earth There is a massive ripple effect from Glastonbury. It sets a very high bar for the other  — that’s  — festivals that happen throughout the UK every single summer.And the same crews who build the stages, operate the sound systems, put up the fences and supply the bogs for Glasto are busy for the rest of the summer at other events.Now the independent festival sector is at risk of collapse thanks to the Covid shutdown.Last month, the Association of Independent Festivals , which represents  festivals in the UK, reported that  per cent of its members were facing costs that could ruin their businesses and . per cent were uninsured for Covid- related cancellations.Most of my time these days is spent planning and organising The Big Feastival, which was due to take place here on my farm in Oxfordshire this August Bank Holiday weekend.Of course I’m devastated it won’t be going ahead, but the really sad thing is that it looks like no one is going to hear any live music, new or old this summer.That’s a tragedy for the musicians who rely on gigging to make a living — as well as all the other people whose income relies on live music.The Musicians’ Union says its members have lost more than £million in income during the lockdown. Remember, that most musicians just scrape by at the best of times.Big stars are bigger than ever before, but they are the exception not the rule. When Adele releases another record there is a danger she will become so massive she will collapse into a black hole.But now bands need an audience to play to and also financial support, which used to come from record companies but now is hard to find.Records, or downloads, are basically free these days, so live shows are the only real way to make money.In the same way restaurants were already struggling before lockdown, many of Britain’s smaller live music venues were struggling too.So most of the places I played in the early days with Blur have already dis- appeared. They need to be able to open their doors again, as do festivals.It has to be possible to find a way. Just as with pubs, restaurants and cinemas, you could limit the number of people allowed into a venue.Perhaps more gigs could be seated to ensure social distancing. Not quite the same, but better than nothing.As far as the rest of the planet is concerned, Britain is represented pretty much by the Royal Family, football and music.We must keep our festival circuit alive and nurture new artists.That means we urgently have to find a way for music to be played to a live audience, evenit’s only a small one — so that we can keep meaning something to the rest of the world.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But this is the Government’s vision for our summer as it tries to save businesses while keeping us safe.To which we say: Well, good luck with that. We understand the reasoning.

I mean, I’ve only been able to see Dear Evan Hansen  times so far.And Christmas won’t be the same without the uniquely British tradition of the winter panto. How will all those former boyband stars fund their showbiz lestyles for another year Sadly, post-Covid restrictions look particularly cruel to the arts.Those dastardly droplets mean singing is banned and the idea of packing out a historic theatre where the tiny seats mean you are virtually sitting on top of your neighbour just won’t cut it.But in the middle of an international health emergency it’s all too easy to dismiss the importance of stage shows, movies, the TV industry, festivals and concerts.The attitude seems to be: “We’re dying, goddammit, the economy is cratering, don’t talk to me about the bloody theatre!”But that approach will mean Britain is cakewalking into a cultural catastrophe that could wipe off decades of creative progress, end our modern domination of the arts and entertainment and see the closure of most historic theatres before the end of the year.If that is yet another horrid consequence of Covid-, a disease most likely spread because of a despicable Chinese wet market, I will be fuming.Dame Judi Denchs warning that theatres may not open again in her letime is as stark as it is horrying.It would wipe out £.billion of annual ticket sales, see , good folk lose their jobs and damage tourism.While the pressure is building by the day on the Government to launch yet another unprecedented rescue package, I think that’s only part of the answer.Entertainment is a big-money industry dominated by super-wealthy moguls who have a responsibility to look after as many of their loyal staff and young creatives as humanly possible.Now is the time for other celebrities and businesspeople who have earned a small fortune from the creative industries to give back.Where are all those Hollywood stars, with hundreds of millions in the bank, who rush to perform on the West End stage to be seen as a real actor, dahling Surely they could donate a tiny portion of their wealth to set up a private rescue fund for theatres For example, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the South Park creators who are behind The Book Of Mormon, are worth a billion bucks.JK Rowling, whose Harry Potter play The Cursed Child is at the Palace Theatre, has a £million fortune.We Will Rock You producer Robert de Niro has £million in the bank, Sister Act producer and star Whoopi Goldberg £million, and West End favourite Dame Helen Mirren £million.I could name a hundred other multi-millionaire stars who have used the West End to enhance their careers who owe it to the backroom staff on the breadline to be part of the solution.Thankfully, the king of theatre — Lord Lloyd-Webber — has, as ever, proved inspirational and innovative.Without being asked, he is putting his money where his mouth is to PROVE to the Government that it is possible to safely reopen theatres WITHOUT ANY social distancing by using enhanced precautions such as temperature checks on the door and face masks for all audience members.The Government must listen to him and embrace his case study of Phantom Of The Opera, which has remained open in South Korea throughout the pandemic with no issues.Otherwise, we risk the curtain coming down for good.BACKING down so quickly on extending Sunday trading hours was a disappointing move forced by Tory backbenchers.While on first glance the idea of allowing supermarkets and other shops to stay open longer on our day of rest sounds unappealing to many workers, the reality is that this change would have probably saved many jobs in the long run.It’s nonsensical that on one day of the week most Tescos can only open for six hours, while international delivery services such as Amazon continue to decimate their business, especially now with social-distancing measures making it even more unappealing to spend time lining up outside.By contrast, the other night I was able to order an Amazon Prime Now delivery to arrive at my house at pm on a Sunday night.I’d ordered an Uber Eats takeaway from McDonald’s two hours earlier.The archaic current trading hours laws were introduced in , the year Jeff Bezos created a fledgling online book store called Amazon.Like it or not, that business has created a dferent world of consumerism.Compromises to allow workers the option not to take on more Sunday work, leaving the additional hours to those who want to earn extra cash, could make the necessary move more palatable.But let’s not avoid having the debate.THE Culture Secretary has so much on his plate that Shirley Ballas used an innovative approach to attract his attention this week – and it worked.Launching an impassioned plea to Oliver Dowden to “safely open” ballroom dance studios on my talkRADIO Drivetime show, the Strictly Come Dancing judge teased: “If Oliver is out there, I don’t even mind having a cha-cha-cha with him to show him it is possible to social distance.”Clearly the power of the Queen of Latin remains undiminished.Within hours, Oliver had tweeted: “Shirley, as a Strictly fan, I’m happy to talk about how we can get dancing going safely again. Great offer on the cha-cha-cha – I’ll get practising.”Expect dance studios to be back in business imminently, then.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Being from the UK, it’s one of those gigs I think everyone wants to do. Hopefully next year.“But no f***ing way am I camping. No way. I’d have to build a house for it to work.“I’ve been to so many festivals with my mates but I’ve not done any camping stuff.“I’ve got the worst OCD so I wouldn’t be camping at all. That’s probably why I don’t have crazy stories from festivals.”Essex-born Jonas, whose real name is Guy James Robin, has cemented himself as one of the biggest names in dance music in the past five years, selling more than million records.Today he’s back with summer anthem Naked, featuring US singer MAX, but it won’t be part of a bigger collection after he decided releasing full albums is no longer for him.Jonas said: “I’m not going to be doing an album any time soon. I really enjoy doing singles. I can move quickly with them, especially in the world that I’m in, because the trends are forever changing.“I’m not planning to saturate the market with loads of records, it’s just about putting Naked out and that being my biggest record to date, I hope.”Jonas hopes the song will be “uplting” for people as we come out of lockdown. But as someone who knows nightclubs better than anyone , he insisted there is no chance they can reopen anytime soon.He explained: “Clubs will not work, how can you tell , drunk people to stand a metre or two metres apart  It’s never going to f***ing work.“It wouldn’t work with meI’d had a few drinks. I wouldn’t even know what two metres is at that point.”SHE is usually a Glasto regular and it’s a good bet you will find her partying into the early hours, but Rita Ora will have to make do with her back garden this weekend.The How To Be Lonely singer shared this photo on Instagram while sunbathing at home in her bra in the scorching temperatures.But she didn’t put as much thought into what she’d be wearing as she would have doneshe was heading to Somerset.She captioned the snap: “Can’t find my bikini.”It must have been a welcome relief for her to get outside though, having spent lockdown working hard on new music.She posted another photo of her home studio, where it was C, and wrote: “Hope you are all having fun outside enjoying the sun, meanwhile we’re cutting vocals with no air con.”Just think about all the tunes you’ll have to perform by the time you hit Worthy Farm next year, Rita.The superstar had said her album would be coming in September but her manager has now confirmed it is being pushed back, partly because the coronavirus crisis prevented her from finishing it.Jonathan Dickins said: “It isn’t coming in September. It’ll be ready when it’s ready.“We’re all in the same boat. You’re doing stuff and then suddenly the world stops.“It’ll come when it’s ready. We have music but we’re still working.”It’s been five years since her third album  was released, while January will mark a decade since her breakthrough record  which sold million copies to become one of the biggest records of all time.If Adele has taught us anything with her music, it’s that it will certainly be worth the wait.LITTLE MIX’s Jesy Nelson probably wouldn’t get very far across Worthy Farm in these shoes.She showed off slippers made to look like her pet pooches on Instagram, amid hopes the girl group could be signed up for next year’s festival.They are expected to have released their sixth album by then and could be a perfect signing for a team eager for more female artists.Jesy said in : “We would love to do Glastonbury, it would be incredible for us to do that. I think we’d be able to get a new audience that maybe we don’t have, people who aren’t too sure about Little Mix. We could prove them wrong, change their mind.”The singer, whose song Blue Jumper is out today, was picked up while supporting the band on tour but almost didn’t get to play for a music boss in the crowd.She said: “I’d gone over a little bit on my set. I was about to do my one hit and the stage director said, ‘You need to finish now’.“The head of Universal had just arrived. Richard ran over and was like, ‘No, let her play another’.”FOO FIGHTERS’ incredible  headline set is among a load of performances stream-ing through iPlayer over the weekend. You can also see Beyonce, David Bowie, Blur, George Ezra, Arctic Monkeys and more.THIS year’s festival was due to be the biggest yet but organiser Emily Eavis has insisted ticket holders are in for a bumper event when it s next year.She said they are hoping to roll over much of this year’s line-up, but had already booked loads of acts for , which may even mean making the festival longer.Emily said: “We’re rolling two festivals together for . We’ve got a hell of a lot of surprises and things that we were planning for the thand we’re going to try to get those things going for next year.“Logistically it’s a little bit complicated because we’d already pencilled in many of the acts for . It was one of those very unusual years where you’re quite far ahead, two years ahead, on the line-up. So we’re trying to work out how much we can fit into next year.“We’ve had lots of amazing letters from people with ideas of how we could make it into like a two-week holiday or run over three weekends. There’s lots of ideas going.”Taylor Swt Kendrick Lamar and Sir Paul McCartney were due to headline this weekend and Emily is hoping they will all be back, especially Beatles legend Paul.She said on BBC  Music: “I really hope he’ll be back next year singing it from the Pyramid and we’ll all be in tears, going, ‘It’s happened, we’re back’.”Me too.SIMON BOYLE - COLDPLAY : THEIR fourth time as headline act and they proved to be one of the greatest ever. CHRIS MARTIN and co won over even the most sceptical festivalgoer and had people in tears with their performance, complete with confetti, light-up bracelets and fireworks.JOE KASPER - DAVE : IT wasn’t just his fantastic performance but meeting his fan Alex Mann, who he got up from the crowd to rap his song Thiago Silva. It was enough to convert workmates I had dragged along to become fans of the Mercury Prize winner and, dare I say, grime.HOWELL DAVIES - LORDE : AT only , she proved to be a cut above when she delivered a standout set, partly from within a huge glass box suspended on stage.

Gradually build up time spent apart.Animals have sensitive noses and using pet-specic cleaning products in the home can be helpful to reduce their anxiety.Making sure there are no harsh smells will lower tension levels and allows your pet to relax. .Keep cat litter trays clean, and for very attached pets, especially puppies, leaving something with your scent on, like a T-shirt or old towel, can be soothing.Playing gentle music at a low volume can help to distract from any unfamiliar noises that may worry them.There are even pet podcasts available.Pets who knew le before lockdown should slip back into previous family routines eventually.Cats are already more solitary creatures, and dogs should cope wellyou prepare them properly.However, puppies that have only ever known lockdown, or dogs that have become too used to your company, may find it more challenging.A good way to help them adjust is by pretending to go back to work. Put on office clothes or a school unorm and act out your pre-lockdown morning routines.Go through the motions of leaving for work. Pick up your car keys, settle your pet, then close the door and leave them, evenyou only go and sit in the garden or take a walk.You might feel silly, but this can be really helpful for your pet, especiallythey have only ever seen you in your “off-duty”, stay-home outfits.When you come back in it’s vital that you wait until your pet is calm before greeting them, whether that takes five minutes or five hours.Don’t join in OTT celebrations or encourage reunion “zoomies”, as long- term this can enhance anxious behaviour and increase stress levels.By taking things slowly your pet won’t find the transition back to post-lockdown le too dficult.However,furry friends don’t seem to be settling well and you encounter signs of anxiety, such as toilet issues, high heart rates, constant chewing or scratching, it’s worth seeking advice from a qualied animal behaviourist apbc.org.uk or your vet.A remote camera can give clues to situations you might not be aware of, such as noises, that could be troubling your pet in your absence.With everyone at home constantly during lockdown, our pets may have struggled to rest properly.Cats famously like to snooze but dogs also need up to  hours of sleep a day and may have found lockdown exhausting.Sometimes pets are actually anxious because our constant company means they are over-tired and over-stimulated and now can’t think straight.For all pets it is up to us to ensure they are not disturbed when they are taking time out.Cats are generally good at taking themselves off to cat nap so just leave them to rest, but dogs often need a bit more help to switch off.Don’t fuss over them while they catch some sleep and help children to understand that when their best friend is snoozing, they need to be left in peace.For dogs in particular, lockdown may have changed their exercise routines dramatically, with some getting more frequent or far longer walks than previously.Start to readjust this now, to correlate daily timetables with your regular routines ing.If you normally walk your dog at specic times of the day, such as before and after work, then resume going for walkies on this schedule.Oryou normally use a dog walker or have help from another person during the day, make the effort to introduce them now, especiallyyou have a pet who hasn’t met them yet.If you are one of the many new pet owners who got a puppy or kitten during lockdown you’ve had a lovely honeymoon period to bond with your new buddy.However, it also means it’s likely your pet has never spent any time home alone.Before leaving you new addition solo, you must do sufficient training to ensure your puppy or kitten understands that being separated from you is OK.With puppies, build up slowly to ensure they are happy and get used to the idea of being handled by other people and socialising with other dogs.You can stay with your pupthey are more confident with you around but don’t allow them to be clingy and always reward positive, confident behaviour.For cats, six months is the ideal age to start training with a cat flapyou plan to use one.Professional help with training is now permitted again under government rules and is strongly advised.A bored pet can be an anxious pet. If they are under-stimulated their minds wander and your home can suffer the consequences – so keep them busy.For dogs, toys stuffed with treats, or scattering snacks into their bed to hunt, will give them something to do.There are also tutorials online for making home-made games and toys.For cats, include circuits and teasers to prevent your furniture being damaged.Rotate dferent ones daily, so there is always something new for your pet to investigate and play with.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But the Chairman of the Local Government Associations Community Wellbeing Board said they did not have the resources to deal with the massive crowds. Councillor Ian Hudspeth said: “It is hugely dficult for a council to keep beaches open to the public while also limiting the number of people who visit. Closing beaches in one area may also simply sht the problem where.“Councils and the emergency services cannot be left to manage this issue alone.

Professor Whitty wrote on Twitter last night: COVID- circulation has gone down due to the efforts of everyone but is still in general circulation. If we do not follow social distancing guidance then cases will rise again. Naturally people will want to enjoy the sun but we need to do so in a way that is safe for all.

Mr Ellwood warned that he would hate to see Bournemouth or any seaside resort be where the second spike is the first to appear. The local authorities needed to be handed out greater powers and resources to shut down and close beachesthey are swamped with people, the MP said.Mr Ellwood added: We need to make sure no beach was like yesterday, those scenes were unacceptable, until there is a vaccine we should not be seeing this. He said it was a perfect storm where people were still furloughed and children were out of classrooms and everyone decided to pile into the beach. When asked about the over-crowding on beaches, a spokesman for Downing Street said: Everyone should be able to enjoy the sunshine, and we understand that people want to enjoy public spaces.But it is important we dont undo the hard work of the British public in reducing the transmission of this virus.It is a matter for local authorities to manage numbers, alongside emergency services and Public Health England.As we saw yesterday they are best placed to make those decisions on a case-by-case basis.We have been clear that should we see case numbers increase we will introduce local lockdowns.Pressed on whether the Government would close beaches, the Number  spokesman said: It is for local authorities to manage numbers.I believe Matt Hancock, when he spoke, was referring to the powers to impose localised lockdowns which we have been clear throughout may need to be the casewe see case numbers rise in a particular area.But the Twitter account for No promptly posted a tweet, warning people to stay socially distanced at Britains beaches. George Eustice, the Environment Secretary, said this morning: Clearly yesterday we had droves of people going to the beach in very large numbers, that was much more dficult. We do have powers to put in place closures should that be necessary.If it were necessary to do that to control the virus, then we would. We have the powers to do itneeded, just as we had the powers to do the lockdown. Shocking pictures of the aftermath of the crowds show the beach had been trashed with tins of rubbish, beer cans and glass bottles.Local authority staff were hard at work this morning trying to clean up the beach. When asked about the worrying scenes, a spokesman for the PM said: What I would say is that the PM and the Governments scientic and medical advisers have stressed the great importance of the public continuing to adhere to social distancing advice. Its only because of the publics hard work that weve been able to bring the virus under control.“If the rules don’t continue to be followed and the virus starts to spread exponentially again, then we will look at having to reverse some of the easements that we’ve put into place.And I dont think anyone in the British public would want for that to happen.When announcing that most of the lockdown measures would be lted next Saturday, Boris Johnson repeatedly stressed he would not hesitate to bring in local or national lockdowns in necessary. The fears over a second wave of coronavirus comes after The Sun revealed MPs have been worried about the risk of transmission on beaches for weeks. People blatantly disregarded social distancing rules over night as well, at illegal rave parties in London.

The aircraft touched the runway surface on its engines,” the inquiry found.In the wake of the crash Pakistan’s aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan said that human error on the part of the pilot and co-pilot as well as air traffic control caused the plane crash.The pilot and co-pilot were not focused and throughout they were having a conversation about corona.The [virus] was on their minds.

You see a black Jesus, or a Chinese Jesus, or a Middle Eastern Jesus - which of course is the most accurate - or a Fijian Jesus, he said.His points were made in response to being askedthe “way the Western church portrays Jesus needs to be thought about again”.The clergyman told how monuments across the CofE, including Canterbury Cathedral, were being looked at “very carefully” to seethey all “should be there”. Rev Welby urged campaigners to show forgiveness for the “trespasses” of people immortalised in the form of statues, rather than tearing them down. He said: “We can only do thatweve got justice, which means the statue needs to be put in context. Some will have to come down.”He added: “Some names will have to change. I mean, the church, goodness me, you know, you just go around Canterbury Cathedral, theres monuments everywhere, or Westminster Abbey, and were looking at all that, and some will have to come down.“But yes, there can be forgiveness, I hope and pray as we come together, but onlytheres justice.“If we change the way we behave now, and say this was then and we learned from that, and change how were going to be in the future, internationally, as well.”Rev Welby said: “Were going to be looking very carefully and putting them in context and seeingthey all should be there.”He said it is “what people do at times like this,” adding: And its a good thing, but there has to be, for forgiveness, there has to be this turning round, this conversion, the Pope called it.“The change of heart that says we learned from them not to be like that, and to change the way we are in the future.”Dozens of sculptures line the walls of the magnicent Cathedral in Canterbury, ranging from William, Duke of Normandy to Queen Elizabeth II.It is unclear which statues will be reviewed, and Lambeth Palace did not immediately respond to request for clarication.In , retired medical artist Richard Neave recreated the face of Jesus by studying Semite skulls using modern-day forensic techniques.His portrait shows the Son of God may have had a wide face, dark eyes, a bushy beard and short curly hair, as well as a tanned complexion.These features would likely have been typical of Middle Eastern Jews in the Galilee area of northern Israel.Dr Neave stressed the portrait was that of an adult man living at the same time, in the same place as Jesus.The absence of a physical description of Jesus in the Bible has left his appearance open to suggestion with Caucasian men dominating likenesses of him in Western culture.The earliest depictions showed him as a typical Roman man, wearing a tunic with short hair and no beard - with his facial hair first said to have made an appearance in AD.Medieval art in Europe typically showed him with brown hair and pale skin - an image strengthened during the Renaissance, by works including Leonardo da Vinci The Last Supper painting.In  white American Ted Neeley played the Messiah in the film version of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Jesus Christ Superstar musical.In  white Brit Robert Powell played the lead role in TV show Jesus of Nazareth before American Jim Cavaziel played the figure in The Passion of the Christ.Jesus has also been depicted as Latino or an Aboriginal.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’m worried the Government are taking their eye off the ball when it comes to the terror threat.“My message to them is, ‘Please do more to ensure no other families ever endure the hell we have’. ”Julie, , a registered pharmacy technician from Leeds, marked yesterday’s anniversary by releasing a balloon at her father’s grave.The last time she spoke to her dad, a retired power station worker, was Father’s Day in June , when they exchanged texts saying they loved each other.The pensioners, from Goole, East Yorks, who were married  years, had picked the five-star Imperial Marhaba Hotel in Sousse because they had stayed there before and it was close to the beach. They also believed it was safe.Julie says: “Before they flew to Tunisia, Mum and Dad had seen the news about the attack in Tunisia’s Bardo Museum months earlier. But dad had rung the tour operator and been assured it was safe to go.“When we swapped messages on Father’s Day I missed him but I knew they were having the time of their lives.”Five days after sending that message Julie was sitting in a restaurant in Leeds with her sister Sharon, , when a new text from her mum arrived. It said simply: “Ring me ASAP.”She says: “I called and Mum’s voice was shaking. She said, ‘We’ve been attacked. A gunman has been in the hotel and he’s shot your dad dead’.“My brain couldn’t process it. I looked at my sister, who told me my face had gone grey.”Julie ushered her sister outside. “I told her and she collapsed on to a bench,” Julie says. “It was a nice sunny day and people were walking past living their lives — but ours had stopped.”The details of what had unfolded in Tunisia were unimaginable. IS fanatic Seeddine Rezgui, , had stormed the resort in Sousse armed with a Kalashnikov assault rle, picking off victims in a killing spree that lasted almost  minutes.Julie says: “When the attack happened Mum and Dad had been lying by the pool sunbathing. Then, suddenly, they heard a bang.At first they thought someone was letting off fireworks. Then a man at the hotel shouted ‘Run!’ and screamed that a gunman was on the loose.”The couple fled but became separated in the chaos. When Rita got to the lobby, she saw an open door and went inside to take cover.Julie adds: “She could see the gunman through the crack. The sounds of gunfire were getting closer and Mum could hear the bullets.” When the gunfire stopped, Rita went to look for her husband.Julie says: “Mum went down the corridor and could see a body covered with a sheet. Then she saw some flip flops had been placed on top of the sheet and realised they were my dad’s.”Bungling officials made Rita’s ordeal worse when she arrived at the mortuary to identy her husband.Julie explains: “They laid out pictures of everyone that died. Mum had to look through them all until she got to Dad. Those pictures will haunt her for ever.“When Mum got home, and we met her at the airport, it just didn’t seem real. There were no words.”Julie said one of the hardest things was waiting for her dad to be ed home. Bruce, a devoted grandfather, was eventually repatriated around a week later on a flight to RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire. Julie says: “When I saw that big grey plane it was awful. Then, one by one, the coffins were brought off. That sight will live with me for ever.”In the days that followed, Rita, , received her letter from Charles.“Our hearts go out to you more than you can possibly realise,” he wrote. Having lost my beloved Great Uncle, Lord Mountbatten, at the hands of IRA terrorists I can at least understand something of what you are going through.“It is beyond belief that someone could behave in such a brutal, callous and abominable way.”The family later met Charles and Camilla at the National Memorial Arboretum, in Staffs, where a memorial dedicated to British victims of overseas terrorism was unveiled.“Camilla was incredible with my mum,” Julie says. “She told her how deeply shocked she was. Both her and Charles wanted to make sure we’d been getting all the support we needed.”The family also met Prince Harry at a service last year to remember victims of the attack.Julie says: “He told us it was very important we made sure we were getting all the help we required to cope with the loss.”Julie adds: “For a long time there was anger but you eventually have to let go or it consumes you.“But forgiveness is not an option. We don’t speak his name. You don’t think something like that will ever happen to your own family. Losing our father in such a horric way is something we’ll never get over.”Julie says the incident on Saturday in Reading, where three people died, brought the nightmare back to le.“It stopped me in my tracks,” she says.“Those poor people who lost loved ones are now going to start the journey we’ve been on for the past five years. My heart goes out to them.” Julie fears lessons have not been learned from the Tunisia atrocity, adding: “My big fear, as we come out of lockdown, is there could be a move towards encouraging people to go back to places that aren’t safe. People that go over there, in my view are sitting targets.”Five years on from the attacks, Julie is angry that firmer advice wasn’t given to her father about the dangers in Tunisia.She said: “If my dad had been told there was any risk he wouldn’t have gone. He was the best dad any daughter could wish for.”Rezgui was shot dead by police and seven others were sentenced to le in prison last February.But Julie says there are still “unanswered questions”.She said: “Are all those responsible now in prison  I’d also like to knowany of the hotel staff were involved. Were they a part of the plot and are they still out there “I don’t think anything has changed in Tunisia. The hotel has been given a lick of paint and that’s it. They’ve even removed the plaque which was supposed to commemorate the victims.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

However, it remains unclear whether British nationals could be forced into self-isolation as they begin their holidays. The UK Government is still in talks with countries in a bid to persuade them not to quarantine UK tourists when they arrive. An official announcement is expected next week when the Prime Minister is expected to confirm deals for “air bridges” or “travel corridors” have been struck with some overseas governments. Britons would be able to begin their trips to those destinations the following week. A traffic light system will decide which nations are safe to travel to, with those classed as green or amber available to holidaymakers. Experts have studied how re coronavirus is within countries, whether the UK can trust their Covid- figures, and whether their infection rates are falling, climbing or flatlining. Britons holidaying in “green” or “amber” countries will not have to self-isolate for  days when they get back. But foreign governments could still look at Britainaposs death toll – the highest in Europe – and decide they want to quarantine arrivals from the UK. The Foreign Office will change its travel advice for certain nations. It has advised against all non-essential travel to anywhere in the world for more than three months.  A Government spokesman said: “Our public health measures at the border were put in place to manage the risk of imported cases and help prevent a second wave of the virus, and will continue to support our fight against coronavirus. “Our new risk-assessment system will enable us to carefully open a number of safe travel routes around the world, giving people the opportunity for a summer holiday abroad and boosting the UK economy through tourism and business. “But we will not hesitate to put on the brakesany risks re-emerge, and this system will enable us to take swt action to re-introduce self-isolation measuresnew outbreaks occur overseas.” The aviation and travel industries have been pleading with ministers to thrash out air bridges with countries where the risk of contracting Covid- is deemed low. Crisis-hit airlines have seen bookings tumble and announced plans for thousands of redundancies. The traffic light system, drawn up by the Joint Biosecurity Centre, come as the Government finishes the first review of its quarantine regime. The controversial scheme was introduced on June  by Home Secretary Priti Patel.  She claimed it would minimise the danger of arrivals from abroad bringing the infection to the UK. But critics said Britain had a higher rate of disease than many of the countries from which people were travelling. They insisted a -day isolation for foreign arrivals should have been introduced at least three months earlier when coronavirus was spreading around the globe. But the Government tonight insisted the quarantine system remained crucial to its hopes of avoiding a second wave of infections. People travelling from countries deemed at red risk of Covid- will still have to self-isolate on their arrival. All people arriving from abroad, including British nationals ing from countries deemed safer, will still have to supply their contact information so health officials can trace themsomeone they have been near, for example on a plane, displays symptoms or tests positive for Covid-.

The family were enjoying a sunny day sightseeing in London and had eaten a picnic together by the Thames before visiting the gallery. The six-year-old boy had skipped ahead of his parents when he was snatched by mentally disturbed Jonty Bravery and hurled over the railing on the th floor - resulting in le-changing injuries that have left him in a wheelchair and requiring round-the-clock care. Bravery, then , had been researching the best way to kill someone and had decided he would throw someone from the viewing  at the art gallery after first trying to get into the Shard earlier in the afternoon. He had already told care workers of a plan to push someone off a high building roughly a year earlier. And despite a record of violence he was allowed out unsupervised. The Old Bailey heard the th-floor viewing gallery on August  was packed with visitors some of whom noticed the defendant because he was behaving in an unusual way. Bravery, now , was jailed for a minimum of  years on Friday. He was acting so weird... I told my kids to stay away Nancy Barnfield, visiting with her two young sons, says she told her children to stay away from the man who was aposacting weirdapos and following people around. At the time of the attack Bravery was in the care of Hammersmith and Fulham Council. He lived in a flat in Northolt, west London, with round-the-clock care.  In the autumn of  Bravery was recorded saying: In the next few months Iaposve got it in my head Iaposve got to kill somebody. It could be the Shard, it could be anything just as long as itaposs a high thing and we can go up and visit it and then push somebody off it and I know for a fact theyaposll die from falling from a hundred feet. The French mum and dad, enjoying the Tate with their six-year-old son while spending a week in London, had no idea what danger they were in. Mum-of-two Nancy, , was alarmed by Braveryaposs strange behaviour. She told the Daily Mail: He followed us around everywhere. I told my kids to stay away from that man, it went on for ages. He was acting so weird. He had his hands behind his back the whole time, his back to the wall, just watching people. We walked away from him then immediately when he was out of sight a woman was screaming aposMy son, my sonapos and people were grabbing him.apos CCTV showed the six-year-old boy with his parents admiring the view, but as they turned away from the railings the schoolboy skipped ahead - this was all the opportunity Bravery needed.  The court heard how as the boy “approached, the defendant scooped him up and, without hesitation, carried him straight to the railings and threw him over”. The six-year-old plunged ft onto the roof of the fth-floor. At one point, he appears to shrug and laugh. Deanna Heer, prosecuting, said CCTV also showed the defendant backing away from the railings after throwing the boy. She said: He can be seen to be smiling, with his arms raised. At one point, he appears to shrug and laugh. The footage also capturesparentsapos disbelief and rising panic at what had just happened. She said the boyaposs father initially thought the incident was a joke until he saw his sonaposs distorted body  feet below. Challenged by the father, Bravery replied Yes, I am mad Challenged by the father, Bravery said: Yes, I am mad, the prosecutor said. He had suffered catastrophic injuries but was clinging to le.  The prosecutor said the boyaposs mother was becoming increasingly hysterical after witnessing the incident. She said Bravery had a big smile on his face.

The boy survived but has suffered severe le-changing injuries.  After screaming out in horror about her son the French mum then attempted to get in a lt down to the fth floor. Bravery, from Ealing in west London, then sought out Tate staff and confessed: I think Iaposve murdered someone, Iaposve just thrown someone off the balcony. He was reportedly punched in the face by one man. Security guards at the scene had to take him into one of the toilets and lock him inside for his own protection while police and ambulance swarmed to the scene.  The gallery, one of Londonaposs most popular tourist attractions, was placed on lockdown. Bravery told police he heard voices in his head telling him to kill or injure someone. He said had to prove a point to every idiot who said he had no mental health problems, and asked policethe incident was going to be on the news. He said: I wanted to be on the news, who I am and why I did it, so when it is official no-one can say anything . Bravery apossearched for the most vulnerable childapos The Old Bailey heard the defendant admitted that he had planned the offence well in advance and researched the easiest way to kill someone. The prosecutor said: He narrowed it down to three possibilities: strangling a woman or a child, drowning a child or throwing someone off a tall building.  The court heard Bravery searched for the most vulnerable child at the Tate Modern. Ms Heer said Bravery told medical experts he felt undestructableand on top of the world after throwing the boy off the viewing . In December Bravery pleaded guilty to attempted murder. Bravery, who has autistic spectrum disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder and is believed to have a personality disorder, has been held at Broadmoor Hospital since mid-October. The six-year-old victim suffered a bleed to the brain, spinal fractures, and broken legs and arms. aposThe act committed against our son is unspeakableapos A victim impact statement from the victimaposs parents, taken six months after the incident, said they had not left their sonaposs side at all, other than for just a couple of hours. They only ed to the family home on rare occasions to collect belongings. Either they, or a grandparent, stayed with him overnight in hospital. They said their boy has endured months of fear and rehabilitation but remains weak, is in a wheelchair and has to wear a corset that is moulded to his waist. In a statement read by Met Police officer Melanie Pressley outside the Old Bailey, the French boyaposs parents said: He has many years of physiotherapy ahead of him and we have no prospects or plan for the future other than being by his side. They said he has endured months of pain, fear and rehabilitation, hours and days spent without moving, without eating, away from his home away from his friends and away from his family.

The Mirror can reveal the “development manager” is a company which has donated £, to the Tories. It is run by Ian Livingstone, who the Prime Minister appointed to the board of his Mayor’s Fund for London. Mr Johnson approved the original plans for the East London site during his final days as Mayor of the capital. He was asked by the developers to replace Tower Hamlets Council in determining the planning application in . It was made by a company owned by Mr Desmond but the developer was London and Regional Properties, a firm behind £billion of building projects owned by Mr Livingstone and brother Richard.

Mr Johnson’s Deputy Mayor Sir Edward Lister, now his Chief Strategic Advisor, overruled it in .  Mr Desmond’s company Northern and Shell then doubled the size of the development to , homes in . Mr Jenrick approved the revised scheme in January, overruling Tower Hamlets Council’s % affordable housing concerns. It came just a day before a new community infrastructure levy to support local development came in, saving Northern and Shell £million. After a legal challenge by the council in the High Court, Mr Jenrick accepted his decision was “unlawful by reason of apparent bias” and quashed it.  It emerged this week he gave Mr Desmond, the former owner of the , his phone number at a Tory fundraiser in November. Mr Desmond also met Mr Johnson at the event but the PM denies discussing the Westferry development. Mr Desmond texted Mr Jenrick to hurry him up as “we don’t want to give Marxists loads of doe for nothing!” Emails from officials suggest Mr Jenrick pushed for a rapid decision.  Mr Desmond gave a personal donation of £, in January, two weeks after Mr Jenrick intervened.

Senior scientists advising ministers are convinced new infections are “flat, maybe up a bit” in recent weeks and are calling on Brits not to assume “it’s party time”. They remain at around , new confirmed cases a day as newly released Sage papers suggest ministers may agree this is an “acceptable incidence” level. Scientists on the Independent Sage group announced that staying at current levels would lead to an extra , deaths. It comes as the Government is about to initiate a major further lting of lockdown measures reopening pubs and allowing larger groups to meet up. A senior Government scientic adviser said: “This is not party time, this is time to go very carefully with these new release of measures.” He added: “Determining acceptable incidence is a matter for Government.” The Office for National Statisticssurveillance study estimated on Thursday that new infections were steady at more than , a day in the last fortnight for which data is available. They had been falling since April. However this was contradicted by separate figures published by the Government that cases were still falling at between % and % a day. The uncertainty came on a day images were taken around the country of packed beaches and violent street gatherings. The Government adviser said: “It’s quite possible this is a true flattening and it might be down to increased contacts.” Looking at the number of confirmed cases following a positive test, there are around , new cases a day.  More papers were released by the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencieson Friday including a draft note dated May . It recommended: “Decreasing daily incidence of symptomatic cases in all regions across the UK until the target acceptable incidence is reached, then incidence kept below that target. “This target is yet to be specied and needs to be spelt out. We suggest , new symptomatic swab +ve cases per day in the UK.” It then added that this acceptable level would be “policy decision”. It comes after latest daily deaths of people after testing positive were at  on Thursday. This took the official UK death toll to ,.  The Independent Sage group of scientists yesterday told an online media briefing yesterday Britain was lting lockdown too soon and could follow the US in triggering a huge new spike. Prof Christina Pagel, of University College London, said: “New daily infections have stopped their downward trend and have been level for the last few weeks. “I think Chris Whitty said recently that he was expecting this kind of level to carry on for about another nine months in to next year. “If we carry on with  to  deaths a day that’s over , deaths. “I think we really, really need to keep that downward trend.” It also estimated that NHS Test and Trace is only reaching a third of symptomatic Covid- cases and obtaining details of contacts.

He told the PA news agency: Usually in the winter when we have hail it is quite small, but this time of the year, because the heat gives the thunderstorms more energy and helps keep the hail stones up in the clouds for longer, they get to grow more and then fall from the sky. A Met Office spokesman said: Heavy showers and thunderstorms are likely to break out on Friday afternoon and evening. Many places will miss the storms, but where they do occur, torrential downpours could bring - mm rain in a hour, with hail and lightning. The storms will slowly clear northeastwards on Friday afternoon and into the evening, though will probably not clear northeast Scotland until Saturday morning. A Met Office rain warning has also been issued for tomorrow, with flooding of homes and roads expected. The alert will be in force from am to pm across all of Scotland, with up to mm of rain expected to fall within a few hours.

It clearly isn’t. Documents show the Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick signed off the development by Tory donor Richard Desmond even though his own officials advised against it. They also show Mr Jenrick hurried along the decision knowing it would save the billionaire from having to pay £million that would have benefited one of Britain’s poorest areas. Today the Mirror reveals that one of the other key players behind the development is another Tory donor with close links to the PM. If Mr Johnson wants to draw a line under the issue he needs to come clean. Downing Street is refusing to say what communications the Prime Minister or any of his aides had with Mr Desmond. The more Mr Johnson tries to sweep this under the carpet the more it will seem that his party is willing to do cash for favours.

SpaceX is scheduled to launch  Starlink satellites from a Falcon . This will be the th mission in support of the constellation of networked satellites known as Starlink. The goal of Starlink is to create a network that will help provide internet services to those who are not yet connected, and to provide reliable and affordable internet across the globe. The controversial Space X project aims to beam low-cost Wi-Fi to remote areas by using thousands of satellites.

During the launch, the unmanned Falcon  rocket will carry the satellites into orbit, before attempting to land at sea.

Starlink explained: “With performance that far surpasses that of traditional satellite internet, and a global network unbounded by ground infrastructure limitations, Starlink will deliver high speed broadband internet to locations where access has been unreliable, expensive, or completely unavailable.”However, several astronomers have raised concerns that one of the satellites, which are solar-powered and usually orbit around  miles above Earth, could pass in front of a telescope and obscure an image. In a recent study, published in arXiv, researchers led by Stefano Gallozzi, wrote: Depending on their altitude and surface reflectivity, their contribution to the sky brightness is not negligible for professional ground based observations. With the huge amount of about , new articial satellites for telecommunications planned to be launched in Medium and Low Earth Orbit, the mean density of articial objects will be of gt satellite for square sky degree this will inevitably harm professional astronomical images.If you want to track the satellites in real-time, you can visit the Find Starlink website, via a livestream on Space Xaposs YouTube channel, or Nasaaposs TV website."},{"url":null,"title":"haunting photos home girl starved","story":"NewsHaunting photos of home where girl starved to death and was eaten by ratsMark James Dunn, , was charged with the murder after his daughter Willow Dunn, , was found dead in an advanced state of decomposition at a home in Brisbane, AustraliaShareCommentsByNeil MurphyRyan Merrield:,  JUN NewsWillows body was found in a back bedroom having been left for days, its claimed\", url\"Dont miss our email newsletter with regular round-ups of the biggest headlines When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

A post-mortem examination concluded Willow was experiencing serious malnourishment and other health issues that indicated sustained mistreatment. It also alleged she had scalp burns and bone-deep infected hip sores. Willow grew up without her biological mother - who died in childbirth - and lived with Dunn, as well as a stepmother and stepsister in their rented home.

However, this does not mean he has something to hide. About the suspect, Mr Fülscher said he makes a calm and friendly impression and has never been loud or angry during their meetings. Madeleine went missing on May , , from the resort in Portugal. The three-year-old was left asleep in the apartment with her two siblings while her parents were having dinner at a nearby tapas restaurant.  The night before Madeleine disappeared, Brueckner allegedly told him then-girlfriend he had a horrible job to do. His former partner later asked himhe abducted the three-year-old and he warned her just donapost go there, it is claimed. The woman claims Brueckner, then , told her: I have a job to do in Praia da Luz tomorrow.It’s a horrible job but it’s something I have to do and it will change my le. You won’t be seeing me for a while. A friend of the woman said she did not take Brueckneraposs comments seriously that night because she did not think he was capable of doing something terrible. The friend said: What he [Brueckner] said at that dinner suggests he planned the whole thing very carefully and that he might even have stolen Madeleine to order. But we also can’t help feeling guilty thinking we should have pulled together all the clues years ago and gone to the police.  A phone call received by Brueckner just before Maddie disappeared placed him in the Praia da Luz area. It was received on a mobile phone belonging to the suspect at .pm and finished at .pm. German investigators are now trying to trace the owner of the phone used to call Brueckner on the night Madeleine disappered. Hans Christian Wolters, the German prosecutor heading the investigation, suspects that a member of the Ocean Club in Praia da Luz may have helped the prime suspect target the apartment where Madeleine was asleep.  Mr Wolters said: This is of interest to us. The phone call made by the suspect could be between him and a member of staff who told him when to break into the McCanns’ apartment. German police said they want to trace the person who called Brueckner before they interview the suspect in prison, The Sunday Times reported. They added there is no evidence the employee knew about Madeleineaposs kidnap in advance, but speaking to the person who made the phone call could help them understand what happened that night. Mr Wolters said: At the momentwe interview the suspect he could say, ‘My girlfriend had my phone that night and I didn’t have it’. The person he spoke to could put the phone in his hand [by confirming that it was definitely Brückner to whom he spoke], which would mean he was in the area at the time. This is the evidence we want before we issue an arrest warrant and then interview him for the murder. It would help the case against him — but we would also need more evidence.

He put men in skirts and women in bomber jackets. Models were presented as both sensual and tough.Aarticle published in  said that Ray#s vision coincided with the very beginning of what has subsequently become the commercialisation and mass consumption of street style.He, quite notably, brought the MA flight jacket into the public consciousness by pairing it with loose-fitting Levi#s jeans. Add a porkpie hat and a pair of brogues and you#ve got Petri#s signature personal look.The most influential # and probably most successful # fashion image creator of the #s, his work celebrated culture and inspired people to forge their own identity.In an interview with the New York Times, French photographer Jean-Baptiste Mondino, who collaborated with Petri on multiple projects, recalled his love of classic Italian tailoring #done in a Caribbean way#.#Ray was obsessed with extra-long shirt sleeves, so he would cut them off at the shoulder and reattach them with big safety pins so that they stuck out under suit jackets,” Mondino said.One of the most recognised images associated with the Buffalo collective featured on the cover of the March  issue of The Face. Taken by Jamie Morgan, the photograph captures a scowling -year-old boy wearing men#s clothes, with the word #killer# emblazoned on his hat.The provocative photograph was shot on mm black and white film and is seen as a rejection of the female-focused, soft and colourful photography that was happening in fashion magazines at that time.For Barry Kamen, the image was about #taking gentleman’s hats and dferent sartorial influences and putting a Jamaican spin on it, then dressing these things on a young, -year-old Jewish boy#.He said: #It was giving it a dferent spin, and then putting the headline on it, like the front page of a newspaper.#In , Petri developed what looked like a stye on his eye. This turned out to be Kaposi#s sarcoma # an AIDS-related tumour involving the skin and other organs # which would eventually spread all over his face and body.Despite his illness he continued to work, although a lack of knowledge and understanding surrounding the disease meant that many did not know how to react to him.Jean Paul Gaultier, who held a front-row seat for Petri until his death aged  in , said: “I was actually criticised for that by people working in the business, which made me very upset.“I felt that it was extremely courageous of Ray to expose himself. It was a show of strength, which I admired and had to support. But others refused to see the truth.”Petri didn#t live long enough to enjoy financial or mainstream success from his work, but his legacy lives on.From Helmut Lang and David Beckham # who once channelled Petri#s vision by wearing a patterned sarong over a pair of trousers during the  World Cup in France # to the thousands of millennials whose urban style is based on a mix of sportswear and fashion, he was a man who left an indelible mark on the world.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

They have been working so hard for the last few weeks and the new session, regardless of how we come back, is going to be really dficult.”Blended learning is a necessary contingency plan in case the virus gets out of control again.#Scottish GovernmentA Scottish Government spokeswoman said: “Blended learning is a necessary contingency plan in case the virus gets out of control again.“We know how hard councils, schools and teachers have been working on this # it is vital work and we can’t thank them enough.“The scientic evidence and public health advice under-pinning our planning is being kept under constant review and we will make a decision on no later than July  on whether schools canfull-time.“In the meantime, the education recovery group, which brings together councils, teachers’ representatives, parent bodies and trades unions, will continue to meet over the summer to discuss the next steps to ensure the reopening of schools.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

They are doing the same to support other temporary NHS services across Scotland.Our people have worked around the clock with health boards across the country to offer new, technical solutions to help frontline health workers get on with their jobs during this crisis.Our frontline staff in contact centres across Scotland – including Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Greenock – have risen to this unprecedented challenge. We’ve received a huge surge of customers asking for faster connections to help with home working, home schooling and running their businesses remotely.These colleagues – most of whom can now work from home when they want to – have performed a critical role keeping our customers, including frontline health workers and vulnerable people, connected.The people in our two  contact centres in Scotland are also playing a critical role, answering lesaving emergency calls.I couldn’t be more proud of how my colleagues have responded to these challenges and their desire to help us all through this crisis.Jane Wood, BT Group director in Scotland, Edinburgh.COVID- is seriously not a jokeGlobally kills thousands of folkYou start coughing, you can#t breatheWithout a respirator, this earth you#ll leaveSocial distancing is now in placeKeep two metres apart, not face to faceWash your hands frequently and well hours on surfaces it can dwellShop infrequently, for essentials onlyDon#t mix with othersyou#re lonelyKeep in touch by text and phoneDon#t put yourself at risk, stay aloneIt#s hoped soon this contagion will peakThen we canto normal, so to speakDon#t travel to other towns by carIt can spread the virus near and farSports, socialising and most work on holdThe alternative could cause damage untoldSupport the NHS, essential workers and neighboursThen we#ll defeat this virus by all our laboursDugald MacGilp, Lochgilphead.Sir,We are looking for people who have the passion to bring communities together, believe in the power of co-operation and who hold the well-being of their community at the forefront of their mind.The successful #Member Pioneers# will receive full training and business support as they help groups and iniduals during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond.

Action is needed and the bullies must be confronted. That they were allowed to behave in this way for so long is the real shocker.Their own managers have questions to answer. Why was this not nipped in the bud  Is there an ongoing lack of management training and support Whatever the reasons, it has to stop now.Minard folk were surprised to find themselves in the papers, on television and on the radio this week.

People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited. The charity has created a free pack full of tips, ideas and videos to help people host their own virtual picnic.You can hold your picnic in your garden, on your balcony or on the living room floor.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

yesterday revealed news that many people across Scotland were waiting to hear.As part of the countryrsquos move into Phase  in the route map out of lockdown, Nicola Sturgeon announced plans for an lsquoextended householdrsquo.She said the Scottish Government was mindful of the ldquowider harms that come from the restrictions put in place to tackle the coronavirus ndash including ldquoloneliness and isolation, particular for older people living alone and lone parents.And while the idea of an extended household has wide-ranging benefits, therersquos one aspect in particular, sometimes dubbed a ldquosex bubble, that has people talking.The new arrangements, permitted from today, means that non-cohabiting couples - where at least one of them lives alone - can be reunited indoors without social distancing for the first time in three months.What can I do under an lsquoextended household rsquoWithin an extended household group, people will be able to meet indoors, without physical distancing and stay overnight - though onlythey wish.But they must continue to see any other households outdoors only, and stay more than  metres apart from them.Who can form one Only people who live alone, or who live only with children under -years-old, can form an extended household.The idea is it could allow, for example, a grandparent who lives on their own to form a group with another household in their family.It will allow a single parent and their children to join with another household for support.And, of course, couple who live apartcan be reunited and stay over.But, an important detail to note: people who are shielding cannot form an extended household.Can I have more than one extension No. A person should not form an extended household with more than one other household.Can I leave my lsquobubblersquo Yes, you can.Households can agree to end the arrangement at any time ndash but they should not then form a subsequent lsquobubblersquo with another household. So perhaps choose wisely.Whatsomeone in my lsquoextended householdrsquo gets coronavirus This is where it gets tricky.Put simply,one member of your extended household gets the virus, the entire group has to isolate.This is regardless of whether or not they are living in the same property.As an addition to that, Ms Sturgeon said: ldquoI would also encourage those who choose to form extended households to pay particular attention to hygiene measures ndash to reduce the risk that one household will bring the virus into another.When will this be extended to other groups of people The First Minister did not provide a date on when this could be extended to more people.But she added she will ldquoconsiderand to what extent we can expand it over the next few weeks, admitting it will not immediately make a dference to everyone.She urged the public to visit the Scottish Government websitefor more information, adding: ldquoWith the best will in the world, we cannot provide precise answers for every bespoke situation.ldquoSo when in doubt, use your judgement and err on the side of caution."},{"url":null,"title":"jeweller-shuts-galashiels-shop-permanently","story":"JEWELLER H.Samuel has announced its Galashiels shop will close permanently in June.The company says the coronavirus pandemic sped up existing plans to shut some stores across the UK.A spokesperson said: \"Our H.

infected person will pass the virus to on average.Coronavirus has an estimated reproduction number of three, meaning an infected person will likely pass the virus on to at least three other people.A

single dose, astudy in pigs has revealed.The ChAdOx nCoV-vaccine -developed by the University of Oxford - is currently undergoing human trials and it is hoped an effective vaccine could be ready later this year.Previous research indicated that macaques were protected against lung disease after a single immunisation.Now the Pirbright Institute, working with the University of Oxford, has shown that two doses of the Covid- vaccine might produce a greater immune response in pigs and therefore be a more effective approach to developing a protective response.What did the study find In the study, researchers saw a marked increase in neutralising antibodies, which bind to the virus in a way that blocks infection.It is not yet known what level of immune response will be required to protect humans against SARS-CoV- .Researchers said the finding in pigs is important as it suggests that two doses of the new vaccine could potentially give signicantly more protection in humans than a single dose.But they said further research in humans is required.What has Professor Bryan Charleston said Professor Bryan Charleston, director of the Pirbright Institute, said: ldquoThese results look encouraging that administering two injections with the same vaccine boosts antibody responses that can neutralise the virus, but it is the response in humans that is important.ldquoThe pig has proved to be a valuable model for testing human vaccines for other diseases to give an indication of the type of immune response induced and testing dferent doses.ldquoPigs are more physiologically similar to humans than some other animal models ndash for example, their body weight and metabolic rate ndash and are more accessible than studies using non-human primates.In the research, the pigs were split into two groups, with both receiving an initial dose of the vaccine, and one group receiving an identical booster immunisation on day  of the study.Latest developments are very encouragingProfessor Simon Graham, the lead author of the study, said: ldquoWhile it remains to be determined what immune responses are required to effectively protect people against Covid-, the demonstration that ChAdOx nCoV- induces both neutralising antibody and T cell responses is very encouraging.ldquoIt is likely that a combination of these responses would act in synergy to prevent and control infection, as we and others have recently shown in the context of experimental flu vaccines.What has the reaction been to this update Dr Stephen Grfin, associate professor in the school of medicine, University of Leeds, added: ldquoThe work done at Pirbright is an encouraging advance in support of the Oxford vaccine on three important fronts.,params: .pushldquoFirst, it has been conducted in a large animal model, namely pigs, which we know recapitulate human-like responses to influenza vaccines better than many other systems.ldquoSecond, it shows that a second dose of the vaccine, a so-called lsquoprime-boostrsquo strategy, gives rise to far better responses than a single inoculation, which might allay concerns arising from some of the earlier work on this and other spike-targeting vaccines.ldquoThird, it shows that the prime-boost strategy may well be achievable using the same vaccine rather than having to switch to an alternative  for the second dose, which could conceivably delay roll-out of the vaccination programme.ldquoWhilst these studies will need to be repeated within human subjects, and the precise nature and longevity of the responses might require further investigation, this is a heartening study that can be built upon and ideally followed by other potential vaccine s for SARS-CoV-."},{"url":null,"title":"staycation-five-scotlands-photogenic-places-visit-lockdown-eases","story":"WITH lockdown measures slowly beginning to ease and the coronavirus continuing to be

Theyrsquore because of public reaction and public perception of Tourettersquos.ldquoThe fact that Irsquom ticking doesnrsquot make me depressed and it doesnrsquot make me anxious.\"Itrsquos how other people react. Itrsquos only such a huge part of my le because of other people.ldquoItrsquos instinctive for people to turn around and look, but it doesnrsquot take away from the fact that it makes me feel uncomfortable and embarrassed over something that I cannot control.It was not only the tics that made Jack stand out from the crowd during childhood.As a gay teenager, he says he struggled to make any male friends because of his sexuality, which he has never hidden.And the struggles, although manesting in dferent forms, have continued into young adult le.As a result of years of relentless twitching and involuntary leg movements, Jack is battling chronic muscle pain and nausea.Cognitive behaviour therapy reiki reflexology ndash Jack has tried everything to relieve the pain but to little avail.He is prescribed strong painkillers, and at times has had to keep his neck in a brace because of his tics.,params: .pushWhen attempting to enter bars or nightclubs, bouncers sometimes reject him because they believe he is under the influence of illegal drugs.Alcohol consumption can trigger his tics, making them more prominent and frequent.Even in university lectures, he sometimes must call out people for continually turning around and staring at him, despite knowing his condition.Jack insists that suffering from Tourette syndrome has given him a ldquothick skin\".He has always felt fully supported by his parents but has chosen to be independent from a young age, refusing to let his condition prevent him from doing the things he wants to achieve.Attending doctors appointments on his own from the age of , Jack preferred to handle everything by himself.In his third year at Peebles High School, Jack ran a public campaign and was successfully elected as a Member of the Scottish Youth Parliamentfor the region.He said: ldquoI ran because Irsquove always been interested in social issues and wanted to meet like-minded people, which I sometimes felt starved of growing up.ldquoI think I would be a really confident, extroverted guy without my tics ndash they are the one thing holding me back.Since his darkest days battling anxiety and depression, Jack has made friends andhad part-time jobs in bars in Peebles and Edinburgh.Mental health struggles may have stolen parts of Jacks childhood ndash and he continues to live in the spotlight of Tourettersquos ndash but it hasnrsquot stopped him embracing student le."},{"url":null,"title":"bournemouth-major-incident-thousands-pack-beaches-south-coast","story":"A MAJORincident has been declared after thousands of people flocked to the beach in southern England.The sun-seekers - defying official advice -descended onBournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council beaches on the hottest day of the year so far.A multi-agency emergency response has now been activated to co-ordinate resources across the area.Council leader Vikki Slade said: ldquoWe are absolutely appalled at the scenes witnessed on our beaches, particularly at Bournemouth and Sandbanks, in the last - hours.\"The irresponsible behaviour and actions of so many people is just shocking and our services are stretched to the absolute hilt trying to keep everyone safe.\"We have had no choice now but to declare a major incident and initiate an emergency response.Services were left completely overstretched as visitors arrived in large volumes resulting in widespread problems of illegal parking, excessive waste, anti-social behaviour, gridlock on roads and prohibited overnight camping.BCP Council issued  parking enforcement fines ndash the highest on record ndash and responded to many reports of cars parking and causing an obstruction.Roads in and out of the area were heavily congested into the early hours.Crews received widespread abuse and intimidation as they attempted to empty overflowing bins on the seafront.

It can also cause confusion and cloud judgement.

ldquoOne of the main problems in this case is one of supply.ldquoThe substance can feel quite easy to get hold of, but this is absolutely no indicator that it is safe.ldquoIt is extremely dangerous, especially for those with undiagnosed or asymptomatic illnesses.ldquoYoung people who are abusing it are taking huge risks themselves and for their friends as well.ldquoOne of the problems is that there are legitimate uses for the capsules, especially in the catering industry.ldquoThere needs to be a well-rounded approach to tackling this latest trend, involving education, support from the

This is to assess the safety of the vaccine and determine the optimal dosage.A total of  healthy volunteers are expected to be given two doses of the vaccine over the coming weeks.If it is found to be safe, and shows a promising immune response in humans, larger trials will follow later in the year.For more information on the Imperial Covid- vaccine, including how to register as a volunteer, visit the vaccine trial website."},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-nitrous-oxide-no-laughing-matter","story":"AS WE approach the traditional school holidays and perhaps some nicer weather, I once again make a plea to all parents and carers of children and young people to make sure you know where they are, who they are with, and ensure they are not engaging in anti-social behaviour.In recent weeks, with lockdown easing, we have seen large gatherings of youths, sometimes more than  at a time, at ious locations around the county.The vast majority of these are all well behaved but a small minority have been engaging in signicant anti-social behaviourand disorder.North Berwick, Tranent and Longniddry have caused us some issues recently, with intoxicated youths verbally abusing passers-by, vandalising items, smashing bottles and leaving a mess behind. This is not acceptable.East Lothian Countryside Rangers have reported a signicant rise in rubbish, empty alcohol bottles, broken tents and ious other items on our beaches and parks.When you visit the coastal areas, you expect it to be clean, tidy and safe, and the Rangers do an exceptional job keeping up with the disgusting mess left behind.However, what they are now regularly cleaning up is way beyond what should ever be expected.During a clear up at Longniddry Bents last week,  canisters of nitrous oxide, or laughing gas, were found discarded, along with hundreds of empty alcohol bottles. This appears to be a trend amongst youngsters, to get a temporary high, and as a parent of two young girls I find this extremely concerning.You may see these small finger-sized silver canisters in parks or discarded in the street.I wanted to provide some information on this gas to help you understand the risks so you can explain these to your children.Inhaling the gas slows down messages between the brain and body, causing temporary feelings of calmness and joy.Negative effects can include dizziness, headaches or fainting. It can also cause confusion and cloud judgement. Sometimes the user can see or hear things that arenrsquot real. The risks include it preventing the ability to breathe and, in extreme cases, death.It can cause the heart rate to beat irregularly, increasing the risk of heart failure, and heavy use has been linked to vitamin B deficiency which can cause nerve damage. The user can also become confused and panicky, which may lead to accidents.This is not something we want our children and young people experimenting with. This is a gas that dentists and medical professionals use under controlled conditions to sedate patients for minor medical procedures.I have arranged a multi-agency meeting to raise awareness of the risks and to prevent someone from becoming ill, injured or dying from this.Please talk to your children and discuss the dangers of these canisters and the impact of ASB.Eventhey havenrsquot been part of the group, they may know who has. Please report any concerns to us on the  number, or  in an emergency.If we all work together we can improve our communities and keep our children and young people

Here, a womanrsquos nostalgic childhood memories of idyllic wild swimming lure her back in the water, but in a public swimming pool she quickly feels out of her depth.Norsrsquo last collection of stories, Karate Chop, mostly revolved around female characters ndash mothers, daughters, wives and girlfriends on the brink of breaking down or cracking up. In contrast, Wild Swims focuses on the travails of both men and women. When they appear together, Nors blends in madcap antics and black humour. In Hygge, an elderly man joins a ldquosenior club to play chess, only to learn that the ageing female members have dferent plans for him: ldquoas a bachelor I had to place my body at the disposal of all the cast-off women and their expectations.These truly are short stories. No tale exceeds seven pages. Some amount to mere sketches, snapshots or portraits. Many are fuelled by strange thoughts and idiosyncratic deeds. A few are maddeningly evasive and raise more questions than answers. And yet all are masterclasses in concision and most get straight to the nub of the matter, able to perfectly convey a mood, encapsulate an emotion or dramatise a predicament. Nors has described her stories as ldquohit-and-run-literature, which aptly sums them up: she gets in there, does her thing, then gets out, often leaving us marvelling at her dexterity.We also admire Norsrsquo prose, which is rich with quirky formulations and novel comparisons .Sharp, inventive, and consistently captivating, Norsrsquo tales are miniature wonders.

Itrsquos the most southerly point in Europe, a place where two continents meet, with Europe and Africa separated by just a few miles of sea.Because of this itrsquos a transitory place. Irsquom no ornithologist, but over many years on my hikes along the coast there Irsquove watched the marvel and splendour of vast numbers of bird species on their migratory routes moving to and fro from Africa.Increasingly, Irsquove also come across abandoned rubber dinghies and other small boats on remote beaches or run aground on this, a rugged coastline which marks the precise nautical point where the Mediterranean Sea meets the Atlantic. These makesht vessels are reminders of the refugees and migrants that have made the perilous crossing from the North African shores of Morocco in yet another stage on a journey to Europe that might already have taken them across swathes of sub-Saharan Africa.This Andalusian coastline that Irsquove hiked for almost two decades is a microcosm of the themes that run through Sonia Shahrsquos latest book The Next Great Migration: The Story of Movement on a Changing Planet. I must confess that on first picking it up, I did so with some trepidation. Would it be a jargon- filled account blunted by impenetrable scientic research and endless demographic statistics, I wondered  Alternatively, it could turn out to be some idealistic paean by a writer simply rapt by the vast spectacle of people on the move. Any misgivings, however, were quickly dispelled, for this is a book that captivates and educates on so many levels.Part travel journal, part reportage, part investigative journalism, itrsquos a work impeccably researched but heartfelt and driven by eloquent descriptive storytelling. These myriad components all serve to make the bookrsquos core argument that migration, far from being a problem, is in fact the solution to the crises that confront so many species today, not least humankind.For the author, an American investigative journalist, ldquomigration is a force of nature, rooted in human biology and history, along with that of the scores of other wild species with whom we share this changing planet. In explaining it this away, Shah takes the reader on a fascinating kaleidoscopic historical and geographical journey. From the southern Calornian habitat of the checkerspot butterfly to the high Himalaya and its shting forests, to the teeming refugee and migrant camps on the Greek island of Lesbos, the eyewitness accounts and interviews from these locations are the work of an accomplished journalist.This ersity and juxtaposition of insights into many aspects of migration are, however, both the bookrsquos greatest strengths and occasionally a weakness. I say weakness only because of the odd moment of uncomfortable jarring in certain comparisons between human migration and that of other species. Can there really be parallels between the infinitesimal territorial relocation of the checkerspot butterfly and, say, Syrian refugees  But then again both are stories of adaptability and the necessity of mobility as a means of surviving in threatening environments.Over the course of the bookrsquos  chapters and conclusion, some readers might at times find this scattergun sweep that draws from the natural, scientic and geopolitical realm slightly disorientating. Some nitpickers might argue, too, that it occasionally takes the reader too far off course in terms of the bookrsquos main thesis.But such shortcomings are minor irritations and more than compensated for by the way Shah convincingly pulls these disparate ends together to reveal how migration and movement are as much a necessity to existence as breathing.In this respect there are echoes here of the great travel writer Bruce Chatwinrsquos wonderful homage to nomadism and wanderlust The Songlines.But Shahrsquos account, while acknowledging the near ldquospiritual need for humans to be on the move and the positive role this plays in our collective culture and psyche, also concerns itself with the arguably much more pressing issue of biological need and physical survival. It was Chatwin himself, after all, who admitted that for many ldquoa journey is a fragment of hell. Those caught in the ravages of climate change, war and poverty already know this from bitter experience. As one of the many revealing indicators in the book points out ldquoby  the spread of deserts in sub-Saharan Africa is expected to compel  million inhabitants to pick up and leave. By  rising sea levels could add another  million to their ranks.Faced with such an onslaught itrsquos no surprise that almost daily our news reports highlight the growth in migration. And, just as they do so, politicians - especially those of a populist or rightest bent - use the perceived threat of migration to kindle fear and appeal to voters with policies that ultimately consolidate their own power.Here Shah does a tremendous service to our understanding of the malign manipulation of the supposed ldquomigrant threat. She traces this perception of it, something sinister and to fear back, back to the th century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, generally considered to the originator of modern taxonomy, which is the practice and science of classying things or concepts.Linnaeus was ldquoentranced by order, effectively reinforcing the idea of putting things in their place, including people. For Linnaeus there was no such thing as a shared ancestry and over time such theories helped shape many of todayrsquos more toxic narratives about immigration.ldquoThe paths taken by human migrants are shaped primarily by abstractions, explains Shah. ldquoDistant political leaders lay down rules based on political and economic concerns, allowing some in and keeping others out. They draw and redraw invisible lines on the landscape in biologically arbitrary ways.She writes, too, of how some observers have seen the writing on the wall for some time, citing the US national security expert Robert D. Kaplan, who described it in a  Atlantic magazine article headlined ldquoThe Coming Anarchy.That the next great migration of plants, animals and humans is already upon us is indisputable. As this timely book outlines, scientists have found that of the four thousand species that they have tracked, between  and  per cent had altered their distribution over the past handful of decades, around  per cent into cooler lands and waters in sync with the changing climate.Human relocation is no less dramatic, with more people living outside their countries of birth today than at any time before. Floods, storms, poverty, persecution and war have all been triggers.Previous books by Shah including Pandemic: Tracking Contagions from Cholera to Ebola and Beyond, have been prescient to say the least. This study is no less so. Totally fascinating, and extremely well written, this is a book of our times and one all of us should take the time to read. When Covid- and lockdown recedes I willto that Andalusian coastline with its migratory birds and people on the move crossing between continents.

Although they acknowledge the disastrous impact shunning them could have on the livelihoods of those who work in hospitality, they put their health first.Some of these people have already decided that they wonrsquot feel safe enough to dine out for the rest of .Age isnrsquot necessarily the defining factor in this decision ndash % of those aged over  want to get back out to restaurants, according to a survey of , members of Tastecard, the UKrsquos largest dining club.It also found that % of people plan to continue dining out as frequently as before, while % even plan to dine out more.Looking specically at Scotland, over , restaurant-goers were surveyed earlier this month by pm, Glasgowrsquos booking-based website, and simpleERB, the restaurant booking management system.When asked, ldquoHow often did you visit a restaurant in the  months prior to lockdown  % said ldquoSeveral times and % said ldquoSeveral times a week. And when asked, ldquoHow likely are you to visit a restaurant when they re-open , % said ldquoExtremely likely and % ldquoVery likely. Only % said ldquoNot very likely or ldquoNot at all likely.So, the appetite of enthusiastic restaurant-goers, the regular clientele that has kept many restaurants going in the past, has not signicantly waned. This confirms my personal observation that many people who feel that they ought not visit restaurants were never big eaters out to start with, before coronavirus.So, for those of us counting the days until we can have a nice brunch, lunch, or dinner out again, what matters  We definitely want to see hand sanitising stations .Irsquod add here, that restaurants might consider a simple soap and hand basin point near the entry, as is common in India. Partitions between customers were welcomed by %. With some thoughtful design, such screens could feel little dferent from the perennially popular booth-style dining, which gives a sense of intimacy. Though Irsquom not sure the sort of plexiglass bubbles seen in our photograph would be welcomed by everyone.And donrsquot forget that even sidestepping the thorny issue of whether the measure for physical distancing should be two or one metres, you can take for granted that most restaurants in Scotland will be quiet at lunchtime. So having plenty space at lunch at least need not be a concern.And % of respondents favoured temperature checks for staff. This is easy to do and a good idea anyway.I have complained loudly in the past about being served by people with stinking colds who have probably struggled into work because the management would dock their pay otherwise. That narrow-sighted practice is long overdue for a change. Temperature checks of customers and face masks, on the other hand, were favoured by just under half of respondents.They werenrsquot so concerned about staff wearing gloves , or face shields . A recognition, it seems, that post-Covid, we donrsquot want our restaurant outings to be as sterile as a visit to the dentist.Hearteningly, the survey picked up a willingness amongst customers to help restaurateurs operate as profitably as possible in these dficult circumstances ndash % of those polled said they ldquodefinitely or ldquoprobably would pre-order their food, and % were prepared to limit their time at the table to let restaurateurs take more customers throughout the day.You see, we cherish our restaurants, and want to see them bounce back."},{"url":null,"title":"Opinion  Rosemary Goring  I look like a Holby City cast member in my mask","story":"Normally I pick up litter. Not today. The mask might have lain there for weeks, but it felt better to leave it for someone with rubber gloves to deal with. In the coming months, I suspect paper masks will become the new crisp packet or plastic water bottle, the leading litter offender of our times. Artists are doubtless already photographing bandit-style objects dangling from trees or trapped in drains, compiling a photo-montage of Covid detritus, to look back on in years to come.Now that face coverings are obligatory on public transport, and recommended in smaller shops and confined spaces, the day is coming when most of us will carry some form of protective gear in our pocket. This is meant to make us, and others, safer, yet the sight of bus passengers earlier this week, hidden from chin to eye, was anything but reassuring. It reminded me of cattle trucks, where all you can see between the slats are the animalsrsquo eyes, rolling in fear as they head for the abattoir.Some of my friends have been covering up for months others would rather head for the hills and ride out the storm like outlaws than comply. But like it or not, I suspect this latest accessory will be with us for the foreseeable future. The days when we used to stare in bemusement at Oriental tourists wearing what looked like BQ dust protectors are long gone. In some places, especially cities, it seems face coverings are already de rigueur, so much so that fashion houses are producing their own lines, to complement their designer range. This could either be seen as a definition of sad, or defiantly le-affirming.How did it come to this  In a text exchange with a friend, we were comparing styles, and recommending ones we liked, when a shudder went through both of us. Who ever thought we would be having this dialogue  It was a sobering moment, stark proof of how altered the world has become in a matter of months.The fabric visors I have on order are as non-medical as it gets, short of the Venice carnival. If Laura Ashley were still in business, I could have lurked unnoticed among the rails in one of these for days. Perhaps wisely, my husband has opted instead for the Ned Kelly look. With a hill-walking snood pulled up over his nose he looks dastardly, and warm. With the hottest days of the year approaching, wearers will be severely tested. It is no joke. On overheated buses, tubes and trains ndash often tropical even in winter ndash being cocooned behind cloth, wool or paper will raise temperatures to simmering point. Tempers might follow. This is no time, certainly, for the menopausal. It will be interesting to see what happensanyone finds it so unbearable a prospect that they dare to go bare-faced.So far the enforcement of lockdown measures has been largely consensual, the police working amicably to ensure peoplersquos safety. Butany passengers revolt or feel unwell when under wraps, who will handle that situation  Itrsquos simple enough to prevent refusniks getting on at the bus stop, but thereafter the driver cannot be expected to enforce the law. Will there be a member of transport police on every service or at every station, or a rapid response squad within hailing distance What about those who suffer from asthma or other respiratory complaints that mean they cannot trap their noses and mouths  Confronting public anger or filthy stares as they appear to flout the rules will be bad enough but how do they convince officials that their condition is genuine  The mere prospect of having to prove their credentials, or to run a gauntlet of jibes and stares, will deter many from even attempting to hop on public transport.Of course we will eventually get used to swaddling ourselves, just as wersquore now programmed to reach for soap after every foray beyond the front door, and to keep a cowrsquos distance from neighbours. Yet the potential hazards of facial wraps are fiercely debated. The main concern is that people will feel a  sense of security behind their personal protective barrier and neglect to wash their hands. Nor, Irsquove read, is cloth very effective at preventing the passage of small contagious droplets. When you add to this the likelihood that the discomfort of prolonged use leads to constant tweaking and touching, it seems their health benefits might be less assured than wersquove been encouraged to believe.All of this suggests the psychological signicance might be as important as the medical purpose. Seeing a sea of veiled faces around you reinforces the message of pervasive threat. Visors, in whatever shape, are a visible reminder that each and every one of us presents a potential risk to others. They are symbols of our collective duty to be seen to be taking precautions by wearing them, we signal willingness to help lower anxiety and alarm, and to play our part in the communal effort to defeat this disease.Will we ever feel relaxed under these circumstances  I can cope with the prospect of covering up while heading off on holiday but once at my destination, how easygoing will a cafe or gallery, beach or bar feel when you can only see waitersrsquo and bartendersrsquo eyes, and art lovers or bookshop browsers look like the cast in Holby City  Holidays are about escaping the everyday, and switching off. Learning to do that now will require mentally airbrushing out the red flags in the scene before us, be it perspex screens, the distance between tables, or a proleration of nosebags.

The First Minister insists she is putting safety first.Scotland will not be following the ldquoreckless relaxation of lockdown pursued by heartless English Tories, who are only interested in the bottom line. Such at least is the political message the Scottish government hopes to convey.In reality, itrsquos not entirely clear what is happening in Scotland about social distancing. Jason Leitch, the National Clinical Director, told BBC Radio yesterday that he expected the two metre rule to be relaxed very soon.:Scotlands two-metre social distancing rule will change, according to Jason LeitchAnd John Swinney later announced that he is aiming for schools to go back to full time teaching on th August, which also suggests lockdown is not long for this world. The Labour MSP Iain Gray called this the ldquomother and father of ministerial climb-downs.Only last week Mr Swinney had been talking about a year of ldquoblended learning and no exams. This was under his assumption that the two metre rule would be still be adhered to over the summer and into the next school year.His u-turn may also be a broad wink to the hospitality industry that Scotland will be following England in the not too distant future. They should plan for a one metre rule and not give up the ghost.Letrsquos hope they get the message, because only % of pubs and % of restaurants say they can survive with two metre social distancing, according to the Scottish Tourism Alliance.Ms Sturgeon says she is no longer bothered about the R number ndash the infection rate that she said last month was her guiding policy. The number of infections is now so small that R is largely meaningless.So,the disease is disappearing fast, and the infection rate is irrelevant, why is Scotland sticking with the two-metre rule at all  Are we following the science or not Nicola Sturgeon suggested yesterday that the scientic advice from SAGE may not entirely concur with Boris Johnsonrsquos decision yesterday to liberate the nation from its Covid ldquohibernation.The former government Chief Scientic Adviser, Sir David King, chair of the ldquoindependent SAGE group, is pretty sure that the official SAGE scientists are not on side. He says it is ldquofar too soon to ease the two-metre rule and that this will increase infections and lead to more deaths.However, the science isnrsquot exactly rock solid on two metres. The World Health Organisation, which government critics often claim is a better advice-giver than SAGE, suggests a one metre rule is safe. WHO says that the risk of catching the disease falls by % over that distance.China, Denmark and more importantly our nearest neighbour France are also in the one metre camp.There is evidence that risk falls by at least a further %you are standing two metres distant. But the risk of transmission depends on many factors: distance is only a part of it. Wearing masks, for example, almost certainly makes one metre equivalent to two. Outdoors, there seems little dference between one and two metres, and even indoors itrsquos no guarantee of immunity.A study cited by the BBC from the Chinese city of Guangzhou, looked at a cluster of infections in a restaurant which was using the one metre rule. Half of the people who came down with the disease were discovered to have been sitting more than two metres away from the primary source of the infection.:Sturgeon prepares to accelerate Scotlands exit from lockdown - but two-metre rule stays for nowAir flow and ventilation seem to be a big factor. Bad ventilation can super spread this virus. On the other hand, sophisticated air conditioning, such as on aircraft with HEPA filters, might actually suppress Covid , especiallypassengers are wearing masks.Theof time you are in contact with a person with Covid- also seems to be a major factor. Just donrsquot hang around, is the message. Indeed, wersquore told thatyou want to hold a conversation with someone you should really stand back to back. Which would be most interesting at a conference or reception ndash assuming we ever have them again.Professor Linda Bauld, of Public Health at Edinburgh University says politicians should ldquonot to get too hung up about distance. There is just too much going on to make this into an inviolable rule ndash like the R number which politicians obsessed about until recently.This at any rate is the view of the UK government. Boris Johnson believes that the costs of relaxing the two-metre rule are far outweighed by the likely costs of not relaxing it. This isnrsquot just a financial calculus ndash putting profits before health.Not allowing the schools toto anything resembling normality is likely to have a signicant impact on the long term health and wellbeing of young people. Similarly, not opening bars, restaurants and leisure activities means depriving many more young people of jobs and security ndash major factors in mental health.It is simply not possible to conduct anything resembling normal le with a two metre rule. Public transport becomes unmanageable, tourism is undermined, shops and offices stay closed. We are a gregarious species and trying to keep two metres away from our fellow man and woman is extraordinarily dficult.Children are not observing anything like a two metre rule in parks and gardens, as is only too obvious. It seems absurd therefore that they should be prevented from attending well managed and clean schools where the risk will be very much less.:CMO warnshealthboards not to assume Covid antibodies provide immunityMany parents were outraged at Mr Swinneyrsquos ldquoblended learning plans, with some pupils getting as little as a day of teaching per week.

Once Swinney switched from the blended model to a straightforwardto school, opposition MSPs were up on their hind legs bragging about a \"u-turn\". They had won. The SNP had been humiliated.The SNP, of course, said it wasnrsquot a u-turn. The blended model remained as a contingency planthe infection worsened. There were caveats, the nationalists said, so therersquod been no volte faceHerersquos the truth: it was a u-turn ndash but nobody cares. The SNP did cave in to pressure from parents and opposition parties, and wersquoll all have to wait and seethat capitulation was safe and sensible. To claim this isnrsquot a u-turn is to reinvent the concept of geometry, and political language.However, outside the incestuous bubble of Holyrood no-one gives a damn. Parents care about their children. Teachers care about their safety and their pupils. Who would spare even a thought to the pride and ego of the political class And this is what sickens most of all. Our politicians think that moving the debate from the future of our childrenrsquos education to the issue of whether they got a political win out of this or not is acceptable. It shows how deeply these people are out of touch with the rest of us.Party politics in inimical to the interests of the people. Political parties take a position, their rivals take the opposite position, and they dig in. It doesnrsquot matter whatrsquos good for us. Like generals in the First World War, they draw their lines and the casualties are the little people, the rank and file.The only issue that matters is that our children get a good education, that parents feel their children are safe and prospering, and that teachers feel protected at work. Thatrsquos all we should care about. Politics should be inconsequential.Parents, teachers and, most of all, children are being failed by our political class. But then the only lesson to be learned from this entire fiasco is that Scottish politics itself is a failure.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Fans of The Perfect Girlfriend will love Hamiltons latest, and the Last We is an utterly compelling, addictive read. Marie makes the ultimate unreliable narrator, and Hamilton is a skilled writer who makes you invest in the most unlikeable of characters. It is the kind of book you finish in one sitting, with enough twists to keep you guessing until the final page.. The Half Sister by Sandie Jones is published in paperback by Pan, priced pound. . Available June A knock at the door during a normal Sunday lunch changes everything for sisters Kate and Lauren. On the other side of the door is their half sister, Jess, looking for answers about the family she never knew. Told through dual narratives, this book is a compelling read and has a lot of potential. However, it is let down by the slow pacing during the first half, which sees the story get bogged down in a lot of unnecessary details and sub-plots that dont add much to the main narrative. Things pick up in the second half, as it races towards the somewhat inevitable conclusion. The end comes too soon, and there has not been enough back story to make it feel believable or satisfying. The Half Sister is a domestic suspense thriller, but perhaps could be better described as a light family drama, as it lacks the heart-racing hook of a thriller.Non-fiction. The Art of Political Storytelling by Philip Seargeant is published in hardback by Bloomsbury Academic, priced pound. . Available nowSubtitled Why Stories Win Votes in Post-Truth Politics, this book by a language and communicate expert tries to explain one of the great quandaries of our age: why reason and logic fail to win out over emotion and truthiness in political discourse. The answer, argues Seargeant, is stories. Successful recent political initiatives, such as the election of Donald Trump and the winning Brexit vote, packaged their causes as powerfully simple but highly adaptable narratives that plug into age-old templates and carry further into the electorates consciousness than careful argument or detailed analysis of the facts on the ground. No doubt it was ever thus, to some extent, but this survey of the toolbox of the political storyteller - from deep structure to rhetorical style to the mainstreaming of conspiracy theories, with a nod to key story theorists like Aristotle, Syd Field and Joseph Campbell - goes a long way to account for the recent successes of provocative populist leaders around the world. Interesting and readable, this is an enlightening guide to our current political moment.Childrens book of the weekWonderscape by Jenner Bell is published in paperback by Walker Books, priced pound. . Available nowJenner Bell, author of the international bestseller The Uncommoners: The Crooked Sixpence, has worked her magic again with this fantastic sci-fi offering. It starts with a bang: while on their way to school, Arthur, Cecily and Ren are accidentally sucked through a portal into an in-reality adventure game called Wonderscape, which exists in the year . The game, and the future, offer plenty of opportunities for otherworldliness, which Bell takes full advantage of. What makes this book stand out is its casual references to scientic concepts such as nanotechnology and cryptocurrency, as well as its celebration of humanitys heroes, including Newton, Edison and Wangari Maathai, who are cast as characters in the game. Bell does this with such finesse that the story never feels like a history or science lesson in disguise. If those references land with young minds, and readers want to discover more, they can do so in their own time theres no pressure to understand them in order to enjoy the story. All in, this is a fun-filled, character-driven, fast-paced, vibrant story - but together with its thought-provoking, science-embracing and hero-referencing narrative, it will almost certainly win both hearts and minds.BOOK CHARTS:.

Every single one of our  local authorities has had cases of trafficking or exploitation. In , there were over  cases of people being trafficked or exploited in Scotland. That number looks set to rise this year. And without question there are many more cases that have gone unreported.Modern slavery takes many forms. Its victims are both men and women, adult and child. There are cases of both sexual and labour exploitation. Its victims can be born-and-bred in Scotland, have moved here years ago, or only just arrived. Modern slavery takes place in our cities, towns, villages and countryside. Often, it takes place in plain sight.All over Scotland, there are women trafficked into sexual exploitation, forced into prostitution by traffickers. They work in appalling conditions, at great risk, terrorised and traumatised by their traffickers and the men who pay for sex. Other victims have been found working for illegally low wages ndashthey are paid at all ndash in nail bars, car washes, construction sites, and where.:Behind closed doors, gangrsquos family traded in victimsrsquo miseryThey have their wages withheld, and their lack of English and support networks is exploited. Other victims are locked into dangerous environments to cultivate cannabis plants, used by their exploiters to transport drugs around the country, or forced to beg on our streets.It gets worse. Despite causing dficulties for us all, the coronavirus lockdown is a gt to traffickers. Many victims are being forced by their traffickers to take greater risks than ever. They may be forced to work in conditions without social distancing, or prevented from accessing healthcare, or be compelled to take risks with their health to earn money for their traffickers.And the lockdown has made it harder for us to find those people who need our help: their traffickers have moved them off the streets, and public services are stretched as we deal with the coronavirus crisis.Furthermore, councils are increasingly concerned that the economic impact of the crisis will make even more people vulnerable to exploitation. Thousands of people in Scotland have lost their job, or seen their incomes disappear.Traffickers will be moving in, to prey on the most vulnerable: forcing them to work in unsafe conditions or for illegal wages, or by tricking people into a debt they have to work to pay off, but never can. Furthermore, many migrants in Scotland have lost their job in the crisis. Even those who are entitled to benefits may not know their rights, or how to negotiate our systems of public support, and they may not have developed personal support networks of their own. The risk of exploitation is great.More must be done to protect victims, and potential victims, from modern slavery ndash and we all have a role to play. Scotlandrsquos councils are doing all we can to combat this brutal exploitation taking place in our communities.Guidance developed by Cosla for local authorities was launched by spokesperson Councillor Kelly Parry in , to enable staff to spot the signs that someone has been trafficked and provide them with the critical support they need. We work closely with the police, NHS and other bodies to disrupt traffickers and help victims.:Neil Mackay: Amid covid and racism hellipwe want to build a better world, letrsquos start with police interrogating Prince AndrewCouncils are embedded in our communities, so we are working locally to spot the signs of modern slavery. Tackling this horrendous crime means working in partnership with a range of stakeholders. Councils, schools, the police, border force, charities and community groups all have a critical role to play.And so too do members of the public. Anyone who sees anything that appears to be an emergency should dial . If it is not an emergency, but a cause for concern, dial . If unsure, it is always right to call  rather than not reporting at all. Human trafficking is a hidden crime, which means that the outside signs can be hard to spot. Businesses need to check their supply chains and report suspicious activity. The more information the authorities have, the better the response.There is currently a national debate about the role of slavery in Scotlandrsquos past. We must also remember that modern slavery is part of Scotlandrsquos present.

It is typical of entrepreneurs that they should see opportunities even when faced with constraints and unfavourable circumstances it is considerably bolder to argue that the right measures to tackle the current crisis could potentially spark a second Scottish Enlightenment.Politicians may regard ambition, or vision, as their preserve, and Sir Tom readily concedes that there are areas of government expertise and freedom to act of which business people are mostly ignorant. A plan for partnership that involves the public and private sectors each allowing the other to get on with what it can do best is not now a vaguely desirable aspiration, but an absolute necessitywe are to weather the damaging effects of the coronavirus and its economic impact.The Higgins report, as Sir Tom argues, is long on recommendations and scant on the minutiae of how to implement them. The fact that essentially all job creation in the medium term will have to come from small to medium enterprisesis a good argument for support of the sort public sector can offer, and that the Scottish Government is calling for from the UK Treasury.Grants, loans, deferrals, development schemes and infrastructure investment are potentially useful government contributions all but the most vocal advocates of ldquorolling back the state would argue that the public sector is, with the current challenges, an essential component of recovery.It is not, though, just a matter of money and support ndash which government may be best placed to provide, but will ultimately be paid for by the taxpayer. Just as much, and perhaps more, can be done by getting out of the way of business, by reducing regulations, easing planning and employment restrictions, and cutting the bureaucracy that hampers SMEs and leads to delays and overspends on so many public sector projects.No one would fault the Scottish Government for having had other priorities until now, nor underestimate the challenges it has faced. But finding a way out may require a sht in thinking and priorities every bit as radical as those that had to be adopted to deal with the disease and to repurpose and restructure public institutions.In economic spheres, the Governmentrsquos primary task is provide clarity in outlining its aims, to listen to business expertise and provide firms with material support and ndash at least as important ndash freedom to manoeuvre, and to accept that new approaches and greater partnership will be essential in rebuilding.On several issues, including Prestwick, the commissioning of ferries, and large-scale infrastructure works, the Scottish Government would clearly have benefited from a closer engagement with business.While that may have been an understandable omission in recent months, the coming challenges ndash averting huge job losses, reconstructing the tourism, hospitality and arts sectors, finding new education and training solutions, and encouraging firms to innovate ndash will demand a more flexible and supportive position. The First Ministerrsquos acknowledgement that ldquowe have to recognise [failure to engage with business] as real and address it is a welcome step in that direction.Our current travails will not be overcome by politicians, civil servants, government institutions, civic bodies or private businesses acting on their own, or continuing to operate as they have done in the past.

A storm in  showed something strange in the sand at the Bay of Skaill and the Laird, William Graham Watt, went on to excavate part of a , year old village. After reading the original reports, I now know that this isn’t true. The real story is more interesting.The Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, has three papers on Skara Brae. The first was by Samuel Laing, who visited the site in autumn .“Two chambers have been completely excavated, together with the passage and parts of the entrances to other chambers by Mr William Watt, a relative of William Watt, Esq of Breckness, residing at Skaill, to whose zeal the scientic world is indebted for the discovery and exhumation of this interesting relic of antiquity.#When I saw the credit being given to a relative of William Watt Esq, rather than the man himself, I remembered my father, Peter Leith, telling me that his father, also Peter, had told him that a dferent William Watt, known as Black Willie, had been the man responsible.In the  Census, I found the Laird living at Skaill, aged , with a son William, aged . His son and heir, William WG Watt was  and living at Kierfiold, so there were two sons called William.In James Irvine’s  book, ‘The Breckness Estate’, I read that William G Watt had a natural son, William, who in  was given £ a year and free board, “so long as he chose to remain a clerk in the house.”The story then turned into a neat circle. I followed up a reference in the book and found it was an Orkney Herald article written by my grandfather. It was about Hugh Miller’s book ‘Rambles of a Geologist’, in which Miller recorded his visit to Orkney in .My grandfather had written: “Another interesting person, who has already been mentioned, was William Watt of Skaill. This was not, as some readers may suppose, the laird of Skaill, but a distant relative who made his home there. He was well-known to everybody as “Black Willie” from his dark hair and complexion. Like Miller, he was a self-taught geologist, he always carried a little bag with a hammer and chisel to dig out any fossils he came across. He brought some of his more interesting specimens for Hugh Miller’s inspection and they had an interesting discussion. When Skarabrae was first dug into in the ’s, it is certain that Black Willie took an active part in the work and saw to it that anything found was safely preserved.”I looked up the references to William Watt in the book and found that Hugh Miller had come with a letter of introduction to him and described him both as an intelligent geologist and an intelligent palaeontologist. He showed Watt, along with Dr Garson of Stromness, where his famous discovery, the Astrolepsis fossil, lay.To read about the second and third papers on Skara Brae and what Patricia found out, see page  of this week#s edition of The Orcadian.Patricia Long is a tourist guide based in Stenness with a strong interest in social history.

Elaine Tulloch, chief executive of Destination Orkney Ltd, said: “We were delighted with the response our recent call to action received from our -strong membership. The four new directors, who have now been co-opted onto our board, bring a range of valuable skills and experience to the table and we very much look forward to working with them during these critical months ahead. “Having a strong board presence, which is fully representative of the trade, is essential as we develop recovery plans with local partners, agencies and regional and national governments.”Orkney’s tourism industry, worth over £ million a year to the islands’ economy, has been hard hit by the COVID- crisis.During the pandemic, Destination Orkney Ltd has been keeping its members up to date with information on COVID- support and available funding streams, offering guidance, and lobbying locally and nationally, while sharing updates from the Scottish Tourism Alliance, Scottish Government, VisitScotland and other national bodies.In order to develop COVID- Orkney recovery plans with partners, Destination Orkney Ltd has also established an industry recovery group to discuss matters such as reopening, communication and marketing, as well as identying future resource and investment needs and opportunities. copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Transport operators continue to play a key role in supporting essential travel and in ensuring passenger confidence in public transport while maintaining physical distancing. The use of face coverings forms a fundamental part of gaining that public trust.“We are asking people to take personal responsibility to do the right thing. Wearing a face covering while on public transport means you are playing your part in the collective effort to prevent the spread of coronavirus and reducing the risk to your fellow citizens.”In line with this, the council is asking people to provide their own face coverings when travelling by ferry, bus, plan, taxi or private hire cars. People who are not able to wear a face covering for specic medical reasons will be exempt, as will children under five.Orkney Ferries timetables are currently being revised in consultation with Community Councils in the North and South Isles. It is hoped that an enhanced service can be provided after Monday, June .Further information about this will be provided next week.In the meantime, the Council is asking public transport users to please be patient and consider others needs when planning future travel – and thanking people for their help and co-operation with this.Advice on face coverings, including how to make one and instructions for using one, will be available on the Transport Scotland website. This advice is being updated to include full details of the applicable exemptions.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Caravans and self-contained accommodation which does not share services to be permitted, with caution to respect rural communities and the islands.July  — Outdoor restaurant and dining services and beer gardens to open.July  — Extension likely to be made to socialising with other households.

This will NOT include theatres, bingo halls and casinos.Pubs and restaurants will also be able to reopen indoors, on limited basis. But before you head for a drink, you#ll be able to get that much-needed chop at the hairdressers or barbers.Ms Sturgeon explained that other Phase Three plans, such as communal gatherings including weddings and funerals, will require further consideration.

soon to the blanket travel ban.Since March , the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has advised British nationals against all but essential international travel.Now, a number of short-haul flights to European countries are expected to resume from next month, in a bid to kick-start the tourist economy.Here is what you need to know about air bridges and travelling abroad. vw,vw,px, px\"A passenger puts on a protective face mask in the check-in area at Edinburgh Airport ndash What are air bridges and how will the system work Also known as travel corridors, air bridges will allow Britons to go on holiday to certain destinations without needing to quarantine for  days on theirto the UK.In place of the quarantine arrangements will be a traffic light system, with officials placing countries into green, amber and red categories based on the prevalence of coronavirus within each nationrsquos borders.It is expected a quarantine-free list of countries will be published on Wednesday, with restrictions lted as soon as July .ndash Which countries are likely to be included The Government is expected to announce next week Britainrsquos first air bridges with ldquolow-risk European destinations, including France, Italy, Spain, Greece and Germany.According to reports, air bridges will be announced in batches, with the second set of destinations likely to include other European countries such as Denmark, Norway, Finland and the Netherlands, and ldquolow-risk Caribbean islands.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said air bridges would only be agreed with countries which have a coronavirus test and trace system of the same standard as that used in Britain.\" data-title\"Summer weather June th \" data--holder\"PA Wire\" data--notice\"PA Wire PA Images\" data-credit\"Gareth

from July , but Mr Shapps said no announcement will be made until June , when the quarantine measures will be officially reviewed.Greek tourism minister Haris Theoharis has indicated it could be up to three weeks before his country is happy to open up an air bridge to the UK, depending on the advice they get from health experts.ndash Which countries are unlikely to be included There were mixed reports over whether Portugal would be included in the UKrsquos plans next week, after a spike in coronavirus cases in the country.Long-haul flights to destinations such as Vietnam, Singapore, Hong Kong are reportedly not expected before late summer.Flights to Australia are thought to be more complicated, due to the need to stop over in other countries, which increases the risk of contracting or spreading coronavirus. vw,vw,px, px\"Passengers will have a dferent holiday experience, with masks and social distancing in place where possible ndash What are the rules on quarantine Since June , all passengers, bar a handful of exemptions, have been required to go into self-isolation for  days when they arrive in the UK.People who fail to comply can be fined pound, in England, and police are allowed to use ldquoreasonable force to make sure they follow the rules.ndash What measures have airports taken Last month, Heathrow Airport began trials of thermal screening technology to detect elevated temperatures of arriving passengers.Edinburgh Airport has implemented a colour-coded one-way system to maintain social distancing, while protective screens have been installed at check-in, security and arrivals, and staff wear face coverings and personal protective equipmentin ldquopassenger-facing areas.At Gatwick Airport, hand sanitiser stations, protective screens, regular deep cleaning and social distancing instructions have been introduced throughout the site, with face mask vending machines selling four masks for pound.Pre-booked airport security slots are being tested at Manchester Airport, in which passengers can reserve a free -minute window to use a dedicated lane taking them directly to a checkpoint.ndash What about on board flights It looks as though in-flight food and drinks will not be available, or at least be limited, for a while.EasyJet said it will not have a bistro or boutique service on board, but will have drinking water available for those who request it.The airline said it hopes to have a limited bistro service operating again ldquoin the near future.Aer Lingus said it has suspended in-flight services on its short-haul trips and will have a reduced service on its transatlantic routes.copy -.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"owners asked to let coastguard know if boats are left unattended ","story":"Boat owners are being reminded to please inform the coastguardthey will be leaving vessels unattended for any period of time.The Aith leboat was called out on Sunday evening after reports of a small boat lying empty near an uninhabited isle to the west of Scalloway.While no missing people had been reported in the area, the volunteer crew of the Charles Lidbury were asked by local coastguard officers to make their way to the scene and investigate.The call out came at .pm and the leboat team steamed south to where the skf had been moored – near the skerry of Sanda Stour at the entrance to Weisdale Voe.On arrival the small boat was recognised by a crew member – who then made contact with the boat#s owner to confirm that they were safe and well.

Lets hope I am proved wrong for the greater good of everybody  The way that poll is set up will skew the result in favour of the wind farm.WIth respect, a #gas-fired power station# on its own is not a possible option since a substantial amount of renewable energy is already installed and it won#t be going away, any time soon. Renewable energy, of course, must have a grid link and a fully-specied standbyplant to cover cable failures. Having two options involving a gas-fired power station obviously splits the vote for that option.Firstly:I am really confused about what this poll is supposed to achieve at this stage in the process and why,it#s important, the Shetland Times didn#t hold it  years ago.It seems that the Shetland public have already voted to reject the Shetland Times# wording of this question so I think it#s time to withdraw the poll and re-launch a new one.Might I suggest that the ST editors consult John Tulloch and an equally well qualied renewables engineer over the wording of the new question so that the public can vote on TWO clear options that are technically feasible, otherwise, it is a wasted exercise. However you re-word the question, you need to deny local votersthe#I agree in principal that we need to work towards renewables but I have certain reservations with the current proposals as they stand# meandering, all-things-to-all-people, non-committal, sort of response.Of course,the oil companies hadn#t paid the hippies to shut down the nuclear power stations, we wouldn#t be having this debate.** Bonus conversation starter..."},{"url":null,"title":"freight vessel runs aground on approach to aberdeen ","story":"A NorthLink freight vessel ran aground in Aberdeen on Thursday morning. was coming to the harbour towards the end of her overnight sailing south from Lerwick. she ran aground in the fairway channel at around .am.Harbour tugs were dispatched to assist the ferry, and another vessel on the scene also provided assistance.The vessel is now alongside the harbour.

Swinney said the full-timewould be “conditional on infection rates being sufficiently low to continue to control the virus, public health and testing systems being in place and protective measures and risk assessments being carried out in schools”.For weeks teachers and other education staff have been preparing plans and helping to kit out classrooms to ready themselves for re-opening in August.They had done so in the expectation that school capacity would be limited, with two metre social distancing rules remaining in place.Many parents has expressed concerns about the impact of the continued lack of classroom time would have on their children.In Skye parents were told last week that due to the guidelines and school transport constraints many Portree High pupils would only be able to attend for one day a week.Councillor John Finlayson, Chair of the Highland Council’s Education Committee welcomed Mr Swinney’s announcement, but said more detailed guidance and information on new resources would be required.He said: “The announcement by the Deputy First Minister that the planning assumption will now be for a fullto school for all pupils in Augustit is safe to do so, is very welcome news for everyone and it reflects the aspirations that have been communicated to me over recent days by so many parents.“The education of our young people is extremely important in terms of their educational, mental and social development, as well as their future opportunities and outcomes.“I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our school staff and our parents and pupils for their hard work and collaboration throughout the period of lockdown and especially over recent weeks when they have been developing plans topupils to school taking account of the rules that are currently in place.“It has been a very dficult time in many ways for all.He added: “It should not be forgotten that a fullto education in August will only be possible with continued adherence to national guidance and scientic advice and everyone has played an important role in helping to suppress the virus in our community.“We cannot become complacent.”The Scottish teaching union called for “appropriate mitigations” to protect staff and pupils.EIS General Secretary, Larry Flanagan said: #This means looking at measures already being used where such as mandatory face coverings, protective perspex shields, proactive testing of teachers and an appropriate level of physical distancing between pupils and most certainly between pupils and staff, alongside continued protections for vulnerable groups.”Mr Swinney revealed that an additional £ million will be invested over the next two years to tackle the impact of lockdown on schools and pupils, including ensuring every current probationer teacher who meets the standard for full registration having a teaching post for the year ahead.Education Scotland has also agreed to work with E-Sgoil, the digital training  pioneered in the Western Isles, to develop a national e-learning provision for all senior phase pupils to access lessons online from qualied teachers.Mr Swinney said: “Since May, because of the efforts of ordinary people to stay at home, we have seen Scotland make signicant progress.“There are now only around  infectious people in Scotland – a reduction of around  per cent since May.“There has been a sustained downward trend in Covid- deaths since the end of -th April, and intensive care cases now stand at a fraction of what they were.“If we stay on track,we all continue to do what is right, andwe can further suppress this terrible virus, then the government believes that we should prepare for children to be able toto school full time from August.”The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking

More perplexing was the apparent lack of imagination or government will to procure the extra resources, staff, transport and buildings that may have allowed more children towhile observing physical distancing.Eventually, political and parental pressure # combined with more encouraging news on the suppression of the virus # led to this week’s climbdown.But questions remain as to how the revised arrangements will work.In a week where it emerged that Covid- could cost Highland Council nearly £ million, it is understandable that education chair John Finlayson is frustrated over the allocation of resources.As opposed to every request having first to be evaluated in Edinburgh, he urged the Scottish Government to “give the local authorities the additional funding so they can get on with things”.“Time is short,” the former headmaster added.We should also recognise that teachers will have every right to feel aggrieved.For weeks they and other education colleagues have been preparing plans, liaising with parents and helping to kit out classrooms to ready themselves for a socially distant re-opening in August.Yet days before the end of term, they are now heading for a summer of uncertainty and face having to come up with a new set of operating guidelines.At a time when measures have still to be reduced for the wider public, teachers have been told that social distancing in schools will not apply at all.As EIS General Secretary Larry Flanagan pointed out this week: “Why would it be mandatory to wear a face covering on public transport but not in a classroom “Why would a till assistant be protected by a Perspex sheet but not a teacher “There cannot be a social distancing rule for outside of schools and a dferent one for inside classrooms.”In some quarters the teachers’ unions have been accused of being obstructive to the prospect of schools re-opening.But in the face of a virus which has shown just how much society depends on these key workers, they are right to stand up for the interests of their members.The trade union faced similar criticism the last time they called for a teachers’ pay-rise.Would anyone, especially parents after more than three months of classes at the kitchen table, argue against that now The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3168924.jpg--.jpg?1591864132000\n","title":"nie meter readers ready to call again","story":"NIE Networks is to resume its meter reading activities across Northern Ireland after the service was temporarily paused due to COVID- restrictions.

Meter readers will be able to take readings from meters located in outside positions as normal.NIE Networks is urging customers to protect its meter readers and themselves by continuing to observe social distancing protocols. Ben Cupples, Meter Reading Manager at NIE Networks, explained the importance of recording a precise meter reading for the customer.“Providing a precise meter reading will ensure that your electricity bills accurately reflect your consumption,” he said. “Our meter readers will call to your home and will record the reading you provide while we wait.“If you are unable to read your meter for any reason oryou are not at home when we call, we will leave a card with information on how to submit your meter reading online via the NIE Networks website, via email or over the phone.”Mr Cupples explained that while meter reading activity would resume it would only be carried out with the health and safety of the public and meter readers in mind.“The safety of our employees and customers is our utmost priority. “If you see our meter readers out and about, we would ask that you please help them by standing at least two metres away. Likewise, we will stand at least two metres from customers’ doors at all times.“We are continually reviewing how we undertake our meter reading activities in light of COVID- and we are looking forward to being able to resume our normal way of working with customers at some stage, but we will only make that decision when it’s safe to do so.” NIE Networks is reminding customers that you only need to submit your reading to either NIE Networks or your supplier – there is no need to do it twice. Customers unable to submit a meter reading will receive an estimated bill from their supplier based on their usage history.If a member of the NIE Networks team arrives at the door, they will always show identication.

A police officer said that on June  the PSNI became aware of a video circulating online showing a man acting in an ‘indecent manner’. googletag.cmd.push It was brought to the attention of police by community representatives and family members of children who witnessed it. McGonagle was identied in multiple reports. The officer said the incident took place at Old School Lane where the -year-old was seen ‘defecating in view of children’. A -year-old recorded the incident. The officer added: “He used chip shop wrappers to wipe himself. He was extremely intoxicated.” Police located the defendant at Old School Lane and he charged straight away. Objecting to bail, the officer said on June  McGonagle was warned about his behaviour and not to be intoxicated in a public place. googletag.cmd.push The court heard the -year-old has  previous convictions and two suspended sentences. There is an ‘extremely high risk of reoffending’, the officer added, ‘this man is incapable of not being intoxicated in a public place.’ Defence barrister Stephen Mooney said his client pleaded guilty to the offences before the court on Monday at the first opportunity and it was adjourned for a pre-sentence report. McGonagle was not in a position to be interviewed by the police due to his level of intoxication. Mr Mooney told the court that back in   the -year-old spent a ‘very signicant’ period of time in custody on remand. He was then found ‘unfit for trial’ because of his mental capacity and the prosecution was discontinued. The defence barrister said it is not so much a ‘fool’s pardon but a street drinker’s pardon’ as he is a well-known street drinker. His alcoholism is being criminalised because of his inability to stay sober, he added. Mr Mooney asked for bail to be granted with strict conditions attached. District Judge Peter King said ‘you’re absolutely correct’ and any bail conditions would have to include a prohibition on alcohol which would set him up for ‘spectacular failure’. He added that McGonagle may upset the ‘wrong person or group of people and find himself facing more dficulties’. The defendant was remanded in custody due to a ‘clear risk of reoffending’ to appear by way of video link on July .

At present, hospitality businesses have to adhere to strict licensing laws in terms of serving outdoors. However, local councils have been encouraged by the Northern Ireland Executive to take a flexible approach to the situation to support the sector as it emerges from the coronavirus lockdown. Derry City and Strabane District Council is currently looking at ways it can help local businesses. They have launched a short survey asking for peoples opinions on the matter. The survey can be filled in here -https:bit.ly eohTnm googletag.cmd.push A council spokesperson said: The hospitality and retail industries have been some of the hardest hit in terms of lost revenue during COVID-. They will also be one of the last to fully emerge from the lockdown. With the impact of the pandemic and the resulting social distancing measures that must continue when businesses reopen it is essential that we start to reimagine how theservice industries can adapt and operate in the current circumstances.New business models and taking hospitality and trade outdoors will play a signicant part in the survival of the service industry locally. Using private and public spaces such as pavements, car parking spaces and events spaces such as Guildhall Square, Waterloo Place and the Canal Basin in Strabane could be part of the solution. googletag.cmd.push To achieve this, Council and key stakeholders including Department for Infrastructure and the Department for Communities will be adopting a flexible approach that seeks to facilitate innovation - whilst ensuring appropriate controls such as Insurance, disability access, enforcement and public health are in place.

Dean O’Neill, from Drumsurn, died suddenly last week and mourners at his funeral yesterday heard how the news had left the community in shock. “The church would be absolutely packed todaythings were normal,” said Fr Seamus Kelly, officiating at the funeral. “The tragic news that spread throughout the area on Thursday morning stunned the whole community. “He was one of the most gted sportsmen to emerge in Drumsurn in recent years and it was lovely to see all the young people with their shirts on as his remains were being carried in.” googletag.cmd.push  Dean, known around the community as ‘Floater’, excelled on the sports field and Fr Kelly described him as ‘one of the most gted sportsmen to emerge from Drumsurn in recent years’. In the colours of St Patrick’s College, Dungiven, he was outstanding and won a Derry vocational schools’ All-Star award in . He represented St Matthew’s GAC and Kevin Lynch Hurling Club and carried his talent with modesty. Fr Kelly recalled how he deflected praise after a notable victory at minor level. “He covered every blade of grass in defence and attack but didn’t want any great glory,” he told the congregation. googletag.cmd.push “When Drumsurn and Drum amalgamated as St Patrick’s at minor level a few years ago, he gave an exhibition of football as he dragged his team back into contention and eventually saw them defeat Glenullin having been nine points down at half time. “He declared humbly, ‘sure Micheacuteal Archibald deserves praise more than me’. He loved sport and played Gaelic, soccer, hurling and basketball with distinction for the school.”  Dean in the colours of Kevin Lynch Hurling Club. Off the pitch, Fr Kelly told mourners how Dean had a great sense of fun and spoke of his great love for his family and friends. “He tortured friends and relations with pranks and jokes. He was very close to all his cousins and friends and kept in touch with them,” he said. “When his brother, Justin, go married, he was best man for him and was godfather to their first child, Taylor. He absolutely doted on her, as indeed he did on all his nephews and nieces. “I know how proud Justin and Jordan were of their brother Dean, but they all have wonderful memories as have Gertie, Rory and wider family and friends. “He met a lovely girl in Amber and it looked like they would settle down for good. Of course, he was not known as Dean, it was just ‘Floater’ to all his friends who loved him so much. “In recent times, he had settled a lot and went to live in Dungiven, although, he always insisted, he was a Drumsurn man.” Fr Kelly spoke of the great sadness within the community following his passing. “I’m well aware that Drumsurn is in a state of mourning, as Dean was so well-known and loved here,” he said. “However, we have a promise that death is not the end, but another step on the journey to eternal le. “Everyone who knew him, or even met him, loved him. He had an amazing personality that endeared him to all and had a relentless sense of fun. “To young and old, he was a legend. It has been the most common remark uttered over the past few days. What a character.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Unity of Purpose group was in the news earlier this month when it called for the postponement of a Black Lives Matter rally which was held in Derrys Guildhall Square on June . In a statement, which was issued through the City Centre Initiative in Derry, the group said they understood and supported the reasons for the rally, but added that they believed it should be called off due to public safety concerns in relation to the coronavirus pandemic. However, despite the appeal, the rally went ahead and police subsequently issued  fines to people taking part in the protest. googletag.cmd.push In its recent statement, a spokesperson for theUnityofPurposegroup said it consists of local MPs, MLAs, the Mayor and statutory and business leaders within Derry. In the wake of the Black Lives Matters rally,Shaun Harkin and Eamonn McCann, People Before Profit councillors on the local council, criticised the stance of the Unity of Purpose group and called for the group to disband. The Unity of Purpose group did not respond to the councillors criticisms. Speaking at todays monthly meeting of the council, independent councillor Gary Donnelly accused the group of being very very selective on what they comment on. There have been a lot things that have happened in this city during the time that this group has been about and they have issued no statements. he said. googletag.cmd.push My concern is that they are not accountable, they dont respond and there is a council connection that I am deeply concerned about. I have seen photographs with councillors and I have seen photographs with council officers and I want to try and get some clarication on that. I want clarication on funding. Do we fund them directly or indirectly  I know there is a link to them through the City Centre Initiative. Far from saying what they say they do on the tin, their actions have led to people becoming more marginalised and excluded, added Cllr Donnelly. Speaking at todays meeting, Councillor Eamonn McCann described the Unity of Purpose group as a faceless organisation. He said it was unusual that there no inidual names attached to the recent statement issued by the group. Does this group have a policy document that we can look at  Does it have a constitution  Does it have a set of aims or a mission statement  Becausewe dont see that we are unable to work out in what way the opposition to the Black Lives Matter rally comes within their remit, said Cllr McCann. Cllr Donnelly proposed that the council carry out a report into connections between the council and the Unity of Purpose group. The matter was put to a vote and the proposal was carried, after  councillors voted to support it. Six councillors voted against the proposal.

While a more defined timeline is now in place, clubs should onlywhen they are ready to do so,saidIRFU Rugby Development DirectorColin McEntee. We have already seen a handful of clubs put a Covid- Club Health  Safety Plan in place and resume with reduced activities and we are delighted to see players being active again and reconnecting with their clubs. Given the restricted nature of these activities, we don’t see any clubs being left behind as we continue to work towards ato competition in September. I encourage all clubs to plan for that time with the highest safety standards in mind. PLAYER WELFARE  INJURY PREVENTION Workload volume and activity should be strictly controlled throughout these stages. This will be critical in terms of injury prevention as well as minimizing the risk of COVID- infection. IRFU Medical DirectorRod McLoughlinsaid: We must remember at all times that COVID- has not been eliminated from this island. It is critical that clubs continue to minimise risk and adhere to all public health measures in place. Rugby will onlyin a meaningful waywe adopt the right behaviours that will keep ourselves, our teammates and our club mates safe. He also urged clubs to take extra care with injury prevention measures for players. It has been over  days since any club player has been involved in competitive rugby and we have seen from other team sports that have ed earlier than rugby that there is an increased risk of injury. That means clubs will have to be extra cautious around the training loads they are putting in place. Player welfare still applies around injury prevention just as much as it does in terms of Covid-. PAPERLESS PRE-RETURN TO RUGBY PERSONAL ASSESSMENT DECLARATION FORM Clubs can avail of a new paperless Pre-Return To Rugby Personal Assessment Declaration Form week commencing theJuly th.The online version of the form will be available as part of the new RugbyConnect system. The form is an essential document in Covid- Health  Safety Planning. It confirms that a club member is not suffering from any Covid- Symptoms, been in close contact with anyone who is self-isolating or has travelled from another country in the past  days. PPE SUPPLEMENTARY KITS FOR CLUBS The IRFU will issue supplementary PPE Kits to clubs to assist in the implementation of their COVID- Club Health  Safety Plans. Each club can expect to receive a PPE Kit to their designated COVID- Club Safety Officer contact from the week commencingth June.

Those behind the ambitious project are confident that the ious stories will appeal to both locals and visitors alike.Other interpretative  will tell of the emigration of families from Saintfield to the United States over the last  years, using the example of the three Maffett brothers who left Leggygowan for America, the first in , followed by a further two brothers in .It is one of their descendants, David Moffett, who has made this precious community asset possible.Saintfield Development Association officials, who played a lead role in securing the new community centre, approached the owners of the Windmill Road field and began protracted negotiations to secure the site, with the all-important funding to acquire the land obtained through Mr Moffettrsquos generous donation.A successful business executive with a well-known company in America, his family had links with the area dating back to the early th century, with Mr Moffettrsquos ancestral, family including James and Isabella Maffett and their children, buried in the graveyard at Saintfield Parish Church.Explaining the background to the heritage park proposal, a spokesman for the Development Association explained that a successful funding bid was submitted to the Heritage Lottery Fund for money to carry out necessary feasibility studies on the field.ldquoThese studies have since been completed to the satisfaction of the funder and have shown that there are no impediments for the field to be developed as a community heritage park, he explained.ldquoThese studies will also provide evidence for the necessary planning application for the change of use of the field from agricultural to community use.The spokesman also confirmed that consultants who carried out the feasibility studies of the field also compiled a list of proposals for the development which include measures to obviate as much as possible any disruption or annoyance to neighbouring residents through noise or anti-social behaviour.Public consultation on the proposals will be undertaken once the current pandemic restrictions are sufficiently eased and, following this process, the Development Association intends to raise the funds needed to implement the agreed proposals by applying for suitable grants.There will also be community fundraising.In addition, Newry, Mourne and Down Council has been asked to approve a new link being created between the community centre and proposed heritage park. The issue was under discussion prior to the coronavirus pandemic.Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess has praised all those involved in the project and hopes that the remaining pieces in the development jigsaw fall into place.ldquoThis is a terric development that not only local people can enjoy, but one which visitors to the town can also enjoy and learn so much about Saintfield and its people, he said.ldquoWe are fortunate to have the new community centre up and running and developing a new heritage park would represent further success for the town. Great credit must go Saintfield Heritage Society and townrsquos hardworking Development Association.Cllr Burgess added Saintfield was ldquovery fortunate to have extremely committed community iniduals who have the town and its people very much at heart.Full details of the proposes heritage park proposal are available at discoversaintfield..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Butler look after royalty and presidents  ","story":"FRANCIS McBriar has been a butler to four generations of the Royal Family, served US and Irish presidents and Northern Ireland Secretaries of State.However, he has only one mantra in his mind every time he dons his smart unorm mdash and that is he treats everyone the same.The farmerrsquos son who lives just outside Saintfield with his we Heather has butlered for  years. For those in the know, hersquos the man to reach out foryou have a special occasion or dinner event coming up.Regularly employed by the Earl of Erne at his Fermanagh residence, Crom Castle, Francis was recently featured doing what he does best in the RTE food series, Lords and Ladles.The  year-old was introduced to Hillsborough Castle, the Royal Familyrsquos official residence when they are in Northern Ireland, by the castlersquos late and highly regarded former house manager, David Anderson.ldquoI wouldnrsquot be where I am today without David Anderson, itrsquos as simple as that, said Francis.ldquoWe met through First Saintfield Church which David joined when he moved into the area. We were part of a group looking after senior people of the congregation and we would have worked together hosting dinners and bus outings and so on.ldquoOne day David turned to me and said, lsquoFrancis you are a very adaptable person, you could be a great help to meyou would like to bersquo.ldquoI was invited up to Hillsborough Castle to work with him and things just took off from there. I enjoy working with people and always went out with the intention of helping others and to make sure that they enjoyed their day, or their dinner. I also always found it easy to chat away to people.At that time, Francis was working as a distribution manager for a group of fashion shops and was the father of three young children with no thoughts of a future career in butlering.Today, he works mostly at Crom Castle and, closer to home, at Montalto House in Ballynahinch, but also looks after an American family when they travel to the British Isles.They take Francis wherever they go, sometimes to the Scottish Highlands and hopefully inSeptember to their Dorset property.ldquoIrsquom hoping that it still happens, admits Francis, whose work, like many others, has been affected by the Covid- pandemic.ldquoI really enjoy it and I love to travel. It doesnrsquot bother me being away from home for maybe several weeks at a time. My family are grown up with families of their own and I think my we is quite content to see me going out and about as she gets her head showered.He and Heather have three children, Robert, Anita and James, and a grandchild, George, who will be one year old soon. A second grandchild is due any day now.Having, in his words, ldquolooked after the late Queen Mother, the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh, their children and Prince Charlesrsquo children, the likes of President Bush, Irish presidents Mary McAleese and Michael D Higgins, Francis admits his disappointment at missing out on meeting Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge.He said: ldquoItrsquos been lovely to look after the Royal Family and a few years ago I was invited up to look after Prince William. I was so looking forward to looking after the couple but unfortunately that was the day the Duchess announced she was pregnant with Prince Louis and couldnrsquot fly over. So I missed that opportunity and would have loved to have met Kate.He believes that having served royalty, he can serve anyone and his nerve has never let him down so far.ldquoI think perhaps once you have attended to the people at Hillsborough Castle, it takes any nerves away, said Francis. ldquoYou think wellI can serve the Queen, then I can serve anyone. No-one is better than anyone  in my eyes. I just go in and do my best for whoever Irsquom looking after.For most people, the role of butler is quite rare today but in the days of stately and larger homes a bulter was the head male servant in a large household and his job was to manage the work of all the other servants.Francis agrees that his role is similar to that of the most famous butler in recent times, Carson, from the hit TV series and movie, Downton Abbey.ldquoThe whole point of being a butler is be unobtrusive but close at hand in the backgroundyou are needed. You need to judge when not to overstay your welcome when you are at the table.ldquoWhat happens there, stays there. I suppose I have developed a reputation for being discreet and I try to be. I would never tell others the conversations I hear around the table. As far as Irsquom concerned, everything is private.ldquoI treat everyone the same, no matter what their position in le, These people are paying my wages. I believe that nobody is better than anyone . If they are there at the table, then Irsquom there to look after them.Unlike Carson, who had to extract Lady Mary out of a number of compromising situations, Francis has never come across anyone who was the worst for wear for drink or found in an embarrassing situation.ldquoI must admit that in the circles I would be in, Irsquove never come across anyone over-indulging. My job is really to be able to turn my hand to anything and to look after people. The butler is really in charge of the household. When I go to work at Crom Castle, the Earl tells me lsquoFrancis, yoursquore in charge, itrsquos over to yoursquo.Working with some of the best chefs around, Francis admits that hersquos been treated to some delicious dining experiences through his work.ldquoI honestly donrsquot see what I do as work. Itrsquos not workyou love what you do, he said..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Developers asked to show interest in Irish Street site  ","story":"DEVELOPERS will shortly be asked to submit expressions of interest in transforming a major site in the heart of Downpatrick to help bolster the townrsquos economic recovery.The Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council are driving ambitious plans to redevelop a near two acre site encompassing the former Irish Street police station, a number of adjacent empty buildings and the local authority-owned car park.While it was feared that the coronavirus pandemic could delay plans to redevelop of the huge site, work has continued on the project with a new brochure produced to provide would-be developers and other interested parties with an overview of the sitersquos potential and secure expressions of interest.The development site stretches as far back as St Patrickrsquos Avenue and is also adjacent to the Irish Street car park, with council officials looking to make the brochure available to the public virtually.Described as a ldquostrategic and prominent location in the heart of Downpatrick, senior council officials, politicians and members of the business community are excited at the Irish Street sitersquos development potential and are working towards drawing up a development brief.While the former police base enjoys protected status, it is hoped that potential developers will be able to come up with an imaginative plan for the historic building and that a preferred bidder will be appointed as early as October and as late as the end of the year.The council and the Department for Communities are keen to revitalise Irish Street and hope its redevelopment will act as a catalyst for the wider economic and social regeneration of the town.Council officials say that the Irish Street project is vital to the recovery of the local economy, improving the wellbeing of the community and a welcome confidence boost for the construction sector.In addition, they insist that theyrsquore committed to working with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the site and want to hear their feedback on the way forward.The steering group set up to oversee the Downpatrick scheme held a recent progress meeting and council chairwoman Laura Devlin said she was delighted with the projectrsquos momentum.She confirmed that councillors and local authority officials have been working with the Department for Communities and local stakeholders to develop an lsquoonline engagement processrsquo.She explained this is designed to inform the preferred end uses for the Irish Street site and allow key stakeholders to have input into the development brief which is critical to the success of the project.ldquoWhile the Downpatrick regeneration scheme is in the early developmental stages, it will also stimulate signicant investment for the local economy, she added.John Armstrong, from the Construction Employers Federation, said the scheme and a number of others the council is planning for the Newry area, will provide a boost for the local construction sector.South Down MP Chris Hazzard and Downpatrick councillors Dermot Curran and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed the progress being made on redeveloping he site.Mr Hazzard described the regeneration project as a ldquounique and exciting opportunity, one which has the potential to unlock much-needed economic and social opportunity for the town centre and wider community.ldquoThis regeneration project must act as a catalyst for the long overdue expansion of the townrsquos evening and weekend economy its new heartbeat in some respects, he continued.ldquoGiven the sitersquos close proximity to nearby homes, the project must also be viewed as more than a commercial development. It must seek to bind together the town centre with the outlying housing developments and consequently look to improve the economic and social wellbeing of the local community.Cllr Curran agreed that the Irish Street site offered a ldquounique opportunity for the development of business, employment and tourism.He thanked council committees and Department for Infrastructure for supporting the project.He said: ldquoThe Irish Street project represents the single biggest change to the town centre in a generation. It has the potential to transform Downpatrick and itrsquos vital everyone works together to make the regeneration proposal a major success.ldquoThe planned redevelopment is one of the most important projects ever proposed for Downpatrick and it is vital to make the most of the opportunities it presents. The proposal has the potential to add a new vibrancy with local people helping shape how this key site will be transformed.Cllr Hanlon said she was pleased that the next stage of the sitersquos redevelopment is ready for launch, allowing potential developers and interested parties an opportunity to view the site online, with feedback from the local community welcomed.ldquoPeople will be able to give their views on the potential for the site and the likely constraints within any proposed project, she explained. ldquoAny feedback would be used to assist both the council and Department for Communities to prepare a development brief for the site.Cllr Hanlon added: ldquoThe project to redevelop the former police base and surrounding area provides an opportunity to reinvigorate the Downpatrick town centre.

However,we use DNA technology to catch dog owners who allow their pets to foul public areas, their identity will be made publicthey end up in court, he continued.ldquoDog fouling problem is a highly contentious issue and, without doubt, one of the single most complained about problems across our district. It is something that we have not yet to got to grips with, but perhaps the new initiative under consideration will change that.Cllr Walker said it was important to remember that the overwhelming majority of dog owners across the district cleaned up after their pets, but there was a hardcore who did not.He added: ldquoWe have talked about this issue for years and the problem has not diminished in any way. People are looking to politicians and the council for leadership and it is vital that we do everything we can to address this problem.Another Rowallane councillor, Kathryn Owen, has welcomed agreement to pursue the DNA issue, explaining that while this particular suggestion had been been brought to the council many times in the past, it was always rejected.She said that going down the route of DNA testing would remove the need for CCTV cameras to be erected to capture video evidence or the need for witness statements to nab offenders.Cllr Owen said that despite the refusal to examine DNA testing in the past, there is now a ldquochange in tone and acceptance to explore this particular option.She added: ldquoI was delighted to support this course of action proposed by Cllr Patrick Brown as something drastic needs to be done.ldquoIt is a terrible shame that it has come to this. Council officers are now going to compile a report for the Neighbourhood Services Committee to decide on the viability of using DNA technology to catch offenders..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Education Minister visits Saintfield school presentation  ","story":"EDUCATION Minister Peter Weir made a special visit to St Maryrsquos Primary School in Saintfield on Monday morning.Mr Weir was the guest of honour at the annual P awards presentation which was held with social distancing and health and safety measures in place to protect the children and their parents.Mr Weir presented some of the awards and was also on the receiving end of a gt when Ryan Walsh Williams presented him with a rainbow chameleon which he has specially painted for the occasion.The children were delighted to receive the awards as an acknowledgement of their success during seven years at St Maryrsquos.The Very Rev Father Anthony McHugh gave the children and parents a blessing for their future.The school has remained open throughout the Covid- pandemic and plans to re-open for all children as soon as the Department of Education gives its permission.A spokesperson for the school said: ldquoSt Maryrsquos is delighted to announce that it will be able to re-open with social distancing measures in place for all children as soon as a restart date is approved in mid to late August.ldquoClassrooms have already set out the two-metre social distancing rule and all staff are keen to welcome all children back in a safe and effective manner.ldquoTeachers are aware of the need to promote the health and well-being and of pupils and the school has a new nurture room, ready and waiting for use.ldquoTeachers said their first aim is to address the wellbeing of our children using a nurturing approach.ldquoWe believe that the best place to do that is in our school environment.

While I missed my family and friends and others who have played a signicant part in my le, I am glad that they could watch from afar via the live-stream.The service began with a welcome and call to worship by the Moderator of Down Presbytery, Rev Dario Leal, minister of First Ballynahinch Presbyterian.During the service, which included three pre-recorded items of worship by members Second Saintfield, Brian McKee a representative elder to the Presbytery from First Ballynahinch, read from  Timothy :-.The sermon, based on the reading from First Timothy, was delivered by the Rev David Hyndman, minister of Magherahamlet and Spa Presbyterian Churches, who convened the Second Saintfield vacancy.Those present for the service and others watching online from over  separate locations also heard short pre-recorded speeches after the service had concluded.One was a message of welcome from Stanley McFarland, Clerk of Session of Second Saintfield Presbyterian Church.The Presbytery Moderator described the installation and ordination service as ldquodferent, but a special evening.He added: ldquoJohn received and accepted a call from Second Saintfield on the Monday before lockdown. While it was frustrating for all concerned that his ordination and installation could not take place in Saintfield due to the restrictions in place, we were delighted and relieved when the offer came from the PCIrsquos General Secretary inviting us to use Assembly Buildings.ldquoIt now means that John can commence his ministry for which he trained and has been called to.

The Greens have also given their assent. The three parties between them have a majority in the Dail.Whether this damages SF long-term, or boosts them in a future Irish election, remains to be seen.Unionists in Northern Ireland should be most interested in the ‘shared island’ section of the draft programme for government. Much of it is vague and harmless, but the Covid- crisis has shown that there are always powerful forces trying to ensure that we pursue all-island policies .Above all the Irish ruling parties have called for January’s New Decade New Approach Stormont deal to be implemented in full. Julian Smith included a commitment to bring in the problematic Stormont House legacy bodies in that agreement, which is causing dficulties. No unionist party should have accepted a deal that had such a pledge. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Please try again later.Submitting...When we entered lockdown, like many people I assumed that when the government lted the restrictions on our freedoms that I wouldto past habits– indeed that I would rush back with renewed zeal.\u2028But that expectation did not foresee the psychologicalchanges which occur during a period of enforced solitude as a household at a time of fear and death.While there are many activitieswhose resumption I relish, it is the simpler ones – being able to see the children hug their grandparents, or playing football with my friends – which are more important than being allowed to shop for a new sofa or yet another tie.AndI,as someone phlegmatic about the personal risk of contracting the virus and in a lower risk category, feel apathy at a rush back to activities such as non-essential shopping, the drop in demand will surely be exacerbated by those who have a deep fear of Covid- as well as those who simply no longer have any spare cash to spend.Butenough of us feel comfortable consuming far less, the temporary economic collapse during lockdown is likely to become a prolongedeconomicslump.Last Wednesday, the front page headline in the Belfastexpressed that bluntly: “Spend your cash to save our jobs”.The headline was based on the comments of Neil Gibson, the respected chief economist of business advisory firm EY Ireland.Highlighting that many people – especially in the public sector – had retained their full salaries and saved money during the shutdown, Mr Gibson said: “It will be our responsibility as citizens and as businesses to show confidence in the sectors of our economy that need it most.“This will require a collective effort to go out for a meal, to buy a coffee from our local cafe and to go to the cinema when they open.”In terms of economictheory, his logic is flawless –we all reduce our spending, the unavoidable consequence will be dramatic job losses.Those job losses are not even likely to hurt all sections of society equally.It already seems clear that the recession into which we have entered is disproportionately hitting women, the young and those who were already the poorest.This week the Belfast-based think tank Pivotal published a report which set out a landscape of economic devastation which, because it has been masked and delayed by unprecedented government support during the lockdown, does not appear to have been grasped by many people.The report said: “The scale of contraction in the Northern Ireland economy is estimated to be much faster and larger than previous recessions ...the nature of the Northern Ireland economy makes it vulnerable to not ing to ‘pre-Covid’ ing for some time,at all”.The report also noted some of the benefits of lockdown and the opportunities which it now provides for Stormont and councils to reshape Northern Ireland by addressing embedded problems.It noted that less travel has meant less congestion and cleaner air, that some businesses have adapted to create new products and find new customers, and that society now has greater appreciation of those essential workers who until now have in many cases been at the bottom of the social and salary scales.And yet herein lies a conundrum. On the one hand, many of us want to retain some of what we have valued about the last few months – the slower pace, the increased focus on our families, the appreciation of the small things in le, and the realisation that contentment is often not simply found in material gain.And yet on the other hand, we want to retain our salaries, and the paraphernalia which accompanied pre-pandemic prosperity.Whatthose two aspirations are incompatible Mr Gibson made clear that he was not advocating reckless spending and his argument was centred on local cafés and restaurants who are facing a brutal prognosissocial distancing rules remain.However, ato far wider consumerism will be necessary to avoid massive retail job losses, and then the associated impacts on other sectors such as the property market.Others have gone far further. Last month the French labour minister called on people to “consume” while the local government in Wuhan, the epicentre of the pandemic, created  million of ‘consumption coupons’ to encourage its residents to spend.One does not have to be a hardline socialist or an asceticto wince at the idea that we now have some sort of civic duty to go out and spend money on items we don’t need which damage the earth and clog our homes because otherwise there will be mass joblessness.As young people in particular become increasingly alarmed about the future of the planet, is an economy which depends on begging us to resume wanton consumerism, rather than focussing on what we need, ultimately sustainable If not, can and should the economy be rebuilt in a more productive and sustainable way While the answers to these questions will be influenced by global forces far beyond Northern Ireland, our politicians have considerable power to help shape whetherthe new economy is simply an attempt to replicate as much as possible of what went before.Already there are glimpses of new thinking in Stormont.To the surprise of some observers, the DUP environment minister Edwin Poots is already pursuing some innovative environmental policies –from a vast tree-planting programme to an attempt at massively increasing not just how much we recycle, but how much of that material is recycled in Northern Ireland rather than leaving our shores with no guarantee that it is actually reused.SDLP infrastructure minister Nichola Mallon has energetically pledged major focus on expanding cycle lanes and pedestrianisation.Those projects both have the potential for signicant job-creation.\u2028This week’s report by Pivotal calls for “inclusive growth that benefits everyone in Northern Ireland” and which “should focus on good quality jobs that offer fair pay, security and progression prospects, underpinned by improved skills that enable people to access these opportunities”.If the immediate future is as economically grim as anticipated, the temptation will be for a desperate Stormont to simply encourage any jobs at all – regardless of their sustainability, environmental impact or how the workers are treated.If we want to retain some of the gains of recent months, with slower, simpler lives, it almost inevitably follows that we will be poorer – at least for some time.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Powys.NRW proposed the dam as one option to alleviate potential flood risk.More NewsVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldMillions become unpaid carers due to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become an exemplar of good practice. community involvement and support will remain key features of our campaign.He added: ldquoWe are grateful to people far and wide who have supported our campaign, including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the A to reduce flood risk.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquolsquoFollowing our meeting on May  Sir David Henshaw chairman of NRW wrote to me on May  to say that NRW received almost  responses to our consultation on the Outline Business Case with the vast majority being opposed to the upstream storage option on the Cadoxton Brook.NRW chairman, Sir Henshaw said: ldquoWhen

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

These include:Communication of health information, and how effective it isCultural issues relating to the suitability of health and social services for BAME communitiesIncome and employment insecurity, which is experienced disproportionately by BAME communitiesPoor quality of ethnicity data, which is preventing accurate analysisHousing overcrowding and environmentThe financial burden created by migration statusThe role of structural and systemic racism and disadvantage.The report is by the BAME Covid- expert advisory group, set up by First Minister Mark Drakeford to look at the reasons why people from BAME communities were more likely to be adversely affected by coronavirus.:One of its two sub-groups was tasked with examining the socio-economic factors, chaired by Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna, professor of management and organization at Cardf Business School, Cardf University.\"Therersquos an overall theme running through our research for this report. It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females. Signicant dferences also remain for Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Indian men. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communitySince March , the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has advised British nationals against all but

Also known as travel corridors, air bridges will allow Britons to go on holiday to certain destinations without needing to quarantine for  days on theirto the UK.In place of the quarantine arrangements will be a traffic light system, with officials placing countries into green, amber and red categories based on the prevalence of coronavirus within each nationrsquos borders.It is expected a quarantine-free list of countries will be published on Wednesday, with restrictions lted as soon as July .ndash Which countries are likely to be included The Government is expected to announce next week Britainrsquos first air bridges with ldquolow-risk European destinations, including France, Italy, Spain, Greece and Germany.According to reports, air bridges will be announced in batches, with the second set of destinations likely to include other European countries such as Denmark, Norway, Finland and the Netherlands, and ldquolow-risk Caribbean islands.Transport Secretary

June , when the quarantine measures will be officially reviewed.Greek tourism minister Haris Theoharis has indicated it could be up to three weeks before his country is happy to open up an air bridge to the UK, depending on the advice they get from health experts.ndash Which countries are unlikely to be included There were mixed reports over whether Portugal would be included in the UKrsquos plans next week, after a spike in coronavirus cases in the country.Long-haul flights to destinations such as Vietnam, Singapore, Hong Kong are reportedly not expected before late summer.Flights to Australia are thought to be more complicated, due to the need to stop over in other countries, which increases the risk of contracting or spreading coronavirus. vw,vw,px, px\"Passengers will have a dferent holiday experience, with masks and social distancing in place where possible ndash What are the rules on quarantine Since June , all passengers, bar a handful of exemptions, have been required to go into self-isolation for  days when they arrive in the UK.People who fail to comply can be fined pound, in England, and police are allowed to use ldquoreasonable force to make sure they follow the rules.ndash What measures have airports taken Last month, Heathrow Airport began trials of thermal screening technology to detect elevated temperatures of arriving passengers.Edinburgh Airport has implemented a colour-coded one-way system to maintain social distancing, while protective screens have been installed at check-in, security and arrivals, and staff wear face coverings and personal protective equipmentin ldquopassenger-facing areas.At Gatwick Airport, hand sanitiser stations, protective screens, regular deep cleaning and social distancing instructions have been introduced throughout the site, with face mask vending machines selling four masks for pound.Pre-booked airport security slots are being tested at Manchester Airport, in which passengers can reserve a free -minute window to use a dedicated lane taking them directly to a checkpoint.ndash What about on board flights It looks as though in-flight food and drinks will not be available, or at least be limited, for a while.EasyJet said it will not have a bistro or boutique service on board, but will have drinking water available for those who request it.The airline said it hopes to have a limited

be out and about andit can be done safely at these sites, it should be.”In response to these comments, Council’s strategic director,Mark Parkinson, confirmed caravan sites at both Gosford Forest Park and Clare Glen would open from Friday, June .“Gosford will open on June  and so will Clare Glen,” said Mr Parkinson.“The site at Kinnego will reopen on Friday, July , and at all these sites the caravan, camping, toilet and shower facilities will be available.”SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon askedthose who had made bookings before the outbreak of the COVID- pandemic and subsequently had their bookings cancelled, were being contacted to ensure they could still avail of the service.“Some people had booked their slots at these sites early in January and paid for them,” said Cllr O’Hanlon. “They were quickly refunded during the outbreak and that was good and the right thing to do but have we made contact with those people now “They had been on the ball and made their bookings early, it wouldbe a shamethey were now to miss out, when the sites have reopened, through no real fault of their own.”His question went unanswered on the night and when the Local Democracy

Forest Park and Kinnego Marina, we are working with the public to accommodateall bookings where possible based on reduced capacity and in compliance with social distancing and PHA guidance,” said a
