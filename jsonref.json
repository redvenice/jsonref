So we\u0027re definitely seeing a bounce-back from all of that, and we believe given the products we sell, being the engagement rings, the diamond rings, the wedding rings - we see that continuing throughout this year.\u0027But we\u0027re also seeing a significant increase in Swiss watches, so people wanting to treat themselves. So I think there\u0027s a real balance between gifting for others and actually just wanting to treat themselves, they\u0027ve probably saved a lot of money.\u0027I think through lockdown we saw online that people weren\u0027t going away, they were getting refunds and they weren\u0027t spending and treating themselves. And now I think there\u0027s still limitations to what people can do and I think they\u0027re thinking they\u0027ve always wanted that Swiss watch or that diamond ring.\u0027Style experts have predicted that Britain is gearing up for a post-lockdown \u0027fiesta in make-up and in fragrances\u0027 not seen since the Roaring 1920s. L\u0027Oreal, the world\u0027s biggest make-up brand, predicts a post-pandemic sales bonanza when wearing lipstick will become \u0027a symbol of returning to life\u0027.That upbeat message was last night backed by fashion experts who claimed that lockdown-weary Brits are aching for the chance to dress up and socialise in safety again.In a reference to the hedonism of the 1920s following the First World War and 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, L\u0027Oreal\u0027s chief executive Jean-Paul Agon predicted a party atmosphere when Covid-19 is finally tamed.\u0027This will be like the Roaring Twenties, there will be a fiesta in make-up and in fragrances,\u0027 he said.\u0027Putting on lipstick again will be a symbol of returning to life.\u0027Leading make-up artist Ruby Hammer, who has styled A-list clients such as supermodels Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell, agreed.\u0027We are already putting emphasis on our eyes and eyebrows by virtue of having to wear a mask but when we can reveal a little bit more of our face we will go bonkers,\u0027 she said.\u0027As human beings we love to celebrate - and make-up gives us a boost. In the 1920s, instead of people saying \u0027woe is me\u0027, they celebrated and looked fabulous doing it. So, there is no doubt that we will want to present to the world the same opulence and we do that by expressing ourselves through the way we look.\u0027It won\u0027t be seen as self-indulgence but something as very important. A beautiful fragrance or lipstick can make you feel wow.\u0027The \u0027Roaring Twenties\u0027, when people defied society\u0027s conventions by wearing daring fashions and holding wild parties, was most famously chronicled in F Scott Fitzgerald\u0027s novel The Great Gatsby. \u0027It was an age of miracles,\u0027 the novelist once wrote. \u0027It was an age of art, it was an age of excess.\u0027Cosmetic sales have plummeted during the coronavirus crisis as store closures, coupled with the shift to homeworking, prompted many women to ditch make-up with sales of foundation and lipstick plunging during the original lockdown by more than 70 per cent. But Lesley Blair, chair of the British Association of Beauty Therapy And Cosmetology, believes the cosmetics industry will prosper post-lockdown.\u0027There will be an absolute boom when this nightmare is over,\u0027 she said. \u0027We will be buying more than we\u0027ve ever bought before. We are desperate to get dressed up and with a little bit more disposable income that will be possible. Putting a little bit of lipstick on solves everything.\u0027Trend forecaster Andrew Ibi, of pressure group Fashion Academics Creating Equality, agrees that the sales bonanza will be driven by people\u0027s simple desire to feel good.\u0027Post-pandemic, we will be looking for ways to reconnect socially – clothes, hair and make-up will be part of the therapy,\u0027 he said.    "},{"url":null,"title":"GPs told CANCEL planned AstraZeneca vaccination appointments pregnant women","story":"Share this article When vaccines for Covid first started to be rolled out, the World Health Organization warned they should should not be used on pregnant women due to lack of evidence about their safety and efficacy. Later, the body walked back on its advice and said jabs can be administered to expectant mothers safely after more data emerged to show that pregnant women appeared to be more likely to fall very ill with Covid than their peers.Pregnant women in the US have been able to get the Covid jab at the same time as their peers since last year.There is no evidence any Covid vaccine has any effect on a woman\u0027s chances of becoming pregnant, or pose any risk to unborn babies. NHS guidance says there is no need to avoid pregnancy after vaccination. Top UK doctors praised the move from the JCVI, claiming it would \u0027empower\u0027 pregnant women. Dr Edward Morris, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG), said: \u0027We are grateful to the JCVI for taking into consideration our evidence and updating the guidance around the Covid vaccine in pregnancy.\u0027Vaccination offers pregnant women the best protection from Covid, which can be serious in some women.\u0027We believe it should be a woman\u0027s choice whether to have the vaccine or not after considering the benefits and risks and would encourage pregnant women to discuss with a trusted source like their GP, obstetrician or midwife, or a healthcare professional in a vaccination centre.\u0027This move will empower all the pregnant women in the UK to make the decision that is right for them, at the same time that the non-pregnant population in their age group receive protection from Covid-19.\u0027Health chiefs advise women to be extra cautious about Covid if they are pregnant or planning to have a baby, and mothers-to-be are on the \u0027clinically vulnerable\u0027 list, but there is not much hard evidence on the specific risks they face. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists says pregnant women are no more likely to catch Covid than others, and that most have no symptoms or suffer mild cold or flu-like warning signs.But there are a small number who can become unwell with the virus, and may be at increased risk of becoming severely ill compared to other women.Some studies have suggested mothers-to-be may be twice as likely to be admitted to intensive care than their non-pregnant peers if they catch Covid. A range of jabs are already recommended for pregnant women in the UK, including ones for seasonal flu and whooping cough. Medics say the tetanus shot can also be given to those who are expecting if necessary. "},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"World\u0026rsquos biggest carbon emitters, including China and Russia, will be in virtual roomThis would require prioritising generosity and sustainable living, and measuring success in terms of contentment not GDPState strategy does not set target to reduce sector\u0026rsquos main source of carbon emissions - livestock"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker what s available in the republic of ireland and what else is coming","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 240,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,800 people have died.Globally, over 140 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Scientists have been racing to develop a vaccine that would bring an end to the pandemic, and there are now 88\u0026nbspdifferent vaccines in clinical development, with another 184 in preclinical development, according to the World Health Organisation.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspis also in talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine. \u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and expects to have its first results by April 2021. On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top four cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3) and\u0026nbsppeople aged 16 to 69 who are at very high risk (cohort 4).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be\u0026nbsppeople aged 65 to 69 who are at high risk (cohort 5), other people aged 65-69 (cohort 6) and\u0026nbsppeople aged 16 to 64 who are at high risk (cohort 7).

File photograph: Stephen CollinsCollins PhotosThe number of people to have tested positive for Covid-19 at walk-in testing centres for the asymptomatic people has surpassed the 1,000 mark.In the four weeks since the HSE first opened the centres, some 1,062 people have tested positive for the disease out of 36,500 tested, giving a positivity rate of almost 3 per cent nationally.Testing sites were chosen to catch symptom-free positive cases in an attempt to identify unknown clusters of infection and to prevent further transmission of the disease.Locations were picked based on high incidence rates of the disease and to encourage people to seek Covid-19 tests, even if they have no symptoms. The aim of the centres is to offer tests to people who may not have a GP or who may be reluctant to visit a doctor’s surgery because they might only have mild symptoms.There are five pop-up centres in operation: at Tallaght Stadium, at Cumann Naomh Peregrine in Mulhuddart, at Parnells GAA Club in Coolock and at St Catherine’s Community Sports Centre in The Liberties in Dublin and at the HSE primary care centre in Cahir, Co Tipperary. People are also being tested who walk in to the HSE’s testing centres at St Loman’s Hospital in Mullingar and at Ballinacarriga GAA in Dunmanway in Co Cork. Walk-ins will be accepted at another centre, Tralee in Co Kerry from Wednesday. The testing has detected high infection rates in some areas, as high as 8.2 per cent among people tested in Coolock, 6.5 per cent at The Liberties and 5.5 per cent in Mulhuddart. “This shows us where pockets of the disease are,” said Niamh O’Beirne, the HSE’s national lead on testing and tracing, confirming the view of public health doctors that high rates of asymptomatic spread would be detected in areas where incidence rates were high.The testing has revealed a trend showing additional cases of infection linked to family, workplace and other known outbreaks of the disease. “There have been more small groups of people with more close contacts and there is a rising number of people who are having more close contacts,” said Ms O’Beirne.“It is not having a massive increase overall on average number of close contacts but we are finding more people who have 10 or more contacts because they are meeting family.”Tracers, who are responsible for calling close contacts of infected cases, have found people reporting back that they are tired with the public restrictions and self-isolation, she said.Some people contacted by tracers had the incorrect view that the most vulnerable had been protected because of vaccinations and so they did not need to stick with public health measures. There was a need to keep case numbers low while more people are vaccinated, she said. The positivity rate among walk-ins is considerably higher than the serial testing in nursing homes and other residential care homes, which stands at 0.1 per cent. Across 35 community testing sites around the country the positivity rate has been as high as 15 per cent in Donegal over the last seven days, 12 per cent in Meath and 8.8 per cent in Dublin.

Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillTwo fully vaccinated staff members at Dealgan House nursing home in Dundalk, Co Louth have tested positive for Covid-19 during routine testing of nursing home staff.The outbreak has led to the suspension of indoor visits at the nursing home. Dealgan House nursing home said that the two employees had received positive results as part of routine serial testing carried out on a fortnightly basis at the nursing home.“Both staff members were fully vaccinated, receiving their second doses in February and neither have symptoms of any sort,” said the nursing home in a statement.“All residents of the nursing home are fully vaccinated. We have temporarily suspended visiting pending advice from public health.”The second and final doses of the vaccine were administered to residents and staff of Dealgan House in the first week in February when the nursing home’s chief executive Eoin Farrelly said that he hoped that the nursing home had “seen the back of this dreadful disease.”Deaglan House was one of the worst affected in the country during the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic when 22 residents died in an outbreak a year ago.Covid-19 vaccines prevent severe disease and death but people can still test positive for the virus after being fully inoculated, despite having high levels of protection from serious illness.“It is possible to contract Covid after being fully vaccinated. It is not see as a vaccine failure unless you are very sick,” said a health sector source.“It is not 100 per cent that you wouldn’t get Covid it is just that you would not get very sick.” Sinn Féin TD for Louth Ruairí Ó Murchú called for the HSE and public health doctors to “engage straight away” and test all residents at the 82-bed nursing home after the positive cases. “We are obviously aware that the efficacy rates on the vaccines are never 100 per cent. The fact that these people are asymptomatic would lead you to believe that the vaccines have been very successful in avoiding serious sickness, hospitalisation or worse,” he said.“But this is a warning to all of us that even with the vaccination rollout we need to follow the precautions in relation to social distancing and public health measures.” Typically, public health doctors carry out a risk assessment of a nursing home before deciding whether all residents of the facility have to be tested following positive cases among staff. Mr Ó Murchú said the HSE needed to carry out “trace back” testing to see where the infections came from and genomic sequencing to see if the cases are linked to new variants of concern.Last year’s outbreak at Dealgan House left the nursing home short of staff as it struggled to manage the virus with the HSE even contemplating calling in the Defence Forces and the Red Cross to help at one point. The RCSI Hospital Group temporarily stepped in to run the home. Vaccinations and lockdown restrictions have led to a dramatic fall in the number of Covid-19 cases and outbreaks recorded in nursing homes and other residential care facilities. The outbreak in Dealgan House comes after no new nursing home outbreaks were reported in the week to April 10th - the first week with no reported outbreaks of the disease since last year. The positivity rate in serial testing of nursing home staff has fallen to 0.1 per cent - a level last experienced in July - from a high of 2.3 per cent in January at the peak of the third wave.

Photograph: Daragh Mc SweeneyProvision.Like many people’s hairstyles and dye jobs, Co Cork-based hairdresser Wayne Lloyd believes the shadow economy in his profession has grown out of control in recent months. Lloyd, who owns salons in Bandon and Ballydehob, says you would not think there has been an enforced closure of personal services since Covid-19 cases spiked in late December when you walk down the street or look on social media. “It’s ridiculous. The amount of people I’ve seen with their hair done, the blatant advertisements on Facebook, we all know about it,” he says. “We are fearful of what it has done to our industry. Black market hairdressers have almost become the heroes of lockdown.”Lloyd says a minority have bent the rules and provided services over the last four months, with some arguing they have had to in order to make ends meet. However, he says they are breaking the law and that the Government and Revenue should intervene to stop this shadow economy. “Eventually, everybody’s tax rate will go up if people keep spending money on the shadow economy and not paying tax on it. Revenue will have to get that money somehow,” he says.“They are not insured, they are potentially spreading the virus. You can’t guarantee what the safety measures are if you’re going around to somebody’s house.”Fixed reopening dateAmid suggestions that personal services could reopen next month, Lloyd says a fixed date for the resumption of business would be helpful. The Irish Hairdressing Council, of which he is president, has written to the Government asking for advance notice of same so that salons can prepare. “During one of the lockdowns we got 48 hours’ notice of reopening. It was chaos,” he says. “Our clients think we already have opening dates, we are getting a barrage of emails.”Lloyd added that staff also have to be mentally prepared to return to work after more than 120 days of closure. “Even though they are dying to get back to work, you get into a different mental state during lockdown,” he says. “People are used to being at home, they almost have a fear of going back out there.”Lloyd feels that his clients will return when things open up as “it’s not just about the hairdressing, it’s about the service”. However, he believes reopening too quickly would come with risks. “Other countries have new strains and and are locking back down. If we open up and close back down again, we will lose more salons,” he says.“We’ve already lost small salons in villages and towns, and that’s the heart of Ireland. Your high-street salon in a little town is the hub of the community .

File photograph: Eric LukeDetails of a new tunnel bypassing the Glen of the Downs in Co Wicklow have been released showing a 2km route under the western side of the Glen.The new Purple Route would see traffic between Dublin and Wexford ert into the tunnel under some 20 local houses. The route corridor also passes below the Norman Downs village and fair green, the 15th-century St Mary’s Church, and a ninth-century ring fort overlooking the Glen itself.At the northern end of the Glen the tunnel would emerge north of the local Red Lane, where it would rejoin the existing M11N11.Consultants Arup working with Transport Infrastructure Ireland’s regional roads office have come up with the design having discounted some earlier options, including two possible routes across Delgany Golf Club.Details of the tunnel route were added to the project website last week under the heading Phase 2 short-listed corridors. Consideration of a tunnel was first mentioned in an update to the project website in December 2020, when the extent of difficulties with other route options became apparent.Three options now remain on the project shortlist are:– To widen the existing route along the Glen floor. This is considered controversial as it would require a further slice off the nature reserve, a Special Area of Conservation which is protected under EU law. Widening the route to a dual carriageway sparked a three-year protest by eco-campaigners some 20 years ago.– A route high on the western side of the Glen known as the Cyan Route. This route is considered punitively expensive as it is 7.9km long. It contains a number of bends as it hugs the contours of Downshill. This route may also attract objections on heritage and environmental grounds given the presence of a pre-historic hillfort on Downshill.– The tunnel route, while costly, would avoid much of the issues raised by other options.HeritageA spokesman for the design team said the approach to the project was an incremental one. He said the first options would have been the simplest and most straightforward, and as each one was ruled out the more expensive and complex options were being investigated.The tunnel option has already received a positive response from heritage enthusiasts. Founder of the website glenodownsheritage Jasime Fortune, who has researched and published much of the known history of the area said the tunnel was “the best outcome” in terms of reducing disruption to bioersity and heritage.Local TD Jennifer Whitmore who lives in Delgany said the community “has been very clear since the start of this process that they want the local, natural and cultural heritage of the area protected and this must be a key priority for the project”.The Glen of the Downs section of the N11M11 upgrade is part of a 22km upgrade of the N11M11 corridor stretching from the M50 to Coynes Cross in Ashford.The scheme traverses two local authority boundaries, Wicklow County Council and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council. Wicklow County Council is the lead authority and appointed consultants Arup in 2018.However, as the area falls within the bounds of the Kildare National Roads Office, that office is responsible for the project management and delivery.

Photograph: RTÉScreenshotPrehistoric Irish people were dark skinned and had blue eyes, a new documentary claims.The hunter gather population that lived in Ireland 10,000 years ago do not have any of the pigmentation profiles associated with light skin.They inhabited the island for 4,000 years before being replaced by settled farmers.According to TCD geneticist Dr Lara Cassidy, techniques normally used in forensic criminal investigations have revealed surprising details about prehistoric Irish people.Scientists have been developing a genetic database of ancient Irish genomes from all periods of pre-history to understand how the modern Irish gene pool came about.She said the hunter-gatherer Irish not only had dark skin, but also bright blue eyes – a combination rarely seen today.They operated mostly along the coast of the Burren gathering shellfish, and then moving inland to hunt wild boar and gather hazelnuts.The Burren’s unique geological landscape means it has preserved evidence of millennia of settlement in the area of west Clare.The hunter gathers were replaced by early farmers. The earliest evidence of farmers in Ireland is in the Burren. They arrived approximately 6,000 years ago in what was known as the Neolithic era.“We know now from ancient genomes that farming was accompanied by a whole group of people moving into the continent from the region now known as modern Turkey, ” she said.They brought cattle, sheep and goats, pottery and new housing structures. They have lighter skin than the hunter gather, but more sallow than today.“There could have been violence. This would have been quite a dramatic colonisation event,” Dr Cassidy added.However, it is more likely that they co-existed peacefully as the remains of one early farmer showed that he had hunter gatherer ancestry.Gene poolThe early farmers began by clearing the trees with polished stone axes to make for arable land. They built the dolmens which populate the area.In 4,000 years the last wave of early settlers came to Ireland. They were at the tail end of a large scale migration in the Steppe region of Russia into western Europe.“Only at that point do we see the establishment of the modern Irish gene pool as we know it today,” Dr Cassidy added.Environmental biologist Carl Wright said the Burren once featured high mountains with a thick forest covering. The mountains were replaced by glaciers during the Ice Age which removed a kilometre of rock off the top of this landscape.The early farmers relentlessly cleared the forests until there was hardly any of the original forest left.“They overgrazed the Burren during the climatic downturn of 3,000 years ago – this led to an environmental disaster on a colossal scale, because over a very short space of time we have massive soil erosion which pretty much left us with the landscape that we have at the end of the last ice age. Literally just bare rock, the soil was washed away,” he said.The Burren:\u0026nbspHeart of Stone is now available to view on the RTÉ Player #HeartOfStoneStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"foster denies unionists boycotting meetings with republic s ministers","story":"Northern Ireland’s First Minister Arlene Foster described as ‘misplaced’ and “’quite mischievous’ claims of an unspoken campaign to scupper NorthSouth Ministerial Council meetings by not putting forward unionist Ministers. File photograph: Mark MarlowPA Wire Stormont First Minister Arlene Foster has denied unionists are boycotting meetings with the Irish Government as part of a plan to overthrow the Northern Ireland protocol.The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader described as “misplaced” and “quite mischievous” claims of an unspoken campaign to scupper NorthSouth Ministerial Council (NSMC) meetings by not putting forward unionist Ministers.On Friday, a meeting involving Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan and his counterpart in the North Nichola Mallon had to be abandoned because, as Ms Foster said, “it did not suit” the nominated unionist Minister to attend.It was the second such meeting in two weeks “to be obstructed in this way”, according to Justice Minister and Alliance Party leader Naomi Long. But speaking in the Northern Ireland Assembly on Monday, Ms Foster rejected allegations “that we are refusing, in inverted commas, to attend meetings between the Northern Ireland Executive and the Government of the Republic of Ireland”.“That is simply not the case,” she said.But she warned NorthSouth relations “will of course be affected by the fact that the protocol is in place, because of its damage to eastwest relationships.”“We need to sort it out and we need to get rid of the protocol so we can continue to have relationships with our nearest neighbour in the appropriate way in the future,” she added.Unionists have united for a five-point plan to get rid of the protocol, a post-Brexit arrangement which puts a de facto trade barrier for goods in the Irish Sea to prevent any need for a hardening of the Border on the island of Ireland.Ms Mallon has accused the DUP of engaging in a “deliberate act” of obstructing North-South co-operation as part of its plan, adding that it was undermining the Belfast Agreement.Responding to remarks by the European Commission vice-president in charge of Brexit, Maros Sefcovic, that the protocol was the only way to protect the peace deal, Ms Foster said Mr Sefcovic “either wilfully misunderstands the Belfast Agreement or is misrepresenting it for his own ends”.“There is a need for those in Europe, in London, in Dublin as well, to listen to the voices of those of us who will not have the protocol, because it is damaging the economy of Northern Ireland,” she said.“But more than that, it is damaging our citizenship here in Northern Ireland as equal citizens of the United Kingdom, because we cannot partake in the internal market of the United Kingdom.”Asked if the North’s DUP Economy Minister Diane Dodds would attend a scheduled NSMC meeting due to take place this week, Ms Foster would only say her party was “fully aware” of its legal ministerial responsibilities.Ms Mallon had gone ahead with last Friday’s meeting “despite the fact she had been told it did not suit the nominated person who would accompany with her” under the cross-community rules of the meetings, she said.Ms Foster said the agenda and papers for the meeting had also not been agreed by her office.NSMC councils have to “proceed by agreement” and “I very much hope agreement and consensus will be sought by those Ministers setting up NorthSouth Ministerial Council meetings in future”, she added.The DUP leader met businesses in the North on Friday to discuss the costs they are suffering as a result of Brexit.“I was, I have to say, alarmed at the extra costs that those businesses are having to incur,” she told the Assembly.“Some of course are passing them on to consumers and to clients, which is very worrying as well.”Ms Foster said there has been a “reduction in choice and an increase in costs”, which she blamed on the protocol “being implemented in the fashion that it has been”.“I mean, the amount of damage being done to our businesses is quite incalculable,” the First Minister added.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald warned any refusal by unionists to participate in NSMC meetings “raises very serious questions, not just for the DUP, but for all of us”.“You can’t cherry pick the Good Friday Agreement,” she said, after meetings with other Stormont Executive parties in Belfast.“Political progress, stability and inclusion relies on all of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement working and working well.“The North-South piece is absolutely essential and that means that unionists of all hues have to participate in those meetings. I think it would obviously be hugely problematic if there was any suggestion that any strand of unionism was stepping back from that or causing a problem with the North-South mechanism.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"hair and beauty industry presses government for financial support","story":"Stylist Danny Law with customer Amy Smith at the Strand \u0026 Lock salon in Birmingham, England, where hairdressers reopened on April 12th. Ireland’s Hair and Beauty Industry Confederation has called for supports for the sector ahead of it reopening in the State. Photograph: Richard VernallsPA Wire The Government is being pressed to provide “significant” financial support for hairdressers, barbers and salon operators when they reopen after more than four months of enforced closure due to Covid-19.Making the case for an aid package that would include tax concessions and a €3,000 reopening grant, the Hair and Beauty Industry Confederation says support will be needed for the foreseeable future as the sector has been closed all year after facing 22 weeks of shutdown last year because of the pandemic.Ministers have suggested that personal services such as hairdressing could resume next month as restrictions are eased.“If such assistance is not forthcoming, many businesses will not survive, which will destroy jobs, undermine the health of the high streets around the country, and damage the exchequer finances,” said the confederation, which represents 2,500 operators.“The black market in hair and beauty services has prospered since March 2020, and the risk is that many clients may not return to legitimate businesses.”Industry estimates suggest the sector supported almost 50,000 direct and indirect jobs before the pandemic. The group added that hair and beauty salons were a big driver of footfall in towns and shopping centres and contributed “in a positive way” to the streetscape.A report by economist Jim Power for the confederation calls for prolonged VAT concessions and tax credits for consumers to encourage them to use such services. It wants an extension of wage subsidies and also debt write-offs.Hairdressers already stand to benefit from a VAT cut to 9 per cent from 13.5 per cent that is supposed to remain in force until the end of the year. But the industry group said the reduction should apply indefinitely and be extended to include beauty salons, who do not qualify. Furthermore, it said a special 5 per cent VAT rate should apply for the sector until next year at the earliest to help it stabilise.Tax creditThe group wants a “stay and spend” tax credit for consumers to use registered legitimate outlets, saying this would ert business from operators in the shadow economy who make no exchequer contribution.Such a scheme should be introduced eight weeks after the sector reopens, to spur business after their initial return.The group said the employment wage subsidy scheme, due to expire at the end of June, should be retained for the sector until the end of the year at least “and possibly to the middle of 2022”, depending on how restrictions evolve.In addition, the group said the sector should also receive grants to meet once-off reopening costs and investment in personal protective equipment and rapid Covid-19 antigen testing.“The grant should be equivalent to 50 per cent of commercial rates in 2019, subject to a minimum payment of €3,000.”It added that many operators will suffer the legacy of accumulated rents, commercial rates, tax liabilities and bank interest costs after the lockdown.“Furthermore, consideration must be given to writing off some of those accumulated financial liabilities.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"may reopening expect a choppy week ahead of final announcement","story":"Into the cauldron now returns Dr Tony Holohan, the chief medical officer and veteran of a hundred skirmishes with his political masters. Photograph: Sasko LazarovRollingNews.ieAs the countdown to the next stage of the country’s reopening gets under way, we are familiar with the routine by now.Decisions will be made by the Government next week about the May reopening. Prior to that there is fierce internal debate about the appropriate and safe extent of the liberalisation that should take place, beginning on May 4th, after the bank holiday weekend.The full extent of the internal debates is not revealed to the public – both Government and the higher echelons of health officials and their advisers like to do things behind closed doors. But through leaks – both inadvertent and deliberate, designed to influence the final decisions or otherwise – and through visible public signals and by simply listening to what politicians and health officials say, it is possible to get a sense of where the decisions are going, and what the key points of dispute are. Everyone knows the drill at this stage: this isn’t anyone’s first rodeo.According to people familiar with the discussions, the arguments are pretty intense right now. The familiar questions of how quickly, where and when to reopen are in full flight. Should outdoor hospitality recommence before June? Should non-essential retail – at least on a click-and-collect basis – restart in May? The pressure from the churches for religious services is building. And from other lobbies.Core to the arguments for reopening is the belief that people are pretty much at the end of their tether with the lockdown. The Government’s own research shows that people are less personally worried about the virus than at any time since last July. The numbers of those who want more restrictions have plummeted, and of those who want fewer restrictions have soared, the Government data shows.Vaccinated vulnerablePrevious  research indicated that when those at greatest risk had been vaccinated, public support for lockdown would slip away. We are not there yet. But we may be getting there soon.It’s an oversimplification to say that the disputes are simply between public health officials and politicians, though it is certainly the case that some prominent public health voices are urging caution, and some prominent political voices want a quicker opening-up. The arguments are complex and multifaceted and don’t always arrange themselves on simple us-against-them lines. But it is true to say the pressure for as much reopening as is safely possible is coming from the political side. The decisions to be taken in the next 10 days or so are not just about reopening. They are also about vaccination. Government Buildings has been frustrated not just by the stutters in the vaccine programme but by the lack of up-to-date information about vaccine deliveries, vaccination targets and progress of the programme. Some people are also pulling their hair out about what they see as the overcautious approach of restricting the use of AstraZeneca. And public health chiefs are windy about stretching the gap between the two Pfizer doses. Now they must make decisions about the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine.Cool to frostyAll of this is in the mix in the discussions between the politicians, the HSE and the public health experts over the coming week. Each has their own particular perspective. Nor is any of these groupings necessarily internally united. Taoiseach Micheál Martin was reportedly furious with Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly after he suggested that the 18-30s might be vaccinated before older cohorts (the latter swiftly withdrew the idea). Relations between Government Buildings and the department are cool to frosty.Into this cauldron now returns Dr Tony Holohan, the chief medical officer and veteran of a hundred skirmishes with his political masters. It should be said that all involved are, by their own lights, striving for the best outcome for the public. But it’s going to be a choppy week or 10 days as a plan is hammered out.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"sorry not sorry mcdonald s mountbatten  mark a change of tone","story":"Speaking in an interview on  Britain’s Times Radio, the day after the funeral of Prince Philip, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said she was “sorry” the IRA killed Lord Mountbatten in 1979. Video: Times RadioMary Lou McDonald’s comments were not quite the full-throated apology for IRA actions that many headlines would suggest. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsMary Lou McDonald’s weekend comments on being “sorry” about the death of Lord Mountbatten were not quite the full-throated apology for IRA actions that many headlines, especially in the British press, would suggest. But they did represent a new tone from the Sinn Féin leader.When asked on Times Radio if she would apologise to Prince Charles for the death of his uncle along with two boys and a woman when his boat was blown up off Co Sligo in 1979, McDonald said: “The army and armed forces associated with Prince Charles carried out many, many violent actions on our island. I can say of course I am sorry that happened. Of course, that is heartbreaking.”You can read this either way. Sorry for the killing of Mountbatten, or sorry the whole conflict happened. The ambiguity is hardly unintentional.Asked on Monday if McDonald was apologising, Sinn Féin TD Eoin Ó Broin said it was “an admission of regret and an acknowledgement of the suffering for the family involved”.Pressed as to whether McDonald intended to go further than Sinn Féin has previously on the subject, Ó Broin replied, “I don’t know”.McDonald is a canny enough media operator to have foreseen headlines about the “apology”. That – and the fact she chose the weekend of Prince Philip’s funeral to make the statement – suggests a deliberate attempt to move the dial.Regret and sorrowWhile expressing regret and sorrow for the suffering caused by the conflict in general, Sinn Féin has never disavowed the IRA or its actions and is unlikely to start now. This is part tactical, part theology. Once you start to address inidual incidents, where do you stop?But on a deeper level, it remains a fundamental tenet of republican thinking that the IRA campaign – while admitting inidual mistakes and expressing regret for all deaths in the conflict – was morally and politically justified. That belief is ingrained in the party’s DNA.So McDonald is unlikely to rewrite that theology. But she does appear – and some party sources agree – to be trying to alter the tone, at least a bit.Her comments on Mountbatten followed a tweet expressing sympathy with Queen Elizabeth on the death of her husband. Since McDonald does not expect the queen to be closely following her Twitter account, it is fair to assume the intended audience included those referenced in the second part of the post – “those of a British identity on our island, for whom his death will be felt as a great loss”.It is unlikely, too, that she just dashed off a tweet when she heard the news. This is not the sort of thing that Sinn Féin does on the spur of the moment.Against the background of a ided Northern Executive and increasing loyalist alienation, McDonald seems to be making conciliatory noises. It is an interesting departure."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons april 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2020 by clicking here or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Derek Chauvin guilty of murdering George Floyd - latest reactionDerek Chauvin guilty of murdering George Floyd: how the world reacted to the verdict George Floyd\u0026#39s family say \u0026#39we can breathe again\u0026#39 after guilty verdict for Derek ChauvinExclusive: Just 32 people in hospital with Covid after having vaccinationSing elderly lullabies to help them avoid sleeping tablets, study findsApple ‘best-before’ dates: Tech giants told to reveal how long before phone models stop workingHow will Derek Chauvin\u0026#39s conviction change US policing?In life, George Floyd struggled to find his place.

I want to do that again. That’s why I have introduced a green watch list.”The green watchlist is designed to give holidaymakers early notice of a green list country which may be about to turn “amber,” requiring anyone returning to the UK to quarantine for 10 days.The islands policy was introduced last summer, which allowed ministers to maintain quarantine free travel corridors to Greek and Portuguese islands while travellers to the mainland were subject to self-isolation on their return to the UK.Greece aims to reopen to UK tourists who are either vaccinated, have proof of a negative Covid test or immunity through having contracted the disease from May 17.Mr Shapps on Tuesday said the UK’s roadmap plan for reopening foreign travel on May 17 was on course but he said people would have to wait until the beginning of May to discover which destinations would be on the “green” list.It had been anticipated only a handful would be “green,” which is determined by their vaccination and Covid rates, the risk from variants and ability to genome sequence the virus.These included countries such as Israel, Gibraltar, the US and Iceland but excluded the vast majority of traditional summer destinations. Mr Shapps\u0027s announcement, however, appears to open the door to islands.Mr Shapps also signalled he could approve a £45 PCR test, slashing the average price by two-thirds, and confirmed moves to allow holidaymakers to take free lateral flow tests to use for pre-departure.It came as the Home Office urged Heathrow to reopen Terminal 4 to prevent passengers from “red list” countries spreading variants to other arrivals in crowded arrival halls, amid claims the airport is becoming a “breeding ground” for infections.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"mass fossil site may prove tyrannosaurs lived hunted packs like","story":"Ferocious tyrannosaur dinosaurs may not have been solitary predators as long envisioned, but more like social carnivores such as wolves, new research unveiled Monday found.Paleontologists developed the theory while studying a mass tyrannosaur death site found seven years ago in the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in southern Utah, one of two monuments that the Biden administration is considering restoring to their full size after former President Donald Trump shrunk them.Using geochemical analysis of the bones and rock, a team of researchers with the University of Arkansas determined that the dinosaurs died and were buried in the same place and were not the result of fossils washing in from multiple areas.The new Utah site is the third mass tyrannosaur grave site that\u0027s been discovered in North America - bolstering a theory first developed 20 years ago that they lived in packs. However, more research needs to be done to make that argument, said Kristi Curry Rogers, a biology professor at Macalester College who wasn\u0027t involved in the research but reviewed the finding on Monday.It is a little tougher to be so sure that these data mean that these tyrannosaurs lived together in the good times, Rogers said. It\u0027s possible that these animals may have lived in the same vicinity as one another without travelling together in a social group, and just came together around dwindling resources as times got tougher.In 2014, Bureau of Land Management paleontologist Alan Titus discovered the site, which was later named the Rainbows and Unicorns quarry because of the vast array of fossils contained inside. Excavation has been ongoing since the site\u0027s discovery because of the size of the area and volume of bones.I consider this a once-in-a-lifetime discovery for myself, Titus told reporters during a virtual news conference. I probably won\u0027t find another site this exciting and scientifically significant during my career.The social tyrannosaurs theory began over 20 years ago when more than a dozen tyrannosaurs were found at a site in Alberta, Canada. Another mass death site in Montana again raised the possibility of social tyrannosaurs. Many scientists questioned the theory, arguing that the dinosaurs didn\u0027t have the brainpower to engage in sophisticated social interaction, Titus said.Going that next step to understand behaviour and how animals behave requires really amazing evidence, Joseph Sertich, curator of dinosaurs at the Denver Museum of Nature \u0026amp Science, said at the news conference. I think that this site, the spectacular collection of tyrannosaurs but also the other assembled pieces of evidence ... pushes us to the point where we can show some evidence for behaviour.In addition to the tyrannosaurs, researchers have also found seven species of turtles, multiple fish and ray species, two other kinds of dinosaurs and a nearly complete skeleton of a juvenile Deinosuchus alligator. These other animals do not appear to have all died together.Paleontology groups have been among those pushing the federal government to restore the Bears Ears National Monument and Grand Staircase-Escalante to their original sizes to protect the region\u0027s rich paleontological and archaeological record.Interior Secretary Deb Haaland visited southern Utah earlier this month as she prepared to submit recommendations on whether to reverse Trump\u0027s decision to downsize the monuments. Titus said he showed Haaland some of the fossils at his lab during her visit and said she appreciated getting to see the material.The (Bureau of Land Management) is protecting these fossils as national treasures. Titus said. They\u0027re part of the story of how North America came to be and how ultimately we came to be.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day dazzling display tulips east anglia","story":"Marcia from Norwich stands among thousands of tulips which have burst into colour in fields near King\u0027s Lynn in Norfolk.

between 60 and 80 beats per minute, a soft volume and smooth melody.The use of music therapy would also reduce the need for dependence on sedatives and sleeping medication. Between 40 and 70 per cent of older people struggle with sleep problems, frequently waking up in the middle of the night or really early in the morning.Not getting enough shut-eye can not only lead to a poor quality of life but also have serious mental and physical health implications.This is because it gives the body and brain the time it needs to repair itself before starting a new day.Most adults need between six and nine hours of sleep a night according to the NHS.The study by the National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University in Taipei in Taiwan may have found a solution in how to ensure elderly people have a good night\u0027s rest.Study author Dr Yen-Chi Chen said: Music intervention is an effective strategy and is easy to administer by a caregiver or healthcare worker.Music therapy might be the first line of therapy to recommend in older adults with sleep disturbances, which would reduce the need for dependence on sedatives and sleeping medication.The researchers pulled together English and Chinese sleep studies of randomised control studies from five databases for their analysis.  Dr Chen said: All studies were reviewed by two independent investigators.The aim was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of listening to music on sleep quality in older adultsBased on psychological theory, listening to sedative music can improve sleep by modulating sympathetic nervous system activity and the release of cortisol, thereby lowering levels of anxiety and stress responses.Listening to music before bed for more than four weeks was especially effective, researchers found.Dr Chen said: Music therapy is safe and easy to administer and can effectively improve sleep quality among older adults, particularly those listening to more sedative music for at least a four-week duration.The findings were published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"university engineer used tiny hidden shoe camera upskirt 250","story":"A university engineer who fitted a tiny camera inside a pair of shoes in order to film up women\u0027s skirts has admitted targeting more than 250 victims during a two month spree.Richard Whyley, 32, a father of two, used a hidden GoPro camera to record almost 6,500 upskirt images during shopping trips in Worcestershire.He also secretly filmed women getting undressed in their own homes as well as one couple having sex.But he was finally caught when a 16-year-old girl heard a camera click from his shoe while travelling on an escalator in August 2019.Whyley, who is thought to be one of the country\u0027s most prolific upskirt offenders, admitted voyeurism, and two charges of recording an image under clothing and operating equipment without consent, when he appeared at Worcester Crown Court.But he was spared jail after the judge opted to give him a three-year community order and placed him on the sex offenders\u0027 register for five years instead.The court heard how Whyley\u0027s offending ned the period between June 26 and August 15, 2019.He was caught when a teenage girl, who was out on a shopping trip with her 10-year-old cousin, raised the alarm after hearing a camera click coming from his foot.Whyley was traced using CCTV which tracked him to a building owned by the University of Worcester, where he was employed.With the help of university staff Whyley was identified and arrested while working testing fire alarms.A search of his company vehicle revealed two pairs of shoes with holes cut in the toes and an SD card with 94 images and videos recorded through windows of peoples homes.He took over 6,400 images of women, including of their underwear, buttocks and genitals. Police identified 250 separate female victims.The 16-year-old girl who raised the alarm was in court to see Whyley sentenced and she read a victim impact statement in which she described how the incident had affected her.She said: When this happened I had only just turned 16 and had gone shopping that day - it was the first time I had ever taken my little cousin off like that by myself.Since then, I have felt incapable of taking her out again and haven\u0027t felt I could protect her.I won\u0027t even answer the door if I\u0027m alone and things that I could do before I can\u0027t now.I have become so conscious of what I wear when I\u0027m out and in the town and there\u0027s other people around.I feel incredibly wary of middle-aged men that I can\u0027t trust and am constantly looking over my shoulder to keep myself a safe distance from other people.This has impacted on every aspect of my life and I\u0027m now constantly anxious and worried about something happening...I\u0027m going to have to live with this for the rest of my life.Sentencing Whyley, Judge Martin Jackson said: It seems to me this was something done for sexual gratification and you have accepted that by pleading guilty to the charges.There was a significant degree of planning, in particular the use of the GoPro camera and adaptation of footwear enabling you to place it inside the footwear so it could be used.Nicholas Wragg, defending, said the images had never uploaded to the internet on any occasion.Whyley was ordered to pay his victim £750 compensation and made subject of a five year sexual harm prevention order.He was also ordered to abide by an electronic curfew tag between the hours of 9pm to 6am for four months, pay £340 in court costs and undertake 40 rehabilitation requirement days and an accredited sex offender program.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"whale wax disproves theory leonardo da vinci sculpted bust goddess","story":"A bust that was long attributed to Leonardo da Vinci not only had nothing to do with him – it is made from a mysterious substance produced by sperm whales, scientists have found.For more than a century, some scholars had insisted that the bust of Flora, the Roman goddess of spring, was the work of the Renaissance master.In 1909 it was acquired by a museum in Berlin, where curators said its resemblance to several Leonardo portraits strongly suggested that it was one of his creations.Its attribution has been the subject of intense debate ever since, but a team of scientists believe they have now resolved the matter for good - they think the bust was made by a British sculptor.By subjecting the bust to chemical analysis and carbon dating, they found that it was created in the 19th century – more than 300 years after Leonardo’s death in 1519.They also made another intriguing discovery – that the artwork is produced largely from spermaceti, a waxy liquid that comes from the head cavities of sperm whales.The exact function of spermaceti is not well understood but scientists believe it may help sperm whales regulate buoyancy.Before the hunting of the species was prohibited, the substance was used to make candles, ointments and cosmetic creams, as well as industrial lubricants.“The bust was not produced during the Renaissance and thus cannot be attributed to da Vinci,” the team of French researchers said in a paper published in Scientific Reports.“The Flora wax bust is made primarily of spermaceti, which was extracted from sperm whales.”The researchers, from the Chemistry Research Institute of Paris, said they had brought closure to a debate that had lasted more than a century.Wilhelm Bode, the director-general of the Kaiser Friedrich Museum in Berlin, bought the artwork at auction in London.He was convinced that the bust was the work of Leonardo, despite the fact that it was unusual during the Renaissance period to use wax as a material for sculpture.In the years after its acquisition, more than 700 articles were written in the European press, “arguing for and against the da Vinci attribution,” the French researchers said.It now seems likely that the bust was created by a British sculptor of the 19th century, Richard Cockle Lucas.Chemical analysis of the whale wax used to make the bust showed that it was similar to the wax used in one a relief produced by Lucas in 1850, Leda and the Swan – based on the story from Greek mythology in which the god Zeus, in the form of a swan, rapes or seduces Leda, a princess.Born in Wiltshire, Lucas was apprenticed to a cutler at the age of 12 and showed himself to be adept at carving knife handles. He moved to London and became a sculptor and, later, a photographer.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit boss five cabinet ministers","story":"NewsBrexit boss and five Cabinet ministers back new hard-right, low-tax Tory groupVote Leave chief Matthew Elliott, who is credited with several successful political crusades, is on the Free Market Forums advisory boardmirrorShareCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy Political Editor:,  APR NewsMatthew Elliott is a seasoned political activist \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

But he accused the Prime Minister of having abandoned our people in a way I simply cannot reconcile...simply because the UK Government cannot find the moral strength or courage we asked of them in bringing peace to Northern Ireland, in finding a political solution to stop these appalling injustices.

Author Anna Pasternak says she believes the fallout of the coupleaposs public spat with the Firm could spark change. And she claims that the rt could even mean Prince Charlesapos long-awaited ascension to the throne is delayed - or even cancelled. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex first split from the royal family in March  before finalising the move a year later. They then gave a bombshell interview to Oprah Winfrey, in which they made claims of racism from an unnamed member of the monarchy.Do you have a view on this story  Email webnews@mirror or let us know in the comments below.Harry recently reunited with his family at Prince Philipaposs funeral.Ms Pasternak, who penned aposPrincess in Loveapos, about Princess Diana, has now told Vanity Fair she is not  per cent sure of Charlesapos future.It may be that there is such a groundswell of public opinion against [Charles] that it’s deemed by the Firm preferable for William to ascend then because he’s younger, more relatable, she said. And the writer added: The Sussexes have sparked something so fundamentally incendiary in this country that it is changing the face of Britain, and I think the monarchy as an archaic institution may well topple. Diane Abbott - Britainaposs first female Black MP and a former shadow home secretary - also spoke to the publication.She said: I think the monarchy as we know it will last as long as the Queen is alive.

But, after the monarch dies, I think there will be a big public debate, Ms Abbott added. And I think what the royal family and their advisers did with Meghan will be part of the argument for change. The claims come as Harry heads back to the US to be with his we, who is pregnant with their second child. He was in Britain for the funeral of the Duke of Edinburgh, his grandfather. The prince is expected tohome to Calornia without having had a one-to-one chat with his father, an insider has claimed. He spent two hours talking to his dad and brother, Prince William, together after the funeral, but he hasnapost spoken to Charles alone.

But the following morning, right before dawn on April , you could also have a good opportunity to see them.  The Royal Greenwich Observatory said: The best time to see the shower is in the early morning of the peak day, which this year is the morning of the  April . Wait until after midnight when the radiant point, in the constellation of Lyra, will have risen in the East.The later in the morning you wait, the higher the radiant will rise and the fewer meteors will be hidden below the horizon.But the closer you get to sunrise the brighter the sky is going to become so plan accordingly!

Masked campaigners from five UK animal welfare organisations handed the document over at  Downing St today.A group of chief executives and directors from five UK animal welfare organisations handed over the Fur Free Britain petition this morning, alongside a letter from Queen guitarist Brian May.He called: “the opportunity to act as a global leader in moral standards, and close our borders to the cruel, outdated, unnecessary and dangerous fur trade”. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section Fur farming was outlawed in the UK nearly two decades ago in , because it was deemed too cruel an industry to support. But since then Britain has imported more than £ million worth of fur from countries including Finland, China, France and Poland, where animals experience terrible suffering and mental distress on fur farms. Last year a YouGov opinion poll commissioned by Humane Society International UK found that % of the British public do not wear real animal fur, and the words % of people most closely associated with a fashion brand selling fur are ‘unethical’, ‘outdated’, ‘cruel’ and ‘out of touch’. The petition of one million signatures from around the world, from supporters all over the world, was presented by by Humane Society International UK, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals , FOUR PAWS UK, Open Cages and the RSPCA. It comes the day before a Ten Minute Rule Bill to propose a fur sales ban will be heard in the House of Commons. Celebrity supporters Brian May and Chris Packham joined the petition hand-in virtually with video messages declaring their support for a UK fur sales ban.  Claire Bass, Executive Director for Humane Society International UK, said, “Fur farming is rightly banned here, but we’re still importing the same cruelty from overseas. The government has the opportunity to end that double standard and our million signature petition today shows that there is enormous public support for a fur trade ban. The British public, along with politicians, designers, celebrities and retailers are in agreement that incarcerating and killing animals for fashion does not reflect brand Britain, the future of fashion is fur free.”  Chris Sherwood, Chief Executive for the RSPCA added: “We want to see an end to an industry where animals are suffering and dying for fashion. Breeding animals for fur can be a cruel and unnecessary business that should have no place in the modern world. Even though fur is no longer farmed in the UK, it is still legal to import and sell it here.  So the UK remains complicit in the continuation of the global fur market, profiting from this cruel international trade. It is shameful and it’s high time we got our house in order and made fur imports and sales illegal. “Our petition calling for a Fur Free Britain has been supported by thousands of animal lovers and we hope the Government listens to our calls to end this horric trade in the UK.”  Mirror readers were also thanked by Humane Society International for their support Claire Bass added: “Much appreciation goes out to every The Daily Mirror reader who have played a part in this campaign by signing the #FurFreeBritain petition. We are ever so grateful for your help in urging the UK Government to make Britain the first fur free country in the world. Together we can end this cruel trade and save millions of animals suffering around the world.” The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening.

Lauren Clarke was shopping at the DFS Old Trafford store on April , with her family including six-year-old Madison who became agitated. In a bid to distract Madison, who is non-verbal, mum Lauren suggested the pair go enjoy some KFC while her family carried on shopping. But disaster struck as the store was closed to walk-ins, and Laurenaposs mum, who was driving, was still in the store. While trying to distract her daughter, Lauren rang the chain who told her to walk through the drive-thru after overhearing Madisonaposs distress on the phone. At the counter, a very calm worker called Emma took their order while chatting away to Madison, only for Lauren to realise she didnapost have a bank card. Without missing a beat, Emma paid for the order herself - leaving Lauren speechless at the act of kindness, which made hers and Madisonaposs day.In a heartfelt post about the incident on her Facebook page, Lauren said Emmaaposs actions saved the day.She has now appealed for the kindhearted KFC worker to come forward so she can know how much that gesture meant for her. In the post, which has been shared thousands of times, Lauren wrote: This afternoon we were shopping at DFS with my mum, nana and my daughter Madison.  Madison is extremely sensory and started to lick objects around her. She is non-verbal and only understands certain words. I told her letaposs go for some chicken to distract her from anything . We went to KFC which is directly opposite DFS and I noticed it was closed due to maintenance work, drive-through only. I wasnapost driving and my mum was still in the shop, the shop Madison was starting to have meltdowns in so didnapost want to distress her by taking her back in. I rang KFC and explained Madison has autism, she is non-verbal and she doesnapost understand why we canapost go in to get some chicken. They clearly heard Madison getting upset and told us to walk straight through to the window at the drive-through.  So we did, the lady at the till called Emma was very calm taking my order, she was very polite, smiling away and was talking to Madison. I then went to pay for our order and realised I didnapost have my bank card on me. Emma immediately said aposDonapost worry ill get it for you!

This morning the government announced commitments to put the UK on course to cut carbon emissions by  per cent by  - just  years away. This is the sixth and latest carbon budget setting the country on the way to going net-zero by . While being ambitious is good, how the country meets its goals is the important bit, argues Jonathan Church, a climate accountability lawyer. The new ambition of this target is great but I donapost think it fundamentally changes the picture, he told The Mirror. This target is in line with the net zero target, but it doesnapost change what we need to do to reach net zero by , this is just the next stepping stone. What it will do is make it easier for people to hold governments to account in a general sense.Will you be happy making changes to your lestyle  Join the debate in the comments belowMr Church says it is crucial to address all the dferent high-emissions sectors at once and as quickly as possiblethe target is to be hit. The big parts are buildings, which is to do with decarbonising heating, waste, keeping homes warm, but also road transport as well, such as getting the charging stations going, he continued. We can no longer address these targets one after another, every sector is crucial. We canapost rest on our laurels any longer.The Climate Change Committee , which advises the government, has set out the steps the country needs to take over the next  years to hit the  per cent target.Hereaposs how its recommendations will change Britain...Waste One of the things that will have the biggest impact on Brits will be how we get rid of our rubbish. The amount of waste that needs to be recycled must hit  per cent in England by  and  in Scotland and Wales, according to the CCC. Thataposs a big jump from the current  per cent of household waste that is recycled and means more commitment to sorting bins at home, as well as better waste management plants. All biodegradable waste must be banned from landfill by , meaning no more hauling paper, cardboard, food, textiles, wood and garden wastes to the tip. The CCC has called for a law requiring all businesses to record how much food they waste.Homes Another big problem we have in the UK are our leaky homes. Ambitious plans brought in by Labour to make all new homes carbon neutral from  were scrapped by the Tory government in , paving the way for energy inefficient house building projects. To hit the  target building emissions need to fall by half, meaning no more poorly built homes. Many people will have to swap their gas boilers out when it breaks for a green alternative such as a heat pump, which requires a cleaner form of energy to be viable. According to the CCC one million heat pumps will have to be put in British homes each year until  to hit the target. That means a large metal box which looks like an air conditioning unit being attached to the outside of ten million homes over the next decade. A lot of money needs to be pumped into green home repair and maintenance, which could create a lot of well paid job opportunities.Food One of the biggest drivers of climate change, yet the area we least want to deal with, is undoubtedly food. On the more positive side of things,  per cent of agricultural land in the UK will need to be used to reduce emissions and suck up carbon instead of farming by . For the average non-farming person, that will primarily mean more woodland and peat bogs to stomp around in, which should provide flood protection and animal habitats.  Less welcome will be the news that our diets need to change. The British public will have to eat  per cent less meat and dairy over the next ten years. This either means a fth of the country shoulder the burden and go vegan, or everybody cuts their intake a little. Food waste also needs to be slashed by  per cent.Transport When it comes to flying - which accounts for just . per cent of global emissions but a big chunk of the average Westerneraposs carbon footprint - most of the requirements set out by the CCC are structural and wonapost impact Brits directly. They include developing sustainable plane fuel and stopping the construction of more airports. The CCC also states that the number of flights from UK airports cannot increase by more than  per cent by . One way to do that may be to introduce a frequent fliers tax to stle demand, meaning the more times you jet off each year, the more out of pocket you are. Carbon cutting transport plans will be felt much more keenly on the road.  From  petrol and diesel cars and van sales will be banned, leading Brits towards cleaner electric vehicles. This will cause roads to become much quieter and less polluted. The CCC has urged the government to pump money into the sector to make electric cars and vans more affordable, as they remain out of reach for most people at the moment. Charging stations will become a feature of every road to keep the green fleet going and lorries, which make up five per cent of all vehicles yet produce  per cent of emissions, will become zero-emission.

The Duke of Sussex spent two hours talking to his dad and brother, Prince William, together after the Duke of Edinburghaposs funeral, but he hasnapost spoken to Charles alone. One palace insider told The Mirror that the heir to the throne was hoping to see his son again but Harry told him he wasn’t sticking around.Itaposs understood that Harry will fly back to the US soon to be reunited with heavily pregnant Meghan Markle, who was forced to skip the Duke of Edinburghs funeral on medical advice.Meanwhile Charles has gone to his Welsh home in Llwynywermod, where he is working from home and continuing to observe the royal mourning period which ends on Thursday.After saying an emotional goodbye to Prince Philip, Charles, Harry and William reportedly went to Frogmore Cottage to hammer things out.Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank, who are currently living in Meghan and Harryaposs former Windsor home, are said to have made themselves scarce so the trio could talk privately.  A source told The Sun: Harry obviously felt outnumbered as there are three of them and only one of him so wanted it to be on his home turf. There is no way this is the end of the crisis in their relationships but it’s a good gesture and a nice way to take the first step towards healing. William, Kate and Charles all left after about two hours, which was long enough for the process of getting father and brothers talking again to start. However there is still a lot of upset surrounding Meghan and Harryaposs interview with Oprah Winfrey, in which the Duke said his brother and dad were trapped in the royal family.  The source told The Mirror: “Harry didn’t expect everything to be completely back to normal but his feeling after seeing his family was there is a lot of ground to make up. “Whether that is harder or easier to do on the other side of the world remains to be seen. “There is a lot of distrust in the camp and everything is still very, very raw.” The insider also claims that Harry wrote to his dad before arriving in the UK, explaining his decision to quit the royal family with Meghan. They said: “Truth be told, Harry didn’t really know what to expect before he came home, which is why he reached out before seeing everyone.

And rather surprisingly, the case came out intact, with the headphones still inside and the charging light still on. Hours later Rachel discovered both the charger and the headphones still worked perfectly. Do you have a similar dog story  Email webnews@mirror  Rachel, who lives at home with her parents in Willerby, near Hull, described how it all started as she said: “It was Easter Sunday and Jimmy has his own Instagram account, so I was taking photos of him getting his first dog Easter egg to use on Instagram.He was jumping up and running around going crazy, he was so hyped up and excited. “As he jumped, he knocked my AirPods out of my pocket and they fell on the floor, and before I even realised they’d dropped on the floor, he’d eaten them whole.  “He looked up at me straight after and gave me a look asto say ‘that wasn’t the treat, was it ’ My heart sank.” Rachel raced the puppy to Vets Now, an out-of-hours pet emergency service in the city, where he was scanned. Susana Jauregui, who is senior vet at Vets Now in Hull, said: “Our vet on duty that evening, Steven, x-rayed Jimmy and the radiograph images clearly showed the AirPods case still intact in his digestive system. “There was a risk of it causing an obstruction and, with it being a charging case, Steven was also concerned about battery acid leaking so, after discussing the situation with Jimmy’s owners, he agreed to operate.  “Jimmy’s a beautul dog and he’s lucky his owners acted so promptly. Battery acid is highly dangerous to dogs as are large foreign objects, especiallythey’re allowed to pass into the intestine.” To Steven’s surprise, there wasnapost a scratch or a tooth mark on the device and even the charging light was still on. The operation took place on a Sunday evening and Jimmy spent the night recuperating in the clinic. He is now home, with a cone around his head to stop him licking his stitches. Rachel said: “He’s a bit sorry for himself, we’re not allowed to exercise him so he has all this energy and nowhere for it to go. “I have been so worried about him, it’s certainly a cautionary tale for other dog owners.

Richard Whyley, , was spared jail after he took a staggering , images of unsuspecting womenaposs private parts and underwear while following them as they went shopping. The dad-of-two preyed on his victims in Worcestershire between June  and August , , while wearing specially modied camera boots. The university worker and engineer also secretly filmed women getting undressed in their own homes as well as one couple having sex. He was finally caught when a -year-old girl raised the alarm after hearing a camera click while shopping at HM in Worcester on August , .  Whyley, of Stourbridge, admitted voyeurism, and two charges of recording an image under clothing and operating equipment without consent. He was sentenced to a three-year community order at Worcester Crown Court on Monday. Sentencing, Judge Martin Jackson said: It is concerning that your offending is of such an extent. It seems to me this was something done for sexual gratication and you have accepted that by pleading guilty to the charges. There was a signicant degree of planning, in particular the use of the GoPro camera and adaptation of footwear enabling you to place it inside the footwear so it could be used. The victim was barely  years old at the time and she should have been able to enjoy the prospects of her future adulthood. But sheaposs said already sheaposs so worried about what might happen and canapost even wear the clothes she wants and leave her house without feeling anxious. Sheaposs now a young adult and itaposs affecting where she wants to go to university, something no  or -year-old should be having to face. I donapost think you really truly understand the impact of your offending on her or upon others who have been a victim of your actions. In this case, I have to ask myselfthere is a realistic prospect of rehabilitation and you have undertaken voluntary therapy and contacted another charity to try address your offending behaviour.  The court heard the victim was on her first-ever shopping trip looking after a younger relative when Whyley took a photo up her skirt after following her onto an escalator. She bravely read out her victim impact statement to the judge, recalling: When this happened I had only just turned  and had gone shopping that day - it was the first time I had ever takenoff like that by myself. Since then, I have felt incapable of taking her out again and havenapost felt I could protect her. I wonapost even answer the doorIaposm alone and things that I could do before I canapost now. I have become so conscious of what I wear when Iaposm out and in the town and thereaposs other people around. I feel incredibly wary of middle-aged men that I canapost trust and am constantly looking over my shoulder to keep myself a safe distance from other people. I also try not to go anywhere myself as Iaposm anxious that Iaposm going to be followed. I worry about what might have happenedI had been by myself orhe had chosen to follow me and feel guilty for the other people that have been a victim of this man and donapost know about it. I worry about who has those images and it gets me really anxious to think that I donapost know where they have gone. I have recently applied for university and Iaposm making decisions about my future and want to do that without thinking about this and protecting myself. This has impacted on every aspect of my le and Iaposm now constantly anxious and worried about something happening. But I shouldnapost have to feel like this because of what this man did whilst I was out shopping with my family. Iaposm going to have to live with this for the rest of my le. The court heard Whyley was traced using Worcester city centreaposs CCTV to a building owned by the University of Worcester after the victim raised the alarm. With the help of university staff officers were able to identy him and arrest him whilst he was working testing fire alarms. A search of his company vehicle revealed two pairs of shoes with holes cut in the toes and an SD card with  images and videos recorded through windows of peopleaposs homes. He took more than , images of women, including of their buttocks and genitals. Police identied  separate female victims.

In a video on the social media , Kat Kamalani revealed all, saying: Have you ever walked on a plane and seen the flight attendant standing right here, greeting you, or the flight attendants walking up and down the aisle Well, Iaposm about to tell you what weaposre really doing...  She continues: So when youaposre walking on the aeroplane and you see our happy, smiley face, weaposre actually looking you up and down, we are trying to find our ABPs and what that is called is our able-bodied people or person.So this is people who are going to help us in an emergency. So for example, military personnel, firefighters, nurses, doctors. So in case of emergency, like a medical emergency, or we are going to land the plane, or thereaposs a security breach, we know whoaposs on our plane and we know who can help us, but weaposre also looking at one more thing. Weaposre looking for things that donapost quite belong on the plane, like a box full of like liquid on the side.  Kat adds: Weaposre looking for human trafficking, it happens a lot in the industry and our passenger safety is our number one priority. So weaposre just looking for things that look off.Her video quickly went viral, garnering over , views and more than , likes.Thousands of people also took the time to comment on the post, sharing their thoughts. Some were confused about how the staff could tell what a person did, just by looking at them. Kat later claried: Some say, aposHey Iaposm a doctor in seat A just in caseapos, which we appreciate.

He didn’t have much to do but he’s a very capable goalkeeper.“We are blessed with two very good goalkeepers and Deniz will move ahead with that now.“We’re a bit short now, obviously, but we’ll see how that goes.”With a Scottish Cup quarter-final against Aberdeen on the horizon, at Pittodrie on Sunday, and United sitting safely in seventh spot, Mellon would be forgiven for ringing the changes at Rugby Park.However, he insists, Deniz aside, it will be a very familiar starting XI that head for second-bottom Killie in midweek as they target #another valuable three points#.“We need to be careful because we will not, in any way, do anything that will go against the integrity of the league,# Mellon stated.“We know how important the result is for everyone concerned in it.“So we’ll be putting out a team we think is capable of getting us a result down there.“I’ll be expecting them to try to get the three points, it’s important to say that.“We have a squad of players here I trust and, yes, we have another important game on Sunday, but I can assure everyone we’ll be putting out a team I believe can get the three points.“We’re trying to keep the momentum of the club going forward.“We’re looking forward to going down and battling for another valuable three points.“We’ll go and attack that.”The Tangerines are on a six-game unbeaten run in all competitions, with the last two coming on a G surface #

on a scheme which will see low-carbon and energy-efficient technology installed in  council homes.Solar , heat pumps and battery storage systems will all be installed, with the aim of demonstrating how green innovations are a viable route to net-zero carbon emissions for the social housing in the UK.All of the upgrades will be carried out at no cost to the tenants or landlords, and it is hoped the new technology will both improve comfort and lower energy costs for residents.Running the project is Glasgow-based firm SMS plc, who have partnered with Aberdeen City Council to deliver the changes to the homes.The scheme will receive £.m from the Government’s newly launched Social Housing Decarbonisation Fund Demonstrator to get the work done.The installation phase of the new technology is expected to create  local jobs, and is scheduled for completion in December .In the months following, the energy performance will be monitored for six months to measure effectiveness.Sean Keating, head of new energy systems at SMS, said: “By creating an expected  jobs locally through the initial trial phase of the scheme, our project additionally looks to demonstrate how – when delivered at scale – investment in green infrastructure can support the Government’s agenda to level up regional economic growth.“Indeed, above all this project is about creating a more sustainable future: one that ensures affordable comfort in our homes, reduces fuel poverty, creates jobs, and ultimately protects our environment amidst climate change.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our

the disease.The self-testing scheme is being expanded to detect more cases which would not normally be picked up, meaning more people with Covid- can self-isolate and avoid spreading the virus.Lateral flow tests have already been distributed to health and social care workers, as well as education staff and secondary school pupils across Scotland.People intending to travel to the islands have also been given access to the rapid testing scheme from this week.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: “The changes that come into force next week have been hard earned by all of us. I know that many will be looking forward – quite rightly – to their first drink in a beer garden, to catching up with a friend in a café, or to going on holiday somewhere in Scotland.“But even as we enjoy those moments, we still need to be careful. We must remember the virus is more infectious now than it was when bars and cafés were last open, so we must still stick to the rules. However, we are hopeful of seeing sustained progress in the weeks and months ahead.“We are keeping island communities in Level  at the moment, so that we can allow travel between those communities and the rest of Scotland. If you are planning to travel to an island and do not have Covid- symptoms, we will encourage you to take two lateral flow tests for Covid- before you depart.#Lateral flow tests involve rubbing a long cotton bud over the tonsil area and inside the nose, and should be used twice weekly.Theya result in  minutes and use a device similar to a pregnancy test.However, they are aimed at those who are asymptomatic. Anyone who develops symptoms should isolate and book a PCR test at a drive-through or walk-through site.The lateral flow kits can be ordered from the Scottish Government website from Monday and can be collected from local test sites.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium

daily updated charts and maps to track the coronavirus crisis in Scotland. The table below shows an at-a-glance view of the situation in each local authority. It shows new reported cases and deaths in the last day, as well as the total cases in each area since the pandemic began. After a second wave over winter, most areas of the country are starting to see figures fall again.The proportion of people who test positive every day was trending downward since December.The chart below shows local positivity rates. This is now a key metric that is considered when putting each area into tiers. The colour scales refer to the potential levels recommended by the World Health Organisation.Another key metric is the rate of cases per , people. The chart below shows the seven day rate in each local authority. Similar to the chart above, this chart is also colour coded by the potential levels as recommended by the WHO.In the early stages of the pandemic, cases were more concentrated in older generations. In the last few months this has shted towards cases being more prevalent in younger people – however, cases are declining in the more vulnerable age groups as the vaccine rollout progresses.As the number of daily new cases reduces, the cumulative totals for the health board areas become less important. The heatmap below shows the number of new cases by health board area.The chart below shows the daily number of deaths after a positive test as well as the cases where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certicate.The heatmap below shows the age demographics of the people who have lost their lives to the virus. The chart below shows a daily snapshot of the number of people in hospital and ICU with Covid-. Use the dropdown to navigate to your health board. The chart below shows the number of new tests reported each day.

This is mainly due to massive insecticide use and habitat loss caused by intensication of agriculture.Up to  per cent of flowering plants and  per cent of commercial crops require insects for pollination, with honeybees and hoverflies most often doing the job.But with declining numbers of these species, farmers may employ hives of bees to prevent crop yields falling.Wild honeybees forage within three miles of their nest, and onthey perform the #waggle dance# that advertises the location of productive foraging sites to other bees. Also, odours from scented flowers picked up inside the nest while unloading pollen act as cues to guide nest-mates to specic flowers.Now scientists have articially imprinted bees with flower odours in an attempt to improve crop yields*.In trying to establish long-term memory for flower odours, the scientists offered bees in three separate groups of hives alternative odours:  sucrose solution scented with synthetic sunflower odours,  sucrose solution scented with jasmine odours,  sucrose solution alone. They then relocated the hives to a sunflower plantation and compared the foraging activities of bees exposed to the three solutions.First, scientists decoded waggle dances to identy sunflower-specic dances. Using this information, they observed bees from hives fed with sunflower odours performing sunflower dances one hour after hive relocation.Contrastingly, the control bees fed jasmine odours took - hours and control sucrose-fed bees took  hours to perform sunflower dances.This resulted in the sunflower odour-imprinted bees performing signicantly more sunflower-specic waggle dances during the first day of relocation, peaking at  per cent increase over control hives preferentially visiting sunflowers and bringing in more sunflower pollen loads than the control bees.The scientists then measured the all-important crop yields in five plots containing dferent sunflower hybrid plants pollinated by sunflower odour-imprinted compared to control bees.Seed yields in all five plots were highest when pollinated by sunflower odour-fed bees, with increased production up to  per cent above control bees.They conclude that providing bees pre-programmed to forage on specic crops could circumvent wild pollinator shortages and signicantly increase crop yields.*Current Biology , -.

Especially when option one, the Glen Croe route, was the chosen option from the A Trunk Road Study # summary report published by Jacobs in .Surely, after nine years of consulting, the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland can choose the best solution rather than going through a y and expensive consultation process.Based on this, our members would like the permanent solution fast tracked, which is well within the Scottish Government’s power and we would ask for this to be seriously considered.Our other comments and feedback to last week’s announcement are as follows:The timber road route should be upgraded as a short-term solution this summer and not in the suggested  months.Argyll businesses have faced the issues of landslides for many years. However, the situation has worsened over the past year and in our opinion it has now become a national emergency and requires immediate action.The , tons of unstable material could swamp any further mitigation measures put in place on the A and Old Military Roadand make the roads impassable. This could easily happen when we next have an extended period of rainfall.Savings in further mitigation work could go towards upgrading the forestry road.The long-term solution should be selected from the  The A Trunk Road Study and based on the delivery of the most sustainable outcome.Any well-developed permanent solution needs to be open  without fear of being buried under tons of rock and mud, and will have less environmental impact than the landslides, catchpits, netting and OMR bund we are currently experiencing.Our understanding of costs and timescales from similar schemes in Norway show a tunnel could be built in three years at a cost of £-m, and not the £-m stated by Transport Scotland.Members of The RABT Campaign group represent a cross section of business sectors and we would welcome the chance to meet with your officials to discuss how we might help cut through the y timescales and fast-track decision making.John Gurr  Sir,I heard that there was work going on in Lochgilphead town centre, and that some people were complaining, about mess and upheaval.

As we look ahead to this year’s event on Saturday March  at .pm, many of us are reflecting on the future, as we emerge from the latest, and hopefully last #stay at home# period.With that in mind, we are asking people to use Earth Hour by helping us to create the #Great Scottish Canvas#. Switch off your lights and by candlelight or torchlight, use the hour to paint a picture, craft a poem, doodle or write something which illustrates the future Scotland you want to live in.With so many eyes on Scotland this year, due to Scottish Parliament elections in May and the vital COP climate talks in November, we want to show the world the vision of the Scottish people, for a greener and fairer society for us all.

While saving in some areas of expenditure, it has incurred extra costs in tackling the pandemic and faces an uncertain funding future while the national economy tries to recover. The drive to save money in services where bringing in a little more through, for example, parking fees and fines, is understandable up to a point.But when the economy is on le support after a pandemic, surely the relatively paltry sums to be made are not worth the potential damage to Inveraray#s recovery, as seems to be the view of locals Perhaps councillors could look at this a little dferently. If they are determined to push this through for control traffic purposes, why not donate the proceeds, which would be a by-product of well-behaved traffic, to the town  The pier fund could certainly use it. Both the community council and Inspire Inveraray would no doubt welcome the cash and find many uses for public benefit.Just a thought.Congratulations to Cameron on his award. This is a huge achievement among a group of young people who each work hard for others.It is also  a great achievement for MacLeod Construction to be shortlisted for a national award.

However, on further reading, this was yet another unsurprising disappointment. The preferred corridor through Glen Croe is still to be announced and there is still no timetable for completion.Landslips at the Rest and be Thankful have frequently seen much of Argyll isolated from central Scotland, or journeys delayed by endless roadworks or convoys along the old military road. Most of these problems have occurred during the SNP’s  years in government and the continued failure to provide a permanent solution is yet more proof of how little the SNP cares about or understand the needs of people and businesses outside the central belt.It was clear long ago that patchwork schemes were not a solution but, rather than provide a new corridor which would have resulted in major capital expenditure, tens of millions of pounds have instead been wasted on years of ineffective schemes which nature evades in next to no time.In the meantime, the SNP has had no dficulty finding money to prop up central belt vanity projects like the Edinburgh trams.Mike Russell, SNP MSP for Argyll and Bute, has been far more concerned with Indyref and Brexit than the day to day concerns of his constituents and has done nothing to ensure that providing a reliable road connection to Argyll is a top priority for Michael Matheson, the Cabinet Secretary for Transport.The Holyrood elections on May  are an ideal opportunity for the residents and business owners in Argyll, whose daily lives are affected by such an unreliable road, to voice their dissatisfaction and vote for anyone other than the SNP or the Greens who oppose any road building on principle.A dferent government might not guarantee a speedy resolution, but after  years of failed sticking-plaster attempts to patch up the existing road, it certainly couldn’t be worse.Donald McCallum, Strathaven.Sir,Across the Kintyre and the Islands ward I continue to receive complaints about the rather shoddy condition of road signage.In some cases the signs are faded and covered in dirt and in many other cases they are falling to pieces.One example of this is the road signs above the footpath outside Port Ellen Primary School on Islay and sadly there are many other examples. In my opinion in the future Argyll and Bute Council must be more diligent in maintaining our signs.Road signs help to regulate traffic, provide crucial visual guidance and give drivers important previews, especially during night-time conditions.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I write further to correspondence on Lochgilphead#s expensive new pavements.When they are finally finished, could somebody seethey have a bucket or two of tarry stones left over that could be chucked into the tank trap that passes for a roundabout, next to the Tesco garage David Hay, MinardSir,I have immense pleasure in communicating to your readers our new address following our successful relocation of our main office premises.Our email, website and telephone numbers remain the same as before.Email: info@abcab.org.uk and phone  .We have had no break in service and continue to provide advice and support to clients across Argyll and Bute, with our advisers all working from home under current government guidance.We are also available to provide advice to those who find themselves in a vulnerable position and require face-to-face advice by appointment in our Helensburgh and Lochgilphead offices.We commence our second volunteer adviser training programme next month and look forward to welcoming our new trainees.Jen Broadhurst, Bureau Manager, Argyll and Bute Citizens Advice BureauSir,Following the Scottish Government#s pay offer of four per cent across the board for all NHS workers, Unite will ballot its members on the offer over the next few weeks.Unite represents workers in every pay band across the entire NHS structure and recognises that while this offer will put money into the pockets of our members, any monthly pay uplt will y considerably between iniduals. For this reason Unite will be putting this offer to our members without recommendation.The offer includes an opportunity to revisit any settlement including an intention by the Scottish Government to allocate additional funding through Barnett Consequentials. Unite will demand that any additional payment made to the Scottish Government by Westminster through this formula, is passed on to our members.Workers across the NHS have been described as #heroic# in what has been an exceptionally challenging year. Now is the time to reward those workers with the pay uplt they deserve, not just for their work during the Covid pandemic, but also for the pay cuts they have endured through years of austerity.For Unite, other pay potential remains on the table in the form of additional Barnett Consequentials and we will pursue any additional pay that is intended for our members through further negotiation with any future Scottish Government.James O’Connell, Unite regional officer for Scotland.Sir,I work for a TV company called Five Mile Films and we are making a new documentary series this year for Channel .We are looking for people to apply to take part who are wanting to live a simpler le.

The disciples were huddled indoors in fear of their lives when suddenly the resurrected Jesus was there among them.Thomas hadn#t been with the others when it happened. He just could not bring himself to believe without seeing him for himself. Thomas gets a bad press because of this.We often react to this wee excerpt from Thomas#s story aswe would have been less reluctant to believe. We carry our willingness to believe as a badge of faith. Poor old Doubting Thomas.But is doubt a weakness  Or is it simply an opportunity, a space, a fertile ground in which faith might grow and ultimately blossom A week later, the disciples were gathered again in the same house where they had last seen Jesus. This time, Thomas was with them. Once again, Jesus came and stood among them. He greeted them again, #Peace be with you,# before turning and addressing Thomas directly.He said to him: #Put your finger here and see my hands. Put your hand in my side. Do not doubt but believe.#Jesus#s words are aimed not only at Thomas, but at everyone who encounters this story, and struggles to believe that God is capable of doing the very thing that God has promised — call our world into new and unending, resurrected le.#Do not doubt but believe.#"},{"url":null,"title":"american dream continues for bob","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

You can also plant the first early potatoes, weather dependent.For beginners, some of the easiest fruits to grow are berries. Strawberries and blueberries love containers or open ground and both will crop heavily once established.A simple garden solution for April is to create your very own veg patch. Mark out the area well, prepare the soil, dig in compost and then sow a iety of seeds that will provide you with veg all year round.It’s a common misconception that you need a lot of space to be able to grow vegetables. You can still achieve real success with container grown plants. Tomatoes will thrive in pots and grow bags and can also be grown in the ground.Another plant that loves container leis Lavender – and it’s the perfect time to plant it so that you can enjoy it throughout the summer. It’s a favourite with gardeners not just for its beautul form and fragrance but also because it attracts essential pollinators such as bees and butterflies.It’s considered a romantic flower that most gardeners get the urge to plant in their garden sooner or later and can add real value with its scent and shades of purple flowers and silver leaf backdrop. To successfully grow lavender, it needs to be planted in a warm, well drained soil with full sun. It is often planted as an edging plant with roses or grown as an informal hedge. However, lavender does not like ‘wet feet’ as it promotes root rot and dampness is often the reason that it doesn’t perform well. It’s a tough plant though and once established only requires regular pruning after flowering has finished in the autumn.April not only sees the start of National Gardening Week , but it really kicks off the gardening season.Top April tips from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 9 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We are also looking for volunteers to support the service.There are an estimated , armed forces veterans in Scotland, with an average age of .  The Comradeship Circles also welcome their partners, widows, and widowers.Participants simply dial into the weekly chat, with a facilitator on hand to assistnecessary. The service is popular with those who are unable or find it dficult to enjoy social connection online.Our Comradeship Circles has been a social leline for many over the last six months, so we’re delighted this funding means they can continue. Even before the pandemic, thousands of older veterans still felt isolated because of health conditions, disabilities, or living in a rural location. Although restrictions are now easing, we know that many are feeling lonelier than ever before.While more and more older people are getting online, there are still hundreds of thousands who are unable or prefer not to use the internet. This telephone service has been especially valued by older veterans who have a disability or health condition which means they struggle to use the video conferencing apps.Comradeship Circles mean they can enjoy banter and share stories and memories of military le. It’s been inspiring to see the care and support that the veterans’ community give each other, helping each other through dficult time. Many participants have told us that they’ve rekindled old friendships or made new ones, or look forward to a natter to get them through the week.If you or someone you know is a veteran aged  or over, we’d encourage them to give it a try.A call to the Age Scotland helpline     can open the door to camaraderie and extra support for older members of the ex-service community.Brian Sloan, Age Scotland chief executive "},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures april 9 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It was not the practice to make public the particulars in cases where those responsible for criminal investigation were satisfied that no crime had been committed but he might mention, for the satisfaction of the honourable member and those on whose behalf the question was put, that on recovery of the body what was observed tended strongly to confirm the accuracy of the statements which had been made at the time by those who were with the deceased when the accident took place.#PICS:Alexander McNab, born Argyll in , at two stages in le. no_aMcNab_story_AlexClare#s great grandmother, Grace McNab Bridge, as a young woman in the early th century. no_aMcNab_story_GraceGrace in later years. no_aMcNab_story_GraceClare Frith has been researching her family history. no_aMcNab_story_ClarePrivate Andrew McNab, one of three McNab brothers killed during the First World War. no_aMcNab_story_Andrew"},{"url":null,"title":"shorter racing only scottish series planned","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Each route takes visitors on a real pilgrimage to ancient Christian landmarks, through remote and impressive landscapes.#Whilst Faith in Cowal is a Christian organisation, the routes are open to people of all faiths and none and provide the perfect way to connect with the wild beauty Cowal has to offer. Some of the sites that book-end each trail date as far back as the th and th centuries as well as more ancient landmarks such as Auchnaha Cairn that are thought to be Neolithic in origin.#The walks take in locations close to the major settlements and population centres of Cowal including Strachur, Dunoon, Kilfinan and Colintraive but they#re unlike any other path you#ll find. These are not all neatly manicured and waymarked trails. We have deliberately kept them dynamic and wild by making use of forestry roads and ancient heritage paths. Many of the routes require short, improvised hikes between paths so you#ll feel like a real pilgrim forging your way through the landscape.#There are detailed guides on our website as well as downloadable GPS tracks. We hope as many visitors to Cowal as possible will take this opportunity to step in the footsteps of ancient pilgrims and travellers, enjoy the wonderful scenery of Argyll and explore fascinating sites of genuine spiritual and religious importance,# added Dan.PICS:A map of the routes. no_aFootstepsFaithPhotos: subtlesensorHistoric Kilmun church, on the shores of the Holy Loch. no_aFootstepsFaith_©subtlesensor_Kilmorich graveyard, Cairndow. no_aFootstepsFaith_KilmorichGraveyard©subtlesensor"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 16 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

One of the highlights from last year’s event included celebrity supporters dressing up as much-loved characters to recreate tea party scenes from the world of film. Phyllis Logan was Mary Poppins, music producer Naughty Boy was Jay Gatsby, Emma Barton was Holly Golightly and Jess and Natalya Wright were Alice in Wonderland and the Queen of Hearts.Families with dementia have been adversely affected by the lockdown for just over a year. Care home visiting restrictions, the closure of support and respite services and the resulting social isolation and loneliness has disproportionately affected people living with dementia and their family carers.Whilst Time for a Cuppa will be slightly dferent this year, we know dementia support is needed more than ever. We are so grateful to all of our fundraisers who will be whipping up treats, enthusiasm, funds and giving their time for others – in a socially distanced way, of course – in what will be a very special and important Time for a Cuppa.For more information about Time for a Cuppa and how to host a tea party with our free fundraising pack, visit the dementiauk.org timeforacuppa webpage.Dr Hilda Hayo, Chief Admiral Nurse and Chief Executive Officer of Dementia UK."},{"url":null,"title":"outdoor centres to help argyll schools","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The good news though is that itrsquos very much less likelythat you will get covidyoursquore vaccinated, compared to someone who isnrsquot.Even better, in the unlikely event that you do catch Covid after being vaccinated, you are much less likely to get severe symptoms or be hospitalised thanyou had not been vaccinated.The clinical trials for the Pfizer vaccine reported a % efficacy, which means that the number of people who showed symptoms of covid during the time of the trial was % lower in the vaccinated group than in a comparison group who were not vaccinated.Data collected since the trials, as the vaccines have begun to be used widely, has confirmed these numbers, so the vaccines are very effective on a population scale. On a inidual scale, though, there is still a chance that you might be one of the very few people who is vaccinated and still gets infected it is possible, just very much less likely than without a vaccine.One extra point to add here is that the vaccines take time to work.The vaccine is not a instant shot of protectionit is a way to train your immune system, so that your immune system will then protect you. It takes - weeks or so for the immune system to respond so, evenyou are someone who has a superb immune response to the vaccine, you are still not protected until - weeks after the jag.Some cases of people being infected with covid after the vaccination are because they were exposed to the virus during this - week window. Be especially cautious during this time.Can I still infect other people Just as the vaccines make it much less likely that yoursquoll get infected, they also make it much less likely that you will be able to infect others ndash but in both cases the answer is that the chances are much reduced, but not zero.We donrsquot fully understand why some people are fully protected and others are not it might be that you have a slightly quirky immune system, or are immunosuppressed it might be that you are exposed to an unusually high dose of the virus.It might be something in your genes or environment that makes you a particularly good target for the virus.When the first trials were conducted to test how well the vaccines work, the data that was collected measured the number of people who showed symptoms of disease. This number was reduced % in the Pfizer trial.The trials did not attempt to measure whether vaccinated people could still be infectious. We have some really encouraging data now, collected after the trials from countries where vaccines have been used widely, showing that vaccination does also reduce transmission ndash meaning that vaccinated people are less likely to infect othersthan people who are not vaccinated.This is what we expected and hoped for, and itrsquos really good to see. This is why being vaccinated not only protects ourselves, but also others.Viruses cannot live for long periods on their ownthey need a person to provide a home.If you are successfully vaccinated, then your body is trained to refuse entry to the virus, denying it that home.When only a few people are vaccinated, the virus can fairly easily find another person, another home to occupy. When very many people are vaccinated, finding a home becomes much more of a challenge, and the virus is condemned to a lonely death outside.The idea of working together by using our immune systems to reduce the number of opportunities that the virus has to gain a foothold and spread is whatrsquos called ldquoherd immunity.Even the rare people in whom the vaccine didnrsquot work very well can be protected this way, as other peoplersquos vaccinations mean that they too are less likely to encounter the virus.Can I stop wearing a facemask when Irsquom vaccinated No. The importance of a face mask is that it is a barrier to stop you infecting other people.We still need to be cautious to avoid infection, and to avoid infecting others, until the amount of virus circulating in our communities falls.The Covid vaccines are one part of our toolkit for reducing the amount of virus circulating. They make it less likely yoursquoll get infected, less likely yoursquoll get sick, and less likely yoursquoll breathe out the virus and spread it to others.But there is still a small chance that each of these steps can happen, and so facemasks, space and distance are all still needed just now.The gradual easing of restrictions that is beginning just now is possible because wersquove successfully driven case numbers down, in part through the vaccination programme.If we can keep this up, then we will get to a point when case numbers are low enough that restrictions will ease yet further, and facemasks might then become optionalin more places.Will immunity last We are optimisticthat immunity will last ndash but not yet certain.The first people to receive the Covid vaccines were only vaccinated  months ago, so we know that vaccines can generate immunity that lasts at least  months.We know that the majority of people who have been infected with the SARS-CoV virus, that causes Covid, also have persistent immune cells and good antibody levels, even a year after infection.There was a lot of fear that immunity would not last, and there are been some prominent cases where people have been shown to be infected twice ndash so in those particualr people, immunity was either not persistent or not ever good enough.But for the majority of people, infection has led to persistent immunity, so far.Another piece of encouraging news is that particular immune cells, essential for protection, were still detectable last year in people who were infected in  with SARS, which was a severe infection caused by a similar coronavirus to the one that causes Covid.So we are optimistic, but will only know for certain when more time has passed.Another twisthere, is whether immunity generated by having one of the current vaccines will be effective against any virus iants: lasting immunity might not be useful,the virus mutates and can escape that immunity. But there are grounds for optimism here toohellipWill I need a booster ... There are two situations in which a booster might be useful.The first one is immunity doesnrsquot last long enoughwithout a booster, and in that case a third jag is definitely a possible solution.The second one is the virus mutates or ies, and we need to update our vaccines to match the new iants. The coronavirus that causes Covid is one that is known to mutate ndash thatrsquos a normal part of its biology.The flu virus is another example of a virus that we know mutates, and thatrsquos why flu vaccines are updated and given every year.But the Covid vaccines have held up well so far: the vaccines currently being used in the UK were designed against the original version of the virus, but have done very well in reducing disease and blocking transmission of the B.. Kent iant, for example.The immune response generated by the vaccines is strong, and evenit is two fold less effective against a new iant, there is a good chance the remaining immune response will still be enough to prevent severe disease and slow the spread of the virus.Another piece of good news is the way that these new vaccines have been designed makes it a relatively simple process to update them,new iants make that necessary.If we do need boosters, that too should be achievable.Will everything go back to normal once everyone has had both doses The gradual easing of restrictionsthat have begun now reflects the success of our collective ability to reduce the amount of virus circulating, and getting people fully vaccinated is a large part of this success.I hope that this gradual process will continue as the vaccination programme is completed, and more normality will be achieved in each step.That said, we are still a long way away from everyone having both doses, as we need vaccinations to be completed globally before any inidual country can fully relax.Within the UK, the vaccination programme is currently planned for all adults, but vaccines for teenagers and younger children are only in the stage of clinical trials.Globally, some restrictions on international travelmight need to persist until global vaccination rates increase, and those gobal vaccination rates depend on politics and cooperation between nations.Another aspect to this question is what normal really means.The pandemic hit us hard and for people whorsquove been bereaved, who have persistent symptoms or Long Covid, or whose jobs and livelihoods have been affected, normal wonrsquot ever be as it was.And as communities, there are also changes both good and bad.Will hand sanitiser provision in supermarkets continue  Will working from home always be more possible  Will high streets rejuvenate  There are opportunities for change here,we want to grasp them but there may also need to be time to heal and recover."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-peeblesshire-tests-people-without-symptoms","story":"CORONAVIRUS tests for people without symptoms are being offered in Peeblesshire again from today.In a press release issued by NHS Borders last week, the health board outlined plans for rapid testing sites toacross the region.Tests will be offered in West Lintontodayand tomorrow.COVIDtesting will alsoin Peeblesand Innerleithenover the weekend.:Fire started deliberately in Peeblesshire, suspect police ndash appeal issuedTesting will take place at the fire stations of all the above locations between .am-pm.NHS Bordersrsquo director of public health, Dr Tim Patterson, said: ldquoCommunity testing of those who feel well and do not have any typical COVID- symptoms is one of the key ways that we can keep each other safe.

It underlines the fact that it is communities who know best what is best for them.Argyll and Bute Council was at the centre of ensuring our resilience teams got support and Scottish Government funding dispersed quickly and efficiently.That is why I find the decision of the Tory Lib Dem Independent ruling administration to remove the recycling service from Kintyre Recycling Ltdand taking it in-house as short-sighted. And giving them only six months notice is disgraceful.KRL has provided a reliable service for the community since  and given employment opportunities to people with barriers to work. It has a committed board and management team who have ersied the projects it does to ensure sustainability. But this decision leaves a gaping hole in its business plan and a workforce unsurethey will still have jobs.There is a projected increase in cost of £, to supply recycling bins across Kintyre. But this does not take account of the possible social and welfare cost of the impact on the workforce. This is yet another blow to the community already hammered by unemployment.I urge the council to work closely with KRL to find a solution that ensures that all of the KRL employees at risk of redundancy are found suitable employment and that this valuable organisation can continue to employ vulnerable people providing services from which everyone benefits.In , the SNP published a coloured map showing options for the route of the A at the Rest and Be Thankful. Nine years later, all they have done is colour in the map slightly dferently. We are no further forward.Whoever is in government after the election must stump up the money needed to construct a road protected from landslides. This must be done a lot quicker than the  years the SNP say it will take them.Without urgent action, many businesses in Argyll will not survive.Across the Kintyre and the Islands ward I continue to receive complaints about the rather shoddy condition of road signs.In some cases the signs are faded and covered in dirt and in many other cases they are falling to pieces.One example of this is the road signs above the footpath outside of Port Ellen Primary School on Islay and sadly there are many other examples.In my opinion, in the future, Argyll and Bute Council must be more diligent in maintaining our signs. Road signs help regulate traffic, provide crucial visual guidance and give drivers important preview especially during night-time conditions.I will continue to campaign for more frequent road sign maintenance for every corner of my ward.Following the Scottish Government#s pay offer of four per cent across the board for all NHS workers, Unite will ballot its members on the offer over the next few weeks.Unite represents workers in every pay band across the entire NHS structure and recognises that while this offer will put money into the pockets of our members, any monthly pay uplt will y considerably between iniduals. For this reason, Unite will be putting this offer to our members without recommendation.The offer includes an opportunity to revisit any settlement including an intention by the Scottish Government to allocate additional funding through Barnett Consequentials. Unite will demand that any additional payment made to the Scottish Government by Westminster through this formula, is passed on to our members.Workers across the NHS have been described as #heroic# in what has been an exceptionally challenging year.Now is the time to reward those workers with the pay uplt they deserve, not just for their work during the Covid pandemic, but also for the pay cuts they have endured through years of austerity.For Unite, other pay potential remains on the table in the form of additional Barnett Consequentials and we will pursue any additional pay that is intended for our members through further negotiation with any future Scottish Government.I work for a television company called Five Mile Films and we are making a new documentary series this year for Channel .We are looking for people to apply to take part who want to live a simpler le.

It is not depression it is more subtle and has spiritual overtones – I would say it is most profoundly a spiritual phenomenon.Looking into it, I clearly identied aspects of it in myself today! It appears to be the most #underdiagnosed# and unacknowledged spiritual illness of this age.I found that Pope Francis also came across it. Commenting in the context of healing the paralytic by the pool, he said the #first illness# is the one afflicting the paralysed man. He had #resigned himself to it,# the Pope said, #perhaps saying to himself: #Le is unfair, others are more fortunate than I am#. There is a plaintive tone in this way of speaking # there is resignation but there is also bitterness.#He added that it is an attitude reminiscent of #many [Christians] who lack enthusiasm and who are bitter#, who repeatedly say to themselves: #I go to [church] every Sunday but it is better not to become involved! I believe for my own sake, but I don#t feel the need to give it to others: each one peacefully at his own home.#These people, the Pope added, also take the attitude that # you do something well in le, they#ll reprove you: so, it#s better not to take the risk#.Good Friday, Easter Sunday # excellent days to take the risk and resolve to do something well in le, to set sensible goals to be better than I am now.

In summary, the society was to promote the study of the archaeology of Kintyre and adjacent islands, to investigate the history and antiquities of the area and to preserve and publish relevant records and documents.The office-bearers were: President, Macdonald of Largie Vice-presidents, Sherf Macmaster Campbell, Colonel Mactaggart and Thomas Lindsay Galloway Hon secretary and treasurer, Duncan Colville Council, Mrs T L Galloway , Latimer MacInnes, Dean of Guild Neil McArthur, Major W Macalister Hall of Torrisdale, Mrs Macneal of Lossit , Archibald Dunlop Armour and Rev Norman Mackenzie.Of these, Macmaster Campbell, Mactaggart, MacInnes and Colville would power the research engine of the society in the early decades of its existence with studies on archaeology, history, place-names and local dialect.The scholarly talents of two of the founder-members, Macdonald of Largie and Lindsay Galloway, were almost immediately annulled by the time of the society#s first annual general meeting on November  , both were dead.Macdonald, a product of Eton and Oxford, was the author of a three-volume History of France, and Galloway, a distinguished mining engineer and protégé of Lord Kelvin, in  graduated MA at Glasgow University with first class honours in mathematics and natural philosophy, #a very rare distinction#."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday april 9 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

In a social media statement, he wrote: #Very sad to hear Jock MacVicar has died. I first met Jock when playing in the  Scottish Boys Championship at Dunbar. He was always very supportive and knowledgeable. We spoke a few months ago. Speaking to Jock was like talking to an old friend.

Sadly we have all heard of someone who has been affected by stroke and many people like me have tragically lost someone too.Almost five years ago, my wonderful mum, Diana, suffered a severe stroke. She died four weeks later. My mum was the most active, #full of le# person I knew. She LOVED le. She was my best friend and I miss her every day. That#s why I want to ask your readers to take part in the Stroke Association#s A Walk to Remember.This wonderful event is a special way to celebrate the le of your loved one whilst raising money in their memory.Simply pick a special place that is filled with memories, create your route, and on June  take part in your own walk to remember to raise funds for the Stroke Association.Stroke strikes every five minutes in the UK, and there are around , survivors in Scotland living with its devastating effects who really need our help.Like so many charities, the pandemic has drastically affected the Stroke Association#s income.However the charity has still been supporting stroke survivors as much as they can with support and advice, while continuing to fund vital research into the condition.Please join me and do something amazing in your loved one#s memory by taking part in A Walk to Remember.It#s bound to be an emotional but amazing day for all of us that have lost someone to stroke. Walk in their memory and raise funds to rebuild more lives after stroke.To sign up, please visit https:www.stroke.org.uk fundraising a-walk-to-rememberChildren#s lives have been turned upside over the last year due to challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic, with many spending extended periods of time out of school and behind closed doors.The NSPCC#s Childline service has heard from thousands of children who have found this time really challenging.Some have felt overwhelmed with home schooling and struggled to access their learning due to a lack of technology, whilst others have missed their friends and family and many have seen their mental health deteriorate.The NSPCC and Childline adapted during the pandemic so our frontline staff could continue to be here as a vital source of support for those children who felt like they had nowhere  to turn.Even though many children in Scotland are now back at school, it remains vital that we are still here to support those who are struggling with the impact that the pandemic has had on them.To help us be here for children and to remind them that Childline is a source of support they can turn to, we are encouraging schools across the country to get involved in the NSPCC#s Number Day.This annual fundraising day, which is based around fun maths activities, will take place in primary and secondary schools across the country on May  in aid of the children#s charity.As part of the day, schools can sign up to enjoy puzzles, games and challenges to raise vital funds.There are a range of activities for dferent age groups and teachers will also be provided with resources including information on supporting their school#s safeguarding.It#s now more essential than ever that children aren#t left alone, isolated and unsupported with their worries, and the money raised from Number Day will help the NSPCC in its mission to make  a better year for children.To sign up, visit the NSPCC#s website and search for Number Day and fill in your school#s details using the registration form.Age Scotland has won a £, grant for an innovative telephone friendship service which links older members of the ex-services community.Our Comradeship Circles service has helped to connect hundreds of older veterans for regular group calls since the pilot scheme was launched six months ago.The funding from the Armed Forces Covenant Fund Trust#s Tackling Loneliness Programme will enable our service to expand and continue until autumn , reaching even more older people. We are also looking for volunteers to support the service.There are an estimated , armed forces veterans in Scotland, with an average age of . The Comradeship Circles also welcome their partners, widows, and widowers.Participants simply dial into the weekly chat, with a facilitator on hand to assistnecessary. The service is popular with those who are unable or find it dficult to enjoy social connection online.Our Comradeship Circles has been a social leline for many over the last six months, so we#re delighted this funding means they can continue.Even before the pandemic, thousands of older veterans still felt isolated because of health conditions, disabilities, or living in a rural location. Although restrictions are now easing, we know that many are feeling lonelier than ever before.While more and more older people are getting online, there are still hundreds of thousands who are unable or prefer not to use the internet.This telephone service has been especially valued by older veterans who have a disability or health condition which means they struggle to use the video conferencing apps.Comradeship Circles mean they can enjoy banter and share stories and memories of military le.It#s been inspiring to see the care and support that the veterans# community gives each other, helping each other through dficult times. Many participants have told us that they’ve rekindled old friendships or made new ones, or look forward to a natter to get them through the week.If you or someone you know is a veteran aged  or over, we#d encourage them to give it a try.A call to the Age Scotland helpline     can open the door to camaraderie and extra support for older members of the ex-service community.I have been contacted by many of my constituents about the concerning condition of Ballymartin road on Islay.It has gradually been getting worse over the years but is now as bad as it has ever been and is getting to the stage that it#s nearly not passable for a small car without risking damage.I have raised this with our roads department and although funds are stretched, this road is clearly in need of some desperate repairs and,left unmaintained for any longer, will only end up costing the hard-pressed council taxpayer more to fix in the long-run."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week april 9 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The disciples were huddled indoors in fear of their lives when suddenly the resurrected Jesus was there among them.Thomas hadn#t been with the others when it happened. He just could not bring himself to believe without seeing him for himself. Thomas gets a bad press because of this.We often react to this wee excerpt from Thomas#s story aswe would have been less reluctant to believe. We carry our willingness to believe as a badge of faith. Poor old Doubting Thomas.But is doubt a weakness  Or is it simply an opportunity, a space, a fertile ground in which faith might grow and ultimately blossom A week later, the disciples were gathered again in the same house where they had last seen Jesus. This time, Thomas was with them. Once again, Jesus came and stood among them. He greeted them again, #Peace be with you,# before turning and addressing Thomas directly.He said to him: #Put your finger here and see my hands. Put your hand in my side. Do not doubt but believe.#Jesus#s words are aimed not only at Thomas, but at everyone who encounters this story, and struggles to believe that God is capable of doing the very thing that God has promised — call our world into new and unending, resurrected le.#Do not doubt but believe.#"},{"url":null,"title":"two pairs triumph at dunaverty","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

All money raised will be kept in the area.She said: #Unfortunately, the diagnosis for Dad was too late, but I know how crucial the service Macmillan provides within the rural community is for all families.#Therefore, my aim is to raise awareness and as much money as possible for Macmillan Cancer Support with all money staying in Argyll and Bute. This money is invaluable in supporting families living with cancer locally.#Lindsay is inviting as many people as possible to join her — in a socially distanced manner — for the full walk or as many or few sections as they like.It will be an early rise for those wanting to do the first leg, as the walk is set to begin at .am.The approximate leaving times from Westport for the remaining sections are: .am, .am, .pm and .pm. Further details will be shared nearer the time.There is no need to sign up. Those wishing to join Lindsay on her walk should just show up at one or all of the starting times. Light refreshments will be provided throughout the day.Lindsay#s sister-in-law Leighann Burns, who has been helping promote the challenge, said: #This is a great opportunity for people of all ages to get together to raise money for an invaluable community service.#It would be lovely to see as many people locally take part on the day, socially distanced of course.#Donations can be made on the day or via Lindsay#s JustGiving page. Search #Lindsay Ramsay Walk at Westport# on www.justgivingLindsay is well on her way towards her fundraising target, having already received donations amounting to more than £ by the time the Courier went to press.A Macmillan Cancer support spokesperson said: #At Macmillan, we give people with cancer everything we#ve got. If you are diagnosed, your worries are our worries. We do whatever it takes. But without your help, we can#t support everyone who needs us.#The charity#s Kintyre fundraising group usually holds annual events to raise essential funds but this has not been possible during the Covid- pandemic, so Lindsay#s challenge will provide a welcome boost."},{"url":null,"title":"tennis players return to the sport they love","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We had to be very careful and keep reinforcing these measures. It had to be safe. Not many of us managed to deliver any events. It was challenging but it could be done.#A former housing manager, Colin gave up his job when he was  to take on a full-time position with Tennis Scotland, the independent governing body for tennis in Scotland. Before that, as well as playing and winning many major competitions, he volunteered his services as a coach.Colin calls Prestwick his hometown but he has lived in several areas across the UK and has a long association with Kintyre, where he lived and worked for a time in the s.

There was mention the flat had not been used much for the purpose of respite for islanders.However, a report before IJB members said the lack of consultation over it closing had caused community concern. The meeting was told there had been #a mix up# over communicating what was happening with islanders.Councillor Mulvaney said he did not feel the flat merited still being in the budget. #We should have saved this [the money] a number of years ago,# he said.Councillor Currie said: #The flat has been used, not much, but it has been used. Everyone is accepting it could have been advertised better.#It was Mid Argyll councillor Sandy Taylor who asked for the service level agreement for the advocacy service to be spared from the savings option list as #a contribution to mental health.#MID ARGYLL AND ISLAY:People across Mid Argyll and Islay have had their mental health boosted thanks to the innovative #Take  Challenge# which began in Kintyre.Inspired by Campbeltown Tesco manager David Brown#s personal K-a-day challenge in , mental health network ACUMEN, in conjunction with Kintyre Link Club, organised the initiative encouraging more people to #take five# each day –  five minutes of walking, five deep breaths of fresh air or a five-kilometre walk or run – with the aim of boosting wellbeing.After success in Kintyre, ACUMEN mental health development worker Sarah McFadzean rolled the challenge out across Mid Argyll and Islay, where people are encouraged to support one another in their challenges by way of a dedicated Facebook group.Where possible, people have been able to meet in twos and, as restrictions change, it is hoped opportunities for groups to Take  together will increase as the initiative moves to the Oban, Lorn and the Isles area in June.Sarah said: #Being involved and enjoying the challenge is as important as the activities themselves.#I would like to thank everyone who supported and got involved in Take  for their enthusiasm and assistance.#We are in the process of developing a Mental Health Forum and Lived Experience Group in the Mid Argyll, Kintyre and the Isles, the purpose of which will be to gather thoughts on current service provision, listen to others# experiences and inform future planning, along with providing information from a range of services and peer support.#For more information contact sarah.mcfadzean@acumennetwork"},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane april 16 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Meantime, however, with the exception of the magazine, all society activities remain in a state of suspension."},{"url":null,"title":"from our files april 16 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

And now, more than a week later and despite updates in the interim about the reopening of schools, they#re still waiting – and it#s not acceptable.Like everyone , islanders are desperate to know when they can reconnect with family and friends. Island businesses are equally frantic to know when and how they can make plans for the weeks ahead.But, unlike everyone , our islands are at a complete disadvantage. They still don#t know what is happening, or when. They deserve better. The Scottish Government needs to respond to our islands# call for clarity and let them, like the rest of the country, start to think and plan ahead.Now in its nd year, the Big Garden Birdwatch is a chance for people of all ages to count the number of birds that visit their garden helping the Royal Society for the Protection of Birdsto build up a picture of how they are doing.This year, more than a million people across the UK, including more than , in Scotland, took part, counting  million birds.The event, held over the last weekend in January, revealed the house sparrow held on to its number one spot. But  out of the top  bird species showed declines in average numbers in Scotland compared to last year.Starlings remained in second place, but numbers were down  per cent compared to . Goldfinches saw the greatest decline in Scotland’s top , falling four places from sixth position last year, with reported numbers  per cent fewer than .I am absolutely delighted with the number of people who have taken part, making it the biggest year ever for RSPB Scotland.This has generated a massive amount of data which will help our scientists with important conservation work, but it also shows how many of us have turned to nature after what has been a dficult  months.We need every voice raised to stand up for nature. The wildle that brings us so much interest and solace is now just a fraction of what should be there.Big Garden Birdwatch has shown that people across Scotland have a real passion for their wildle. We now need government to take the global leadership, policy and legislative opportunities open to it this year to reverse the decline and restore nature.It#s no exaggeration to say that when a dog goes missing or is stolen, it is heart-breaking.Dogs for Good has put together some tips to reduce the likelihood of your dog being taken.If the unthinkable happens and your dog is taken, remember, you are not alone.

Phyllis Logan was Mary Poppins, music producer Naughty Boy was Jay Gatsby, Emma Barton was Holly Golightly and Jess and Natalya Wright were Alice in Wonderland and the Queen of Hearts.Families with dementia have been adversely affected by lockdown for just over a year now. Care home visiting restrictions, the closure of support and respite services and the resulting social isolation and loneliness have disproportionately affected people living with dementia and their family carers.Whilst Time for a Cuppa will be slightly dferent this year, we know dementia support is needed more than ever. We are so grateful to all our fundraisers who will be whipping up treats, enthusiasm, funds and who are giving their time for others – in a socially distanced way of course – in what will be a special and important Time for a Cuppa.For more information about Time for a Cuppa and how to host your own tea party with our free fundraising pack, visit the dementiauk.org timeforacuppa webpage."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week april 16 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We have staff, more volunteers, moved to larger premises and do much more than shopping.April is our birthday month where we celebrate on the th and th, when we became a company and a charity respectively. So many people have been part of these years and there are many memories to look back on, so many people to thank who have supported us in many dferent ways.We won awards for helping older people – Herald Society in  and Age Scotland in , raised funds with raffles, walking, running, getting covered in mud, quizzes, bingo, making and selling fairy doors, alpacas, books and eggs. We have celebrated birthdays, weddings, Christmases, Easters and any day we can! There has been laughter and sadness, fun, hope and joy.It was  when the seeds were planted at the South Kintyre Fit Communities about the need to develop a shopping service to help older people on discharge from hospital, no longer able to drive or to carry heavy bags.Since then, we have provided not just a shopping service but a number of social activities and housekeeping throughout Kintyre. We have developed the #Making Kintyre Dementia Friendly# project to help all parts of the community to have an understanding of dementia and how it can be managed. We have worked with children of all ages, meeting and helping the older generation and look forward to doing so again.Covid- has changed all our lives and we have had to adapt to dferent ways of keeping in touch and keeping busy. Phone Buddies was set up and we had a monthly virtual tea.However, our plans – started last year – to celebrate our th anniversary with parties has had to be cancelled but we are marking the occasion with a specially made mug by Simon Rochford of Campbeltown Pottery.Thanks to everyone who has been involved in any way with Shopper-Aide – it has been and, I hope, will continue to be, a help to the older generations in Kintyre.So here is to the next  years."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week april 16 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Positioned a little to the right of Taurus, they are an unmistakable sight in the winter sky.Even a modest pair of binoculars will reveal that there are many more stars in that cluster than the naked eye can discern. The Pleiades along with Orion, are even mentioned in the bible, in the Book of Job, chapter ..With the aid of binoculars these stars are a truly dazzling sight.The bible is a collection of books coming from the pens of many dferent authors over a long period of time. These books contain fascinating stories, many with moral teaching in them to guide us along the way of le.Alas, although the bible has sold millions of copies down the ages, it often remains unread and not consulted.Just as binoculars can enrich our vision of the #starry, starry night# so we can enrich our lives by a careful exploration of the bible and discover what it can teach us, so, let#s look at it more closely and take time to enjoy what it has to offer."},{"url":null,"title":"happy monday scotlands grand reopening","story":"Ellis ButcherUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Liberal Democrats have been highlighting the shocking state of mental health services across Scotland.Right now, adults can wait up to two years for necessary treatments.Even prior to the pandemic, waiting times for these vital community services were getting worse.Earlier this year, Lib Dems in the Scottish Parliament finally persuaded the Scottish Government to declare this awful situation a national crisis.Now we need to elect more MSPs that will treat it as that.We immediately need to see a resumption of mental health First Aid training.This was suspended for the pandemic, yet physical First Aid courses were allowed to continue.During the recent budget negotiations, my party was able to secure pound million for community services and we need to see much more going towards these early help services.The impact on our families, communities and economy of failing to take this crisis seriously cannot be overstated.Under the current SNP Government, it is not just mental health services which have suffered.Nicola Sturgeon has broken her waiting times guarantee, failing , patients, meaning they have to wait longer than  weeks for vital services.The mismanagement of hospital construction has meant that the new Sick Kids building in Edinburgh has opened  years after it was promised.Now she is threatening closure of the vital Eye Pavilion, which has provided such fantastic treatment for so many across the Lothians.It appears that her Government wishes to move the service to St Johnrsquos in Livingston, making it extremely dficult for many communities across East

reflects local peoplersquos priorities too.We must do more to support our young people who have been devastated by the effects of Covid-.In East Lothian, the pupil-to-teacher ratio ranks alongside Edinburgh as the worst in Scotland.The SNP have failed to deliver on their promise of reducing class sizes and pupils are suffering restricted subject choice.Thatrsquos why the Scottish Conservatives are committed to delivering , extra teachers nationally.The SNP have made only limited progress in closing the attainment gap in our schools ndash despite saying it was their defining mission.Alongside the local Labour council administration, the SNP are failing pupils from the poorest backgrounds in East Lothian.Our countyrsquos attainment gap grew by three per cent between  and .It is unacceptable that the SNP Government have excluded local schools from receiving attainment challenge funding to address this.If elected as your MSP, I will press the case for more investment

similarly reject the Labour and Tory recent support of stockpiling even more nuclear weapons, rather than spending those billions on health, housing and education.Broken promises undermine public

help to reduce our carbon emissions.These innovative national plans will translate well to a local level, providing a framework to support East Lothianrsquos recovery.However, Irsquom very clear that our local recovery, while backed by national guidance and funding, must be designed and delivered locally, not by ministers and civil servants in Edinburgh.Over the last year, our communities have demonstrated how they can come together in times of need and look after each other.Local communities, businesses and organisations should be empowered to show the same drive and determination in recovering from Covid- that they have shown throughout the crisis.Finally, on a more personal note, I have pledged my support for several important campaigns and initiatives so far during the campaign.Among them are the Teach the Future pledge on making the climate emergency part of the curriculum the More for Scotlandrsquos Animals pledge on animal welfare the Walk, Wheel, Cycle, Vote

has been there for us ndash sometimes at great personal cost.I believe that offering our NHS staff an inflation-busting four per cent pay rise is well deserved, although I wish it could be more.South of the Border, one per cent is being imposed.This is simply an insult.There is a perception that our NHS is lsquobrokenrsquo in some way.I do not believe this, but I do see a huge organisation which now needs to re-invent itself, not for the first time, into an efficient, modern support for us all.However, our NHS is genuinely under threat.Privatisation is not just a scare word.The Transatlantic Trade Deal being negotiated with the USA leaves our NHS vulnerable and available for sale.Our SNP MPs proposed an amendment which would have ensured that our NHS remained in the public ownership.The Westminster Government rejected that safeguard.Since GP surgeries are independent contractors, not run by the NHS, they are vulnerable to being sold to the highest bidder.This is how the system was set up in .It may have made sense at the time but no longer.We must review the deal with doctors and ensure that creeping privatisation cannot take place.In Scotland, we have control over our NHS.However, the UK Government passed the Internal Markets Act, which allows UK Government ministers to arbitrarily enforce a lsquolevelling outrsquo of regulations and dferences between the nations of the UK.This would allow London to make NHS Scotland available for sale regardless of our wishes.I will fight to prevent the loss of our NHS and the best way to be sure of that is to take back control of our own affairs.Please give me an opportunity on May  to continue to serve our community and to protect our NHS.Stevie Curran IrsquoD LIKE to begin by expressing my sadness at the passing of the Duke of Edinburgh ndash a dedicated public servant.I send my condolences to Her Majesty The Queen and her family.The quality of our social care system should be a key issue at this election.The speed with which the failings of our social care system were exposed last spring was ghastly.The Covid crisis didnrsquot bring about the crisis in social care, it was already there.It simply brought it to the top of the agenda.The challenge of Covid- has made the crisis in care even more acute.The movement of people from hospital settings, without consultation and without being tested, into care homes to accommodate Covid patients was a human rights scandal.This contributed to the devastating reality of care homes becoming the epicentre of the pandemic and almost a third of deaths across the country being people from care homes.Scotlandrsquos social care workers have also been on the frontline in the fight against Covid.Their commitment, alongside all our other frontline workers, to help keep us safe during this public health emergency has been heroic.Scottish Labour has been calling for a National Care Service for some years now, a service that will include local governmentrsquos social care staff as partners in the service delivery.It will put the dignity of iniduals and the quality of services before profit.We must address the inequalities in the sector as it deals with the shortcomings highlighted in the recent Feeley Report, which I donrsquot think goes far enough.Scotland urgently needs a plan to transform social care. Scottish Labour knows that urgent reform and investment is needed and thatrsquos why we are working with the public to make our vision for a National Care Service a reality.We donrsquot want to just talk about the problems, we want a plan for how things could be better.Charles Dundas A QUESTION which I keep being asked during this campaign is what will the Scottish Liberal Democrats do for those in our communities who are struggling to make ends meet, especially those with children I know that all parties are committed to reducing child poverty, but here is what I want to do about it.Willie Rennie and the Scottish Liberal Democrats will commit to doubling the Scottish Child Payment.This is currently available at pound per week to eligible children under six.This will rise to take in under-s in the next few years and we will pay pound per week.We are also keen to listen to campaigners who want to extend the payments to include disabled children or those with disabled parents.It was Liberal Democrats who reintroduced free school meals and targeted extra money to schools who needed it most in England, and in Scotland we will extend free school meals to cover all primary school pupils all through the year, including school holidays.This will also help these children with their education since a hungry child finds it dficult to focus and learn.The Scottish Lib Dems also pledge to increase the amount of free childcare Scotland offers, increasing it to a full , hours for every two-year-old.At the moment only some twoyear-olds are eligible, and takeup of the places is very low.By expanding the scheme, wersquod hope it would be more useful to more and more working parents, helping them get back to work and all the benefits that brings to society and the economy.We will also extend the number of summer clubs on offer to eligible children to help parents on low incomes with the costs of childcare during the school holidays.Plus, our manesto pledge on fuel poverty will also help us with child poverty.Warm homes with lower heating costs undoubtedly help the families who need it most, and I think that Midlothian North and Musselburgh would benefit from more Liberal Democrat policies like these in place after the election.Iain Whyte AS PART of my campaign, I have been highlighting the need for more local policing and ato locally based crime prevention across the constituency.This should be backed by visible local police patrols in our neighbourhoods to deter and detect crime.So, it was disappointing to read news articles this week highlighting police advice to Musselburgh householders about securing their garden sheds due to a spate of breakins.The crimes seem to have been concentrated in the Stoneybank area but the advice is valuable for everyone.Police say you should make sure your shed is secure and should fit an alarmthere is anything valuable inside.The alarms can be provided free to elderly and vulnerable residents: email MusselburghWestCPT@scotland.pnn.police.ukSince Police Scotland was formed, there has been a centralisation of our policing that I want to see reversed.During that time, public awareness of police patrols fell from  to  per cent.I know from my time as chair of Lothian and Borders Police Board that locally based crime prevention had a really positive impact.Crime fell and communities felt far more connected to their local officers, who they knew were working on their priorities.Thatrsquos why I want to see beefed-up neighbourhood policing teams and theirin the parts of the constituency where they have been reduced or removed.These teams work well on a preventative agenda.They solve problem issues and work with the community sorting things like housebreaking sprees and anti-social behaviour.I also strongly support the wider Scottish Conservative campaign to introduce a Local Policing Act to boost local police patrols and increase community engagement with policing decisions.This goes alongside our plan to tackle more serious crime by introducing a Victims Law to end the SNPrsquos soft-touch justice system.This would give judges the ability to put the very worst criminals behind bars for le.It would also end automatic early release, so that criminals must earn parole.Musselburgh residents need to see a more visible, local and responsive police service.That would be my aimyou elect me as your MSP."},{"url":null,"title":"boxing-world-champion-josh-taylor-vows-visit-aidan-hogg","story":"Josh will step into the ring with Jose Ramirez for the most important

If yoursquove never tried growing tomatoes, this could be the year to have a go!Getting startedSome gardeners begin with seed but ensuring the correct temperatures for germinating tomato seeds can be tricky. We find that most people prefer to buy their tomatoes as young plants, and these are available in pots at this time of year. Buying tomatoes as young plants also gives gardeners the opportunity to mix and match dferent ieties.Therersquos a vast range of ieties to choose from, which at first may seem quite disconcerting. So start by considering the type of tomato you prefer and the space you have available to grow them.Generally speaking, tomatoes are either grown on a single, upright stemor as a bush.If itrsquos your first time growing tomatoes, it might be easier to begin with one of the bush ieties, but read on and decide for yourself!Bush tomatoesTwo of our most popular bush-type ieties are lsquoTumblerrsquo and lsquoTumbling Tom Redrsquo but seedsmen are always improving ieties so take time to read the labels on the plants in the garden centre before making your choice.Bush tomatoes tend to have a slightly weeping habit, making them well-suited to being grown in pots, window boxes or hanging baskets. They tend to be relatively compact plants with numerous sideshoots producing clusters of tomatoes.Upright tomatoesAmongst the upright ieties lsquoAlicantersquo, lsquoMoneymakerrsquo and lsquoShirleyrsquo are well tried-and-tested, producing a good crop of full size, red tomatoes.For cherry tomatoes, lsquoGardenerrsquos Delightrsquo is by far the most popular choice amongst our customers.Upright tomatoes can be grown in pots, grow-bags or directly into the ground. As the plant grows, the stem needs to be kept straight so that it can bear the weight of the tomatoes and will require support either by canes or string.To maintain the strength of the main stem, sideshoots need to be nipped out. Sideshoots are the little shoots that appear in the angle between the leaf and the main stem and, as any tomato grower will tell you, itrsquos a job that requires to be done very regularly!Other ietiesTherersquos also a wide selection of yellow, beef-steak, plum and other distinctive ieties to choose from, so take your time to read the labels and choose the ieties that will best suit you, your garden and your family.CultivationAll tomatoes like a warm, sunny location to grow. Outdoor-grown tomatoeswill have to be well-sheltered, although there still needs to be some movement of air to avoid disease.Watering needs to be consistent and regular, and tomatoes growing in pots or growbags will benefit from having a tray underneath to provide a reservoir that they can draw from between waterings. Avoid irregular watering, as it results in uneven growth and may cause the tomatoes to split.Once you see the first bunch of yellow flowers appear, thatrsquos your first tomatoes on they way! The flowers will die off and the little tomatoes will begin to form ndash thatrsquos when gardeners will happily report that ldquothe first truss has set!Once the first truss is set, yoursquoll need to provide additional feeding and this is best done in liquid form whilst watering using a specialist feed such as the well-respected lsquoTomoritersquo, for example.As the season progresses, you may decide to remove some of the older leaves to let more light in and help the fruit ripen. For tomatoes that havenrsquot ripened at the end of the season, use them in the green for chutney or bring them indoors and leave them on the windowsill to ripen.And then...If yoursquove enjoyed growing your own tomatoes and plan to do it again next year, make sure that you remove the old plants completely so that yoursquore not leaving any rotting vegetation and disease that could affect next yearrsquos tomatoes.As always, the plant team are always very happy to help with tips and advice ndash so much easier now that wersquore allowed to be open again, of course!Yoursquoll also find lots of information on our website at www.merryhatton"},{"url":null,"title":"doors-reopening-dirleton-castle-tantallon-castle","story":"Historic Environment Scotlandis preparing to open the gates to more than  ticketed sites, including Tantallon Castle, near North Berwick, and Dirleton Castle, across the country this month.The historic sites will open on April  following the Scottish Governmentrsquos proposed dates for the reopening of the tourism sector and mainland Scotland moving to Covid protection level three.New technology is also being implemented as part of HESrsquos new visitor offering.Visitors will be able to explore the stories of many of the sites in innovative ways through downloadable maps, family trails, quizzes and quests, music, poetry and personal accounts to tell stories throughout the centuries, videos exploring Gaelic culture and words, and digital fly-throughs to areas usually restricted to visitors.Visitors will be able to enjoy access to the historic outdoor spaces at both sites, as well as the Doocot, Gazebo, Hallyburton Range and first floor of the Ruthven Range at Dirleton Castle.All visitors, including members, will be required to pre-book tickets online and to use contactless payment where possible one-way systems will be implemented in some locations visitors must wear face coverings in any indoor enclosed spaces, including retail and catering areas and visitor numbers will be limited for safety reasons.Alex Paterson, chief executive of HES, said: ldquoWe know how keen our members and visitors are to get back to our sites, so wersquore delighted to reopen over  per cent of our properties on April .ldquoScotlandrsquos heritage sector is a key part of our tourism offer ndash from providing jobs to increasing our wellbeing ndash and, in addition to reopening the sites that reopened last year, we will also reopen further sites on a phased basis over the upcoming months.Tantallon Castle will open daily, am-pm, from April , while Dirleton Castle will open on the same date and from then on will be open Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays between the same times.For more information, go to restarthistory.scot"},{"url":null,"title":"in-pictures-prince-philips-visits-east-lothian","story":"On Friday, Buckingham Palace confirmed the news of his death, mere months before his th birthday, saying that he passed away peacefully last Friday morning at Windsor Castle.Since then people across the world have been sharing their condolences and been paying tribute to the late Duke, including here in East Lothian.Over the years the Duke of Edinburgh has visited East Lothian on several occasions, both solo and with the Queen, to whom he was married to for more than  years.From Haddington and North Berwick to Musselburgh and the opening of Yellowcraig Caravan Park in , he has visited several parts of the county over his  years.One of his first visits is believed to be in  with the then Princess Elizabeth, a year before her coronation.Over the years he re-visited the county on several occasions.Another was  when he inspected the British Legion parade in North Berwick, he also opened Yellowcraig Caravan park in .He has also visited Haddington on numerous occasions, in ,  and .Prince Philiprsquos last public visit is believed to be with the Queen, who was  years old at the time, to Musselburgh Racecourse in , when the couple helped it celebrate its th birthday.

the site where legend tells he was killed by a giant.Then, at Finnrsquos request, they walked to nearby Finlarig Castle.Izzy had always felt the castle had a sombre atmosphere, and so it did, even on this sun-drenched afternoon.Maybe itrsquos because it is quietly hidden away from the tourist trail, its unstable ruins concealed by old trees.Normally a tranquil place feels magical, but the grim deeds said to have been committed here darken the feelings.Izzy had already told Finn of the castle and he wanted to see the beheading pit and hanging tree.It was another built by the Campbell chief lsquoBlack Duncan of the castlesrsquo at the beginning of the s ndash such a ruthless man, andaccounts of him were true, very cruel even for his time.At Finlarig, it is said, he enacted his lsquojusticersquo, in particular against the MacGregors, whose land he had taken and whom he hunted mercilessly.Finn stood in the pit where, according to tradition, noble victims were executed.Their Campbell persecutors could watch and gloat from a window above in the tower.Nearby was the hanging tree, where people of lesser status were said to have met their end.Finn found the overgrown steps that led to the summit of the small hill on which the tree grew.They stood on the spot where so many condemned men would have had their last view of this world.ldquoYoursquore right, aunty, this place does have a bit of a gothic atmosphere, especially when you know that so many people were hanged on the branches of this tree.Izzy nodded: ldquoBut remember, Finn, eventhis is the original hanging tree, then it is innocent, she said as they stood under its boughs.ldquoThe poor thing was used to commit terrible crimes, she put her hand on its trunk, ldquobut it wasnrsquot the treersquos fault.Finn wasnrsquot sureshe was joking itrsquos just a tree, how could it be blamed He put it down to his auntrsquos love of nature.She often spoke asplants and animals were like people.Finn looked around.ldquoCan you tell me a story about this place  he asked.Izzy thought for a moment, then agreed.They sat on a stone by an old holly tree in the sunshine and Izzy told two stories.First, the tale of a wedding at the castle interrupted by MacDonalds lting cattle.Then she told the tale of Marion Campbell, a daughter of a powerful Campbell chief.She had been promised to a man she didnrsquot love, but instead she eloped with Gregor Roy MacGregor, the chief of the MacGregors.ldquoThe sad thing is, explained Izzy, ldquothat beforehand the MacGregors and Campbells had been close allies for many generations, but then a feud over land and power developed.So Gregor Roy was forced into the hills as an outlaw, and Marion willingly joined him, marrying him against her fatherrsquos wishes.ldquoDespite their tough le, said Izzy, ldquothey deeply loved each other.Finn was fascinated as Izzy told Finn stories of their adventures of how they lived in the wilds, living in secret hideouts, hunted by the warriors of Marionrsquos father.She told the tale of how Gregor once escaped his pursuers by leaping over a river and how Marion gave birth to their first son in a cave.ldquoThey wrought vengeance on the Campbells, lting their cattle, said Izzy, ldquobut eventually they were found and Gregor was beheaded by a Campbell chief called Grey Colin in .ldquoIn the beheading pit  asked Finn.ldquoNo, not here, said Izzy, ldquobut at another castle at the east end of Loch Tay.\"Some accounts say poor Marion was forced to watch, and afterwards she composed a beautul lament, which is a sad song.\"She wrote it for her son, to explain to him what had happened to his father.Izzy recited a verse she could remember: ldquoEven in snow and blizzards, And days with all the seasons, Gregor would find a hollow for me, In which we would sleep cosily.ldquoWow, what a story. What happened to her after  asked Finn.Izzy shook her head: ldquoNobody knows, she disappears from history, but her son Alistair later avenged his fatherrsquos death and so the feuding continued, which explains the grim deeds at this castle.ldquoMaybe her son protected her after and hid her to keep her safe, wondered Finn.ldquoThatrsquos a nice thought, maybe.Finn stood up and walked around.ldquoIt would be betterfolks could just get on, donrsquot you think! he announced.ldquoAgreed! said Izzy.They walked back to the village.They had a much-needed wash with hot water and Finn called his mum.After a while, he poked his head out of the phone box: ldquoMum wants to talk to you.Izzy knew how dficult this time was for her sister, being separated from her son overnight for the first time in four years.But Izzy was trusted by her and Finnrsquos attachment to his aunt was very strong and made him feel safe.He was obviously missing his mother, but he seemed to be enjoying the journey and his moods had been better, so it was decided the journey could continue.ldquoRemember, mumrsquos back from Spain on Monday eve.ldquoI know, smiled Izzy, ldquowe will be there to meet her, I promise.After the call, they did some shopping and made a quick visit to the Folk Museum, which was housed in the old mill by the side of the river.Izzy wanted to show Finn St Fillanrsquos Stones, which were on display there ndash a tale to tell later when they went for a swim in his pool.As they walked back onto the bridge, Izzy had a surprise.She unlocked the gate which led to the old MacNab burial ground, where chiefs of the clan lie in a walled enclosure, their clan folk in the surrounding ground.ldquoItrsquos actually an island in the middle of the river, explained Izzy.ldquoIts name means yellow island. It was a prehistoric fort before it was a burial ground.Finn nodded as he walked round the edge, looking through the trees down at the river as it roared, then calmed its way to Loch Tay.Izzy spotted a carving of the MacNab crest, with an image of the head of a MacNeish chief, a reminder of a famous incident in the clanrsquos history.ldquoIrsquom getting hungry, aunty, said Finn.She had a plan for tea.They would eat within the ruins of Rob Royrsquos house at Auchinchisallen in Glen Dochart.It was a -minute drive west of Killin.They parked at a small layby just past the small bridge that took the busy traffic over the burn called Allt Coire Chaorach.ldquoThat there  asked Finn, pointing at the ruins.ldquoLooks like mostly a pile of stones with a chimney.ldquoItrsquos called Rob Royrsquos house, letrsquos have our tea there, said Izzy.ldquoReally, it was his house  How do we get to it It was a good question.Once they got over the gate, they followed a narrow bracken-covered path.They got scratched as they scrambled up a steep slope, but suddenly they were on the top and the ruined house was in front of them.They were only a short distance from the road, but it felt like a dferent world.Finn stood on a large stone that once formed part of the foundations and looked up at the one gable end that was still standing.No, it wasnrsquot just a pile of stones, he thought, he could see it had been a house.Finn scanned the landscape around him.Occasional traffic could be heard not far below, but the road seemed engulfed and made insignicant by the mountains and hills that dominated the view.A herd of highland cattle were grazing nearby.ldquoLook, look! We have our own Highland cows! Finn called to his aunt.ldquoPerfect, she said as she her puffed her way to the house.Finn jumped from the stone down to his aunt.ldquoSorry, let me help, he said.ldquoLetrsquos get set up said Izzy, laying the heavy rucksack down.Finn went for a closer look at the cattle while Izzy found a safe place to sit within the ruins.She got out the camping stove and began to cook.Finn joined her and they stared at the pasta as it twirled in the boiling water.The cows came to watch, standing in a row, tails twitching with a fascinated look on their faces.ldquoYoursquore right in what you said, aunty, remarked Finn between mouthfuls of pasta.Izzy curled her eyebrows not sure what he was referring to.ldquoFood tastes much better when itrsquos cooked outside, in a place like this, he explained with a big sauce-covered grin.The sun was now lowering in the sky and Izzy could feel the air finally cooling.The huge presence of Ben More was casting shadows in the glen.She took out her small fire dish, screwed on its legs and placed it carefully within the ruins, away from any vegetation.Finn suggested moving some stones to make more comfortable seats.ldquoWe are guests here, said Izzy, ldquowe are sitting amongst old ruins, and we must leave them exactly as we found them. Even our wee fire must leave no trace. There used to be a sign here telling people about this place, but people just didnrsquot respect it, theyrsquod damaged it or trash it, so the sign was taken away. We know better, so we are welcome guests.Finn nodded. He initially felt upbraided, but his aunt gave him a kind smile which changed the meaning of her words.Instead of feeling scolded, he felt a strange sense of privilege that hersquod been taught something important.ldquoThink how long this house has been here, said Izzy, who looked up at the gable end with the chimney.ldquoThat standing wall was added later, but it is said Rob built the original house here in . It was a time when he was a hunted outlaw. This was Campbell country when he lived here, but he was under the protection of a Campbell chief, how ironic was that  Robrsquos mother had been a Campbell, and yoursquove seen how MacGregors could be both enemies and family with Campbells.She pointed at the base of the ruins: ldquoThose stones are the foundations of the old walls. Now close your eyes for a moment, Finn. Imagine we are in the house in Robrsquos time. There are no windows, a thatched roof above us and a peat fire is in the middle, with a smoky heat filling the room. Now open your eyes, can you see the house as it used to be Finn opened his eyes and looked around.ldquoYes, I think so.ldquoCan you smell the peat smoke in your imagination ldquoI donrsquot know what it smells like aunty.ldquoItrsquos a sweet smoke.ldquoI smell it now.ldquoNow look up, can you see how the soot from the fire has made the rafters of the roof all black ldquoYeah, itrsquos all sooty.ldquoWe are sitting in the very place of the story, said Izzy. ldquoRight where you are, sat Rob Roy himself.ldquoNo aunty, hersquos next to me, otherwise hersquoll be on my knee, joked Finn.ldquoAll right then, of course, hersquos next to you, chuckled his aunt. She pointed to the small fire crackling in the fire dish.ldquoHersquos looking into the peat fire, thinking about his we and children.

The good news though is that itrsquos very much less likely that you will get covidyoursquore vaccinated, compared to someone who isnrsquot.Even better, in the unlikely event that you do catch Covid after being vaccinated, you are much less likely to get severe symptoms or be hospitalised thanyou had not been vaccinated.The clinical trials for the Pfizer vaccine reported a % efficacy, which means that the number of people who showed symptoms of covid during the time of the trial was % lower in the vaccinated group than in a comparison group who were not vaccinated.Data collected since the trials, as the vaccines have begun to be used widely, has confirmed these numbers, so the vaccines are very effective on a population scale. On a inidual scale, though, there is still a chance that you might be one of the very few people who is vaccinated and still gets infected it is possible, just very much less likely than without a vaccine.One extra point to add here is that the vaccines take time to work.The vaccine is not a instant shot of protection it is a way to train your immune system, so that your immune system will then protect you. It takes - weeks or so for the immune system to respond so, evenyou are someone who has a superb immune response to the vaccine, you are still not protected until - weeks after the jag.Some cases of people being infected with covid after the vaccination are because they were exposed to the virus during this - week window. Be especially cautious during this time.Just as the vaccines make it much less likely that yoursquoll get infected, they also make it much less likely that you will be able to infect others ndash but in both cases the answer is that the chances are much reduced, but not zero.We donrsquot fully understand why some people are fully protected and others are not it might be that you have a slightly quirky immune system, or are immunosuppressed it might be that you are exposed to an unusually high dose of the virus.It might be something in your genes or environment that makes you a particularly good target for the virus.When the first trials were conducted to test how well the vaccines work, the data that was collected measured the number of people who showed symptoms of disease. This number was reduced % in the Pfizer trial.The trials did not attempt to measure whether vaccinated people could still be infectious. We have some really encouraging data now, collected after the trials from countries where vaccines have been used widely, showing that vaccination does also reduce transmission ndash meaning that vaccinated people are less likely to infect others than people who are not vaccinated.This is what we expected and hoped for, and itrsquos really good to see. This is why being vaccinated not only protects ourselves, but also others.Viruses cannot live for long periods on their own they need a person to provide a home.If you are successfully vaccinated, then your body is trained to refuse entry to the virus, denying it that home.When only a few people are vaccinated, the virus can fairly easily find another person, another home to occupy. When very many people are vaccinated, finding a home becomes much more of a challenge, and the virus is condemned to a lonely death outside.The idea of working together by using our immune systems to reduce the number of opportunities that the virus has to gain a foothold and spread is whatrsquos called ldquoherd immunity.Even the rare people in whom the vaccine didnrsquot work very well can be protected this way, as other peoplersquos vaccinations mean that they too are less likely to encounter the virus.No. The importance of a face mask is that it is a barrier to stop you infecting other people.We still need to be cautious to avoid infection, and to avoid infecting others, until the amount of virus circulating in our communities falls.The Covid vaccines are one part of our toolkit for reducing the amount of virus circulating. They make it less likely yoursquoll get infected, less likely yoursquoll get sick, and less likely yoursquoll breathe out the virus and spread it to others.But there is still a small chance that each of these steps can happen, and so facemasks, space and distance are all still needed just now.The gradual easing of restrictions that is beginning just now is possible because wersquove successfully driven case numbers down, in part through the vaccination programme.If we can keep this up, then we will get to a point when case numbers are low enough that restrictions will ease yet further, and facemasks might then become optional in more places.We are optimistic that immunity will last ndash but not yet certain.The first people to receive the Covid vaccines were only vaccinated  months ago, so we know that vaccines can generate immunity that lasts at least  months.We know that the majority of people who have been infected with the SARS-CoV virus, that causes Covid, also have persistent immune cells and good antibody levels, even a year after infection.There was a lot of fear that immunity would not last, and there are been some prominent cases where people have been shown to be infected twice ndash so in those particualr people, immunity was either not persistent or not ever good enough.But for the majority of people, infection has led to persistent immunity, so far.Another piece of encouraging news is that particular immune cells, essential for protection, were still detectable last year in people who were infected in  with SARS, which was a severe infection caused by a similar coronavirus to the one that causes Covid.So we are optimistic, but will only know for certain when more time has passed.Another twist here, is whether immunity generated by having one of the current vaccines will be effective against any virus iants: lasting immunity might not be useful,the virus mutates and can escape that immunity. But there are grounds for optimism here toohellip... There are two situations in which a booster might be useful.The first one isimmunity doesnrsquot last long enough without a booster, and in that case a third jag is definitely a possible solution.The second one isthe virus mutates or ies, and we need to update our vaccines to match the new iants. The coronavirus that causes Covid is one that is known to mutate ndash thatrsquos a normal part of its biology.The flu virus is another example of a virus that we know mutates, and thatrsquos why flu vaccines are updated and given every year.But the Covid vaccines have held up well so far: the vaccines currently being used in the UK were designed against the original version of the virus, but have done very well in reducing disease and blocking transmission of the B.. Kent iant, for example.The immune response generated by the vaccines is strong, and evenit is two fold less effective against a new iant, there is a good chance the remaining immune response will still be enough to prevent severe disease and slow the spread of the virus.Another piece of good news is the way that these new vaccines have been designed makes it a relatively simple process to update them,new iants make that necessary.If we do need boosters, that too should be achievable.The gradual easing of restrictions that have begun now reflects the success of our collective ability to reduce the amount of virus circulating, and getting people fully vaccinated is a large part of this success.I hope that this gradual process will continue as the vaccination programme is completed, and more normality will be achieved in each step.That said, we are still a long way away from everyone having both doses, as we need vaccinations to be completed globally before any inidual country can fully relax.Within the UK, the vaccination programme is currently planned for all adults, but vaccines for teenagers and younger children are only in the stage of clinical trials.Globally, some restrictions on international travel might need to persist until global vaccination rates increase, and those gobal vaccination rates depend on politics and cooperation between nations.Another aspect to this question is what normal really means.The pandemic hit us hard and for people whorsquove been bereaved, who have persistent symptoms or Long Covid, or whose jobs and livelihoods have been affected, normal wonrsquot ever be as it was.And as communities, there are also changes both good and bad.Will hand sanitiser provision in supermarkets continue  Will working from home always be more possible  Will high streets rejuvenate  There are opportunities for change here,we want to grasp them but there may also need to be time to heal and recover."},{"url":null,"title":"boxing-champion-josh-taylor-speaks-preston-lodge-pupils","story":"Josh spoke online to a number of pupils from Preston Lodge High School about their achievements and

On land, solid placemarkers will map the trail, carved in reclaimed red Arran sandstone, the lettering on each slab designed both to pay tribute to ancient Arran waymarkers and echo the work of the concrete poet and artist Ian Hamilton Finlay, who was ldquoa big presence in Corrie, as Ruth Impey, project manager of the Arts Heritage Trail, puts it. The locations were chosen in collaboration with islanders.Itrsquos a hugely ied roster of artists, as erse as the landscapes of the island itself. There is John Muir Wood, an early pioneer of photography in Scotland who made hundreds of images of Arranrsquos mountainous landscape. There is Alasdair Gray, who spent holidays at Pirnmill as a child and wrote the first story of his debut collection on the island. His marker is placed on the tourist trail up Goatfell, from where he painted his view, Bay.There is the eminent Victorian landscape painter Horatio McCulloch, whose aim was ldquoto paint the silence of the Highland wilderness where the wild deer roam ndash he obviously hadnrsquot been there during the rut ndash a putative silence which, of course, was occasioned by the Clearances.William McTaggartrsquos June Day, Arran , showed young children clambering over an ancient stone, again at Machrie. The th century brought the Corrie Summer School, the brainchild of Jessie M King and her husband EA Taylor, artists based in Paris who, from the summer of  to , attracted wider European artists and locals, including Charles Rennie Mackintosh, to stay with islanders all over Arran for their hugely successful art summer school in High Corrie. The Colourist Samuel Peploe, a friend of King, also painted here.But of all the painters, it is Eardley who is the best known modern artist associated with Arran. The pioneering mid-th painter spent the summers of her formative student years in Corrie, where she painted the shore in all weathers. If artists previously had frequently been inspired by the dramatically changeable weather on Arran, Eardley painted in it, the weather frequently marking her paintings, as was to be seen to mature effect in her later works at Catterline in Aberdeenshire.ldquoThe picture I painted yesterday was of a fir tree in the castle wood from the shore part of the Brodick road, she wrote from Corrie in  to her friend and fellow painter Margot Sandeman, with whom she often shared a but and ben named the Tabernacle in the village.ldquoI tried hard to finish it ndash but I havenrsquot, quite.

So I erected a little tent over my canvas with my mac and your bike and some pieces of ropehellip it must have looked pretty funny to the people from the roadhellip today it is raining, too, only this time there is a hurricane as well, and I donrsquot think the little tent would stay up.Pretty funny it perhaps was, or at least unusual, in the minds of some of the locals, including one five-year-old who still remembers seeing Eardley ldquopainting by the old port in Corrie, wearing oversized dungarees. She had her canvas and paints with her. He offered her his pocket money ldquobecause he thought she must be destitute! says Impey, who says theyrsquore hoping to collect many more local stories for the trail. A publication, with details of all the artists and locations, is nearing approval for the launch, although the database of artists is ever-expanding, testament to the inspirational lure of ldquoScotland in miniature.ldquoI think wersquove just scratched the surface, says Impey. ldquoEvery time we put a full stop on the database, we find another artist influenced by Arran.

However, he subsumed this Republican thought beneath personal sympathy for the Queen and her family.:Coronavirus: From Indias double mutant to vaccine hesitancy and the supply slowdownNicola Sturgeon sounded a genuine, personal note as she evinced admiration for the wit and intellect of the Duke, whom she met frequently at Balmoral and where. They shared, she disclosed, an intense interest in books.But her general theme was, again, one of continuity. The Dukersquos role as a constant companion to the Queen, the cherry trees they planted in the grounds of Canongate Kirk, which she hoped would thrive and bloom for many years.Of all the sundry institutions which comprise the UK State, it has long struck me that the Palace gets devolution best. Perhaps alongside the Foreign and Commonwealth Office which, as one mandarin once told me with a wry grin, is well used to dealing with troublesome colonies.The Palace appreciates the need to work with the UKrsquos devolved apparatus. For example, the Sovereign regularly travels to her palace of Holyroodhouse to welcome new First Ministers from over the road, rather than obliging them to sojourn to London.While representing continuity, the Palace is adaptable. Within limits, it moves with the times, often cajoled down the decades by the Duke of Edinburgh. The Queenrsquos own speeches to the Scottish Parliament constantly endorse devolved governance.However, the Queen has also been known, very occasionally, to express disquiet at potential constitutional change.In , as Scottish devolution was under active discourse, the Sovereign said she could readily understand such aspirations but could not forget that she was ldquocrowned Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.More recently, in , days before the independence referendum, the Queen was also in contemplative mood, perhaps prompted by advisers. Asked about the ballot by a by-stander outside Crathie Kirk, she said that she hoped people would think very carefully about the future.Nicola Sturgeon thoroughly understands this nuanced approach by the wary Palace to the malleable UK constitution.She studiously avoids placing any question marks against the Regal Union of . She is not about to pick a fight, arm wrestling or otherwise, with the Monarchy.However, she does maintain a standing challenge to the Parliamentary Union of . She does want, in the word of the moment, to affect transformational change there.Yet she also understands that, right now, the people of Scotland remain deeply, deeply apprehensive and unsure about their future.:Kevin McKenna: Recover from the virus and a referendum  We can do bothThey contemplate the pandemic, this hideous plague, and they fret. They also cast their minds back to the banking crisis of , from which we have yet to recover. They consider too the disruption of Brexit, which may or may not resolve itself.Folk need reassurance. Which is precisely what Nicola Sturgeon was attempting to offer this week, most notably with regard to indyref but also in her policies on income tax.Ms Sturgeon declared that tackling Covid must come first, with indyref on hold until the middle of the new Parliament. She opts for popular pragmatism. She calculates that there is little to be gained from evoking the spirit of William Wallace, or even Robert the Bruce.Once more, it is easy to understand why this might exasperate the most eager adherents of the independence cause. Incidentally, it also irks the Conservatives who yearn for constitutional wrestling arms, feet, whatever.This week, also, there was some passing interest in a poll which suggested that fewer than one in five of the Scottish population ranked independence as among the most important issues at this election.That did not surprise me. Constitutional questions, even independence, are generally second order matters, unless a population is actively experiencing oppression, either physical or spiritual.By ldquosecond order, I do not remotely intend to say that such matters are unimportant. Merely that they are dferent, that they are regarded by the people as conduits towards the issues which dominate their thoughts, such as employment, health and security.That is the error the Tories previously made when they used to say that devolution was never raised on the doorsteps. They needed to ask a second question: how best might you address the concerns you have raised Nicola Sturgeon gets that distinction. She understands the yearning for stability in a time of turmoil. That is why her offer, for the most enthusiastic fans of independence, is Paradise Deferred.Our columns are s for writers to express their opinions.They do not necessarily represent the views of The Herald"},{"url":null,"title":"election-2021-lobbygate-independence-better-uks-pirate-republic","story":"Mr Winton, now sadly departed, was the flamboyant presenter of Supermarket Sweep, one of the most subversive shows in Britainrsquos formidable daytime television canon.

After all their friends and colleagues who helped themselves to multi-million PPE contracts seem not to have encountered any backlash in the polls.Labour politicians in the Tony Blair era were slightly more circumspect in the process of capitalising on their time in office. Blair himself built a massive property portfolio while pimping himself out as a sort of international, travelling peace salesman. In office, Blair committed British troops to seven wars, all of which provided him with ample opportunity to make the connections in the Arab world that would provide a few extra zeroes in his pension.

Wersquore schmucks letting them get away with it. For proof of our collective schmuckhood, we once again, for the umpteenth time, find ourselves in the middle of a lobbying scandal: this time the Greensill affair.Itrsquos a vile swamp. Former Prime Minister David Cameron became an adviser for the finance firm Greensill after he left office. He was reportedly given share options worth tens of millions. Cameron contacted ministers, included chancellor Rishi Sunak, trying to get Greensill the largest possible allocation of government-backed loans under the Covid corporate financing facility. Cameron also took company boss Lex Greensill to private drinks with health secretary Matt Hancock. Lex Greensill previously had a role as lsquosenior advisorrsquo to Cameron when he was PM ndash a role in which Greensill was reportedly allowed to pitch financial projects across Whitehall.: Democracy in dangerThe scandal has thrown up all sorts of unpleasant truths, including the fact that civil servants are allowed to work for private industry while in office. Bill Crothers, former head of Whitehall procurement, became an adviser to Greensill while still employed by the civil service. John Manzoni, chief executive of the civil service, was allowed to keep a poundk a year job as a non-executive director of the company SABMiller.The stink isnrsquot confined to Westminster. Fergus Ewing, SNP rural economy secretary, had an unrecorded dinner with Lex Greensill, and steel billionaire Sanjeev Gupta. Wersquore told there were no officials with Ewing, no notes were taken. The government claims to have no emails, texts or phone records about happened. Deals struck between the SNP government, Gupta and Greensill exposed taxpayers to hundreds of millions of pounds of debt after Greensill collapsed. The ministerial code states that officials should be present for any discussions relating to government business, with facts recorded. Nicola Sturgeon claimsthat dinners which Fergus Ewing attended are ldquovery dferent from David Cameronrsquos antics and the SNP said that \"attempts to make mischief around this issue are utterly baseless.Inevitably, therersquos going to be a Greensill inquiry ndash there always is when one of these scandals erupts. But donrsquot expect anything to change. It never does. After all,wersquod learned anything from previous scandals, Greensill wouldnrsquot have happened. Nigel Boardman, appointed by Boris Johnson to run the inquiry, is on the board of a private bank with close ties to the Tory party and a number of former civil servants in its ranks.We can, however, nip all this in the bud immediately, and end the scandal of political lobbying once and for all. The one simple way to stop this gross exploitation of the public is to ban anyone whorsquos ever held political office from lobbying on behalf of business interests for le. Soyoursquove served one single day as an elected representative, yoursquore barred from lobbying your former colleagues on behalf of any corporate interest. No more Sir Nick Clegg working as Facebookrsquos lobbyist, for instance. We could go as far as banning politicians from all lobbying, but some has decent intent. It would be draconian to prevent lobbying for a charity, for instance ndash as long as that lobbying is done openly and without profit.: Where is the vision Therersquos some other changes we also need to clean up public le. The definition of what lobbying is needs to be claried in Scotland to ensure that all forms of communication are covered, and that politicians canrsquot wriggle out of scrutiny by playing semantics around what a lsquomeetingrsquo actually means. At the moment thatrsquos not clear, and lobbyists have been exploiting loopholes which require only lsquovisual interactionsrsquo to be registered. Phone calls and emails donrsquot have to be registered. Lobbying rules should also extend to civil servants ndash theyrsquore not covered by the register.So is change likely  The omens donrsquot look good. The SNP has a host of former big wigs working as lobbyists so I wouldnrsquot set any store in the party suddenly finding its moral conscience. The Tories basically invented the revolving door between lobbying and public le. When it comes to Labour, the MSP who led the charge in Holyrood against lobbying scandals, Neil Findlay, appeared to court companies to hire him as a lobbyist in advance of him standing down at this election.However, change is down to us. If we donrsquot order the politicians ndash whose salaries we pay ndash to legislate for the public standards we expect, then wersquoll have nobody to blame but ourselves when the next Greensill scandal inevitably happens.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

In fact, the Norwegian government wanted to join the EU but that was rejected in a referendum.One big plus of being in the EU is full representation in the European Parliament, Council and Commission plus a vote and say in decisions on the myriad of laws that underpin the EU internal market. Consultation processes within the EEA are much weaker.In , a Norwegian review of its EEA membership concluded, in the words of its chairman, professor Fredrik Sejersted, that there was a ldquogreat democratic deficit... but this is a kind of national compromise since Norway decided it did not want to join the EU\".Scotlandrsquos lsquoremainrsquo vote in  does not suggest it would choose such a democratic deficit.Mr Salmond argues that joining the EEA could be quicker and that Scotland could,it wanted, join the EU later. But the key determinant of speed of rejoining the EU would be Scotlandrsquos ergence from EU laws in the meantime. And that would impact on the speed of joining the EEA too. Nor could formal talks start until Scotland was independent.Certainly, there will need to be transition arrangements into the EU or EEA. But EU accession candidates normally agree a tailored Association Agreement the EEA is not a transition route. To join the EU, Scotland would need to clary its position on currency and be ready to move to its own currency after a few years. But that is entirely feasible.Being in the EEA or EU raises considerable issues on borders. There would be a major regulatory border with England and Walesin both set-ups. But in the EEA, there would also be a customs border with the EU, meaning no open border in either direction. In the EU, Scotland would face a hard customs and regulatory border to England but an open border to the EU.Mr Salmond suggests an independent Scotland could form a customs union with the UK nations.

But the EU-UK trade deal has surely put paid to the idea that the EU would simply allow an independent Scotland into the EEA without a separate and good deal on access to fishing waters.In the end, an internationally recognised, independent Scotland could apply to join the EU or the EEA. But in the EEA it would have little say over the huge range of EU internal market laws. And being in a customs union with the UK would mean following its trade policy. It would be a rather pale form of independence for little obvious gain.Kirsty Hughes is director of the Scottish Centre on European Relationswww.scer.scot"},{"url":null,"title":"luther-vandross-google-doodle-honours-late-singer-70th-birthday","story":"The New York-born singer was born in the Bronx in  on April  and rose to fame through his writing and performance skills.The -time Grammy nominee Vandrossco-wrote David Bowies Fascination as well as Everybody Rejoice for the  Broadway musical The Wiz, before launching a solo career in .The Google Doodle today is inspired by the debut solo album from Vandross, Never Too Much, whichreached No.  on the RB charts and was the first of  studio albums that went either platinum or multiplatinum.He also performed the half-time show at the  Super Bowl.Vandross suffered from diabetes and hypertension and had a severe stroke in  that left him in a wheelchair.

Its phenomenal success ndash . million tuned in for the opening episode of this series, not to mention the many whorsquoll watch again on iPlayer just to get to grips with some of those inpenetrabilities ndash reflects this.In an age when Black actors have sometimes been cast simply to tick a box or to mention in a producerrsquos annual appraisal, the scene between actors Martin Compston, Shalom Brune-Franklin and Adrian Dunbar in which it was revealed that institutional racism had played a part in a case they were examining, was trail blazing.They discussed a case where a young Black architect, Lawrence Christopher, had been attacked by a gang of white youths with a history of racial violence and taken into custody where he was mocked by police officers as he died from his injuries.The character Steve Arnott, played by Compston, turned to his Black colleague and said he was sorry she had ldquoto dredge all that up and askedshe was okay.She replied with a barely perceptible hint of pain in her voice: ldquoCustody officers were laughing and making monkey noises while Christopher lay dying. They were all cleared of misconduct, took early retirement for stresshellipand claimed tens of thousands of pounds in compensationhellip How could anyone be okay I choked on the power of this scene. DC Chloe Bishop for five episodes has played the almost emotionless foil for some of Steve Arnottrsquos hypothesesand suddenly out of nowhere we are reminded of her humanness and her blackness and her experience and her strength at having to deal with this case.At last here was a recognition that Black characters could be written to reflect the universal themes and stories that affect us all but that they also have experiences that only they can uniquely reflect or react to. Add to this the fact that Mercurio has based the storyline on the real le events around the murder of Stephen Lawrence by a gang of white youths in , and the death in police custody of Falklands veteran Christopher Alder in , and itrsquos clear that authenticity is at the heart of this episode.And authenticity is one of the great aims of ersity. Yes, ersity is also about fairness, representation, and inclusivity but for audiences and TV executives alike ersity brings new stories and crucially, dferent ways of telling stories.As someone who has worked in television for  years and counting, and been through countless  dawns where it felt like progress on representation was being made after a series of short-term initiatives only to be told an idea was ldquotoo niche or there ldquowasnrsquot enough Black or Asian talent out there, I am convinced that we have now crossed some sort of Rubicon.After last yearrsquos Black Lives Matter protests, UK broadcasters were swt to act. ITV launched an advertising campaign in support of the dance act Diversityrsquos Black Lives Matter-themed performance on Britainrsquos Got Talent. The performance had received , complaints to Ofcom for being ldquotoo political. ITVrsquos full-page ads in every newspaper featured a still from the performance which read: ldquoWe are changed by what we see. Just as we are changed when we are seen. Ofcom rejected the complaints.The BBC has earmarked pound million of its existing budget towards inclusive and erse content over the next three years. The money is available to those creating erse content, erse production leadership and erse-lead production companies. The definition of erse is Black or minority ethnic, disabled and those from lower-income backgrounds. The BBC is also asking all producers they work with to ensure % of their workforce are from under-represented groups.This is a mammoth but top-down effort that will bring rewards for all ndash for the audience with their ever increasing appetite for content, for the TV industry as a whole, but most of all I think, for those in under-represented groups who never imagined a career in film or TV was for them ndash the door is open.When I think of under-represented groups I think of the many schools I visited as a BBC education producer in the s all over Scotland but particularly in places like Castlemilk and Govanhill where few young people would have thought about a career working in film or television because it didnrsquot feel like the kind of environment for them. Thatrsquos the bit of all the high level strategies that really gets me excited and keeps me focussed on the importance of inclusion.The hope is to make the system ndash the broadcasting and content creation system ndash institutionally inclusive where every part of the system is interdependent on another part and all parts are pushing in the one direction towards genuine inclusivity. Once thatrsquos done we can do away with quotas and ring-fencing and initiatives and schemes and just get on with making the most creative content we can from a myriad of dferent voices."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12525532.jpg?type=article-full","title":"scot-launches-petition-make-vimto-vegan-again-recipe-change","story":"Many vegans have voiced their frustrations at the recipe change, which has altered the popular Vimto squash drink in a move that has been slammed as \"regressive and unnecessary\".Now, apetition has been launched by Scottish mental health nurse Ian Anderson to protest the recipe change.Mr Anderson, from Lochgilphead in Argyll, wrote on the petitions page: \"Vimto is a delicious fruit drink which was until recently - suitable for vegans.\"The recipe has now been altered to include an animal based Vitamin D ingredient.\"We the undersigned feel that this is a regressive and unnecessary decision when an increasing amount of people are becoming vegan and eating plant-based diets to oppose the abuse, exploitation, and killing of animals.\"Mr Anderson, , added: \"There is no reason why Vimto needs to contain animal products.\"Wecall on Nichols plc to either reverse this decision or to use a plant based Vitamin D such as Vitamin D. #MakeVimtoVeganAgain\"Vimtos website reads: ldquoAll of our Vimto squash drinks are suitable for Vegetarians, due to the recent addition of Vitamin D they are not suitable for Vegans.ldquoHowever, all of our other Vimto drinks iants, including fizzy and still ready to drink ranges, do not contain any animal products and as such, are suitable for vegetarians and Vegans."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeons-scotland-lockdown-update-7-things-need-know","story":"Speaking during the briefing today, the First Minister was able to confirm that easing of restrictions onApril  will be going ahead and all areas in mainland Scotland will move to level .This means that bars, restaurants, retail shops and beauty salons can reopen on Monday.She also outlined the easing of restrictions for travel around the UK and discussed international travel.Here, we outline the key points from her briefing.# Watch live: First Minister Nicola Sturgeon gives an update on #coronavirus #COVID# restrictions.Joining the First Minister is Chief Medical Office Dr Gregor Smith and National Clinical Director Jason Leitch. https:t.co nDsOhVTSpeaking of Scotlands lockdown exit strategy, Nicola Sturgeon said: \"Taking all of the recent data into account, I am pleased to be able to confirm today that from Monday  April, those parts of the country that are currently in level  will move to level .\"That of course includes all of mainland Scotland.\"We then expect that all of Scotland will move to level  on Monday  May.\"That means, for example, that from  May, people will be able to meet in small numbers in each otherrsquos homes, hospitality will reopen more fully, and outdoor contact sport for adults will resume.\"Then,circumstances permit, I can confirm that we will move to level  on Monday  June, before moving I hope to level  in late June ndash and then to something much more like normality over the course of the summer.\"Hospitality venues like cafes, pubs and restaurants can open until pm indoors, but without alcohol, and pm outdoors where alcohol is allowed to be consumed.Up to four people from two households can socialise indoors in a public place, such as a cafe or restaurant.All shops, stores and close contact services can open.Gyms can open for inidual exercise.

The most striking feature is the patch of white at their rump. Males are slightly smaller and pale grey with black wingtips. Both have a round, owl-like face.Hen harriers are the UK#s most persecuted bird of prey relative to its population size. Their Scottish population is of global importance, yet it remains far from stable largely as a result of illegal killing by humans.The RSPB’s Jenni Burrell said: “We are calling on the public to email our Hen Harrier Hotlinethey believe they’ve seen a hen harrier. This helps us build a picture of where these birds are. Please don’t hesitate to contact usyou see them # we welcome any sightings and appreciate your time.“Hen harriers are beautul and elusive raptors and, unlike peregrines and kestrels, they are rarely seen in urban environments. Soit’s perched on your fence, it’s probably a sparrowhawk,it’s in a tree by the roadside, it’s probably a kestrel or a buzzard… butit’s over rough pasture or moorland, and matches the description above, then you might have seen a hen harrier.“Sadly hen harriers are a long way from reaching a healthy, self-sustaining population, and this is largely down to persecution by humans. Particularly where land is managed for the purpose of driven grouse shooting, natural predators like hen harriers can be viewed as pests and, despite being legally protected, the shooting, trapping and poisoning of hen harriers is a serious and ongoing problem.”If you think you’ve seen a hen harrier, you are asked to email henharriers@rspb.org.uk and to include the date, time, location grid reference and a description of the bird.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Reducing transmission of bacteria requires thorough disinfection of the sinks and surrounding areas and not just getting your hands wet.The study was conducted in , prior to the coronavirus pandemic, so there is no direct influence of increased handwashing or other hygiene behaviour associated with the pandemic on this study.But the researchers say the signicance of bacteria from the skin means that handwashing will be having a signicant effect on the bacterial communities of our sinks.copy -.

Yetwe continue using coal, oil and gas at the current rate, estimates show that reserves will be gone in around  years. But this is the least of our worries. If we want to slow rising global temperatures we need to stop burning these fuels their combustion, and subsequent release of greenhouse gases, is the main driver behind global warming.In , the Scottish Government pledged to end the use of all fossil fuels by  in order to reach their zero net emissions target. And in their place  Renewables.The traditional options such as wind farms and hydro schemes have now been joined by green hydrogen. Although still in its infancy, this renewable gas is expected to be a leading source of future energy production. Naturally occurring hydrogen is obtained by passing electricity through waterthis electricity is renewably sourced the gas is labelled as ‘green’ hydrogen, as opposed to ‘grey’. Once extracted it can be used in existing gas pipelines to heat and power homes, fuel vehicles and drive heavy machinery.And unlike traditional gas, when burned it produces no harmful emissions, only water.Keith Masson, climate change and energy team manager at Highland Council, said: “We’re in the process of recruiting a project manager to lead on the delivery of new hydrogen and low carbon heat strategies, to ensure that the council and the wider Highland region benefits from the energy-systems transformation that these technologies will bring.”In Highland region, plans are underway for a ‘hydrogen hub’ in the Cromarty Firth. Electricity generated from wind turbines in the area will be used to produce hydrogen gas for use in local industries.But progress towards the net zero emissions target is also happening even closer to home. In the last few months plans have been confirmed for two community hydro developments in Skye and Lochalsh.Construction of a community owned kW micro hydro development in Sleat is due to begin this month. Electricity produced will be sold to the national grid with over £, expected to be generated in the first  years. All money generated will be used to fund sustainable projects in the local community.Kenny Nicolson, project officer for Sleat Community Hydro, said: “Despite the Gàidhealtachd being a huge exporter of renewable energy, we pay the highest prices for electricity with some of the worst rates of fuel poverty in the UK. On Skye we have issues with inequality, young people unable to find secure employment and housing, and a dying language and culture.“Community-owned renewable energy projects are not just a means for reducing carbon emissions, there is a massive potential to create community wealth and address some of these underlying issues.”We as iniduals can also take steps towards installing renewable energy sources. The process may seem complicated or costly but thanks to an initiative launched by the Scottish Government, homeowners can apply for  per cent cashback, up to £,, for a renewable heating system. Small and medium sized businesses are also eligible for a similar cashback grant scheme. And the options for renewable heating systems are vast, from biomassboilers to solar  and ground source heat pumps.Iain Stewart and Shelagh Parlane have a ground source heat pump which sits just below the surface in their garden in Edinbane, extracting warmth from the ground to heat their radiators, underfloor heating and water. Shelagh said: “I would absolutely recommend it. It is certainly a very efficient system. If you were trying to heat water in a standard way I think it would be much more expensive.”Renewable heating systems can also be a source of income with the UK government’s Renewable Heat Initiative scheme. If you install, or have installed in the last year, an eligible system you could receive quarterly cash payments over seven years.Of course, no energy source is completely harmless. Whether it is birds flying into wind turbines or the destruction of fish spawning grounds with a hydro scheme, everything has a cost. Butwe want to continue using electricity, fossil fuels are not the way forward.No birds or fish will be able to survive at allwe continue to exacerbate the greenhouse gas effect by burning coal, oil and gas.Green alternatives are no longer trials for the future of energy production, they are the future."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MV-Glenachulish2.jpg","title":"glenelg ferry back in service in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine• Bittersweetafter death of founding directorFerry company directors took the decision not to operate the service for the  season in the interests of public and crew safety during the Covid pandemic.The vessel, MV Glenachulish, which normally runs from Easter to mid-October, has been tied up at the Kishorn boat yard since the autumn of .This week, general manager Jo Crawford from Glenelg said the boat was undergoing final checks and it was hoped to resume the service on Saturday st May.“It was a big miss last year, for locals and visitors alike,” said Ms Crawford.“We have put in additional measures to comply with Covid regulations including sanitising stations at both slipways and all the crew have been issued with PPE.“We have secured some grant assistance for opening up again and the ferry’s  employees will be taken out of furlough.

What is not as well-known about Alastair though, is that he had strong family connections with Skye, which he never forgot.Alastair MacPherson Alexander, to give him his full name, was born on th November , in Parklea, Port Glasgow. He died on Sunday th March, aged .Alastair was intensely proud of his home area of the Port and wider Inverclyde but was also acutely aware of his roots in Skye. He is one of a long list of people in that area who could trace his lineage to the island and the remarkable tale of serendipity and genealogy which eventually saw him commentate on Skye Camanachd’s greatest day in  bears further examination.Alastair’s maternal grandmother Jessie MacPherson was born in Skye in . His mother, Marion Smith, was born in Skye and lived at Tarskavaig in Sleat where her father was a shepherd. Following a well-trodden path, they moved to Kilmacolm in Renfrewshire for work.And it was farming and work on the land which brought Alastair’s parents together. Walter Alexander’s family had Bogston Farm in Greenock and eventually Marion and Walter met and married. Walter was to live with sight and hearing loss and they were, understandably, huge influences –clearly demonstrated in Alastair’s subsequent voluntary work with the Rex Blind Parties, while he developed a remarkable affection for shinty through his connection with Skye.Incidentally, Marion’s father moved to Renton, won the football pools, bought the show house in Dumbuck Crescent, Dumbarton and called it Tarskavaig. It was there that Alastair’s grandmother Jessie died in  when he was seven years old. Her sister Annie MacPherson , whom Alastair Alexander visited in Skye, was known locally as ‘Annag Alasdair’ denoting her father’s identity, and was single all her le. She lived at No. Tarskavaig, and is well remembered by people in the area today.Alastair met his family circumstances head on with a resilience and fortitude, marking him out as a thoroughly decent human inidual, as well as a consummate professional in more than one area of le.He went to the Glasgow School of Art to train as an architect and pursued a career in the building industry, while maintaining his other interests – moving seamlessly in all his dferent spheres of activity.Forty years of Alastair’s le were spent commentating on more than , football matches and describing bowls, hockey at the Kelvin Hall, and athletics for BBC Scotland, as well as the shinty. He first started commentating for people with vision loss at Love Street, Paisley in .Six years later he asked the BBC for an audition and was on television the following week.It was a great privilege to share commentary duties with the great man in my own early days as a commentator, beginning in  in Oban on a blisteringly hot day. I learned a great deal from him over the next few years and he was fantastic to work with.Technology, or more accurately a digger, failed us together one famous day in  when Fort William scored a goal in less than ten seconds and went on to win the Camanachd Cup -. Few in Fort William were aware of the outcome until much later in the day —there were no mobile phones — as a digger had uprooted the cable which connected Old Anniesland to the BBC studios at Queen Margaret Drive. Alastair and I blethered away for the whole match not knowing that only a few minutes had been broadcast and Tiger Tim had filled the rest of the afternoon with records.One of Alastair’s cousins, Ann McCarron, recalled: “My brother and Alastair spent a lot of their youth together on the Skye holidays and at Gran and Grandpa Smith’s in Dumbuck Crescent. Apparently my brother Alistair had a Subbuteo football game and when they played he [Alastair] used to do the commentating, so he must have had the commentating in his blood!”Such was the family’s affection for Skye that Ann’s brother Alistair’s ashes were scattered on Skye following his death a few years ago.Tributes have been fulsome and sincere. The plaudits and anecdotes could fill Hampden. Alastair was a “gentleman and a true professional” according to Ken MacQuarrie who made the formal presentation to him on behalf of the BBC in .It was singularly appropriate that he commentated on Skye’s greatest triumph in . In that famous final Alastair described Skye’s Calum Murchison on the radio as “leaping around like a salmon”. That of course meant an awful lot more to anyone knowing the shape and size of Calum and also his family’srelationship with the local salmon fishing river in Bernisdale.Alastair was a great man and is a huge loss to our collective knowledge of our history, sport and broadcasting. Meticulous in his presentation and fastidious when it came to detail, he was a total professional. The BBC bid him farewell with the traditional microphone presentation in October  when he retired.We shall not see his like again and we know that Alastair will of course be most sorely missed by his daughters Shirley, Susan and Joyce, her husband Mark, granddaughter Alex and grandson Callum."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/POT-HOLES-KYLE-1-scaled.jpg","title":"kyle womans petition targets","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineIona MacLachlan says people are being forced to drive in the opposite carriageway in Kyle’s Main Street to avoid huge potholes and believes a bad accident is waiting to happen.Ms MacLachlan, of Heathmount, is asking people to sign her petition on the change.org online petitions , urging Highland Council to improve the roads in the busy village.The health and social care frontline worker said: “I’ve raised this petition because of an experience I had at the weekend as an L-driver.“I was driving down to the village and I was confronted with this car in the middle of the road. I nearly hit it. I understand why the car was there – the driver was trying to avoid the massive potholes all along the street. I was able to avoid the vehicle but it gave me a scare and this situation could easily result in a bad accident.”Ms MacLachlan has reported the potholes in the road to Highland Council on multiple occasions.She said: “All you get is for the potholes to be filled with gravel and with the bad weather we’ve had over the past few months that lasts only two or three days and then they’re as bad as ever. The road needs to be properly repaired.“I’ve had to replace coil springs and tyres on my car because of the state of the roads in Kyle and I’m fed up with it. I hope as many people as possible will sign the petition to send a strong message to the council.”Ms MacLachlan’s petition is on the change.org site and calls for “All B roads in Kyle of Lochalsh to be repaired”.Local Highland councillor Biz Campbell said she was aware of the petition and agreed the road was in a poor state.“I don’t blame people,” said Councillor Campbell. “The roads are horrendous. We fight for funds for roads all the time and make the case when the budget comes up, but council doesn’t have the money.”However, she said councillors in Ward  — Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh — had been allocated an extra £, for local projects and members had discussed buying a “hot box” tar machine.She explained: “Currently the potholes in this ward are filled with cold tar and it’s a complete waste of money because the tar is simply washed out and the repair doesn’t last.“This machine would allow hot tar repairs to be made to potholes and it would last longer. We have discussed it at a meeting and I think this could achieve better road repairs which would help road users at least in the short term.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/salmon_farmJPG-1.jpg","title":"region should be more than a playground for","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineWhat is also very clear is that the impacts of the pandemic are extremely unequal, with the young having their prospects most severely impaired and those working in the private sector suffering the most severe economic consequences, yet to be felt in full, while the elderly and those with underlying health issues bearing the most risk to le, which has been tragic.Many people working in the front line have worked heroically. Of course, this includes those in the health service who have had to battle to save lives, but it also includes those who kept the boilers running, the ambulances and delivery vehicles on the road and the PPE arriving where required. That includes those in supply chains up and down the country, drivers, engineers, and tradesmen keeping our homes and critical facilities operational. It also includes those who have produced our food and those who distributed it and indeed those who kept the wheels and machinery of production and distribution of le’s essentials turning. Not least in the supply chain required to put food on our plates.A great many of our population, however — which is a blessing for them, whether wealthy, retired or working in the public sector or government, local or national — have neither had their economic situation nor their future employment prospects impaired, though of course, everyone has suffered the social deprivations and mental health challenges of lockdown. For those fortunate enough to be working in secure public sector employment or retired, perhaps on a secure pension, they do not have the financial concerns of those in the private sector whose jobs and livelihoods depend on viable economic activity.This imbalance of the bearing of the economic consequences of the pandemic is not given coverage or widely recognised, though our politicians at a national and local level are actively involved in formulating policy, actions, and funding programmes to sustain the economy and build back greener, better, and more fairly.Never has it been more critical for government at all levels, locally and nationally, to do everything possible to create and support sustainable jobs across our nation.We all have an obligation to recognise and understand this fundamental fact and do what we can to support economic growth and sustain people in, as well as create new jobs. The lack of a job, and the want of it, is fundamentally one of the most damaging situations to the long-term prospects, an inidual, their family and therefore society at large can suffer from.Economic growth and development,we are to sustain ourselves as a society, must be front and centre of government policy and action at national and local level. Local authorities and local politicians have a duty and an obligation too, not only to support development but make sure that they actively seek out and promote economic development opportunities within their areas of responsibility as a minimum. There needs to be some maturity in decision making and joined-up thinking in policy and action. You simply cannot have development without some impact, but neither can you have social progression without economic development.How can we call for building back our economy and protecting jobs, yet fail to support compliant job-creating planning applications  For example, the recent decision to refuse planning for an organic sea farm in Skye, which was recommended for approval, was in my view a dereliction of responsibility. It was to create nine new jobs directly. However, just the cancelling of the equipment orders required by this development and to be built here in the Highlands by our company, Gael Force Group, has caused the redundancy of over  people immediately and directly, just in this one company alone. This is a shocking narrowness in consideration and a failure of process and joined up thinking.We have become anti-development, anti-business in this country, yet we want all the benefits that depend on a strong, successful, and growing economy. It seems that we are prepared in this country now to tolerate someone dying from hunger and homelessness and the lack of a job, but not prepared to tolerate ‘our’ view or environment being altered. In the view of some people, all other forms of nature now have precedence over their fellow human beings. Like the clearances, once again the welfare of the local people who work the land and the sea is being considered as secondary to the narrow interests of a minority, often not rooted in the area, who care not for the economic wellbeing of other local people. We need to put people, their livelihoods, and their wellbeing first.The depressing familiarity of narrow interest groups’ objections to developments, often by an outspoken, sometimes fanatical, minority, often prejudiced on misinformation fuelled on social media but not supported by the scientic facts, is reaching a crisis across the Highlands and Islands and needs to be addressed. It requires local and national political leadership to speak out and stand up for the greater good, for the peoples of the Highlands and Islands welfare and livelihoods and retake the economic development agenda that has made the rural Highlands and Islands such a turnaround success over the past  to  years.If we do not see a change of behaviour in the support of development and growing the economy by all of us, we will be a failing nation, with rural areas becoming very largely inactive economically a playground for tourists, who are very welcome but who come and who go. A place again, where the will of the few suppress the opportunity of the many. If we do not change direction, we will leave no fine place, which in rural Scotland it should be, to raise a young family as our legacy. Shame on us."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MURAL-BIRCH-2.jpg","title":"donnie munro unveils sight for storr","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe landscape of the iconic island attraction is situated in Bayfield Road directly opposite Birch Cafe.The work was commissioned by Donnie’s son Niall who runs the coffee house.Niall said he wanted to bring an artistic flourish to the area for the enjoyment of both locals and visitors to the village., Niall Munro said: “The idea came about because the wall across from the cafe was in a total state of disrepair and there was a nice area that I thought was well suited for having a mural on it.“I mentioned it to my dad, but then didn’t really think much of it, but then I prompted him again and looked at it a bit more. He thought the landscape idea would be fitting.“We were thinking of locations and the Storr is quite an obvious one. We actually had an image of that particular view and thought that it would work really well.“It took a good few months to arrange because the wall belongs to Boots, so it took a bit of time to get the go ahead but we have got there.”He added: “From an arts point of view it is great to do something like this because it engages local interest as well as being for visitors.“It was very much just a way of brighting up the lane that we’re on anda by-product of it is that it benefits the other businesses here then great.”Like most business owners, Niall has experienced his fair share of obstacles due to the uncertainty brought by the pandemic. However, with Birch set to reopen at the end of April, he is excited about welcoming back customers with the cafe set to embark on a new venture.He said: “We are reopening at the end of the month and starting our own coffee roastery. We#ll start it on a small scale to begin with – by supplying Birch and a few other establishments on the island, and then a couple of months down the line I’ll open it up to online sales.“I have a passion for coffee and it is so much more exciting to be part of the whole process – from sourcing, importing, and now roasting, to then serving the final product.“It creates a much better story, and it is also an ethical way of doing it as we have direct links with the farmers that we are getting the coffee from.”Assessing the season ahead, he added: “It’s a mixed bag of feelings, it is dficult to have complete faith that this is the final lockdown – I think everybody needs to err on the side of caution and respect the rules that are in place.“The added benefit of Skye is that it is rural so there is lots of space for people to socially distance. And, thankfully, with the exception of Home Farm there hasn’t been any major outbreaks – and I think that was because people were being safe and able to be outdoors.“As long as people are following the rules then that’s the best we can do.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3746987.jpg--.jpg?1618485362000\n","title":"martinstown post office temporary closure for modernisation work","story":"Martinstown Post Office will temporarily close for modernisation.

It had been so long,” said Sarah whose alarm clock goes off at an ungodly .am.“It’s absolutely brilliant to finally be in Belfast.“I had a few anxiety dreams where I missed everything and was running around in a building unable to find a door with a microphone on the other side of it... then I woke up three minutes before the alarm went off.“I was fully organised. The younger me would’ve been very impressed. I’d all my clothes laid out. I had a shower the night before... I was all ready to go.” Belfast Beat Newsletter Receive the big stories from across Belfast directly to your inbox  Enter email address   This field is required  Sign Up      Sarahfronts GMU from Monday to Thursday – Mondays with Joel and the other three days with Chris Buckler , the BBC’s former Washington Correspondent, at Ormeau Avenue’s Broadcasting House.Having initially relocated from the Peak District to Donegal with husband Terry Coyleand their six-year-old son Theo, they recently moved into a new home in Eglinton on the outskirts of Derry.“I had a bit of dficulty getting onto the A on the first day because every road was closed so there was a good bit of stress to start the day but thankfully I arrived at exactly the same time as Joel,” she said.“I pulled up behind him in the car park and then I instantly felt at ease and happy because he’s such good craic.”With a global pandemic causing massive disruption to #normal# working practices, Tuesday was actually the first time Sarah and Chris had physically seen each other since being interviewed for the jobs in December .“We started on air at the end of April last year so it has taken exactly a year for us to be in the same room as each other,” she said.“I was genuinely happy to see him. After all of this time... to finally get to be together, it was special.“Around the time of the interviews, we talked about how much we were looking forward to working together... and then we ended up spending a year not seeing each other apart from on Zoom.”Not that close proximity always means perfection.“Hilariously, we almost didn’t know who was going to pick up right at the start of this morning’s programme at .am,” Sarah revealed.“But it’s much easier now because you can read someone physically when you’re next to them.“Within two or three weeks, Chris and I will know by the way the other person sits in a chair whether or not they want to get in, whether or not they want to make a cup of tea...“We’ve already learned each other’s way of broadcasting incredibly well – maybe even better - because it’s like we’ve developed an extra sense to a certain extent through not being together.”During the show, her co-presenter exposed Sarah’s early morning Jaffa Cake fix and she told me the treat “does not y, because not all biscuits are created equal at the breakfast time of day”.“If I’m broadcasting, then the Jaffa Cakes are my breakfast because I won’t have eaten at am,” she said, adding that she’s in bed by pm on work nights.Currently Sarah’s commute is “ miles door to door, which takes about one hour  minutes” although once the roadworks are complete she’ll be able to shave some time off that.“I’ve got a six-year-old and an -year-old mother, who’s living with me, and a husband I’m leaving... let’s see how this new arrangement goes,” she said.Co-presenter Chris meanwhile, was shocked when Sarah suddenly exited the studio during one of Tuesday morning’s news bulletins.“I think he thought I was leaving him at am when I got up and left, but I was actually just going to make us a cup of tea,” she said.“During the programme I need to walk and clear my head because otherwise you’re sitting there for two and a half hours.“Chris, on the other hand, was sitting drinking the same cup of tea for two and a half hours, which is utterly outrageous.”Belfast Most ReadNew IRA blamed for bomb attempt on female part-time PSNI officer and her young daughterFurniture set alight in Belfast disorder and loyalists protest protocol in ArdsFather-of-four jailed after travelling to Belfast to have sex with -year-old girlGang of youths attack north Belfast home in hate crimeEx-PSNI officer#s alleged misconduct case adjournedTop VideosPlayPolice update after bomb found beside young female officers car PlayNI Assembly debate motion to ban gay conversion therapyPlayTiny Loyalist protest at Irish Secretariat building in Belfast Latest Northern IrelandOpinion poll finds % in NI would vote to stay in UKFemale officer in terror attack only worked  hours a monthAllison MorrisOpinionNew IRA so desperate it#s reduced to copying worst tactics of IsisDUP MP Gavin Robinson says NI veterans #should not be treated as second class soldiers# after Mercer resignationNI would vote in stay in UKborder poll was held, according to surveyLatestEnglish clubs to quit European Super League following fan backlashOpinion poll finds % in NI would vote to stay in UKThomas Tuchel ‘worried’ about Cha’s top-four bid after Brighton stalemateFemale officer in terror attack only worked  hours a monthAllison MorrisOpinionNew IRA so desperate it#s reduced to copying worst tactics of Isis,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

To suggest that our LGBTQ+ population are in need of a fix or cure is fundamentally wrong.“The Assembly had an opportunity to send a message to those who have been subjected to this disgraceful practice that we hear them and will right this wrong. Conversion therapy has a devastating impact on the lives of those who have undergone it and many still suffer from poor mental health for years afterwards. “Conversion therapy exists in an environment where a culture of shame is cultivated. This culture creates a problem and offers a solution through conversion therapy. We cannot look away from the devastating effect of shame on LGBTQ people. Quite simply, shame is a killer.

We now need to see legislation brought forward imminently. Conversion therapy must be banned before the end of this mandate.”In response, Minister Hargey said: “So called #conversion therapy# has no place in society. I know how huge the hurt and damage can be to people when they are told they need to be fixed or cured. We have heard that hurt again from people in recent days. This language and behaviour is unacceptable and should not be tolerated - it will not be included in any proposals put forward by my Department. We need to accept people for who they are and this is what I will ensure we do.”Presbyterian Moderator, Dr David Bruce, said he welcomed the opportunity for locally elected representatives to discuss and debate an issue that is important to many, including people of faith, highlighting the need for clarity and balance.“As a Church we are also clear on this issue, we oppose such coercive approaches, do not sanction them and they should never be suggested. We support moves to introduce legislation where it does not already exist to outlaw these abuses, which are evidently damaging to people,” he added.

It is a powerful reminder that the game is, and always will be, for fans.”The Duke of Cambridge earlier held talks on the issue with the FA’s chief executive Mark Bullingham.It follows William, the FA president, tweeting how he shared “the concerns of fans” over the proposals.There was anger in the football community earlier on Tuesday over the actions of the English clubs, with the Prime Minister telling the football authorities he was ready to “drop a legislative bomb”necessary.In a morning conference call with the FA and the Premier League, he had indicated the Government could act to ensure they did not fall foul of competition lawsthey imposed sanctions on the clubs involved.Speaking later at a Downing Street press conference, he said he was determined to prevent historic clubs being “dislocated” from their towns and cities and turned into “international brands and commodities” by billionaire owners without any say for the fans.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk dab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_a-bf-e-ae-eaab_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk dab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_a-bf-e-ae-eaab_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk dab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_a-bf-e-ae-eaab_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk dab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_a-bf-e-ae-eaab_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Premier League clubs who were part of the planned European Super League Press Association Images FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":truePremier League clubs who were part of the planned European Super League Under the now unravelling plan unveiled at the weekend, the six English clubs would have joined six leading Spanish and Italian clubs to set up an alternative competition to the European Champions League.The proposal attracted particular ire as there would be no relegation from the Super League, regardless of how well clubs do on the field, although five of the best performing teams from outside the league would be invited to participate each year.It led to calls for the clubs involved to be expelled from the Premier League amid suggestions their players could be barred from representing their countries in the World Cup or the European Championship.PAMost ReadNew IRA blamed for bomb attempt on female part-time PSNI officer and her young daughterFurniture set alight in Belfast disorder and loyalists protest protocol in ArdsFather-of-four jailed after travelling to Belfast to have sex with -year-old girlGang of youths attack north Belfast home in hate crimeEx-PSNI officer#s alleged misconduct case adjournedTop VideosPlayPolice update after bomb found beside young female officers car PlayNI Assembly debate motion to ban gay conversion therapyPlayTiny Loyalist protest at Irish Secretariat building in Belfast Latest UKEnglish clubs to quit European Super League following fan backlashUK-ticket holder scoops £m EuroMillions jackpotAll the key announcements Apple made at its spring eventWilliam and FA boss hold talks as European Super League row intensiesLatestChinese hackers suspected of spying on US, European and Japanese targetsEuropean Super League to ‘reshape project’ in wake of English departuresBeyonce and Oprah Winfrey lead celebrity reaction to Derek Chauvin verdictEnglish clubs to quit European Super League following fan backlashOpinion poll finds % in NI would vote to stay in UK,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

So Ill be in the kitchen prepping on Christmas Eve and then the dinner will be cooked and delivered on Christmas Day for anyone who’s alone or in need of one.Last year we actually had some spare meals left over so I went and delivered them up to the Fire Station, which was the highlight of my Christmas, she said.Paula has been provided with the names of people in the local community who would benefit from the scheme by the Operation Snowball at the OLT and staff at the Long Tower Youth Club.This service is free of charge of course, soyou or someone you know needs help this Christmas please send me a message to the Peggys Kitchen Facebook page,continued Ms Monk. googletag.cmd.push Last year we covered the cost of it ourselves, apart from the desserts, but this year Foyle Fruit have kindly offered to donate the potatoes and vegetables and we have also had donations of containers and cups. All donations are welcome andanyone wishes to help our efforts that help would be much appreciated.Ms Monk has enlisted the help of two delivery drivers to take the food to the Bogside, Brandywell and Creggan areas of the city.Like all cafes, Peggys Kitchen is closed at the moment due to current restrictions.Its sad that we cant open because we really miss our customers like the Over s Club that used to meet here every Wednesday and for a lot of them it was their only source of interaction but the safety of everyone needs to come first, said Ms Monk. googletag.cmd.push We cant wait to reopen again but until then please keep safe.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The rain of the previous night has given way to a sun strong enough to elicit steam from its surface. Entering by the crossroads at the boxing club, there appear to be a lot of closed doors. A sign informs the public that Granaghan Fireplaces will be back on Monday, April . There is almost giddy optimism around the date, and by the time you read this, well be on the far bank of that particular Rubicon. Some non-essential retail will have opened, schools will be back and group training, albeit not in its full form, will have resumed. googletag.cmd.push In keeping with the general theme of this series, as soon as I gather my stuff and leave the car, the heavens open. Hailstones this time. By the time I reach the deserted play park at the bridge, it has receded to a bitter mizzle, only a stf breeze propelling it into my face. A quiet Swatragh last Friday afternoon. The Drumbane Road climbs towards the North Sperrins Scenic Route away to my right as I make my way up the hill past an empty St Johns Primary School, closed for the Easter holidays. St Johns chapel towers over the cars that pass by on the main road. That all of the gravestones seem to face in that direction only enhances the effect. googletag.cmd.push A single car sits outside the open doors of the chapel. Inside, an elderly lady has lit a candle and is praying at the foot of the altar. On the way out, she tells me Ive just missed mass. I head back towards the village. A triangular sign advertising Friels to Go sits outside the school, offering local flavour to an exploding mobile catering industry. Light snow begins to fall as I head back over the bridge. A pink Fiat brings a splash of colour to the street as grey clouds swell overhead. Outside McGuigans Garage, Kieran McGuigan says the pandemic has taken on a personal edge for him and his family.     “I had Covid myself, and so did my family, but we have all recovered. Its been a strange time. Once you get that [positive] result back, you just dont know whats in front of you.” he tells me. “Other families havent, and its been a tough time for everybody. Business-wise, were just tipping away and doing what we can. “Covid affects dferent people in dferent ways. I was off my feet, in bed for a week with the fatigue and no energy or appetite. “My we and the kids had it too, and my mother-in-law had to go into hospital with it for ten days, but thankfully shes okay now.” McGuigans garage has adapted to the restrictions as they have been introduced. Kieran pauses to wave a customer around the one-way system introduced with the onset of the pandemic. McGuigans have had to adapt like everyone . “Its all one-way and its appointment only now,” he says. “Its easier managed, you dont want too many people on the premises at the same time. Ive a routine every morning and evening where I wipe everything down. “You have your signs up, you do what you can and you bring as little people inside as possible. Were managing it and doing what we can. “The car sales will be open on Monday morning again. Vans and pick-ups have been very busy, but its going to be great to get opened up to do test drives again and meeting people face-to-face. “People enjoy the process, its part and parcel of the business. When theyre spending that amount of money, its a big step and you cant take them for granted.” Kieran admits not being able to physically meet up with friends has been tough, but says last years lockdown had a galvanising effect on the community. “There are boys I havent seen since the bars shut. Youd be texting boys, but its not the same having the craic in a WhatsApp group,” he says. “Having the banter over a beer or even getting to a football match is missed. Last year, Swatragh had five games and I was at every one of them. “The year before, I was only at a few of them, but it was just the fact you could get out, so you made a point of going to them. “The local GAA club did a lot for the community throughout the  months. They were offering to pick up groceries for people that were isolated and delivered meals. “My mum is  years of age and got it a few times, and that was done by Davitts. Its the heart of the community. Everything revolves around it and it brings everybody together.”  Sineacutead McErlean and Fran OKane from SM Filling Station on the Kilrea Road. After indulging in the glamour of being a reporter on the road and conducting a Zoom interview in the car, I head down Kilrea Road to SM Filling Station. A few minutes of to-and-fro with Sineacutead and a phone call with Sean and Im chatting to Fran OKane, who tells me the ongoing vaccination programme is lting peoples spirits. “I think people are more hopeful now because of the jab, theyre more upbeat as its been rolled out,” she says. “I have had the first one. It was a bit of a relief, but itll be better when I get the second one. Youre meeting so many people in here all the time.” The busy service station found itself with the responsibility of being essential retail, but Fran says the extra regulations quickly became part and parcel of doing business. “Its busier now again than it had been. It was very quiet early on in January but things have really picked up now and were a lot busier,” she says. “You always had that bit of nervousness and were very aware not to stand too near, or to sanitise your hands, especially with handling money and everything. “It was dficult, but as time went on it just became matter-of-fact and you just do it now every time you serve somebody. You adapt and get used to it. “Even outside, youre still inclined to pull back. Id say % of customers are wearing the masks, but you do get that odd one that doesnt wear it.” Daffodils signal Spring is well underway in Swatragh.

The upgrade of the Buncrana Road was first mooted some  years ago. Hopes that work would commence in the near future rose this week after it emerged that traffic lights are to be erected at the Springtown Road junction of Buncrana Road. However, Dfi has quashed those hopes by stating the new lights were being put in place to facilitate an expectant increase in traffic due to the construction of a new Lidl supermarket due to open in  weeks time. googletag.cmd.push In a statement to the Derry News, a Dfi spokesperson said: “Planning permission was granted for a new Lidl store on the Buncrana Road which includes for the upgrade of the Springtown Road Buncrana Road junction to a signal controlled junction prior to the opening of the new store. “This measure is to assist the mitigation of the impact of traffic generated by the new retail outlet in the interests of road safety and traffic progression and will incorporate a pedestrian phase.” The spokesperson added: “In June , Minster Mallon announced her commitment to fund the continued development of a number of Strategic Road Improvement schemes including the A Buncrana Road, as part of her plan to aid economic recovery and community transformation while addressing regional imbalance. googletag.cmd.push “Consistent with wider priorities, Minister Mallon is committed to ensuring that this scheme is future-proofed to help stimulate green recovery. “The Department is continuing to progress the A Buncrana Road scheme in line with the objectives which include improving transport links, road safety, traffic progression and contributing to the regeneration of the area. The spokesperson concluded: “Officials will continue discussions with all affected landowners and other stakeholders over the coming months and to progress scheme development.” Sinn Fein Foyle MLA Martina Anderson said it was vitally important the upgrade took place as soon as possible. “The full upgrade of this road is crucial to ensure that it is fit for purpose as a main gateway into our Donegal hinterland and feature in any future expansion of the Fort George site.     “And it is also vitally important to make sure that happens as soon as possible for all the residents and businesses along its entirety as it’s estimated that over , vehicles use itdaily.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dormant accounts are defined as those which have seen no customer-initiated activity for at least  years. Under the Dormant Bank and Building Society Accounts Act , money has been released from these unused accounts to the National Lottery Community Fund for distribution to good causes across the UK. Theprogramme,delivered by The National Lottery Community Fundinconjunctionwith theDepartmentof Finance,issupportingthe voluntary, community and social enterprisesectortobe more resilient and prepared for thelong-termfuture. An Gaelaacuteras in Derry, which runs Irish language education,musicand cultural activities, has been awardedpound, to improve their financial resilience by increasing opportunities to generate income. googletag.cmd.push Paacutedraig MacCongaacuteil, Chief Executive of AnGaelaacuteras, said:“We currently receive funding from quite a few funders,but one of our ongoing goals is to become more self-sufficient. We want to be able to provide a valuable community hub and services into the future as we develop our educational, cultural, social and employment opportunities. “In recent years our staff and Board have recognised the value in appointing someone to increase our revenue and help with our sustainability, but we haven’t been able to dedicate the required resources into it. So once the Dormant Accounts Fund opened, we were ready to apply straight away as we already had plans in place and knew what we needed - this just gave us the opportunity to finance it. googletag.cmd.push I’m confident the organisation will be in a stronger position in two years’timeand it should be very clear that the sustainability of the organisation has been increased.” Dormant accounts are UK bank and building society accounts that have been untouched for  or more years, wherecustomers who own the accountscannot betraced. Over pound million is currentlyavailableand money will continue to be released each year to support thelong-termsustainability of the VCSE sector. As part of the first phase,organisationscan apply for up to pound, as part of a flexible and responsive grantprogrammeto help them adapt to future challenges and be more financially resilient.     Kate Beggs, Northern Ireland Director at The National Lottery Community Fund,said: “There has been a lot of interest in Dormant Accounts FundNIand we are delighted to be able to award the first grants. “Weknow many organisations are trying to plan for the long term and thinking about the changes they need to make to become more sustainable. Those changes require leadership, strategic planning, newskillsand strong governance.Those are things for which funding often isn’t available and that’s where the Dormant Accounts Fund comes in. It will provide flexible, multi-year funding and allow a erse range of organisations to plan for a more secure future. “There isalso support for larger investments that will enable collaboration and develop new and creative Northern Ireland-wide or sector-specic approaches to sustainability.” Finance Minister, Conor Murphysaid: “It is great to see the very first initial awards being made from the Dormant Accounts Fund. This funding will support these projects with longer term sustainability and resilience which are at the very core of this Fund. I look forward to further awards being madein the near futureandseeing the positivelonger termimpact the Dormant Account Fund has within the voluntary, community and social enterprise sectors.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Applications were recently made for new Irish street signs at Ballynagard Crescent and Hatmore Park. Once an application is made to Derry City and Strabane District Council, the council then writes to the residents in the streets to find out their views on the street sign application.

However, because this did not meet the current threshold of %, the proposed new road sign will not be installed. At Hatmore Park,  households were contacted by the council.

Cllr McMahon said: “We have been calling for this type of investment in Bundoran for some time and it is most welcome. The situation with Covid and lockdown highlighted just how important such outdoor physical activity is, to both body and mind.” googletag.cmd.push “Bundoran has become a magnet for those in the surfing world and we can offer a coastline, waves and other water based activities that are on par with many other parts of the world. It is something that will become more important to us in the future. This key investment in south Donegal is long overdue. The Bundoran centre will also be fully wheelchair accessible and built using sustainable materials such as solar heating  to meet ‘Nearly Zero Energy Building Standards’. The signicant increase in people enjoying outdoor water-based activities such as kayaking, surfing, paddle-boarding and open water swimming is expected to continue to grow year on year, and not just during the summer months.     This means all-weather changing facilities, secure storage and bathrooms at beaches and inland water spots will be in huge demand.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

After  years in Asia,  of which have been in Thailand, John is now nearing  years of age and is finally taking a step back from an adulthood that has revolved wholeheartedly around the growth of gaelic football in Bangkok and beyond. The magnitude of the Asian GAA community cannot be underestimated. The Asian Games are massive in this part of the world, with over  teams involved – men and women, and over  people coming together in friendship and competition. There are  clubs in Asia and the popularity of the sport, amongst Irish exiles and locals is growing year on year. googletag.cmd.push At the heart of this growth was, and is, Derry native John who founded Thailand GAA in . Since then, John has slowly but surely built something lasting, ever since agreeing to a request from the Asian County Board to set up a gaelic football team in Thailand. That set in motion a chain of events that has resulted in a thriving club – Thai GAA – but also a gaelic community that extends far beyond the limitations of the game itself. With three South Asia Championships to their name, Thai GAA is not just there to make up the numbers – it has ambition, not just for growth, but for success, and winning the men’s section of the Asian Gaelic Games remains the ultimate goal. googletag.cmd.push It is a far cry from kicking a ball about with Oxford United back in the late s. “I would never have thought  years ago when I was in Derry that I would end up in Thailand,” John admits. “I had one of those fork in the road moments. I was working for two years in England and was itching to get back home. I wasn’t that satisfied with my career and wanted to do something dferent. It was in July ’ that my boss rang me and asked ‘How do you fancy going to Thailand next week ’. The very same day I got a job offer back in Derry. I thoughtThailand didn’t happen, I would take the job in Derry. A week later I was in Thailand. That taste in travel, it opens your eyes to the world and I have never looked back.”     John left St. Columb’s in  and was accepted into Loughborough University for a degree in Chemical Engineering. Loughborough’s fine sporting pedigree was a key factor behind his choice but that side of it didn’t work out as he hoped and it wasn’t until his final year that he kicked a ball regularly again. He started playing gaelic – not his strong suit – in Leicester, before moving to Reading where there was a strong Irish community, and plenty in the way of soccer and gaelic. His job took him all around the world, but a trip to Taiwan in  ultimately changed his path and his le, completely. Now married to Jessie, with children Shannen, Cara and Caolan, John remembers when he discovered just how popular gaelic was in Asia. “I went to Taiwan in  on a project and discovered gaelic football team there,” he recalls. “They were competing in Asian Gaelic Games. It was just amazing to see  Irish people playing Gaelic football in China. “I had the opportunity to meet with Micheal OMuircheartaigh who was the honorary President of the Asian County Board. He comes over year and commentates on the games pitch-side. I didn’t watch a lot of gaelic growing up but I always watched the All-Ireland final. His voice was legendary and to actually meet the guy and have dinner with him and get to know him, was inspiring. “I ed to Thailand in , the County Board asked Johnhe could set up a team in Thailand. I managed to get a few Irish people and a few non-Irish people together and we got a team together and we played in our first Asian Games in Singapore in . In our first match we were lined up against Singapore Rugby team and I was in midfield and was lined up against a guy called Phil Green, who used to be a hooker for the England rugby team. “That was our first participation as Thailand GAA. Since then, every year, except , we have entered a team into the Asian Gaelic Games.”  Responsibility For a man who preferred soccer, and even a bit of golf, John was suddenly thrust into a position of responsibility, and, admittedly stubborn, he was not about to give his new role anything other than %. It was not easy however, and a lot of dficult days passed for a club which started out with five showing up for training to a club and city which has now hosted the Asian Games on three occasions, in ,  and  as well as hosting the South Asia Games on four occasions. “It was very dficult to be honest,” he admits. “The first thing I did was put an ad in the Bangkok Post and I got maybe four or five replies. The first training session had four or five people with a few girlfriends watching on. Because of my background with Oxford United, fitness came first so I told the guys they wouldn’t see a ball until they were fit, and I think because they had a dferent background from me, they thought this wasn’t for them. I probably scared people away. “Near tournaments it’s easy to get people to commit, but during the year and you’re running training once a week – I have a -hour commute to get out to training – you’re not sure what numbers you’re going to get. It’s very frustrating and the number of times I questioned myself ‘Why am I doing this ’ It was dficult, but I’m quite stubborn as well, and when I start something, it takes a lot for me to drop it because I want to make it a success. I persevered and I persevered and in  it really started changing.” The foundations of Thai GAA really started to take hold thanks to a talented group of girls, who came to the club, not just wanting to play, but to compete at the highest level. As defining moments go, this was signicant for John and his hopes of what Thai GAA could ultimately be. “I got a batch of girls in who were all natural athletes,” he explains. “Only two of them were Irish, one from the North and one from the South and neither of them had played gaelic before. One of them had played soccer for Northern Ireland but had no background in gaelic football. I had this group of girls for six weeks – all teachers from international schools before the  Asian Games in Malaysia, trying to get the basics. “In the first games they were asking ‘Where do I stand  Where do I go ’ They won six out of six at that tournament and won their ision. That was unbelievable success. Their hardest game was actually the semi-final against the Japanese Ladies. We beat them on Sudden Death Golden Goal. The same bunch of girls came back the next year in  and they won their title again that year. The following year they lost in the Upper Division, but that set the basis. This group of girls was committed, they loved their sport and we were giving them an opening to play competitively. “ was when we really bedded in as a club and that was on the back of our girls’ team. In , my girls won the South Asia Championship, so that was a regional tournament involving Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Taiwan and Shanghai. That was quite an achievement.”  Sustained success On the back of the girls’ success, the club got this influx of Irish men in  and that has since helped sustain the club over the last  years. The first men’s trophy soon followed – the Plate at the South Asia Games, and from there the club has gone from strength to strength. Better quality players joined – some with county experience, and fresh ideas and new energy began running through Thai GAA. “I was trying to remember things I learned playing with Doire Colmcille  or  years ago, but then these guys come in with fresh ideas and I was happy to let them coach,” John laughs. “The club is in a really strong place right now. We probably have about  members. What’s important is that there is a really good social side to the club as well. Most of the players would be late ’s, and early to late s, but there is room for everyone and it’s just a home away from home for a lot of people. It’s a good social network as well and you’re giving people a chance to play competitive sport as well as keeping fit. “Something I’ve picked up from the last  years of playing gaelic in Asia is what gaelic football means to people as a community. Most major cities in Asia have a gaelic team and it really is a home away from home from Irish and Northern Irish people, and people from both sides of the community in Ireland.” Only recently, John gave up the Chairmanship at the club, as he finally takes a back step from the day to day running of Thai GAA. It has been a labour of passion for the Carnhill man for  years, and he is proud of what it has become. He is not about to drt away into the sunset however. He might be turning  but he wants to keep playing, and doing whatever he can to ensure longevity and success for the club in the future. “I am very proud of what we’ve achieved in Thailand,” he says. “It’s also helped me stay connected to Ireland to be honest. This connection with gaelic football has given me more of an identity and a connection with Ireland being overseas. I have been able to meet a lot of people through gaelic football. The GAA certainly connects people and you can see the impact it has overseas. “I’m realizing that Father Time is marching on. I still want to be involved with the club, but I have work and family commitments. I used to be very heavily involved in making all the decisions but I have got a good bunch of people in there now who can share the load. “The next tournament maybe in Bangkok next year as it will host the South Asia Games and then at the end of  for the Asia Games, so maybe I can have a final swansong at those. There are guys older than me still playing so there’s a level for everyone. I’ll still be involved.”  Home away from home John s to Derry every summer with his family but for now, and for the past  years, his real home has been over , miles away, where he has helped build not just a team, but a club, a community and a legacy that will last long into the future. “It makes you realise the world is a small place and that the opportunities are out there,” he reflects. “It wasn’t something I sought out. I am proud of what I have achieved and what the club has achieved, but there has been a lot of good work that other people have done out in Asia around gaelic football. “It’s not just about gaelic football, it’s about Irish people and how we fit in around the world. We have no real baggage, we are able to adapt and fit into the communities we find ourselves in, and make a positive impact with our culture and with the welcome that we can bring to other people. When you are a teenager you have no idea where the future is going to take you. I had no great expectations or any great career plan.

Kick off :pm. Dundalk have lorded it over the Candystripes in recent years, winning  of  games in all competitions since Ryan McBride inspired Derry to a win over them back in . It has been one-way traffic, but that is a statistic which City will have to changethey are to finally move off the bottom of the Premier Division. Dundalk have not lost a game at the Brandywell since November ,  when they lost -, and over  years has passed since that meeting. googletag.cmd.push Declan Devine’s team ended a run of four success defeats when they drew with Drogheda United at the weekend, but along with Dundalk, they are one of only two teams without a Premier Division victory after five weeks. Both teams are therefore desperate for the win, and with Dundalk in a chaotic state off the pitch – manager Shane Keegan and coaches Filippo Giovagnoli and Guiseppe Rossi have all left the club in recent days – now could be a good time for City to face their great rivals. Declan Devine is paying no attention to the comings and goings at Dundalk however, insisting it does not change the talent they have at their disposal ahead of tomorrow night’s game. googletag.cmd.push “Dundalk have probably got the best squad in the league,” he said. “I was at the game on Saturday and you look at the bench and you have Cherrie, Sloggett, McEleney, Junior and McMillan and they have just signed a guy from America who was in Valencia’s first team. “They have so many quality players, so don’t get caught up in the fact that they have a low points tally and that they are where they are. They were very good for periods against St. Pat’s and they will be coming here and it will be a good game.” Derry City and Dundalk are the only teams in the Premier Division without a win yet, and while the pressure grows with each passing game, the City boss seems content with the progress he feels his team is making.     “It’s a game we have to look forward to,” he said. “A lot of teams are still finding their way and still finding their identity in terms of their patterns of play. We are staying positive. I have seen glimpses in all our games, except Longford, that what we’re trying to do here is going to work. There’s nothing in the league here that scares me. Everybody on their day is capable of winning games in this league. We are getting close. We are giving ourselves a mountain to climb with the goals we concede but we also have to be better in how we penetrate teams at the other end.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It is imperative that this report is published and consulted upon so that we can see the stark reality of what key strategists in health here are thinking.ldquoAre we to take the threat of having the Downe and Daisy Hill in Newry reduced to dferent grades of urgent care centres  If we are, then we need to maintain solidarity as a district and not allow this to happento either of our two beloved hospitals.Cllr Savage said the local authority could not get into a ldquoide and conquer approach that saw ldquoone end of the district get more crumbs from the health service table than the other.ldquoWe need to fight to protect and enhance the services at both hospitals. We want services retained and enhanced for our people, he said.The Newry councillor pointed to the -year community campaign for a new Downe Hospital, suggesting that since its foundation stone was laid ldquoit has been a constant battle to retain services, commending the Down Community Health Committee for its work in fighting to retain local services.ldquoWe in this district should not have to constantly look over our shoulder in fear of the centralising grim reapers within the Department of Health attempting to swing the axe again at our cherished local hospitals to enhance services within a cluster of hospitals within the greater Belfast area, declared Cllr Savage.ldquoElected representatives have an obligation to speak up for our people and ensure that we are not treated as second class citizens when it comes to access to local hospital services and first class health care.ldquoThe Department of Health should be looking to enhance local hospitals and a strategy needs to be looked at regionally with the emphasis on fair access to local health services.Highlighting the need to fight to protect the health rights of rural communities across the district, Cllr Savage called for a ldquofair share of specialist services across all hospitals, suggesting thatthe Downe is good enough to provide cataract surgery, it is good enough to provide other services.Cllr Savage added: ldquoWe need to look at the challenges we face in health and ask ourselves are the current engagement structures we have capable of holding decision makers within health to account into the future and could they withstand the body blow of a potential decision to halve the number of current hospitals ldquoWe need to review those structures and a good place to start would be enhanced engagement with the Down Community Health Committee and Daisy Hill Pathfinder Group, inviting these groups to meet with us to discuss their concerns for the future of our local hospitals in a post-Covid world.Cllr Savage said local people required an ldquounequivocal statement from the health minister that there are no plans to reduce the number of hospitals and a ldquocast iron guarantee that there are no plans to downgrade the Downe HospitalHe added: Only when we get a response will we know  the rumours are just rumours.

The post-Christmas lockdown presented yet another challenge to the council and the DfC to target help where it was most needed.The County Down Rural Community Network , Newry Confederation of Community groups and others were asked to set up three brand new distribution centres and allocated over pound, worth of food and essential hygiene and household goods to the area.The Journey Church stepped up to assist in the Downpatrick area and week after week, dozens of their volunteers received the supplies from Lynas Foods, which they made into the ious orders and dispatching them to the ious groups in need. Down Community Transport helped with the bulkier loads.The Clanrye Group were tasked with coordinating the scheme and Kilkeel Development Association looked after the Mournes area. Clanrye collated orders for food and supplies each week and Lynas foods delivered pallets of supplies to this part of the world.Orders were placed each week by local food banks, the St Vincent de Paul Society, Home-Start, Sure Start and other organisations.Nicholas McCrickard, manager of CDRCN, said: ldquoOn behalf of the strategic stakeholder forum, I want to thank Journey Church and all the other groups involved in this gigantic effort.ldquoThe general public may never fully grasp the scale of the operation to keep our foodbanks and SVP stocked and able to answer the great need which has been brought on by the pandemic.ldquoWhile many of us have seen our lives as relatively unaffected, thousands of people have seen their normal weekly incomes and their day to day struggles take a turn for the worse.ldquoThis food pallet scheme and other financial and food security systems have been a leline for many. I want to thank the Maria Keenan from the Clanrye Group in particular and my colleague Daniella McCarry for going well beyond their normal jobs to help people most in need.Daniella said: ldquoWe could not have done this without the volunteers from the Journey Church in Downpatrick. They selflessly gave up days of their own time and rallied to the warehouse to get the vital supplies out to those that needed it most.ldquoThe foodbanks, SVP and our other partners are also to be commended for getting their orders in every week and for getting food and nappies and other products quickly out to local families.Thomas Leavy, from the Journey Churchrsquos leadership team, was the person who co-ordinated the local effort.He said that the church volunteers represented all generations distributed food to Downpatrickrsquos Fountain food bank, St Vincent De Paul in Strangford and Killough, Newcastle and Ballynahinch food bank.ldquoThis is the second time we have partnered with County Down Rural Community Network, he explained.ldquoIn the first lockdown we delivered food parcels, this time we delivered straight to agencies so that they could get the supplies out.ldquoDown Community Transport assisted with the use of several of their buses to deliver supplies furthest away while we did more local deliveries.The church hired the former Down Sports Centre premises in order to have room to break down the thousands of pounds worth of food which came each week on pallets..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/14Apr2021-Backing.jpg","title":"Council backing ban on conversion therapy  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has called for a ban on so-called conversion therapy and increased protection for those in the LGBT+ community.The decision was taken at last weekrsquos monthly meeting of the local authority with the debate including a powerful and moving contribution from Slieve Gullion councillor Pete Byrne, who highlighted the issues that those in the gay community like himself face.Tabled by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown, the motion was not agreed unanimously, with Independent Unionist Henry Reilly voting against it on the grounds that he did not know enough about the issue to make a judgement. The DUPrsquos Glyn Hanna and Kathryn Owen abstained.Cllr Brown urged the local authority to oppose the harm caused to the LGBT+ community in the past through the denial of rights and equal treatment and to recognise that discrimination still occurs today.Councillors have also supported a call to three Stormont ministers mdash Deirdre Hargey, Robin Swann and Naomi Long mdash to introduce an effective ban on conversion therapy within Northern Ireland, supported by a programme of work to help tackle these practices in all their forms.Cllr Brownrsquos motion, which urged the NI Executive and UK government to ban conversion therapy, called on the council to highlight and promote the continued support, counselling and advocacy local groups provide to members of the LGBT+ community.ldquoConversion therapy is a horric practice that has no place in todayrsquos society, Cllr Brown declared.ldquoConversion therapy is a term used to refer to ious dangerous and discredited practices aimed at changing an inidualrsquos sexual orientation or gender identity.ldquoThat could include attempting to change someonersquos sexual orientation from lesbian, gay or bisexual to straight or their gender identity from transgender or non-binary to cisgender.Cllr Brown said this disgraceful practice should not be accepted and permanently banned through legislation.Cllr Byrne mdash who is the SDLP group leader mdash said the fact that the issue was being debated in  was ldquobeyond distressing and as conversion therapy was still openly being practised.ldquoWe canrsquot look at the LGBT community and ask us to speak about it without your support, he told colleagues. ldquoWe need everyone in the chamber to support it and I hope they do.ldquoWe have heard the disappointing and weak response from the equalities minister on the conversion therapy debate in early March and we have waited almost , days since the UK government announced its intention to ban this therapy and we should not have to wait any longer.ldquoItrsquos long past time that the NI Executive stood up together to ban what I think are abusive practices in Northern Ireland and right across the UK, banning all interventions that have the intention of changing, suppressing, converting or cancelling sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression.Cllr Byrne said that growing up as gay, he found it incredibly dficult, explaining to his colleagues that he could not express how dficult it had been.ldquoMentally, you torture yourself, you question yourself and you close down, block out your feelings. You literally wear a mask every single day, praying that you donrsquot say something that will give you away.ldquoYou endure enough mental anguish to last a dozen letimes so, to me, when I look back, that is you internally practising a form of conversion therapy on yourself. It is shameful, but that is how you feel growing up, suppressing your own sexual orientation and every LGBT+ person knows the damage that it does, he said, emphasising that allowing conversion therapy to be practised openly or signposting people towards it is ldquobeyond depressing.Cllr Byrne said for most of those in the gay community they ldquogenerally breathe for the first time when they let it all out and to be true to yourself, explaining that the dficulties do not stop there.ldquoYou are confronted as a gay person by many situations that challenge you mentally and while people say lsquothat is the cross you have to bearrsquo it should not be, he continued. ldquoThere is nothing about my sexuality that needs fixed, nothing about it that needs intervention.Cllr Cathy Mason, who seconded the motion, said the practice of conversion therapy sought to ldquodenormalise or completely eradicate a personrsquos sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression and was deeply rooted in ldquointolerance and bigotry.She said those who conducted the therapy regularly exploited the vulnerabilities of young people struggling with their sexuality.She described conversion therapy as a ldquodeeply harmful and regressive practice and that there must be no loopholes on the legislation governing it.Cllr Hanna said the DUP would abstain on the motion, making it clear he had no problems with anyone and takes everyone as he finds them and that conversion therapy was ldquosomething that he would not wish on anyone.Cllr Willie Clarke said no one had the right to question another personrsquos sexuality, while Cllr Reilly askedpeople were ldquoforced into conversion therapy, explaining that he did not know about the issue.However, he suggested that to ban something because ldquoyou did not like a personrsquos ideology or philosophy was the start of a dark path.He said there was a wider context to the issue and that he had a lot of respect for Cllr Byrne.

I thought he did it excellently, he had such short time but he had the room laughing and I think everyone really appreciated it.While Mr Lindsay also met him at St Jamesrsquo Palace in London, it was another Hillsborough Castle event that Prince Philip shared his robust opinion.ldquoThere was only the one time that I talked to him for about two minutes at Hillsborough gates and there was a statue there that he didnrsquot think very much of and he told me, which was quite funny, recalled Mr Lindsay.ldquoI was once lucky enough to have a short private conversation with the Queen but that was all I managed with the Duke unfortunately.Mr Lindsay commended the Duke for the positive impact and benefit his award scheme had on young people.ldquoI do strongly support the Duke of Edinburghrsquos Award scheme, as I support all groups who help develop and support young people, said Mr Lindsay. ldquoThere is no doubt about it, these groups who help young people make a huge dference as to how people develop as adult and help keep the more vulnerable children away from undesirable habits.ldquoI take my hat off to him being behind a scheme which has been an outstanding success and copied around the world as well.He revealed that previous plans for the aftermath of the Dukersquos death had advised there were to be no memorial services for  days after his death which subsequently had been changed to  days.Mr Lindsay said: ldquoAll along the Duke said that he did not want any particular arrangements and I agree.

I had been told it was good for anxiety which I have struggled with, so I thought I may try it myself, said Lorna.ldquoOnce I tried it for the first time, I was hooked. It sends sensations up your body and brings an overwhelming sense of calmness to you. Itrsquos a complete form of tranquility.Cold water swimming has been reported to help people who struggle with depression and anxiety as well as slowing down the onset of dementia and help with the effects of menopause. It also has been reported to increase happiness, give your body better circulation and to help build your immune system.Although an advocate for cold water, Lorna also stressed the importance of safe swimming, especially when the temperature s to near freezing.ldquoItrsquos a good place to be when yoursquore in the water. I think the colder it is then the more benefit you get from it, she said. ldquoHowever, you obviously have to be careful when yoursquore going in, especially during harsher weather you have to limit your time.ldquoIf you go into it and yoursquore not used to having your breathing under control, your body can go into an uncontrollable shock. Start slowly and get your body into control. Irsquove seen people walk in and run out again almost immediately, but once you get used to the process you just feel happy, calm and relaxed and you want to stay in longer.After stressing iables which must be taken into account before hitting the waters, Lorna also lists some essential tips for beginners thinking of giving it a try.ldquoAlways take someone with you in case something goes wrong. Try and find a safe beach, which I know could be more challenging as we have to stay local she said.Since lockdown, Irsquove been restricted so I would travel to the end of the quay in Killyleagh and swim down there. You have to consider the effects of rip tides as they can come close to the shore and can be a very real danger.Lorna recommends those who are thinking of giving it a try to bring a wetsuit, neoprene socks, a hat, gloves, dry robe, hot drinks and possibly a hot water bottle for afterwards.Swimmers should always aim to gradually heat their body once out of the water by adding layers to prevent going into a hypothermic shock.Also, they are advised to bring a floating aid to be seen safely and wear bright clothes.Lorna, a NHS care worker, first got involved with wild swimming after a colleague informed her of a Bangor-based group called Dash and Splash.Since then, more and more groups have took to the waters in local places such as Newcastle, Ballyhornan and Whiterock. Lornarsquos native Killyleagh have recently formed the cold water group Dippy Flipper swimmers.These groups are highly recommended to beginners as they have invaluable knowledge of the waters they are swimming in..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/14Apr2021-family.jpg","title":"McAlister family raises £3k for Marie Curie nurses  ","story":"A DRUMANESS family have helped raise over pound, for Marie Curie nurses in memory of local woman Peggy McAlister.The money was raised through a series of Easter activities including a virtual raffle and a socially distanced visit to homes in the village from the Easter bunny.Peggy, who was a well known figure in Drumaness, sadly passed away in August .

Thatrsquos been a big bonus, Irsquove played a few minutes more than I thought I would when I signed.ldquoI have settled in well, which is not always the case when you move clubs. Accrington have a great group of lads on the team and theyrsquove made the transition easy for me. Similarly with the manager, John Coleman. So far hersquos been great with me and is giving me the minutes on the pitch.The highly sought after Morgan didnrsquot take long to make his mind up on his move to Accrington, which is less than  miles away from his home, with everything falling into place at the right time.ldquoI was part-time at Southport so being full-time now with Accrington makes le a lot easier. One thing that crossed my mind about having to move clubs is that Irsquove two young children and one is at school. Itrsquos not easy for children to move so in all respects of teams that may have been interested in me, itrsquos the perfect situation not having to move home said Morgan.The midfielder also noted the dference of both training and playing level at his new club, and how he has adapted to his new surroundings on the pitch.ldquoI treated Southport as a full-time role, despite only training two times a week. Irsquom in five times a week with Accrington. We get as much grass work as possible which suits me settling into a new team so I can understand what way they tick, he said.ldquoI hadnrsquot played for two months before I moved to Accrington, due to the league being cancelled at Southport. When I first arrived I was fit, but not match fit. I got thrown in at the deep end due to injuries and noticed instantly the pace of the game is a lot quicker. You donrsquot have time to take extra touches.Accrington Stanley are currently pushing for a place in the play-offs with just six games remaining before the end of the season.Morgan hopes he can help his new team gain promotion to the Championship, but he remains firmly grounded ahead of the next game.ldquoPlay-offs are the aim, every game is massive and we know that as a group. Everyone knows that is the objective for this season but we must take it one game at a time and not overlook anyone he said.Morgan is also looking forward to seeing theof fans, as he is yet to witness a crowd at his new club.ldquoOne of the big things Irsquom looking forward to seeing is the fans in the stadium. Football is not the same without the fans. You associate the two with being normal and you just want that back, he said.ldquoI want my family to experience the football league. They were constantly taking me places to help me develop as a player. I remember my dad racing home from work just to take me to training and I want to repay that with them watching me in the stands.The new No  also paid homage to his former club as he focuses on the next chapter of his career.ldquoIrsquove a special connection with Southport. The staff, volunteers, the team and the club as a whole is something I have a lot of time for. Irsquod love to have a role with the club further down my career to repay them, but for now, I want to be here for the long haul at Accrington.ldquoAt Southport I played my best football, so I want to take that form with me to Accrington.

In October, firefighters fought to bring a malicious blaze under control.They were back at the plant last Saturday just before pm following reports of a fire in an industrial skip which spread to a nearby metal container.Fire crews from Downpatrick and Ballynahinch brought the blaze under control within an hour of the alarm being raised.The fire at the waste oil plant came at the end of three nights of sporadic trouble in the area, with fires started in the middle of the Killough Road which straddles the Model Farm and Flying Horse estates and missiles fired at cars.It is also understood that police on patrol in the area came across a pile of breeze blocks which were removed, fearing they would have been used as missiles to target passing cars.Cllr John Trainor mdash who was a passenger in a car targeted by petrol bombers late on Saturday night mdash has called for an end to the violence, which, he said, is being perpetrated by teenagers hellbent on causing misery for others.He believes that a partnership approach involving the local community, statutory agencies and the police is vital in getting on top of an issue which has resulted in a number of residents living in fear and others afraid to venture out at night.Just before .pm last Saturday, Cllr Trainor was approaching the Model Farm junction when a petrol bomb was hurled at the vehicle by a crowd of up to eight teenagers which included girls and boys. While the missile missed the car, it smashed on the main road and exploded.ldquoA fire had been lit on the main road and there is just no sense to this kind of activity, he declared.ldquoWhatan elderly driver had been confronted by a petrol bomb thrown at them and lost control of their vehicle  I have no doubt that last weekrsquos trouble was cleary pre-meditated.ldquoYou just donrsquot turn up at a housing area and discover petrol bombs. While what happened was clearly planned, it is not reflective of the hard working local people in the area.Cllr Trainor said there was ldquono sense to this kind of activity and questioned how the teenagers were able to get their hands on petrol bombs.He said there had been trouble at the Killough Road some years ago and that a targeted approach involving local groups and statutory agencies had made an impact.ldquoI think we need to go back to this model and there must be community buy-in. It is clear we are talking about a long term commitment as this continued trouble needs to stop. People have had enough and want to be able to live their lives free from the threat of trouble and violence, continued Cllr Trainor.ldquoWe need a strategy and action plan in tandem with an effective policing policy to deal with this issue and a pledge from partner agencies that they will make a long-term commitment. A partnership approach is vital moving forward and must include the local community.Admitting that he was not shocked nor surprised by the petrol bomb attack, Cllr Trainor said what happened could potentially have had ldquocatastrophic consequences with the behaviour witnessed over the past number of days at the Killough Road area nothing knew, insisting that it is in no way reflective of of the people who live locally.ldquoWe have a situation where people are not happy and a number are living in fear. Numerous scenarios could potentially have played out last weekend and I am thankful that they didnrsquot. The the fire in the road, the arson attack at the waste oil plant and the petrol bomb incident will be roundly condemned and rightly so. But they must not be allowed to continue, that is why a strategy to deal with the issue involving all stakeholders is vital.Cllr Trainor added: ldquoWe simply cannot have a situation where violence is prevalent in a part of Downpatrick where people are trying to get on with their lives. They do not need this. Throwing petrol bombs is not entertainment, it is criminality. Anti-social behaviour is often a symptom of other issues in peoplersquos lives which have to be tackled.Agreeing that the recent trouble is not reflective of the wider community, Cllr Oonagh Hanlon revealed that she witnessed some of the incidents including the malicious fires.She said it appeared that the blaze at the Macwaste plant was started deliberately and was ldquoextremely concerning given that the business was targeted last October.ldquoConsidering the highly flammable material stored at the Brannish Road site, it is a miracle that no one was seriously injured, she declared.ldquoCredit to our local firefighters who ensured that the fire did not spread. It is extremely frustrating that emergency services are being distracted from what could be more serious incidents and emergencies. We also had reports of petrol bombs being thrown at cars passing through the area last week.Cllr Hanlon added: ldquoIt is hugely disappointing and frustrating that this type of behaviour continues in this area. Do the perpetrators of these crimes realise the impact of their actions ldquoI would appeal to anyone with information about what happened and those involved to provide it to the authorities and ask the community to continue to report suspicious behaviour as people are fed up with the actions of a small minority.

The Prince will be missed most by his family, but he has left an indelible mark and the success of his Duke of Edinburgh award scheme is unparalleled.Terry said the torch for environmental issue which was taken up Sir David Attenborough so many years ago was one once carried by Prince Philip whose care for the such an important issue has been passed to his eldest son Prince Charles.He added: ldquoPrince Philip has left his mark on this world and there are many people from Northern Ireland who have met him over the years.ldquoThey recall a man with an infectious sense of duty and one who could also be humorous at times, using this aspect of his character to put others at ease.

The court sentenced five pro-democracy advocates, including media tycoon Jimmy Lai, to up to  months in prison for organising a  anti-government march, part of protests that triggered a crackdown from Beijing. He has yet to face six other charges which carry a possible le sentence under the draconian National Security Law introduced by mainland China last year.Others have been given twelve-month sentences. Some of these that have received suspended sentences include Martin Lee QC who is aged  and regarded as the founding father of democracy in Hong Kong and leading barrister Margaret Ng. One of the nine, called ‘Long Hair’, was sentenced to  months in prison.The former Alliance Party leader and Fine Gael MEP John CushnahanThere is nothing left of democracy and human rights in Hong Kong. The much heralded ‘one country, two systems’ no longer exists. The Irish government is morally obliged to use its position on the UN Security Council along with the UK and US governments to protest against the latest destruction of Hong Kong’s one country, two systems. In tandem with this, I belive all Irish MEPs should work together to persuade the European Parliament to reject the EU–China Comprehensive Agreement on China. The wider international community must also act. Moral condemnations of China’s action alone will not change Chinese policy. Their current arrogance stems from their rapid emergence as a global economic power en route to being the world’s largest in the next couple of decades. The only thing that will halt China’s aggression in the South China Sea region is when the international community including EU governments work together to do two things.l Firstly, to impose political and trade sanctions that threatens to undermine China’s role as a global economic power. The suggested expansion by Boris Johnson of the G to D to include Australia, India and South Korea which could happen at that organisations summit in June in Cornwall could provide a vehicle for such actions.l Secondly, by creating military coalitions such as an expanded “Asian Nato” as suggested by the new United States Asia Tsar, Kurt Campbell. It could involve EU members of NATO and would provide a counterweight to China.If the international community fails to act, China’s next target will be Taiwan.• John Cushnahan is a former Alliance Party leader, and Fine Gael MEP.

Throughout the pandemic, football has been an emotional and mental support during a dark time.The familiar highs and lows of Saturday afternoons have given the pandemic at least some sense of normality. A welcome distraction from the unremitting gloom of le under Covid.But, without fans in attendance, it’s fair to say that football this season has also been a pale imitation of its usual self. And no amount of fake crowd noise can make up for that.It’s this emotional connection to the game which makes the news of a European Super League this week feel like a slap in the face to the real football fans who have shelled out their hard-earned cash over the years on season tickets, travelling to away games and endless replica shirts.\u2028\u2028Of course, it’s no surprise that the faceless, billionaire owners behind the ‘big six’ have taken this stance.

To them, these fans are nothing more than a minor revenue stream in comparison to the riches of TV deals and global sponsorship opportunities.The iconic Jock Stein quote in full reads: “Without fans who pay at the turnstile, football is nothing. Sometimes we are inclined to forget that. The only chance of bringing them into stadiums isthey are entertained by what happens on the football field.”In the wake of the ESL news, perhaps we should add that the only chance of bringing them back into stadiums isthey feel invested in what happens on the football field too.Because, right now, fans up and the country feel left out of the conversation altogether.The breakaway plans, led by investment bankers and sharp-suited shills, threaten the fabric and future of English football.\u2028\u2028On the field, the competitive nature and ability of clubs to progress through the football pyramid will be reduced, while off the field, revenues will be in danger of collapsing. This will have a knock-on effect for our communities, not just our clubs.That’s why NationalWorld, alongside our sister titles across JPI Media, is launching For the Fans, a campaign calling for a halt to the ESL, and for fans to have more say in the future of the clubs they’ve grown up supporting, through good times and bad.It’s time for us to have a collective voice, and call on the authorities to protect our clubs and communities.But first, we want to hear what you think.Have your say on the European Super LeagueHave your say on the European Super League fans by filling out this survey, which should only take a minute of your time.You can also let us know what you think on Twitter and Facebook"},{"url":"http://www.penarthtimes.co.uk/news/resources/images/12527083.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

Photo Kirsten McTernanDiscussions about the opening of an arts centre in Cardf started in  and were part of a vision for a space where artists could produce and present work, free from commercial pressures. Experimental work was seen as key to its identity, and the needs of artists were at its heart.The venue was formerly Canton High School, and the initial period of set up was a demanding time. The founders, and a gang of enthusiastic and dedicated volunteers, lovingly cleared, restored and adapted the building to make it fit for purpose as Walesrsquo first arts centre.The first official Board meeting was held on  April  and in July that year Chapter opened its doors with a temporary cinema, gallery and bar, and with former classrooms used as studios, workshops and offices.

Every year, the venue welcomes , visitors to more than  film screenings,  live performances,  visual art exhibitions and  community classes, artisan fairs and events.Mr Eagle added: ldquoChapter is many dferent things to many dferent people. For some, it will be the international gallery exhibitions and the programme of independent films.\"For others, it will be the cafeacute bar and restaurant to meet friends before a Cardf City home game, or it will be for dance and theatre classes or a cup of tea before working in the community garden.\"But at its heart itrsquos a centre for contemporary art, supporting artists and creatives from Wales and beyond to produce and present work.Chapter works with practitioners at every stage in their careers, supporting and stimulating opportunities for exciting new talent as well as promoting the work of established artists.It is a springboard for the creative community of Wales with a focus on bringing the world to Wales and Wales to the world.Chapter is home to over  of Walesrsquo most dynamic creative companies and artists, including BAFTA Cymru, Printhaus, ie ie Productions, Everyman Theatre, Beryl Productions, Cardf Music School and Taking Flight Theatre. Chapter has remained open to this creative community during the pandemic.MORE NEWS:They also offer a range of spaces in support of local artists and companies for the research and development of artistic projects, including Hijinx Theatre.Like most art and entertainment venues, the last year has been one of the most dficult times for the organisation as they were forced to close their doors.

We are an arts organisation that generates almost all of its income through ticket sales, classes, hires, cafeacute bar and other activity.\"The small remaining amount comes fromArts Council of Wales and is used to support our arts and education programme. Our capacity to earn incomeliterally stopped overnight and that was profoundly scary.Support has been generated from extremely generous public donations and from a range of funders including Arts Council Wales, Welsh Government, BFI, Art Fund, Ffilm Cymru and Admiral.Since its closure, Chapter has offered an exciting Chapter from Home programme, consisting of over  virtual film screenings, online theatre productions and art exhibitions, monthly online comedy gigs presented by Welsh comedian Robin Morgan, virtual lectures with Arts Society Cardf, as well as outdoor theatre performances with Cardf-based companies including Theatr Iolo and Kitsch  Sync.Currently showing at Chapteris internationally focussed art exhibition Artes Mundi.

Depending on Covid guidelines, they hope to welcome customers back outdoors sometime after Easter, and they have been working hard to improve their outdoor catering offer to keep visitors warm and cosy day and night.Although Chapter canrsquot bring everyone together for a big Birthday party as planned, they will celebrate their five decades through to next April with a series of special events, activities and online content - they particularly have some exciting plans for outdoor events this summer.Mr Eagle said: ldquoNeedless to say  is not the year we were anticipating for our th!ldquoWhile the move to digital is great in many ways, ultimately, people want to be able to enjoy themselves and meet and do things in person.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIn what they say is the largest study of sink bacteria conducted outside of hospitals, scientists at the University of Reading discovered communities of similar bacteria that largely remain in drains after hand washing.Researchers found that there are signicant dferences between families of dominant bacteria depending on the location in the sink drains.They also found that plumbing systems such as P-trap or U-bend provide ideal environments for bacteria to grow.Hyun Soon Gweon, lecturer in bioinformatics for genomics at the University of Reading, said: ldquoThe mantra to lsquowash your handsrsquo to fight coronavirus transmission has highlighted the importance of not only good hand hygiene, but also the need for well-designed and regularly cleaned sinks.ldquoOur study reveals that the signicant dference in bacterial families between dferent buildings shows that a number of factors including occupancy and building design may have a big influence on the types of bacteria we come into contact with.Samples were taken from  sinks around non-clinical settings at the University of Reading ndash such as toilets and bathrooms in teaching, research and social spaces.They showed that sinks have a distinct microbiome dominated by certain bacteria.The plumbing area beneath sinks revealed microbial communities dominated by a group of bacteria called Proteobacteria.This included pathogens such as Salmonella and E. coli, which can cause serious disease, although the proportion of bacteria from that family was low.While higher concentrations of the common Moraxellaceae and Burkholderiaceae bacteria which can cause infection were found, these are mostly harmless to humans.According to the study published in Environmental DNA, the type of plumbing system had a signicant effect on which family was more abundant. vw,vw,px, px\"Scientists said handwashing could have a signicant effect on the bacterial communities of our sinks      While below-sink strainers were found to have Moraxellaceae bacteria, P-trap sinks had higher amounts of Burkholderiaceae.Lead author of the study Zoe Withey, a PhD researcher at the University of Reading, said: ldquoThe bacteria that live in our sink drains are shaped by what we are directly putting down them.ldquoWhile we expected that bacteria from the gut would have a greater impact, caused by the wider environment of a bathroom, it seems that by and large the bacteria living on the skin of our hands are feeding the community in the drains beneath sinks.ldquoThis means that we need to be very aware that what we are putting down our sinks is affecting the bacterial community underneath.ldquoThese areas may not be reached during routine cleaning, and this could lead to communities containing hardier, resistant microbes.The researchers point out that all the sinks where samples were taken were regularly cleaned.Dr Gweon added: ldquoWe hope our findings will remind people that the bacteria on your hands often stay alive and capable of growing even after they have been washed off, even in the presence of soap and warm water.ldquoIt is possible to spread bacteria to the surrounding areas of your sink, where they can grow and persist. Reducing transmission of bacteria requires thorough disinfection of the sinks and surrounding areas and not just getting your hands wet.The study was conducted in , prior to the coronavirus pandemic, so there is no direct influence of increased handwashing or other hygiene behaviour associated with the pandemic on this study.But the researchers say the signicance of bacteria from the skin means that handwashing will be having a signicant effect on the bacterial communities of our sinks..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Handwashing may be responsible for bacteria in sinks  u study article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This opportunity is in advance of opening the programme to the entire - age group by the end of April. Appointments are mainly available at the vaccine centre at the SSE Arena and bookings will be available from pm today. Appointments in community pharmacies will be made available to - year olds later in April as vaccine supplies permit. Health Minister Robin Swann said:“I have always been clear that we would move through the vaccine programme as quickly as vaccine deliveries and capacity allows as recommended by JCVI. I recently announced that we successfully administered over one million vaccines across Northern Ireland to the highest priority groups. This figure is expected to rise exponentially as the Trust vaccine centres and GP practices continue to deliver second doses while the vaccine centre at the SSE Arena and the community pharmacists push ahead to deliver first doses. Opening up to - year olds earlier than expected is a testament to the hard work and dedication of all staff who are delivering the vaccination programme in Northern Ireland. “I encourage those who are eligible to seize this opportunity and take up the offer of vaccination. Getting the vaccine not only protects you but also those close to you. I would also strongly encourage anyone aged  years or over who hasn’t booked themselves a vaccination appointment yet to do so as soon as possible.” In line with recent JCVI advice, those living in the same house with someone who is severely immunosuppressed will also be able to access the programme shortly, once their household has received a letter from their GP. Appointments at this stage are limited and the Department is asking for patience. If you cannot get an appointment immediately keep trying. Appointments will be more widely available by the end of April.
