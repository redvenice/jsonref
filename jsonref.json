Two months ago, 75-year-old Jim moved into a two-bedroom annexe specially built for him in the grounds of his 32-year-old daughter’s Hampshire home.It was constructed by Lauren’s husband Malcolm, 35, who runs a roofing and building company, as a thank you to Jim for everything he has done for his daughter.‘Dad had been in the pub trade for 20 years but with failing health it was unthinkable to let him continue as a publican any longer,’ says Lauren, a full-time mother to Cody, six.‘He was so stressed and has had heart problems and operations on his back.

They won’t reveal the exact cost – suffice to say it was substantial – but it was worth every penny.‘The moment Dad moved into the annexe in April, his stress visibly ebbed away – it’s like having my old, chirpy dad back,’ says Lauren.‘I pop over every morning for a cup of tea and a chat, and Malcolm has even built a firepit in the garden where the two of them like to sit and have a beer in an evening.‘Dad keeps saying that he can’t thank us enough and offers us money but we won’t hear of it.

I had an amazing childhood and as far as I’m concerned he looked after my siblings and me when we were young so it’s only right that we look after him now.’Meanwhile, Jim, who’s orced, admits he’s still pinching himself.‘I was too old and immobile to be in the pub trade any longer, but I was so worried about money and how I was going to live when I retired,’ he says.‘I’d used all my money to try to keep the pub going. Then I was at Lauren’s last summer and she told me, “Malcolm’s going to convert the garage into a home for you!” I burst into tears on their driveway. What Malcolm has done is absolutely amazing – there aren’t many people who’d want one of their in-laws living next door.‘I can’t give him enough credit. All my stress vanished the day I moved in here two months ago. Lauren even put a big bow on my front door. It’s wonderful.’ Other parents who are eternally grateful to their generous children include Arun and Shikha Tandon.When 65-year-old Arun retired from his job as a council director in 2014, he and Shikha celebrated with a £1,400 holiday in Kerala, southern India – paid for by their only son, 30-year-old retail manager Akshay.As well as paying for his parents to travel to India and the Scottish Highlands last year, Akshay gave the couple £2,000 to pay off a loan to stop them dipping into their savings.But perhaps the biggest gift of all was a holiday home in the beautiful Indian province of Rajasthan.‘It’s a three-bedroom apartment I bought as an investment for £60,000 in 2014 having saved really hard,’ says Akshay, who lives in a rented house in Aberdeen with his wife Alpna, 29, an account manager.‘But I can’t use it very often because I’m working and have a busy life.‘In 2016, I decided that I’d give it to my parents as a gift because I knew how much enjoyment they’d get from it now they’re retired.‘People might question why I didn’t just tell my parents that they could use it, but buying them a holiday home was something I’d wanted to do since I was young, watching how selflessly they sacrificed their needs to provide me with everything I wanted.‘They worked and saved hard all their lives to give me a good upbringing and covered my living costs when I did my degree and then an MBA at university.‘They also helped me to pay off my student loan when I got my first job after graduating. I love them dearly and it feels good to be able to treat them and make their lives a little easier.’Their son’s generosity has made his parents extremely proud.‘It gives us joy and satisfaction when we see a reflection of our values in him,’ Arun says.‘We are also thankful for the support – financial and otherwise – that we get from Akshay, who is our pillar at this stage of our lives.’And their son doesn’t begrudge a penny of it. ‘When I paid for Mum and Dad to go to Kerala, they hadn’t had a holiday in more than two years,’ he says.‘Spending all that money on them meant that I couldn’t afford to go away myself, but sometimes seeing your parents happy is even better than being happy yourself.’Who’d ever have thought they’d hear a millennial say those words? "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/06/23/00/15128488-0-image-m-38_1561247427197.jpg","title":"Fathers 12 WEEKS paid paternity leave Theresa Mays legacy plans","story":"Share this article Equalities Committee chair Maria Miller has been putting together a new set of famil-friendly policy ideas that could soften the Conservative Party\u0027s image.The parental leave for fathers plan looks very similar to one proposed in a report by her committee last year.That suggested the 12 weeks would be “use it or lose it” to encourage greater male involvement in the lives of newborn children.Three years ago, the government introduced shared parental leave, which gave couples the option of splitting 50 weeks of leave entitlement and 37 weeks of pay.However, take-up is thought to be a low as 2 per cent.

But it’s a sad reality of being a priest in London that I have to be ready with the last rites at all times.’Mr Lee, who appeared on last week’s Question Time to condemn the failure of politicians to get to grips with the knife-crime crisis, said he believes putting a stop to low-level crime would be a good start.‘I look around London and I see Sadiq Khan – who seems to be more focused on what Donald Trump is saying – and a lot of other politicians squabbling over Brexit, and it’s not surprising knife crime is as bad as it is,’ he said.‘I’m a firm believer that we need to take a stronger stance on low-level crime. If we can stop the littering and the loitering, people will start to be proud of themselves and of the area they live in.‘That kind of attitude will help curb violent crime in this country.’         Mr Lee, who took over the tough inner-city parish in August last year, said that his parents had been uneasy about his move to Tottenham with his wife and two young children because of London’s knife crime epidemicMr Lee, who is also a county commissioner for Greater London North East Scouts, revealed that he once met the murdered schoolgirl Jodie Chesney.The 17-year-old Explorer Scout was stabbed to death in an East London park in March. ‘I wouldn’t want to overstate my relationship with Jodie but I did meet her and she was, by all accounts, an extraordinary young woman with everything ahead of her,’ he said.‘Scouting is the kind of pursuit that gives skills for life. I’ve met so many incredible people who are involved with the Scouts and it’s horrifying to think a Scout could be caught up in knife crime in such a tragic way.’The vicar, who grew up in Ilford, East London, left school at 16 with only four GCSEs and few prospects, but said he pulled himself up by his bootstraps and believes the same mentality could help young people today.‘My teenage years were very wayward, to say the least,’ he added. ‘I always joke that I left school with hardly anything to show for myself but ended up studying at Oxford, which is where I did my priest training. If I can turn things around then anyone can.’Of the dangers he and his family face in Tottenham, Mr Lee said: ‘My wife thinks I can be cavalier because of what this area is like, but I have a job to do and I feel I need to get out and talk to people.‘It’s no good pointing the finger at others if I’m not willing to do everything I can to turn knife crime around.’"},{"url":null,"title":"After 4 000 years scientists set unlock secrets Bronze Age dagger covered gold shards","story":"Share this article Experts believe only children aged no more than ten would have been capable of such delicate handicraft.

But scientist Dr Christopher Standish, of Southampton University, is carrying out tests to find out the exact origin.One stud will be bombarded with X-rays to analyse the minute quantity of lead impurities mixed with the gold to reveal a telltale signature specific to one location.

He said: \u0027There would have been Bronze Age metal workers who were left myopic for their adult life. They would have been able to see only a few inches.\u0027They would have been unable to do any other work apart from the making of tiny artefacts and would have had to be supported by the community.\u0027The handle is estimated to have taken at least 2,500 hours to complete in six stages.

One end would be flattened to form the circular head of the stud and the wire would be cut with a fine flint blade.A tiny bronze awl would have been used to drill holes in the wooden handle, which would then have been coated with sticky resin.

It’s wonderful.’ Other parents who are eternally grateful to their generous children include Arun and Shikha Tandon.When 65-year-old Arun retired from his job as a council director in 2014, he and Shikha celebrated with a £1,400 holiday in Kerala, southern India – paid for by their only son, 30-year-old retail manager Akshay.As well as paying for his parents to travel to India and the Scottish Highlands last year, Akshay gave the couple £2,000 to pay off a loan to stop them dipping into their savings.But perhaps the biggest gift of all was a holiday home in the beautiful Indian province of Rajasthan.‘It’s a three-bedroom apartment I bought as an investment for £60,000 in 2014 having saved really hard,’ says Akshay, who lives in a rented house in Aberdeen with his wife Alpna, 29, an account manager.‘But I can’t use it very often because I’m working and have a busy life.‘In 2016, I decided that I’d give it to my parents as a gift because I knew how much enjoyment they’d get from it now they’re retired.‘People might question why I didn’t just tell my parents that they could use it, but buying them a holiday home was something I’d wanted to do since I was young, watching how selflessly they sacrificed their needs to provide me with everything I wanted.‘They worked and saved hard all their lives to give me a good upbringing and covered my living costs when I did my degree and then an MBA at university.‘They also helped me to pay off my student loan when I got my first job after graduating. I love them dearly and it feels good to be able to treat them and make their lives a little easier.’Their son’s generosity has made his parents extremely proud.‘It gives us joy and satisfaction when we see a reflection of our values in him,’ Arun says.‘We are also thankful for the support – financial and otherwise – that we get from Akshay, who is our pillar at this stage of our lives.’And their son doesn’t begrudge a penny of it. ‘When I paid for Mum and Dad to go to Kerala, they hadn’t had a holiday in more than two years,’ he says.‘Spending all that money on them meant that I couldn’t afford to go away myself, but sometimes seeing your parents happy is even better than being happy yourself.’Who’d ever have thought they’d hear a millennial say those words? "},{"url":null,"title":"Pioneering six minute cornea transplant surgery spell end reading glasses","story":"Share this article ‘I’ve lost count of how many pairs of glasses I’ve damaged or lost, but I now have 20-20 vision in both eyes which is better than I had before.’The procedure, conducted at the private Centre for Sight clinic in East Grinstead, West Sussex, involved Mr Daya cutting a thin flap in the top of Mr Parkes’s cornea – the clear surface of the eye that allows in light – with a low-powered laser.He then inserted a 3mm dot of corneal tissue – a quarter as thick as a strand of human hair – and closed up the tiny incision.The transplant sufficiently changed the direction of light rays entering Mr Parkes’s eye for the previously long-sighted patient to be able to focus on nearby objects again.         The new surgical technique could eliminate the need for reading glasses among some peopleLong-sightedness is progressive and caused by the gradual stiffening of the natural lenses in eyes as people age. It makes it harder for the eye muscles to pull the lenses into a rounder shape, which is required to focus properly on nearby objects.However, the addition of a convex layer in the form of the corneal transplant ‘fattens’ the focusing equipment and solves the problem. Laser eye surgery, which reshapes the cornea, produces a similar result but unlike the transplant is irreversible.While laser surgery is popular and usually successful, Mr Daya said results could be variable. ‘The beauty of this procedure is you are adding material, not taking it away,’ he said. ‘If it doesn’t work for some reason, it can be removed and you can add in a different sized corneal inlay.’A patient has only one eye treated, even if they are long-sighted in both because the brain is able to create a ‘blended vision’ giving the impression of almost perfect distance and near sight.Mr Parkes’s operation was part of a global trial of 100 patients sponsored by US firm Allotex which ‘makes’ the corneal implants. The corneas come from willing donors after their deaths.If the trials are successful, the procedure is likely to become available to patients prepared to pay several thousands pounds from next year.It is thought unlikely to be offered by the NHS, at least in the near future. "},{"url":null,"title":"Budget airlines charging fly cases passengers","story":"Share this article Our reporters found shocking examples on five different airlines providing flights across Europe. If holidaymakers want to buy a £48.57 return flight to Faro from London Southend on the easyJet website, they would be recommended a \u0027luggage selection\u0027 that cost them £69.23. The cost of a £29.98 trip to Copenhagen with Ryanair from London Stansted was significantly increased when our reporters were charged £50 to check in a 20kg suitcase.

Her plight is harder to bear because her elder sister Kemi, with whom she lives in East London, has always been a British citizen as she was born before the changes to the Act. Ms Thomas believes she is a victim of the Home Office becoming over-zealous after then Home Secretary Theresa May introduced a ‘hostile environment’ towards illegal migrants in 2012.The policy resulted in the Windrush scandal, which saw dozens of long-standing British citizens deported because they lacked papers proving their right to be in the country.Ms Thomas, 36, who has performed on the BBC, said: ‘My parents came here at the end of the Windrush era.‘I had a National Insurance number, I had my birth certificate, I’d got a driving licence, a bank account, I went to college. At no point during that process was there any indication I was doing anything incorrectly. I believe that I am British.’Although she was born in Scotland, Ms Thomas lived with her father in Nigeria between the ages of three and 18. She thought she had dual British-Nigerian nationality when she returned to Britain. She applied for a UK passport when she was 25 but she was refused. She was granted temporary discretionary leave to remain and told she could apply for permanent residency.But two weeks ago, Ms Thomas received a letter saying her application had been unsuccessful, and that she had to leave within 14 days or appeal, or face detention and deportation without notice.         New rules require documentary evidence of the right to be here, which many Windrush children do not have as anyone who arrived in the UK from a Commonwealth country before 1971 was given indefinite leave to remain, meaning many did not apply for a British passportThe letter revealed her right to remain had been granted only because she had been in a long-term relationship with a British citizen. It went on to explain that her right was withdrawn after she told the Home Office that the relationship had ended.She said: ‘I thought it was about my own situation having been born here and spent all my adult life here, but they weren’t interested in that.’She has chosen to appeal on human rights grounds and her case has been taken up by Liberal Democrat peer Lord Roberts, who intends to bring up her case with a Home Office Minister. But Ms Thomas remains in limbo as her case could take up to eight months to reach its conclusion. Her US performing debut at the Ford Theatre in Los Angeles in October is now in doubt and she estimates that fighting her case so far has cost £7,000 in legal fees.Ms Thomas’s lawyer, Fahad Ahmed, said she missed out on automatic citizenship by a matter of months and added: ‘Courts take a less harsh view than the Home Office, and if someone can prove their life is here, the courts will use their discretion.’The Home Office said: ‘All immigration applications are considered on their inidual merits.’Ironically, Ms Thomas’s story emerged as the first National Windrush Day was held yesterday – and as Mrs May announced that a memorial to the Windrush Generation will be built at Waterloo Station in London as a legacy to ‘their tremendous contribution’ to Britain. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/06/23/00/15128488-0-image-m-38_1561247427197.jpg","title":"Fathers 12 WEEKS paid paternity leave Theresa Mays legacy plans","story":"Share this article Equalities Committee chair Maria Miller has been putting together a new set of famil-friendly policy ideas that could soften the Conservative Party\u0027s image.The parental leave for fathers plan looks very similar to one proposed in a report by her committee last year.That suggested the 12 weeks would be “use it or lose it” to encourage greater male involvement in the lives of newborn children.Three years ago, the government introduced shared parental leave, which gave couples the option of splitting 50 weeks of leave entitlement and 37 weeks of pay.However, take-up is thought to be a low as 2 per cent.

But now a portrait of one of history’s most formidable women by one of the world’s greatest painters has been rediscovered – and it will go under the hammer next month.The Portrait of Olimpia Maidalchini Pamphilj, painted in the mid-17th century by the Spanish master Diego Velázquez, has undergone painstaking authentication and conservation by Sotheby’s since it was brought to the auction house’s Amsterdam office 18 months ago.With an estimated price of £2m-£3m, it could be bought by either a private collector or a world-class museum. “Velázquez is one of the absolute stand-out titans of European and world painting. This portrait is unquestionably of interest to scholars and admirers of Velázquez alike,” said James Macdonald, Sotheby’s senior specialist in Old Master paintings.It is also a rare depiction of the most influential, avaricious and manipulative woman in 17th-century Rome. Olimpia Maidalchini Pamphilj was the power behind the papal throne, and the reputed lover as well as sister-in-law of Pope Innocent X. Nicknamed Papessa – the lady pope – Donna Olimpia was an ardent feminist, championing Rome’s prostitutes and nuns alike.She was a “baroque rock star”, according to Eleanor Herman, author of Mistress of the Vatican: the True Story of Olimpia Maidalchini. “Women from all over the Catholic world came to Rome to station themselves outside her palace and cheer as her carriage rolled out.“They could not believe that a female from modest beginnings had risen to such heights, running the nation of the Papal States and the Catholic church, an institution where women were not – and still are not – allowed any power at all.”Donna Olimpia determined foreign policy and chose cardinals. Kings and queens across Europe sent gifts of gold and diamonds to curry favour. No decision was taken by Pope Innocent before consulting his sister-in-law. “People in Rome hung banners over the pope’s name on public buildings that read Pope Olimpia I. Medals were minted showing her wearing the papal tiara and sitting on the throne of St Peter,” said Herman.But the men of the papal court despised and feared her. One cardinal deplored the “monstrous power of a woman in the Vatican”. Another contemporary said that never before had a pope allowed himself to be “so absolutely governed by a woman”. Another cardinal said that the government of Rome was “in the hands of a whore”.Roman artists, musicians, playwrights and sculptors enjoyed her patronage. She was behind the commissioning of the Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi, the extravagant fountain in the Piazza Navona that is today a major tourist attraction.“She was a woman of fierce passions, keen intelligence and great charm, who protected weaker women against the injustices of men. She was also greedy, calculating and at times chillingly cold,” said Herman. Soon after her death from bubonic plague in 1657, the Catholic church “moved to eradicate the scandalous memory of this audacious woman who had ruled them all”.Several years earlier, Velázquez had made his second trip to Rome, during which Donna Olimpia sat for the master. “Her character was captured in this portrait – you can see she was a pretty stern inidual,” said Macdonald.Ownership of the portrait – a companion to Velázquez’s Cardinal Camillo Massimi, which now hangs at Kingston Lacy, a National Trust house in Dorset – was meticulously documented until 1724. “Then the trace went cold,” said Macdonald.Now it is known that the painting ended up in the Netherlands, where in the 1980s it was offered at auction as the work of “anonymous, Dutch school”. It was bought by a private collector, who bequeathed it to its present owner.Sotheby’s showed the painting to Velázquez experts in the UK and elsewhere in Europe. Macdonald recalled: “Bit by bit, the jigsaw fell into place. It was incredibly exciting. Everyone who saw it was amazed that this picture, long deemed lost and thought probably to have been destroyed, had actually risen from the ashes.”The painting will be offered at a Sotheby’s sale of Old Masters in London on 3 July, alongside works by Gainsborough, Constable, Turner, Rubens, Botticelli and Brueghel, collectively estimated to be worth up to £66m."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e0190188cf194874b9778e438927cc0eb448c68/0_0_3500_2354/master/3500.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4c3eb1fe6018ddbb413c9a4a77391557 960w","title":"on chapel sands laura cumming extract memoir mother","story":"In an exclusive extract, the Observer’s art critic tells the remarkable story of how her mother was abducted as a child – and how it was covered upThis is how it began, and how it would end, on the long pale strand of a Lincolnshire beach in the last hour of sun, the daylight moon small as a kite in the sky. Far below, a child of three was playing by herself with a new tin spade. It was still strangely warm in that autumn of 1929, and she had taken off her plimsolls to feel the day’s heat lingering in the sand beneath her feet. Short fair hair, no coat, blue eyes and dress to match: that was the description later given to the police. She had come out of the house that afternoon and along the short path to the beach with her mother, Mrs Veda Elston. They had already been there for some time, with biscuits in an old tartan tin, digging and sieving the sand. The tide was receding when they arrived, the concussion of waves on the shore gradually quietening as the day wore on by now the sea was almost half a mile in the distance. In this lull, on their own familiar beach, and so comfortingly close to home, Veda must have let her daughter wander free for a moment. For she did not see what happened next.Someone moved swiftly across the beach and began talking to the little girl. Someone she perhaps knew, because no sounds were heard as they coaxed her away. One minute she was there, barefoot and absorbed, spade in hand, seconds later she was taken off the sands at the village of Chapel St Leonards apparently without anybody noticing at all. Thus was my mother kidnapped.I see the scene again and again, always trying to grasp the unfathomable moment in which she vanished and everything changed. The place where she was playing empties into air the tide freezes the beach turns blank. Time stands still on the shore. How many minutes before her absence begins to register, before Veda becomes uneasy and then fearful, before the silence is broken by shouting and rushing to the spot where the spade lies fallen? The waves continue their impervious lapping, gulls drifting on the surface as the afternoon fades. How long before anybody missed my mother?I have the police report of that day. It is scant. Mrs Elston takes her daughter to the beach at or around 2.30pm. Approximately two hours later, the child disappears so fast that she couldn’t have got anywhere near the water. Unable to find her on the sands, Mrs Elston retraces their steps, searching the path and even the house in case she might have found her way home. Neighbours help look for the child. An urgent telegram is sent to the father, who is away for work, summoning him back to Chapel.All of this is duly reported to the police, but not until the following day and not, I suspect, by Veda. I hear instead the brusque authority of my grandfather George. Veda appears silent with shock. All she offers, via her husband, is the possibility that the child must have wandered up the beach behind her and out of sight. She herself was sitting on a blanket, knitting or staring dreamily out to sea in the mild afternoon sun, as I imagine it, with one eye on the child, occasionally plying her with biscuits – until she just slipped out of view. Perhaps the crisis was not immediately apparent. After all, the beach at Chapel was so innocent, like the child and her little legs could not have carried her far. But then came darkness with no trace, and more stricken searching, before Veda had to spend the first dreadful night alone without her daughter.How could she have disappeared? The beach, to begin with, is completely flat. A broad street of spotless sand, scattered with angel-wing shells, it seems to stretch forever in both directions. There are no coves, dunes or rocks where an adult could hide a child everything stands in open view.To reach it, you must walk up and over an artificial incline of heaped sand that is supposed to act as a barrier to the sea a barrier so ineffectual that houses, cattle and villagers have been swept away in historic storms. This little embankment runs for miles along the coastline and from its top people can be seen walking far away in the distance. Tennyson, the Victorian poet born and raised not far from Chapel, was drawn back to it all through his life. “I used to stand on this sand-built ridge,” he wrote in old age, “and think it was the spine-bone of the world!”Veda’s mother once saw Tennyson on Chapel Sands: pressing along against the strident north-easterly winds, black cloak blowing, hat held on in brows-down melancholy.Come over this ridge and even more surprising than the flatness is the way the sand appears to merge with the sea. The beach is tawny brown and so is the brine, because it washes over beds of clay. On a still day they become one vast continuous expanse, an optical illusion only dispelled when a chink of reflected blue sky gles the water or a sudden gust troubles the surface. Perhaps that stillness slowed the events of the day. Veda did not notice what was happening quickly enough. Nobody scrambled up that ridge in time to spot any hurriedly departing figures. Footsteps muffled by the sand, voices dispersed on the mellow sea air, all it took was a prolonged moment of parental inattention. No commotion. Nobody saw, and perhaps there were few other people there to witness the incident, for it was a weekday afternoon in October. Nor was this yet a crowded beach as it is today in high season. Black-and-white photographs from the 1920s show deserted sands or very occasional hikers in hobnail boots and straw hats buying tea from a hut by the Pulley, as they still call the narrow passage where horses once pulled cargoes of tobacco and paraffin over the ridge into the village.The beach was always Chapel’s livelihood. Boats went out for whiting, people searched for mussels, shrimped in the waves at low tide. Ships sometimes ran aground, stalled in the shallows, their debris washing fruitfully ashore. There might be wood for the fire, treasurable in those days before electricity and on Sundays people took bags and went coaling. Stranger things turned up too. A ship running guns lost its dangerous cargo at Chapel and soldiers had to be brought in to handle the live ammunition. A case of glassware was shared out among the villagers, not a single piece shattered. And once a crate of grapefruit spilled out across the sands, odd yellow globes never seen before by anyone except Mr Stow, proprietor of Stow’s Stores by the Pulley where in the world had they come from?All along the sea’s margin, curds of delicate foam arrive on incoming waves. My mother used to hurl them gleefully about, risking her father’s instant reproach. In winter, sea-driven winds direct from Scandinavia skim sand into the air, stinging the eyes and gritting the mouth. There are spring tides when the water feels warmer than the grey rain spattering its surface and blazing summer days when you can swim forever, it feels, along the unchanging shore. This level strand, with its inviting sea, was the great playground of my mother’s youth. She went there with George, paddling in the shallow froth, clambering about the tide pools, digging holes, drawing in the sand. He took photographs of her with his Box Brownie and even in those monochrome days, they show the beach at Chapel exactly as I knew it too, from the holidays of my own childhood.Photography gives us memories we hardly knew we had: the house where we were born, our infant selves, the embarrassing clothes we once wore. But the camera is also capable of giving us memories we cannot actually have because we were not there in the first place. This rare gift, this strange illusion of deja vu, characterises all of George’s pictures for me. He photographs his daughter on the shore, laughing in a swimming costume I remember as pale lilac, embroidered with a butterfly, though of course I neither saw nor wore it. She sits in front of a bell tent with a kettle brewing on a portable stove, its meagre flame the result of the purple methylated spirits that fuelled it, and I scent that sharp stinging reek. There is a picture of her beaming at the bottom of a gigantic hole which I know George has been excavating all day, the sand damper and colder the deeper he digs into the secret innards of the beach. She is carefully seated inside, in clean clothes for the camera. I am with her, smile pinned to my face too, waiting to be lifted back out.Every beach shot is ecstatic, and almost proverbial: my mother looks happy as a clam. Years of happiness, or so it seems, on Chapel Sands. I particularly love the sight of her perched on the shoulders of a sunbrowned man who bears his load with patient resignation. She is about five, so tanned her eyebrows look white, and the lilac costume is nearly slipping from her thin body as she lifts her arms like a gleeful reveller at a festival. The man’s name is Frank, and he is a friend of George, who is in his customary position behind the camera. But a line of apparently innocuous foam is stealing up behind them. Not many weeks after the picture was taken, Frank fell deeply asleep on an inflatable raft on this beach. The tide stole him away to his fate, a dark disappearance somewhere out in the North Sea.All the beach photographs in the Elston family album were taken by George. He would not yield his Box Brownie to anyone else, which is why he never appears on the shore with his daughter. But on the other hand, neither does Veda. I did not notice these absences as a child, leafing through the illuminated treasury of my mother’s early life, images to go with the stories she told, but of course they strike me every time I look as an adult. George Elston is there, recording the moment, but his wife is not. My mother has not a single memory of going to the beach again with Veda.The photographs in the family album are few and tiny, no larger than a matchbox, in a landscape-shaped book that is barely 10 inches by eight. This modest volume has only 22 pages, yet half of them are completely empty. All my life this puzzled me. For years I thought it was a matter of thrift but film for a Box Brownie was relatively cheap, even for a poor family like the Elstons. In fact, George appears to be selecting only the best images from many rolls of film for his album there are rejects in the back, and considerable time passes between one picture and the next. And time is precisely what I should have noticed. There are no photographs of my mother before the age of three. There are none of Veda, George and Betty together, and the whole narrative runs out when she is around the age of 13. One decade in the light, then many black pages.“Betty, Chapel.” This is written in George’s firm hand on the back of these photographs of his daughter. Other people drift in and out of shot, nameless strangers, now forgotten. But she is always given as Betty. Except in one stray image, slipped inside the back cover of the album, never attached, that does not fit anywhere in the sequence. This picture shows my mother as a young child on Chapel Sands, but with a different name on the reverse in an unknown hand. Here she is not called Betty. She is Grace.My mother was born on 8 August 1926 in the shadow of a windmill in a Lincolnshire village. One month later, she was christened Grace in the parish church. No father is cited on the birth certificate the child was to be considered fatherless. At the age of three, she was passed to George and Veda Elston, given this new name Betty, and taken to live in Chapel St Leonards. The Elstons were going to be her parents now. Henceforth, she was to be considered lucky.But she did not feel that way. As an adult she began to call herself Elizabeth, having always hated the name Betty, specifically for its associations with George. It was incredible to me, when young, that this abundantly loving woman could so have loathed her father that she would change her own name to be free of his reach. But I knew very little of her story yet, and neither did she. My mother did not see her own birth certificate until she was 40. She did not know that she was once called Grace, had no sense of her existence before the age of three. The knowledge of her early life came – and went – in waves over the years. Something would be established, believed, and then washed away then it would happen all over again, the arriving wave disrupting the old in a kind of tidal confusion. Even now, in her 90s, she has no idea precisely how or why she ceased to be Grace, but I know that it was before she ever reached the home of Veda and George. She stopped searching long ago now I must discover the truth of her story.The name they will be calling in desperation on the sands that day is Betty – Betty Elston, three-year-old daughter of the Elstons at No 1 St Leonard’s Villas, who are well known in Chapel. George Maybrook Elston – he always signs his name in full, with some flourish – is a travelling salesman. He sells industrial textile soaps, setting off by train every Monday morning with a suitcase of samples to extol to factory managers across England all the way through until Friday. He is away on that autumn day in 1929. So Veda must try to reach him wherever he is, perhaps in Leeds or Liverpool in a commercial hotel. They do not have a telephone, and neither do any of their neighbours, so she goes to the post office at the back of Stow’s Stores to send that frantic telegram. Mrs Stow offers comfort Mr Stow gathers other villagers to join in the search. I suspect they have private thoughts about where she is, and even who might have taken her. Perhaps that is why the police are not involved until the following day. But their guesses will all be wrong.The hue and cry ran along the coast from one village to the next, from Chapel to Ingoldmells and Anderby Creek. If the missing child left any footprints in the sand they led nowhere, or faded out too soon. If there were witnesses who could offer something more useful than the colour of Betty’s dress then they never spoke up, even when the policeman called. The first day passed with no news of her, and then another by which stage the police could surely offer only dwindling reassurance. Three more days of agony followed. And then Betty was discovered, unharmed and dressed in brand-new clothes – now red, as if through some curious Doppler shift – in a house not 12 miles from the shore.My mother has no memory of these events. Nobody ever spoke of them at home, in Chapel St Leonards or anywhere else. It was another half-century and more before she even learned of the kidnap.The dead may be invisible, but they are not absent so writes St Augustine. We carry their influence, their attitudes, their genes. Their behaviour may form or deform our own. The actions of all these villagers have affected my mother right up to this day, most particularly the behaviour of her parents and those who took her. Her life began with a false start and continued with a long chain of deceptions, abetted by acts of communal silence so determined they have continued into my life too. The mystery of what happened, how it changed her, and her own children, has run through my days ever since I first heard of the incident on the beach 30 years ago. Then it seemed to me that all we needed was more evidence to solve it, more knowledge in the form of documents, letters, hard facts. But to my surprise the truth turns out to pivot on images as much as words. To discover it has involved looking harder, looking closer, paying more attention to the smallest of visual details – the clues in a dress, the distinctive slant of a copperplate hand, the miniature faces in the family album.I picture each scene, as we all do with puzzles, assembling the evidence in the mind’s eye. But the habit is also involuntary. My mother is an artist, my father was an artist it is the family profession. Every evening, after teaching at Edinburgh College of Art, my father would draw for hours in his sketchbook. These drawings took the form of lyrical abstractions of the golden mean, the cuneiform alphabet, the newly revealed wonders of the subatomic particle, occasionally a couple of highwire acrobats for his children. But recollections of the day would materialise too: a student at an easel, a bowl of spaghetti cooked by my mother, and all conceived within frames just as her doodles during a phone call would appear as finished tableaux. She might even draw the telephone itself, with its spiralling cord, add an elaborate table, then set the table with dahlias, all while hanging on for a dentist’s appointment.She taught me how to remember paintings in those long-ago days before I could take their image home from the museum in the blink of an iPhone: first draw the frame, then summarise the main shapes and volumes in rapid thumbnail. Rembrandt sketched a Titian in just the same way at an Amsterdam auction. Even the picturing of pictures is ingrained.This is almost the only way that I can think, in fact. And I have thought of this day on Chapel Sands all these years, trying to imagine who took Betty – “presumed stolen” is the police phrase – and how it could have happened, to gauge the force of it, the effect on her and on everyone involved. I picture Veda, bewildered, afraid, inexperienced, not long in charge of this child who is suddenly lost, perhaps never in charge of her again on the sands George, trying to control the situation at a distance, rushing home to take charge Betty, an inkling in blue, moving about the beach in the last of the light, and then gone. The more I have discovered, the more I realise that there was a life before the kidnap, and a life afterwards, and they were not the same for anyone.• The above is extracted from On Chapel Sands: My Mother and Other Missing Persons by Laura Cumming, published by Chatto \u0026amp Windus on 4 July (£16.99).

From an era of falling walls and blurred borders, of globalisation celebrated as an economic tide that would lift all ships, we are now witnessing a backlash of startling viciousness. Narratives of migration have been co-opted by rightwing politicians and their media cheerleaders, who discard both facts and human rights in their efforts to conjure old fears of invasion and cultural subjugation. Literary responses to political crises generally take years to percolate through – JK Galbraith’s definitive The Great Crash, 1929 was published in 1955 – but such is the urgency of the present moment that already there are a host of books, both fiction and nonfiction, seeking to redress the narrative imbalance around the refugee crisis and immigration more broadly.Dina Nayeri’s The Ungrateful Refugee is a work of astonishing, insistent importance. Like Hisham Matar and Viet Thanh Nguyen, Nayeri speaks firsthand of the refugee experience. She was born in Tehran in 1979, the year of the Islamic Revolution. Her mother was a proselytising Christian, and she soon found herself fleeing Iran for the Middle East, then Italy. She was interned at Barba, a camp in a dilapidated hotel near Rome. Nayeri ended up in the US, where she attended Princeton, Harvard and the Iowa Writers’ Workshop. She then travelled back to Europe, to the camps, seeking to find there some relic of her own life as a refugee.The Ungrateful Refugee interweaves Nayeri’s own story with those of the refugees she meets along the way. “In a refugee camp,” she writes, “stories are everything. Everyone has one, having just slipped out from the grip of a nightmare.” This is a book full of revelatory truths, moments where we are plunged deeply and painfully into the quotidian experience of the refugee. Refugees are trapped in the perpetual present: “The future brings anxiety because you don’t belong and can’t move forward. The past brings depression, because you can’t go home, your memories fade and everything you know is gone.” She visits a tent in a Greek camp whose occupants maintain it scrupulously. “It seems heroic to me, every scavenged and scrubbed item, the toil to keep her family’s dignity in this wasteland.” She notices that instead of pictures, they have teddy bears pinned to the wall. In a place where they need blankets and schoolbooks, there is a surfeit of stuffed bears. “They overflow from the donation bins. American and British well-wishers apparently are always sending bears.” Even the well meaning fail to comprehend the reality of refugee life.Nikesh Shukla’s era-defining collection of essays The Good Immigrant clearly informs Nayeri’s thesis. She recognises that the immediate migrant crisis is masking a deeper issue, the need to treat with dignity those to whom we offer refuge not to demand assimilation, but to recognise the integrity of their otherness. “Refugees have no agency,” Nayeri says. “Often, they are so broken, they beg to be remade into the image of the native.” It is through writing that Nayeri has managed to “undo the excesses of my assimilation”. It’s a powerful message about the need for such stories in a world that is suffering a collective failure of the sympathetic imagination, where political regimes and rabid rightwing media seek to portray migrants as an abstract, threatening mass, rather than a patchwork of inidual lives.Ali Smith’s luminous latest novel, Spring, draws deeply on her participation in Refugee Tales, a project launched in 2014 by the poet David Herd to draw attention to the voiceless hordes trapped within Britain’s byzantine immigration system. Britain is the only country in Europe where refugees can be held indefinitely, with many being locked up for months, even years, passing their lives in bureaucratic blind alleys. The latest Refugee Tales collection – the third instalment (I should declare an interest here – I had a piece in the second) – contains stories told to Monica Ali, Abdulrazak Gurnah, Lisa Appignanesi and Patrick Gale, among others.The Orphan’s Tale, rendered by David Constantine, is characteristic of the power of these narratives to move, to make the political coruscatingly personal. Constantine gives voice to M, a traumatised child from Sierra Leone whose parents were killed in the civil war. M came to England, was adopted, grew to be a young man, fell in love, and worked hard to provide for his girlfriend, for her daughter. Then “a clean white hand approaches and between thumb and finger takes hold of the end of a thread and delicately pulls. The unravelling has begun.”We follow M into the sinister and shadowy immigration system, where he is stripped of his possessions, his identity, his access to his family. We leave him in a cell, where he has spent years listening to “the howling of captive fellow human beings who have been told that early next morning they will be on a plane back to where they came from, however bad that place and whatever their loves and friendships, their loyalties, brave beginnings, notable achievements and aspirations here in this worsening land.”Alongside these stories whose horror and hopelessness has a galvanising moral impact, there are others that seek to celebrate the role of migrants in our society. In Our City, the historian and urban policy specialist Jon Bloomfield uses a collage of migrant voices to tell the story of the making of modern Birmingham. Bloomfield has carried out dozens of interviews across several generations of the city’s migrant population this is a book that speaks of the hope and courage of those who came to Birmingham in the 50s and 60s, when the UK government advertised in newspapers from Jamaica to Pakistan seeking workers for its burgeoning industrial enterprises. Bloomfield delves into each of the city’s immigrant communities – those from Kashmir, from the Caribbean, from eastern Europe and China – as they live through the rise and fall of British industry, the closure of Longbridge and the other car plants that employed a huge proportion of Birmingham’s workforce. In tight, energetic prose, Bloomfield shows how Birmingham’s second and third-generation migrant population embraced the move to a service economy and now look forward to the future with optimism noticeably lacking elsewhere in the country.Jonathan Portes is an economist and academic who wrote a New Labour-commissioned study on the impact of immigration in Britain in 2001. In his short, sharp and compelling book What Do We Know and What Should We Do About Immigration?, he uses the fissures exposed by Brexit as an opportunity to carry out a historical survey of British attitudes to migrants, then to contemplate the current state of discourse in the country. The message of the book is clear – in a war of competing narratives, the line on immigration pedalled by the rightwing press cannot be allowed to stand. An ideological battle must be fought with facts and stories that counter the dominant representation of migrants as a threat to economic stability and societal cohesion.In telling the story of Britain’s historical engagement with others, Portes draws on Robert Winder’s consummate Bloody Foreigners (2004), demonstrating the cycles of openness and insularity that have ebbed, flowed and coexisted over the past millennium. It’s evident, he says, that “political controversy over (and hostility to) immigration is anything but new”. He notes that The Merchant of Venice was written at a time when Jews were still not officially allowed into England. He cites the 1884 novel Simiocracy by Conservative MP Arthur Brookfield, which imagines a future where the Liberal government keeps itself in power by extending the franchise to apes and importing millions of African gorillas. There’s Oswald Mosley and the BUF, Enoch Powell and the rivers of blood, the Smethwick election of 1964, in which the Conservatives won on the strapline “If you want a nigger for a neighbour, vote Labour.” Then we have Theresa May’s “hostile environment”, the rise of Ukip, and Brexit.Alongside this insularity and xenophobia, Portes tells another story: one of a country that embraces others and is built on the labour of immigrants, from the waves of Protestant refugees in the wake of the Spanish Inquisition, to the Huguenots, the Irish, the Windrush generation, east African Asians and those from Bangladesh and Pakistan. Portes notes that in the 16th century, there were immigration processing centres much like those we have now, where immigrants were “allotted to various areas for settlement”. This was not a reflection of their undesirability, though, but rather “the need to take maximum advantage of this economic opportunity”. Britain has always been a refuge for those fleeing political persecution – among them Garibaldi, Giuseppe Mazzini, Napoleon III, Victor Hugo, Karl Marx.The book draws on a great deal of evidence to prove that immigration contributes positively to the British economy. “Immigrants do not take our jobs,” writes Portes, “nor do they make us poorer. Fears about the wider impact of immigration – on public services, crime or ‘cohesion’ – are overstated.” One of the problems, he argues, is that it has been politically expedient for the Conservative government to commingle two separate issues – austerity and immigration, a “shifting of the blame from political decisions on the allocation of resources to immigration”. He cites several studies that illustrate the lack of correlation between Ukip support and local levels of immigration, but a high correlation between austerity-related spending cuts and rises in support for the party. Brexit and the concomitant rise in extremism, Portes claims, are the direct result of the government’s attempts to rebalance the books in the wake of the financial crash. He ends on an upbeat note, claiming that “public attitudes to immigration in the UK are at their most positive in decades”.Despite the positivity of Bloomfield and Portes, it’s hard to look at the regimes of Trump and Orbán, the rise of Marine Le Pen and Nigel Farage, the persecution of minorities in Burma, Cameroon, Xinjiang and elsewhere, and not to feel that these are dark days we’re living through, that we’re less open, more inward-looking, less accepting of others than at any time in living memory. Nationalism, xenophobia, human rights, hospitality – these are both the stories we tell about ourselves and how we define ourselves in relation to others. It is these stories that shape the geopolitical world, that give us licence to welcome or reject those who come to us in need. One of the striking messages from this timely collection of books is that political systems are set up to treat people in general, rather than inidually, and yet each story, each life, demands to be read, to be acknowledged, on its own particular terms. In ignoring them, we allow the story of immigration bellowed by the rightwing press and self-interested politicians to be the only story.• The Ungrateful Refugee by Dina Nayeri is published by Canongate (£16.99).

It is not possible to prosecute that has been closed down, although iniduals can be.GPT has operated with only one contract for years, which the UK’s Ministry of Defence has decided not to renew. The MoD is understood to have awarded it to the US military contractor KBR instead.GPT said it did not intend to seek new business with other customers.In 2012, the SFO started investigating accusations from a whistleblower that GPT had used illicit payments and gifts totalling at least £14m to win a £2bn contract to provide communications and electronic warfare equipment to the Saudi national guard.Any prosecution would require the consent the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, under the Prevention of Corruption Act, but his department has taken more than a year to make a decision. Cox has yet to announce what he intends to do.Sue Hawley, the policy director of Corruption Watch, said: “It is disgraceful that the attorney general has sat on this case so long that the company is now effectively becoming insolvent, leaving no company for the SFO to charge and sanction. This level of political interference in a foreign bribery case is completely unacceptable.”Cox’s department declined to comment because the investigation was ongoing.Any prosecution could be politically awkward for the UK government because it could provoke a diplomatic row with the Saudis and might reveal that the government had approved of illicit payments.Anti-corruption campaigners say the decision on prosecuting GPT is a key test as to whether Britain is serious about tackling bribery and not repeating the BAE scandal. In 2006, Tony Blair’s government terminated an SFO investigation into alleged bribes by BAE, Britain’s biggest arms firm, in a huge Saudi contract following complaints by Riyadh.GPT’s sole contract has been run under an agreement between the UK and Saudi governments. The MoD has been responsible for awarding the contract and approving payments as part of it.The MoD has previously declined to comment when asked if it had refused to hand over documents to the SFO during its investigation. The SFO has reportedly interviewed two MoD staff and four former GPT executives.The MoD declined to comment. Airbus has previously said it had not been notified of a decision to proceed with charges in this case and that it continued to cooperate with the SFO."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51709e65ece3826b2856436c25dffd9b19c089c0/0_41_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a9cee1caf880ead251e233aa77cf0d2","title":"aston martin ceo andy palmer faces vote against 12m salary","story":"The chief executive of Aston Martin faces the prospect of a vote against his pay package as he faces shareholders for the luxury carmaker’s first annual meeting as a listed company.Andy Palmer has led the company since 2014, but investor scrutiny of his £1.2m salary – before a potential bonus five times larger – has increased as shares have slumped from the price at the carmaker’s much-anticipated stock market flotation.There is little prospect of Aston Martin losing the vote because the majority of shares are owned by Italian private equity firm InvestIndustrial and Kuwaiti investors. However, a symbolic vote against the binding pay policy would add to pressure on the company’s leaders.Aston Martin’s struggles in recent months have come despite making progress on opening a new factory in south Wales to make the DBX, the brand’s first sports utility vehicle in its 106-year history.Palmer is hoping the car, which will retail from £140,000-£160,000, will become Aston Martin’s most popular model, helping to double production.The company has also confirmed its Valhalla supercar will feature in the 25th James Bond film, scheduled for April 2020. Aston Martin counts product placement in the series as a key part of its marketing.Aston Martin’s valuation has fallen by almost half since October, when the shares were listed, to £2.3bn. The company disappointed in its first full quarter as a listed company, as higher costs from sales and marketing dragged on profits.Institutional Shareholder Services, an influential adviser to investors on governance issues, has recommended that shareholders vote against the company’s first public remuneration policy because of the “quantum” – the size – of Palmer’s potential earnings.In a report for clients, ISS said: “There are significant concerns regarding CEO Andy Palmer’s salary of £1.2m, which is well above UK market norms for a company of this size and appears to be pitched above similar positions at comparable companies.”ISS also balked at Palmer’s “extremely competitive” potential bonus and share awards, worth as much as £6m annually if certain targets are met.In a response to ISS, Aston Martin said it was “unique” and that Palmer was “one of the leading and most experienced executives in the global automotive industry”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/657e922beae6c1375c0ba621278ea49406225a60/0_255_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf8525edb2261b3816075edfde0cf929","title":"north of england needs more than to be a new london","story":"After five years, the northern powerhouse has to move beyond its big-city thinkingIt was in 2014 that the then chancellor, George Osborne, used the phrase “northern powerhouse” at the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester. His speech was set against a backdrop of steam-powered engines that had driven the Industrial Revolution in the 19th and early 20th centuries. But five years on, what exactly has been done to drive the north of England’s economy forward?But beyond the rhetoric, the northern powerhouse has helped to usher in a new era of devolution, with directly elected mayors in Greater Manchester, Liverpool City Region, Tees Valley, Sheffield City Region and, most recently, in the North of Tyne. Similarly, the momentum behind the northern powerhouse has arguably accelerated pan-northern co-operation and collaboration, particularly through the establishment of Transport for the North as the first subnational statutory transport body, and the collaboration between the 11 local enterprise partnerships in the region.And there is evidence that the north’s economy has strong foundations, with productivity growing at a faster rate than London between 2014 and 2017 and jobs being created at a greater rate than the UK average.However, the ability of the northern powerhouse initiative to deliver has been seriously undermined by austerity. There has been a £3.6bn cut in public spending in the north of England since 200910, with 37,000 fewer public sector workers too. This has not just driven down local economic demand but has reduced the capacity of local government to act in the interests of their areas.Also, when it comes to driving improvements in the everyday economy of people’s lives, the statistics tell a slightly different story. There are 200,000 more children living in poverty in the north since 2014. There are also 150,000 more people earning less than the real living wage – currently £9 per hour. Set against a backdrop of welfare reform, it is clear that many people living and working in the north are not seeing the benefits of increased productivity in their pockets.The failure of the northern powerhouse to engage with these stark realities and to devolve power and resources could risk the agenda running out of steam. Because, while progress has been made, the initiative has been overly reliant on a conventional economic approach that has prioritised city growth, trickle down and property investment-led regeneration.If this policy intervention is to survive, it needs to evolve into a meaningful programme of change.Here in the north, people need to see a change in who holds power, a change that brings economic prosperity for all northerners, and change that creates a fairer region in which to live and work. If Westminster fails to support this change, it will only exacerbate the sense of political and social disconnection that continues to make people feel not just left behind but kept behind.A better north is possible, but it needs a new approach. It cannot simply be about replicating a “new London in the north” that will simply import the capital’s economic problems – northerners demand and deserve better. So, five years on from its launch, the northern powerhouse must think beyond big city growth in isolation and recognise the potential of smaller towns, cities and rural areas.And it needs to be driven by northern leaders, with access to real resources, rather than by Westminster. Done right, it could be the means by which to realise the north of England’s huge economic and human potential and would benefit other regions and the UK as a whole.• Sarah Longlands is director of thinktank IPPR North "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f857caab081a06e58ebf6bb3cf8028626b4d0934/0_36_2150_1291/master/2150.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c259d76acbdcd679aba87e5e82252a29","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of needle","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘needle’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘needle’.Share your photos of what needle means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 26 June at 10am.

Which, of course, makes them all the more precious. Once in your hand, you can sneak off to a quiet place to rub your fingers over the skin, to lick lips and suck stones, or better still, to pass the bag around among your nearest and dearest. But so perfect a fruit is the exception rather than the rule.Still, we can always rescue an underwhelming apricot with the application of a little warmth. By which I mean an oven rather than a sunny windowsill. Whatever your past experience with this fruit has been, I encourage you to give them another go. Don’t give up on the hard, disappointing ones that promised so much in the shop. Give them time in the company of sugar or honey or maple syrup. Tuck them in under a pie crust or hide them in a crumble. Singe their edges in a frangipane tart or bubble them down into a loose-textured jam. Warmth and sugar will make even the meanest little apricot surrender their all.Apricots bring a touch of acidity to a lamb tagine (and to the sweetness of prunes, with which they are so often partnered), a casserole of duck or a stuffed pork escalope. Earlier in the week I placed a handful around a roast loin of pork with onions and aubergines. The snap of tartness was welcome with the sweetness of the pork and glossy brown onions in the same way apple sauce is, and the juices of the collapsing fruit soaked their way into the aubergine.It is the slight acidity that gives the apricot the edge over a peach in the kitchen. Peach pie is invariably too sweet. An apricot pie is the stuff of dreams, especially under a sugar-dusted crust of soft, almost shortcake-like pastry.Once you accept that it is the shopper rather than the shop that must bring the fruit to perfect ripeness, and that the most lacklustre specimen can be made to shine (even the most stubborn will submit after a day or two in a paper bag in the airing cupboard), the apricot becomes less of a challenge and much, much more a thing of joy.I suggest you ask the butcher to bone and roll the pork loin. It needs to weigh 1.5kg after boning. There will be plenty for 6 (in which case use 12 apricots). I usually roast a piece this size for 4, leaving plenty for sandwiches tomorrow (with salt and pickled cabbage or kimchee.)onions 4, mediumaubergine 1, largeolive oil 4 tbsppork loin 1.5kg, boned and rolled apricots 8-12rosemary 6 sprigsSet the oven at 220Cgas mark 8.Peel the onions and cut them into quarters. Slice the aubergine into rounds 2cm thick. Put the onions and aubergine into a roasting tin, season with salt and black pepper and pour over the olive oil. Lay the pork on top of the vegetables, rub the fat with salt then place in the oven.Let the pork roast for 25 minutes, then lower the temperature to 180Cgas mark 4 and quickly add the apricots and rosemary. Continue roasting for 70 minutes then remove from the oven, cover loosely with kitchen foil and leave in a warm place for 20 minutes. (I know this sounds a long time, but trust me, the meat will be all the more juicy for it.)Remove the meat from the tin and carve into thin slices then serve with the roasted onions and aubergine.Made in the style of a tarte tatin, but with apricots, which I prefer to the traditional apple, their slight tartness being most welcome among the blisteringly hot caramel and pastry.Set the oven at 200Cgas mark 6. Put the sugar and Marsala in a 21cm tatin dish (or frying pan with a metal handle) and warm over a moderate heat until the sugar has dissolved. Continue cooking until the mixture starts to caramelise, thickening to a syrup and turning walnut brown. Cut the butter into small cubes and add to the pan, removing it from the heat as soon as the butter has melted.Halve and stone the apricots, tuck an almond in the hollow of each, then place them, snugly and cut side down, into the caramel. Roll the pastry out then, using a bowl or tart tin base as a template, cut a disc of pastry 23cm in diameter. Lower the pastry into place on top of the fruit, tucking the edges in as you go.Bake the tart for 20-25 minutes until the pastry has risen and the fruit is tender. Leave to rest before turning out upside down. (Take great care with this, as the caramel will still be hot.)To make the cream, crack the cardamom pods, extract the dark brown seeds, and grind them to a fine powder with the icing sugar using a spice mill or coffee grinder. Pour the cream into a chilled mixing bowl and beat until soft and thick (stop well before it is thick enough to stand in peaks). Fold the yogurt into the cream, followed by the cardamom sugar. Scatter with flaked almonds and serve with the tart."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4499832fdae7e953fad81932cbb70e92bb1721bc/0_1324_3225_1935/master/3225.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d1a1c182a2adafd22a513ab9cba09e7","title":"notes on chocolate i was so wrong about the salted stuff","story":"Last week Annalisa was snippy about the salted stuff this week she is forced to eat her wordsToo soon the wrapper was but a graveyard of crumbs and memories.

Unlike some of the responses she had the last time around, he didn’t qualify his remarks by saying the performances were “good … for women’s football” or question the quality of the games.“He was just thrilled by it and enjoying the tournament,” she says. “And that’s the thing, it’s the same game, with the same goalposts – I don’t know where the debate came about that the goals were smaller – and you can get into it quickly. You’re not introducing audiences to an entirely new sport, it’s not chairball. It’s football! When they watch it, they realise..”Logan is enjoying a triumphant run anchoring the BBC’s coverage of the Fifa World Cup in France as its trusted voice and experience on the ground. It’s her sixth World Cup but the first in which the women’s game has been treated with anywhere near the seriousness afforded the men’s the BBC has committed to showing every game, of the tournament across its channels and the red button, with care made to show viewers back stories for the participating teams.Deftly negotiating tapas at her local in Beaconsfield, Logan is as poised and polished as she is on screen. “They weren’t going to put these matches on for small audiences,” she explains. “You can’t put something on without any knowledge that there’s an appetite for it, and the audience have pleasantly surprised us – they’ve been bigger than we hoped.”England’s win over Scotland set a record in the UK for women’s football, with 6 million viewers this is expected to climb for the team’s much-anticipated last-16 game against Cameroon today. Logan is warm but has a no-nonsense efficiency by her own admission, she can be brusque, gets frustrated by tardiness and slackness and lightly eye-rolls men on Twitter who see fit to comment on what she’s wearing on TV.At the height of ladette culture, Logan says she was frequently offered men’s magazines covers and felt anxious about not taking that route or “being pretty enough to be a broadcaster” but was determined to ride it out. “I remember consciously thinking to myself, ‘This phase will pass and I have to stay true to myself’. I wasn’t interested in drinking 10 pints and being in that world. I liked being a woman and I l liked sport I just had to wait until that was acceptable.”Now, she says, she is content. Her twins, Lois and Reuben, are almost 14 and she and her husband, the former Scottish rugby union player Kenny Logan, spend much of their weekends ferrying their children around to compete in sports. “I said to my husband recently that we should have had another baby and he laughed and asked how we’d ide even more of our time between them.”Logan is one of four siblings her younger brother died when she was 19 and he was 15. She talks openly about the strain her family suffered With her own children, she’s determined to make the most of their time together as a unit “before they move out and leave” and is chief organiser of family time. Mostly, she hopes she and Kenny have instilled “a strong work ethic” in them both. “My kids are funny, they’ll turn around and ask: ‘Are you sure we don’t have trust funds?’ And I’ll say: ‘Yep, I’m positive yes, where have you heard this form?’. Who talks about trust funds?!”.Logan is all about hard graft: since 2007, she has been a key element of the BBC’s presenting team, deputising for Gary Lineker on Match of the Day and anchoring the athletics and rugby coverage. This month, Amazon Prime announced it had won the rights to show 20 Premier League matches in the coming season and will be assembling a new presenting team could she be tempted by an offer?“You’ve got to feel valued,” she says diplomatically, “and realise market forces are at play but I’m doing jobs I love and my opinions are taken seriously and I have an influence on the people I work with I’ve done the hours.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcb77f7c5418f3c2b00805ed99b8c9322c951c5f/0_0_4099_2459/master/4099.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9aa7ae707adcc5460acb0650c809ee2","title":"roy keane leaves nottingham forest after five months at club","story":"Roy Keane’s brief return to Nottingham Forest is over after he informed Martin O’Neill he wants to leave the club to try to resurrect his own managerial career.Keane has been working as O’Neill’s assistant since January but the former Manchester United and Republic of Ireland captain has always made it clear his preference would be to start again in management, eight and a half years since his last position at Ipswich Town.His departure from the City Ground has been described as amicable and he will now start the process of trying to find a way back into the game.

Naturally, what this means to me is that the thought of meeting her is absolutely terrifying, so I sit down in the Parisian hotel where we have arranged to do the interview and tell her this. She is dressed in black, of course, her slightly hunched posture making her look more like her 64 years. She is sipping a tiny coffee, and isn’t remotely surprised I’m terrified.“People think I’m judging, but I’m not judging,” she says. “I’m watching. It’s different. People sometimes say, ‘My God her eyes will scan you,’ but it’s not to judge you. It’s to get ideas. It’s observation.”Well that’s all right then. French Vogue, under her tenure from 2001 to 2011, was a force to be reckoned with. It looked like nothing else. She believed in bold ideas and she loved boobs, even naked on the cover. She loved cigarettes dangling from models’ mouths. She loved fur. And she loved curves. She used unskinny models Crystal Renn and Lara Stone, and did a cover with the blonde, mainstream-looking model Carolyn Murphy prancing around with Andre J, a black transgender model in a dress and a beard. “Would Anna Wintour ever allow such a thing?” asked the American website Jezebel at the time.I have brought the current issue of French Vogue with me and we flick through it together. All the models are the exact same skinniness. “I do not like this,” she says. “I like older women. I like bigger girls. I like black women. I did everything first. But people forget, because people forget everything. I feel totally comfortable with everyone. It is my strength, to be open-minded, always.”It does seem to be true – she is even interested in my red handbag, which is made of fake leather, cost about £50 from a small animal-friendly brand she’s never heard of, and is bursting at the seams “because you put too much stuff in it,” she says, as if she’s my mum.After too many years spent reading all those books about how to be chic like a Frenchwoman and hating them so much I’d feel compelled to go straight out and buy one about how to date like them, too, and then how to raise children who eat like French enfants, I feel I should be expert in how to be an insouciant yet glamorous Parisian – except it hasn’t worked at all. I am not remotely chic. My love life is so English it’s practically Chaucerian. My child subsists on potatoes. So I want to ask this most Parisienne of Parisiennes for her secrets – can she make me chic? I have this scarf, you see, and every time I tie it in a knot it doesn’t look right. I ask her to tie it better on me, but she takes it off me and ties it better on herself – by not tying it at all.“Never a knot,” she says. “But I learned this from Tom Ford, not France.” She shows me that you either wrap it around your neck once with two long ends dangling down either side of your chest, or you fold it so it’s doubled over and half the length and then thread it through itself a little bit like a tie. Not a knot, you understand.I ask Roitfeld, when I look at a Parisian woman who doesn’t have much makeup on and is in a simple navy sweater and jeans and yet looks stunning, what is she spending her money on. What has she paid for that I can’t see? Is it a dermatologist? Roitfeld nods – I have hit the nail on the head.“To be beautiful costs so much money,” she agrees. “For something you don’t see.” She favours the aesthetician Hervé Herau for her own skin treatments, which she suggests are just a bit of cream, really. She is not keen on younger women getting Botox at all, while she thinks older women often overdo it. “I don’t want to name names but there are some who can’t move their faces any more. Like Cher.” Roitfeld also says that French style is quite conservative, so the chicness comes from a certain coolness in attitude, a lack of overt polishedness, as well as the cut of the trenchcoat, the quality of the shoe. But she insists she prefers English style “because we are not good at fantasy, French people. In New York you see all this crazy nail art and I love that, too, but we French are more quiet, discreet.”But how, how do I become chic? There must be a way. She looks at me sympathetically. “Chic,” replies Carine Roitfeld, “is innate.”In the years after leaving Vogue in 2011, her son Vladimir worked on convincing her that her name was valuable and that rather than keep only working for other brands she could become one herself. She was surprised, but she trusted him, and gradually they went into business together, launching her bi-annual magazine CR Fashion Book, her creative talent agency CR Studio, and now her Carine Roitfeld Parfums, for which she has created her 7 Lovers range, sold exclusively at Net-a-Porter, each perfume is named after a different fantasy lover from her imagination. So there is the English lover, called George, like our royal prince, “Yes, like him, your future queen,” she says, suggesting either a language barrier or that she knows something I don’t about Prince William’s son.George the perfume started off quite green, so she added a shot of cannabis and a shot of espresso to the mix, as you do. Then there’s Sebastian, who comes from Buenos Aires and is as dark and troublesome as the tango, and smells spicy and woody and is “a very selfish lover, the fight between life and death is what I want for him, he’s very proud of himself”. So he’s the one you shouldn’t marry, I suggest. “Oh maybe you should,” she replies, quite seriously. My Englishness floats around me like virginity.Her daughter, Julia Restoin Roitfeld, has also been involved, having taken a nude photo of her mother a couple of years ago that they decided to use for her marketing, after checking with Vladimir. “If he say I can do it, I can do it.” She says the French aren’t hung up on nudity like we are, although when her own Russian father would parade naked around their French apartment during her childhood, the neighbours did sometimes call the police, “because they didn’t like to see it in front of their windows. But he didn’t care.”Vladimir also encouraged her to put a Muslim model in a hijab on the cover of her own magazine. The model was Halima Aden, a Somali who was born in a refugee camp in Kenya before moving to America as a child, becoming her American school’s homecoming queen and entering Miss Minnesota. Roitfeld saw those photographs, used her on the cover and Aden now has a high-profile modelling career, having now appeared on the cover of British Vogue, too.“When I’m thinking about something he say yes you can do this no you can not do this. He gives a balance to me, which I need, because I’m a bit fearless, I can go too far. When I put this girl with the Muslim scarf I was not sure because no one did it before. But he say, ‘I think it’s you, do it. Even if some people kill you, it’s you, do it. You open minds.’” At this point I realise this went beyond a cultural or fashion decision – she genuinely thought she might get murdered. “And they do kill me, but it’s OK.”Wait, Carine, nobody killed you, you’re still here. You mean you were… criticised?“Yes, but a lot. It’s different in different countries. When you’re doing something new, it’s normal to have critics. Every time I did a new thing I get criticised, but funnily I do a new thing because it’s my way of thinking, my way of loving people. I’m very open-minded. This girl was so beautiful, and she wore her scarf, and there are a lot of girls in scarves in fashion now – you’re not going to put them away from fashion, they’re too big now.”I mention how multicultural British Vogue has become under its new editor Edward Enninful. It’s been a huge shift. “Yes, good! But he took my girl! He take my model! Halima become a huge voice now and great for her. I find other ones. It’s part of the world today.”On the one hand, CR is from a world of French chic that is, to me, impenetrable. On the other, she is really very funny and tells me that she likes makeup best when you only take half of it off at night “so you’ve got black smudged around your eyes the next day, and this is why people think French women are dirty,” and that she doesn’t follow the supermodel maxim about obsessively moisturising on aeroplanes, “because I’m always too cold, I just put my big sunglasses on when I land.” Her high-powered morning health routine is composed of the two major nutrients, “espresso and cigarettes”, and she doesn’t like seeing women doing their makeup in their cars, on their way to work. Because it’s vulgar? “Because it’s dangerous!”As for her own relationship with the mirror, “I’m lucky because I’m rather blind now so I don’t see myself very well, it’s much better. Although I have to do my makeup in one of those amplified mirrors. Horrifying.” She did ask Tom Ford to show her how to take a good selfie, help her find her angle, “but he say to me: ‘Oh, you do not have a good angle Carine.’ I say: ‘Thank you Tom, that is nice of you.’ He say: ‘No no it is better that someone else takes your picture.’ I say: ‘OK, nice, stop. Do not say that.’ So I do not take selfies.”She misses Karl Lagerfeld. “I really lost someone very important for me. My father died 20 years ago and Karl was… not a new father for me, but a protector.” Since he died in February, she has taken on the role of style adviser at his namesake brand.I ask if he used to phone her a lot, but no, he would just text her photos of his cat, Choupette. “He was the king of sending big bunches of flowers and handwritten letters. No one else does it like this.” We meet just before French Mother’s Day, and she has been thinking about this, the first one since his death. “I know I will not get my flowers from him with the card saying you are a great stylist and a great mum. Mother’s Day is different date in each country, how could he even know it was Mother’s Day?”She has become so tender at this bittersweet memory that I wonder, almost dreamily, what sort of mum she was.“I was very tough with them. Screaming at them. Brush your teeth, go now to school, go and clean the car if you get a bad mark at school, make your bed, clean the kitchen even if the maid is coming. Say thank you to the taxi driver, say thank you to the waiter in the restaurant. My kids are well brought up because I was so tough with them. But I was very dedicated to them, too.” Every Saturday she would take Vladimir to play football Julia every Sunday to ride horses. She sent them to a bilingual school in Paris so they learned perfect English and now they both live in New York. She feels confident her parenting was a success, because, as adults, “They are very polite, they’re working and they’re not taking drugs. And my daughter would never leave her apartment without making her bed.”So how does it feel to be the most glamorous grandma in the world, now that Julia has a daughter, Romy?“Oh, but on Instagram I see a lot of glamorous grandmothers. Andrea Dellal, who lives in Rio and used to be a model. She is very glamorous and she has seven grandchildren. Very funny and laughing all the time, which is what I love, and she has good bones. And she has this, which I don’t have,” she says, pointing at her lack of cleavage. “But grandmothers now are not like before. My own grandmother seemed so old with her white hair. I dye mine.”You wouldn’t ever let it all out and go fully grey yourself?“Never say never but… certainly not.”She says it’s only younger people who could think the problem with ageing is wrinkles anyway, and that once you get old, you realise that the real trouble is your back, and your eyes going. Roitfeld tells me that six years ago, she had a bad fall, leading to seven operations on her back.“I have very fragile bones. I got the ears of my dad and the backbones of my mum.”I ask if she is in pain at all times, and for the first time she pauses before answering. I sense she doesn’t feel able to admit it, or to complain. “I have some good drugs,” she says, slightly quietly. She then insists that she has to keep wearing heels because flat shoes are, according to her, not good for your back, at which point I realise that chicness is not so much innate as incurable.Even if she’s not leaving the house, there are three things Carine Roitfeld never fails to apply every morning: “A bit of cream, a bit of black, a bit of perfume.” And there we have it: my new mantra.That night, I try her trick of leaving on my eyeliner and mascara and the next morning, oh my goodness, the transformation has actually worked. All right, so it’s my transformation into a panda rather than a Parisian, but still.

But are ‘life extensionists’ any closer to finding the key to longevity? Alex Moshakis meets some of the people determined to become immortalIn 2016, an American real-estate investor named James Strole established the Coalition for Radical Life Extension, a nonprofit based in Arizona which aims to galvanise mainstream support for science that might one day significantly prolong human life. Standards in modern medicine are allowing us to live longer now than ever before. But that is not Strole’s concern. What good are a few more measly years? He is interested in extending life not by days and weeks, but by decades and even centuries, to the degree that mortality becomes optional – an end to The End. “The deathist paradigm has to go,” a line on the Coalition’s website reads. “It’s time to look beyond the past of dying to a future of unlimited living.” It describes its supporters as “early-adopting advocates, numbering in the thousands”.Life extensionists (or longevists, or immortalists) fit neatly into two types. The first are rationalists: scientific researchers at the coalface of gerontology, the study of ageing, chipping away at the many technical difficulties of ending entropy. Strole is the second type. A businessman, he has no formal scientific training, but is nevertheless resolutely committed to the cause, eager to rally behind new findings. He hopes to live indefinitely, or at least until 150. But he is ultimately reliant on researchers finding a way. Consider him less a gerontological groupie than a politely optimistic mega-fan, sitting on the sidelines of science, willing on a major breakthrough.He isn’t alone. Life extensionists have become a fervent and increasingly vocal bunch. Famously, the community includes venture capitalists and Silicon Valley billionaires, non-gerontologists all, and nearly all men, who consider death undesirable and appear to have made so much money they require infinite life in which to spend it. But now mere mortals are joining the throng, heads filled with fantasies of forever. Humans have lusted after immortality for as long as they have been alive. So far the quest has been unsuccessful – we still die! But good news: paradise is reported to be closer now than ever before, and private clinics and online pharmacies are promising to help get us there, “there” being the future, all of it.Strole has been an evangelist of human immortality since he was a child, when his grandmother died, and he felt “a pain you can’t even describe, it’s so deep in your gut.” He was 11, still new to the world, and he came to think of death, like most of us do at some point or another, as deeply unfair.In the early 1970s, when he was in his 20s, he began touring the US as a public speaker, sharing what was then limited gerontological research, but nevertheless extolling its possibilities and advocating the anti-ageing benefits of a positive mindset: “Isn’t life great? You can live forever if you really try!” Because Strole is not scientifically accredited, he mostly based his patter around inspirational healthy-living tips, much of which would now fall under the umbrella of common-sense wellness: exercise, eat well but not too much, look after yourself. But still his message seemed radical, and he was not always well-received. Audiences wary of Strole’s ideas condemned him for testing God’s will, or disrupting the natural order. His concepts ran counter to the common world view – that we live and then we die. Particularly aggravated spectators referred to him as “the devil”. Every now and then he received death threats.Nevertheless, he persisted. He considered himself fortunate to work in a field that meant he was privy to insider information and he became convinced a significant breakthrough was around the corner. To fully prepare his body for the rigmarole of centuries-long life, he adopted a strict health regimen. He fasted, juiced, cleansed and devoured supplements, inviting audiences to do the same. Eventually, a community formed, driven by a shared, urgent aversion to death. “We felt then how important it was to do everything you could to stay alive,” he saysStrole is now 70. He lives in Scottsdale, Arizona, a desert town. In the life-extensionist mode, he avoids dairy and rarely touches bread, though he devours a whole heap of other things. Recently his diet has included pills, branded “Cognitive”, which he takes twice a day and claims have all sorts of nourishing effects on his brain. (What good is maintaining the body if not the mind?) The pills are part of a self-directed anti-ageing process that requires a lot of swallowing. On some days, Strole takes 70 supplements, including a tablet that “energises the mitochondria” (mitochondria produce energy) and whose effects resemble “a shot of coffee, minus the jitters”, as well as vitamins, multi-nutrients and metformin, a diabetes drug that has become so popular among life extensionists that one referred to it as “the aspirin of anti-ageing”. In the early mornings, when the Arizona air is still brisk, he takes a cold dip in his pool to shock his immune system into better function, and at some point or another he lies face-up on an electromagnetic mat that whirs silently against his body and “opens up the veins”, and engages in a breathing regime that, he says, “balances the hormones”.These are typical life-extension strategies, though most people supplement regimens with their own ideas. Some fast. Others arrange expensive stem cell replacement therapies. To maintain a supple mind, the gerontologist Marios Kyriazis, who is in his 60s and heads the British Longevity Society, reads the newspaper upside down, and whenever that becomes too easy, he reads the newspaper upside down and reflected in a mirror. Think of it as an alternative to Sudoko.What good is all of this? The current life-extensionist strategy is twofold. First, achieve a “wellness foundation,” Strole says. Second, stay alive until the coming gerontological breakthrough. All that is required is to “live long enough for the next innovation,” and presuming you do, “You can buy another 20 years.” Twenty years here, 20 years there, it all adds up, and suddenly you’re 300. This is a common view. Last year the British billionaire Jim Mellon, who has written a book on longevity, titled Juvenescence, said: “If you can stay alive for another 10 to 20 years, if you aren’t yet over 75 and if you remain in reasonable health for your age, you have an excellent chance of living to more than 110.” To most, 110 seems a modest target. Why not forever? “It’s not some big quantum leap,” Strole says, by way of explanation. He invokes the analogy of a ladder: “step by step by step” to unlimited life. In 2009 the American futurist Ray Kurzweil, another supplement enthusiast, coined a similar metaphor, referring instead to “bridges to immortality”.Where to begin with the almighty question: why would anyone think this a good idea? Strole is openly afraid of death (who isn’t? He argues), though he seems more motivated by a kind of curiosity. We live our lives knowing they will one day end. Imagine what we might accomplish if they didn’t. (It is not clear exactly what Strole might actually want to accomplish: self-actualisation? World peace? That tricky jigsaw?) The American entrepreneur Dave Asprey, who is 46 but hopes to live beyond 180, and who takes 150 supplements a day, told me: “I can’t imagine running out of exciting new problems to solve!”This motivation is common – the burning desire to help – and it can be seen as morally virtuous or horribly presumptuous, depending on your opinion on the altruistic potential of a bunch of disproportionately wealthy, middle-aged men. (Is it possible the future will become a refuge for the rich, who experience life as a sequence of exquisite events and who might not understand the concept of entropy as relief or escape?) Few life extensionists openly admit to hedonistic impulses. “You can only smoke so many Cuban cigars,” Asprey says, “before you’re like, ‘I’ve got to buckle down.’” Though when I asked the British gerontologist Aubrey de Grey why indefinite life appeals, he replied, half-joking: “My hot tub.”De Grey, a serious scientist, considers life extension a health issue, which is perhaps the field’s most convincing argument. Gerontologists are not hoping to end death, he says. Instead, “We’re interested in people not getting sick when they get old.” No matter how much society rails against the concept of immortality, nobody really wants to suffer through Alzheimer’s, or suddenly fall foul of cardiovascular disease. Gerontology is the act of developing treatments for age-related diseases, de Grey argues – of reducing the causes of death, not death itself. “The benefits of living longer are not the point,” he says. “The benefits are not having Alzheimer’s disease.” For de Grey, indefinite life is a by-product, not a goal.Are we anywhere near to a breakthrough? So far, research has produced modest yields. Gerontologists speak prophetically of potential, but most warn a significant human development remains somewhere far off in the distance – almost in sight but not quite. Richard Hodes, the director of the National Institute of Aging, a US government agency, told me that, though research in animals has led to “dramatic increases in life”, some of them multi-fold, “There has been far less quantitative effect as those models have moved towards mammalian species.” The biologist Laura Deming, who in 2011 established the Longevity Fund, a venture capital firm that supports “high-potential longevity companies”, told me that startups continue to successfully root out biological markers of ageing – inefficient cells, mitochondrial decline – but that, in humans, “We really don’t know right now what will work and what won’t.”Much of gerontology focuses on identifying types of damage that accumulate with age and developing ways to halt or reverse that accumulation. It has been discovered, for example, that as we grow older, certain cells become ineffective but nevertheless stick around, getting in the way like comatose guests at the end of a house party. Removing those cells have helped mice have longer, healthier lifes (this is called senescence.) Similar forms of genetic engineering have been successful in other animal models. But to reach the mainstream, gerontologists must convince government agencies to support human adoption, a complicated and long-winded task, given the general view that death is a normal human process. Why play God?In any case, it is likely that one single longevity strategy alone won’t help us much. Life extensionists enjoy a metaphor: humans are complicated machines, they say, like cars, but mushy. And what happens to a machine if you don’t look after it? It rusts. It splutters and spurts, until it reaches its inevitable conclusion. De Grey considers ageing a “multifaceted problem”. Humans incur many different types of damage. We don’t just rust. We scratch. We dent. Rubbish accumulates in our footwells and grime develops in our engines. We require multiple strategies of repair – constant fine-tuning. What’s the point in removing those senescent cells if that molecular junk continues to build up?De Grey shares Strole’s belief that innovations are coming. But, unlike Strole, he considers current strategies almost pointless. He does not take hundreds of supplements. He does not pay for stem-cell transfusions. “I want to wait and see,” he says. At 56, he is content to sit tight for treatments that have become “progressively more effective… so I don’t have to use clunky, first-generation therapies that may have side-effects.”This does not seem to bother Strole, nor others in the community. Time is running out! Bring on the treatments! At RAADfest, the Coalition’s annual conference – “the Woodstock of radical life extension” – visitors are invited to root through the latest in anti-ageing products, of which there are many. Try DHEA PRO-25, an “anti-ageing hormone”. Or NAD+PRO, advertised to “boost physical and mental energy”. Or Piracetam, from the family of “smart drugs”, or nootropics, which claim to enhance brain function. Strole named the area: “The marketplace of your future.” It is popular among RAADfest guests for the power of its promise: the opportunity to realise the hoped-for self. This is Wellness 2.0 – beyond the cosmetic. We have been anti-ageing our skin for years. Why not our insides, too?Jim Mellon is reported to have described the longevity market as “a fountain of cash”, and has urged friends to invest. Business is already lucrative, but it is a market that appears to take little notice of efficacy. The majority of anti-ageing products remain unregulated – “patent pending”, in the vernacular – and more than a few appear utterly useless. Earlier this year, the US government released a statement condemning the anti-ageing fad of transfusing young blood into older bodies, a practice researchers have proved effective in mice but which, the FDA said, “should not be assumed to be safe or effective” in humans. (The treatments cost thousands of dollars, and led to concern that “Patients are being preyed upon by unscrupulous actors.”)A decade ago, the American Association of Medicine publicly condemned the sale of “anti-ageing hormones,” an industry that was reported to be worth $50bn. “Despite the widespread promotion of hormones as anti-ageing agents by for-profit websites,” the association said, “the scientific evidence to support these claims is lacking.”The oldest person to have lived, Jeanne Calment, reached 122, though she was perhaps not the greatest example of good health: she smoked until she was 117. The most successful life-extension methods we know of seem to be those we have known all along: eat well, sleep well, exercise, reduce stress and rely on modern medicine, which has prolonged average lifes significantly over the past 160 years.Strole does that and more. So far it’s working, he says. He is 6ft 4 and 13st – “the perfect weight” – with a slick of glossy grey hair. Perhaps his regimen is effective. Or, perhaps, like Calment, he has won a kind of genetic lottery, his healthy hair predisposed. It is difficult to say exactly, but, as of this moment, he will die. What happens if a breakthrough doesn’t arrive in his lifetime? “Well, then we’re in a little bit of hot water,” he says. But “it’s better to go for it than to not go for it. It’s better than just settling in. Don’t go quietly into the night.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b917949d4faa17fac67427596c239addfb14828c/0_116_4127_2477/master/4127.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7531f726ad0a36039b4bbf453977448","title":"delhi free travel metro offers lifeline for women","story":"As a politics student, Sonakshi Dogra has given the bold new plan by the Delhi government to let all women ride free on the metro and buses a thorough going-over. “It’s ridiculous. Why favour women this way? What about male students and working men? Women can’t ask for gender equality and then support inequality on public transport,” she said firmly.Dogra was about to enter Ashram metro station with three male friends, also students at the same university. They spend about 4,000 rupees (£45) each a month on transport.Her friend Gaurav Verma said: “How will it be fair if Sonakshi saves that money and I don’t? We have been asking the Delhi government for student passes on the metro and had no luck, but they go and do this? It’s a publicity stunt because Delhi voters go to the polls in February.”The plan has aroused strong emotions. The stated reason for it, provided by the Aam Aadmi party (the Common Man’s party), which runs the Delhi government, is to make women in the city feel safer.Jasmine Shah, vice-chair of the Dialogue and Development Commission of the Delhi government, said: “Public transport, particularly the metro, is the safest form of transport for women. Many women who can’t afford the metro fares have to walk long distances to work or a long way to a bus stop. Or they use auto-rickshaws or informally run local van services that are not safe.”Shah is the first to concede that free public transport is not a silver bullet. All the other factors – policing, street lighting, changes in male mentality – are vital. Although it’s true that the presence of more women on public transport will make women feel more secure, it’s also true, he concedes, that once women get out of a metro station, they are in the same unsafe streets and public spaces. However, he says, this is “one thing that is in our hands to do, so we are doing it”.It would be just as easy – and more gender-equal – if the Delhi government were simply to reduce the metro fares. The doubling of fares in 2017 was a huge blow to the poor and lower middle class. Overnight, they became unaffordable, at least on a daily basis.In fact, since the increase in fares, the metro has undergone a sea change. When it opened in 2004, it instantly became a source of pride. For once, Indians had a piece of world-class infrastructure. The network was brand new, the trains were on time, the carriages gleamed and the stations were spacious and well lit. The fares were cheap enough for the poor to take to it en masse.Previously, public transport had been a great class ider. The rich shunned buses and local trains, and remained, as Aravind Adiga in the novel The White Tiger wrote, sealed off in their “dark eggs”. Public transport was for the poor.The metro changed all that. Since it was too efficient and convenient to be ignored, the well-off started using it. The metro carriage became one of the few democratic spaces in India, where construction workers and bankers literally rubbed shoulders and where social inequalities were, in that time and space, irrelevant. No executive class as in the trains no business class as in planes.Shah points to the figures to prove his contention that the poor have been pushed out even though they are the ones who, because they travel long distances, need the metro the most. By now, it was scheduled to have four million riders a day but the figure for 2018-19 was 300,000 lower than in the previous two years.“Delhi has high levels of poverty but the metro fare structure is three times the price of metro systems in cities like Beijing, New York and Paris. The plan to give free rides will help bring ordinary women back on to the metro,” said Shah.Quite apart from affordability and safety, the decision could have all sorts of positive corollaries for women by making them mobile. It could allow them to work and study, enrich them socially by getting them out of the house, and change the very look of New Delhi by unleashing women into public spaces monopolised by men.Neelam Rana, who is the breadwinner in her family, was offered a job as a cook in a Delhi suburb that she was desperate to take to help pay for her husband’s medical bills. Buses on that route were few and unreliable, so she took the metro. “I struggled for two months but it didn’t make any sense. I was spending more than half my salary on transport. I had to give it up last month,” she said.Experts say that while it might seem unfair that rich women will enjoy the perk of free public transport rather than low-income men, the latter will still benefit from the saving every month if they are married and their wives work or wish to work.Millions of Indian women living on their husbands’ earnings would love to work, either to supplement a small family income or simply to get out of the house. Vineeta Jain, 26, got married last year and lives in the affluent Vasant Kunj area of Delhi. She doesn’t need the money but she would love a job.“It’s stifling being at home all the time just doing household chores but the first thing my in-laws say if I talk about getting a job is, ‘Forget it, it isn’t safe for you to travel.’ I don’t have an answer to that,” said Jain.It’s not only work opportunities that are limited because of safety fears over travelling. A 2017 study of 4,000 Delhi University students by Brown University PhD student Girija Borker found that travelling distance determined which college women chose to attend. “For the average woman, selecting a safe travel route requires her to choose a college that is of lower quality, leading to trade-offs between travel safety and college quality,” wrote Borker.For some women, the idea of public spaces being flooded by more women is a thrilling proposition that may alter the very look and feel of the capital. Following the 2012 gang rape and murder of Jyoti Singh in a moving bus, safety has been even more of a concern than before.Many women opted for caution and went out less, leaving public spaces, already dominated by men, to look even more uninviting for women.Last year, Jasmeen Patheja, who runs the Bangalore-based feminist group White Noise, organised a “Meet to Sleep” campaign in which women slept for a few hours on benches or in parks, as Indian men do, to reclaim public space and do something as simple as having a nap in public without feeling scared.In 2016, activist Neha Singh spearheaded a protest called “Why Loiter?”, asserting women’s right, instead of hurriedly and purposefully getting from one place to another while doing their best to minimise male attention, to loiter at any time, in any place.Columnist Amulya Gopalakrishnan, writing in the Indian Express, argued that women out on the streets have always been treated as a threat to traditional order and controlled by an atmosphere of fear. “The whole business of becoming a woman is learning your limits, so any policy that lifts those limits is to be cheered,” she wrote.The details of the plan – such as how to make up the losses that will be incurred by the metro – are being worked out before being submitted to the Delhi government cabinet in a few days. “It is certain to be approved. It will happen,” said Shah."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d25ffe681498ffc51cc8f54a030018c06a7e59e9/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a76881ae4923d6ede9ad72209fc1f63d","title":"parenting guides teach us nothing about parenting breastfeeding maternity","story":"From breast feeding to sleep training, there is a manual to help new parents. But how useful are they really? And don’t they just make us feel even more stressed?Visiting a maternity ward last week I saw the oddest thing. A series of posters designed to promote breastfeeding, each one a disembodied white woman’s torso. The first featured her tits being groped by a variety of hands. “Bond with your baby,” said a slogan over the tit pictured stage left, a child’s hand covering the nipple. And above the second tit, this one enclosed by a pink male hand, the words, “Bond with your man.” OK. The next poster showed the tits in a leopard-print bra, a baby sucking on one nipple, and the slogan, “Designer mum. Designer milk.” An involuntary shudder. Not just at the suggestion that the reason so many women bottle-feed their babies is to protect their “designer” bosom, but at the memory of drowning in similarly delirious mothering advice, in finding myself bleeding on a battleground, its lines drawn in crayon.Parenting advice is big business, despite appearing to consist of just two contrasting ideas: the first, control the kid the second, control yourself. The many millions of books written, about feeding, sleeping, carrying, playing, inevitably extend into a variety of things to buy, whether tech-driven sleep aids or parenting coaches, or “mumpreneur” networking events. And yet, despite so many parents’ shaky investments (at a time when their earnings must be impacted) much of the advice is offered without much, if any, serious explanation why.On maternity leave I remember standing in the supermarket hovering over a box of formula, having slept for no more than two hours at a time for months and, as if trying to remember a dream, searching the empty pocket of my brain for the reasons why it had felt important to breastfeed. Something about immunity? Bonding? I really wanted to buy the formula, but the books said no, and I didn’t dare get it wrong. So on I fed, my designer tits relegated to TK Maxx, my exhaustion a feral cat that hid in corners and screamed at cars.At times that abstracted advice must have been a relief – a calm voice telling you what to do and when. But from this distance I’m scandalised. “By not explaining why,” writes Emily Oster in her new bestseller, Cribsheet, “we remove people’s ability to think about these choices for themselves, with their own preferences playing a role.” Oster is an economist, and Cribsheet is a chatty but extensive analysis of what research reveals about the benefits and drawbacks of co-sleeping, breastfeeding, toilet training, circumcision and other fraught conversations that typically take place at 3am. Its interrogations are sensible and sane, but its final advice is the most radical: rather than worrying about parenting mistakes, just… try not to think about it.It’s the antithesis of the intensive mothering so many parenting books advise. A level of concentration, both on the child and on educating oneself about how to bring up that child that, despite existing in order to relieve stress, becomes its own new anxiety. In 2017 researchers looked at how the use of parenting books affected 354 mothers – the more books they read, the study found, “The more likely they were to have symptoms of depression, low self-efficacy and not feel confident as a parent.” With the completion of one book a new level is unlocked, one that can only be won by reading more books, downloading more apps. The next level after sorting a baby’s sleep patterns, of course, being to sort workplace structures, government sexism and societal inequality.It is rare, though, for a parenting book to admit, as Oster’s does, that even with all the knowledge and all the apps, there is rarely one “correct” choice. Not just because the data is limited, or the parent (like the customer they quickly become) is always right. But because it happens backwards – it’s after making the choice, whether to breastfeed or to close the door on a screaming baby, that we decide it was the right one, and so prescribe it to others. “If I choose not to breastfeed, I don’t want to acknowledge that there are even small possible benefits to breastfeeding,” she explains. “So I encamp myself in the position that breastfeeding is a waste of time. On the other side, if I spend two years taking my boobs out every three hours, I need to believe that this is what it takes to deliver a life of continued successes to my child.” The avoidance of cognitive dissonance: it does more for self-help than any mindfulness technique.The decent books are honest about the limits of socioeconomic data, gentle about the tensions, and explicitly acknowledge the role of luck. But too often parenting advice is simply “content” – that self-reproducing machine that expands to fit all broken spaces, all internet cracks. Staring at those posters in the maternity ward last week, the flimsy advice felt more like craven exploitation of new parents, desperate to try to fix a system they are powerless to even touch.Email Eva at e.wiseman@observer or follow her on Twitter @EvaWiseman"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/626d0bae094cbd79e75be9dd70ec93fd2a5ac525/1561_1316_4135_2481/master/4135.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0575f5003be66c20de1d73abddd5e689","title":"state bicycle co 4130 road retro affordable steel bike review","story":"Known for its single-speed urban bikes, this cool American bike builder has just released its first affordable retro racer with gearsState Bicycle Co 4130 RoadPrice £549.99, statebicycleFrame steelGears 8 speedSizes 49cm to 62cmAbout 20 years ago I went for my first “proper” bike ride. I borrowed a knackered old frame from a friend and rather randomly set my sights on Tunbridge Wells, mostly because it was about 40 miles from where I lived and there was a direct train back home.It ended in disaster. I had three punctures, broke a pedal and ended up walking for miles along the hard shoulder of the A21. Finally, I reached a pub and had to call my wife to ask her to fetch me. To this day I don’t know how I managed to make such a meal of a ride I can now do in my sleep.There was one bright spot, however. After my second puncture, as I was sitting on a grass verge considering my options (I’d only brought one spare patch), two riders in their 70s stopped. They were from Penge Cycling Club in southeast London. One fixed my wheel, while the other opened his flask and shared out homemade flapjacks. I rode on with them for a few miles, enjoying their stories – they had more than 100 years of cycling derring-do between them – and struggling to keep up with the effortless cadence of their wiry old legs. They were an inspiration and I still think of them when I head out towards Tunbridge Wells – and I always salute the grass bank where they came to my aid.I also think of them when I see a classic steel bike like this one from the State Bicycle Co. The brand was launched a decade ago by three cycle-crazy mates from Arizona. That’s about as far as you can get from Penge, but those two OAPs would have loved this bike. They’d appreciate its slim frame, flat top tube, traditional 60s colour scheme and those lovely tan-walled tyres.State made its name building hip, urban, single-speed and fixed-gear bikes – beards, tattoos and an obsession with beer brewing are almost mandatory. The 4130, however, is a big departure. It’s the first time the company has added gears to one of its bikes. The 8-speed drivetrain shifts using a down-tube lever. It’s a durable, low-maintenance option that also harks back to the way vintage bikes were built. The single chain ring is in a natural, old-school aluminium finish. The Penge pensioners told me that back in their heyday, when your gear shifters were always mounted on the down tube, it was common for opponents to ride dirty by leaning over and flicking you out of gear during hill races, which meant a dramatic and often dangerous loss of momentum. It wasn’t all sepia-tinted romance back in the day.The 4130 has more vintage-inspired details on its brake levers, hubs, pad holders and saddle. But the bike also considers the needs of modern riders. There are lugs for racks and mudguards, and room to fit wider 32mm tyres as used on gravel bikes for better comfort and stability.For anyone wanting to get into riding on a modern bike that comes packed with classic charm, the 4130 is an affordable and rewarding choice. But remember, whatever the era, you won’t get far without a couple of spare tubes and a flapjack in your pocket.Wear it more, but wash it less.

A superb cover of Luther Vandross’s Never Too Much allows her to yell: “I just don’t want to stop.”And why should she? At 75, she may be less nimble on her feet than she used to be, but she looks fantastic and her voice still justifies her nickname: the empress of soul.An astonishing 58 years after Every Beat of My Heart hit the US charts (the singer performing as part of Gladys Knight \u0026amp the Pips with her brother and cousins, who have all retired), she is still clearly having fun, telling her euphoric audience: “We’ve been hanging out for, errrr … many, many years” to ripples of laughter.

Some were great, and some just refuse to accept that they had to deal with me.”“We are working toward 5050. Some years it’s 6040. It’s a challenge for us and we’ve really taken it on and I’m always totally conscious everyday that the gender balance should be right.”She added: “Every day when I’m booking I’m thinking about that and cajoling stage bookers to be onboard with it. Some of them have been here a long time so it’s a little bit of hustle. But we’re getting there.”Kyle Minogue, Miley Cyrus and Janet Jackson are among the big acts this year, alongside The Killers, The Cure and Stormzy. Eavis has complained about sexism in the industry since she first started booking acts at one of the world’s largest music festivals.Speaking to the Observer in 2009, she said: “People didn’t take it seriously coming from a girl, especially as not only was I a girl, but a ‘daughter of’ … but my dad has in no way given this to me in a nicely wrapped package. He has challenged me, made sure I can do it.”Eavis also told Desert Island Discs her family were often the brunt of local anger at the festival when she was a child in the 1980s. “We used to have people shouting at us when we drove through the village. At the time it felt like we were part of something really controversial and everyone had an opinion, and they used to just let us know. You’d be at a Christmas drinks party and someone would just come over and start shouting.”Eavis said she was not a fan of the festival as a child, and was troubled by the arrival of so many strangers on her family’s land. The organiser said the event could be “pretty scary at times” during the early days."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7cbc322e69ff8cec432f07be506e97e6203188e/0_133_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c45a3b27dbed40801d463be50ca469a","title":"green music festivals eco environment","story":"When Chris Johnson first started putting on outdoor parties with his mates, they were small, impromptu and shambolic – or “really good fun”, as he puts it.

Co-organiser Emily Eavis estimates “the ban will save the million bottles that we would have otherwise sold” and is in line with the festival’s ethos to tread lightly on the land. Instead, the 200,000-strong audience will be served by 850 water taps and dozens of water kiosks, using Worthy Farm’s purpose-built water reservoirs.Earlier this year more than 60 major festivals, including Reading, Leeds and Download, pledged to go plastic-free by 2021. Straws, cutlery and bottles remain major offenders and bans have been met with enthusiasm by audiences. But according to Claire O’Neill, co-founder of the not-for-profit organisation A Greener Festival, which audits and advises the industry on how to reduce its environmental impact, the key challenges remain “transport, tents and toilets”.Getting festival-goers to the site using public transport or signing up to car-share schemes makes the biggest difference to the carbon footprint. Trying to make sure they pack up and take their tents is also a major environmental headache.“We actively ask people to consider what they bring to the festival and urge them not to bring disposable tents,” says Ian Fielder, operations director at Green Man festival. “We don’t ban it because we don’t want to become financially prohibitive, but they are a bane for most festivals. The waste is extraordinary.”Green Man works with refugee charities to repurpose left-behind tents, but emphasises that many of them are impossible to recycle and get sent to incinerators.At Houghton, an electronic music festival set in a Norfolk estate, sewage is treated equally seriously. “We’re using compostable toilets across the site this year,” says co-founder Tom Elkington, who explains at length the environmental benefits over chemical portable toilets. “Being sustainable and ethical is a core social responsibility for us – a lot of what we do isn’t legislation, but it probably should be.”For Festival Republic boss Melvin Benn, who runs major events including Latitude and Wireless, efficient use of the diesel-powered generators used on sites remains a key focal point. For Benn, converting to vegetable waste oil, biofuel and hybrid units makes environmental and economic sense.At BlueDot, a science and music festival held at Jodrell Bank observatory in Manchester, the line-up is heavy with climate crisis panels and talks from experts and activists. According to the festival director, Ben Robinson, the emphasis isn’t just on what happens at the festival but what the audience takes from it afterwards.“Of course, building mini-cities in fields every summer has an environmental impact,” he says. “But festivals can prompt long-term behavioural change. It’s not just about hedonism. People are open to new ideas and it invites them into a different conversation. We cause a conscious cultural shift – using less plastic, reducing waste, living sustainably. If these can be achieved on site, they can make a difference long after people have gone home.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ab309586e55bd02f5ee85455752643cf5918b5e/0_2614_3370_2021/master/3370.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28f1928947d8c7bea65c453b3c93bace","title":"share your experiences of sure start childrens centres","story":"Whether you helped set up the programme in your area or your family used a centre near you, we would like to hear your storiesThe flagship Sure Start programme has saved the NHS millions of pounds through the benefits it has brought to children including some of the most deprived areas and reducing the number of those taken to hospital, according to a study.Research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies “found that where Sure Start offered high levels of service in poor neighbourhoods in England, visits to hospital to treat injuries fell among all children of primary school age, and by a third of all 11-year-olds”.Tracy Brabin, the shadow early years minister, said: “This research shows the critical role Sure Start plays in children’s health, as well as their development.

Defeat in that competition at that stage of the season condemned a county side, which was struggling in the other competitions, to another trophy-less season. That was always when the mumbling started in the committee rooms.This was the summer when Ian was banned from the game for two months after admitting that he had smoked pot earlier in his career. The response of his relatively new and ill-conceived choice as manager, Tim Hudson, to Ian’s admission, which was revealed on the front pages of the Mail on Sunday after a deal had been brokered between the two parties, raised the odd eyebrow. “Doesn’t everybody?” said a bemused Hudson.Ian’s manager was a charmer but not the ideal man to be running his business affairs in the mid-80s – or in any other decade. The notion of a career in Hollywood, promoted by Hudson, never quite came to pass though Ian did appear in pantomime half a dozen years later.Ian’s enforced absence from first-class cricket meant that he was obliged to play in Somerset’s second team to get some practice for the first time in more than a decade. Julian Wyatt was leading the team at the time and he was asked how tricky it was to captain Botham. “It was very simple, actually,” he replied. “Ian told me when he wanted to bat and he told me when he wanted to bowl.” (For the record Ian scored 41 and took two for 47 from his 15 overs.)Another problem stemmed from the mediocre output of the newer members of the side. There were no new sources of wickets, while Nigel Felton and Jon Hardy struggled to have an impact as batsmen. In the wake of that NatWest Trophy defeat to Lancashire, Viv had been in a foul mood, frustrated by another Somerset failure, and increasingly the argument surfaced that the younger players struggled to perform because of Viv’s mighty, broody, overbearing presence.It was an argument that failed to convince me then, it does not convince me now nor did I find it vindicated soon after Viv had been sacked when the output of the players concerned was exactly the same.Viv was an obvious asset for a captain. He would be there, he would be supportive and he would score his runs. It was clear that when Viv joined Glamorgan in 1990 he was an inspiration to their younger players. No doubt having been rejected by Somerset, a decision that hurt the proudest of men, he was determined to demonstrate that he could fulfil that role as a mentor and a motivator as well as a runscorer. As for the genial Joel, the only issue for a captain was his fitness. Increasingly the body was rebelling but in one-day cricket he was still formidable.The overhaul was not the brainwave of the captain, Peter Roebuck. The idea stemmed from the chairman, Michael Hill, and the process was ignited when Crowe, whose registration was still held by Somerset (dating from 1984 when Viv and Joel had been busy with West Indies), asked permission to speak to Essex, which he assumed would be a routine request. The plans were kept secret and I was astonished when Pete told me about them. My immediate view, which did not change, was: “In your shoes I would not do that.”However, Pete seldom shied from confrontation I was always the conciliator.There was another factor in all this that went beyond the cricketing ramifications. More than anything as captain, Pete craved a side that would, amid all his eccentricities, listen to and follow him without too much questioning. This was wishful thinking with an ordinary professional cricket side it was downright impossible in a team containing Ian and Viv. Holding complete sway in those circumstances could never be an option.Towards the end of the season there was the final committee meeting. I saw Pete that evening, eager to know the outcome. “I could have saved them,” he said – after all, he was the club captain – “but I could not bring myself to do it.”Now it became ugly, very ugly. Viv and Joel were stunned, especially Viv, who had always had such an emotional tie with the club since 1974. A placard appeared, presumably via Ian, on Pete’s peg in the dressing room bearing the word “Judas”. Unsurprisingly Ian was fuming at the decision and threatening to leave. Meanwhile Viv had long since stopped functioning as the vice-captain – how could he fulfil that role now? – and he was trying to make sense of it all.At the end of August we arrived at Birmingham for a Sunday League game with a squad of at least 15 players because no one could be sure that Viv and Joel would turn up (they did and between them took four cheap wickets in a six-wicket victory).Whenever I found myself batting with Viv Richards he was, of course, a reassuring presence. He did not say much out in the middle but he always engaged with his partner. He did not bat in isolation. There was always the sense of “we are in this together”, which us lesser mortals obviously appreciated. But he did not like batsmen riding on his back, just hanging in there and relying upon him to do all the scoring. Provided you were alive, active and trying to contribute at the other end he was happy. He did not want any parasites. He did his best to make you feel good, a tricky task since he was usually batting sublimely at the other end. They seemed to bowl so much rubbish to him.Richards could intimidate bowlers in a manner beyond any other player of my experience. Most batsmen are vulnerable on nought but Richards, by his delayed, swaggering entrance, could have the palms of bowlers sweating on a cold day before he had faced a ball. He oozed arrogance, a quality that deserted him when he was beyond the boundary, which made him unusual most cricketers accurately reflect their character in the way they play. All the bowlers of that generation remember what happened when they were up against Richards – the same applies with Geoffrey Boycott. They knew, even then, that here was something to pass on to the\u0026nbspgrandchildren.It was better not to provoke him. At Leicester in 1981 Viv was practising on the outfield on the first morning of the match when the Tannoy opened up. It was Mike Turner, the no-nonsense chief executive of Leicestershire, on the microphone. “Could the Somerset players please refrain from hitting the ball into the advertising boards around the boundary? And that includes you, Mr Richards.” A few of the Leicestershire players winced at this intervention and their worst fears were soon realised. Richards hit 196 out of Somerset’s 356 in a match we won by 10 wickets.\u0026nbspAfter that Viv and Joel understandably withdrew for a while Ian was steaming but obliged to play (after all, he had not been sacked) Pete was feeling the pressure too and, as ever, I was just about the only one talking to both parties, to no good effect.The most poignant occasion was in the last Sunday League game of the summer against Derbyshire at Taunton on 14 September. Standing in for Pete as captain was a privilege I could have done without and I can’t quite recall what, if anything, I said beforehand but this was the last game played by Viv, Joel and Ian for Somerset. We won by three wickets Joel took one for 27, Viv made 55 and Ian 32. It wasn’t supposed to end like that.There would follow meetings, talk of rebellions and vigorous expressions of no-confidence in the committee. Pete was under severe scrutiny but he was also stimulated by the controversy, revelling in the challenge of a forensic debate and a political battle to win. I’d seldom seen him so alive. The club’s position was ratified at an extraordinary members’ meeting at the Shepton Mallet showground.So Somerset had seen off the rebels but there were no real victors in this outcome. The club had been torn asunder and it took a long time to recover. For Pete I think this was the seminal moment in his life and it stayed with him for years, longer than any of the other protagonists. I remained friends with him but there was always a tension on this issue. He always sought affirmation from me that he had taken the right course in 1986 and I was never able to give it to him.The immediate upshot was that Ian joined Worcestershire, which proved to be a successful move for both parties. Viv later joined Glamorgan, where they thought the world of him in 1993, inspired by Richards, they won the Sunday League. Joel retired from international cricket in March 1987.Eventually the three titans were rehabilitated with the club.

The part-timer Markram has picked up Hafeez, who missed his sweep and was trapped dead in front. That’s just what any off-spinner is trying to do from around the wicket, pitching in line and straightening. Lovely bowling. No review needed there, that’s for sure.29th over: Pakistan 139-2 (Babar 29, Hafeez 19) Phehlukwayo is spun around to replace Tahir, giving him three to bowl later in the innings. And again the all-rounder is efficient, giving up one to Babar first ball down to third man then dotting up Hafeez for the rest by mixing up his stock delivery and off-cutter.28th over: Pakistan 138-2 (Babar 28, Hafeez 19) Clever captaincy from Faf to get part-time offie Markram on for an over while the sting is out of it just a little bit. It works, racing through it for just just two singles. TV suggests that the over was delayed because they couldn’t get the music off the PA. Speaking of music, we haven’t seen Cricket Bat Guitar Guy so far today. His rendition of Everlong when Nabi holed out in the final over yesterday hit me right in the sad spot. 27th over: Pakistan 136-2 (Babar 27, Hafeez 18) Tahir to Babar, a heavyweight battle this. The leggie has him under his thumb early before getting him down the ground for one, Hafeez doing likewise. 226 from seven. Will Faf bowl him out?“Hello Adam, hope you are well.” Thank you Richard Dennis. I am! “With regards to the now synonymous Tahir celebration, it’s great, I enjoy it, I mean how could you not? But with a dismissal like Fakhar’s, where the wicket is merely a cause of the batsman’s stupidity, a celebration like that does look a it silly, don’t you think? Maybe Tahir needs to keep the big celebration back sometimes, for a wicket a lot like his next one even. I think it would improve the spectacle. If you could let him know from me, cheers.” Yep, I’m with you here. It’s the best. But better when he’s made the wicket happen. For instance, the opening morning of the tournament when he picked up YJB for a golden duck. What a moment that was. 26th over: Pakistan 134-2 (Babar 26, Hafeez 17) Phehlukwayo has a calming influence at the bowling crease for South Africa here, dotting up Babar early in the over before he takes one to cover. Hafeez wasn’t able to beat de Kock with his glance, then happy in defence to finish. Just one run from it. Push and pull. 25th over: Pakistan 133-2 (Babar 25, Hafeez 17) DRAMA TO FINISH with Tahir denied a leg before decision from his brilliant googly. It was too good for his fellow veteran Hafeez on the sweep, hitting him low to the ground. Turned down and sent upstairs, the technology showed the ball doing everything it needed to but going over the top of leg stump by a about two cricket balls, if you like. Heart rates were already elevated the ball before when Hafeez hit him for six over square leg, just clearing Ngidi, the tallest man on the field. Livin’ la vida loca is the man they call The Professor. What a great couple of hours of entertainment we’ve had so far!24th over: Pakistan 125-2 (Babar 25, Hafeez 9) The crowd are going WILD now as Babar adds another boundary, this time behind point from the outside portion of his bat off Phehlukwayo back into the attack for a second burst from the pavilion end. Earlier in the set, Hafeez flicked three behind square. He’s started positively. With a wide and a couple of other singles in there, it’s a most prodcutive over. 23rd over: Pakistan 114-2 (Babar 19, Hafeez 5) That’s a dropped catch! Tahir wins Hafeez’s edge and it was inout. I’m not even certain it was in, on reflection. But it was down and that’s the main thing. Other than that, the singles are now being opened up to the sweepers by this pair against Tahir. But how close he was to a third in a hurry. Halfway through his complement, the 40yo leggie has 216.22nd over: Pakistan 108-2 (Babar 17, Hafeez 1) Babar goes bang, bang! That’s what they needed, slamming Ngidi’s penultimate ball through midwicket before driving quite beautifully down the ground into the rope in front of the pavilion. “Cricinfo are reporting that the TV and official scorers bothall failed to record the second ball of the 14th, so in fact it ended up being a seven-ball over,” writes Romeo. “Cricinfo reported it accurately on their ball-by-ball.” Gosh, I love that this can still happen at a World Cup. Cricket: bless it. 21st over: Pakistan 98-2 (Babar 8, Hafeez 0) Hafeez gets down the track to Tahir, just as he tried to do last week when coming in against India’s wristspinners. That didn’t last for long, mind. Just one run from the successful over. Despite how well Pakistan started, both of their set men are now back in the shed and they have only gone at 4.68 runs an over. Babar, time to take back control. (No, not like that)Here is the Fakhar dismissal. Hopefully, they will also put up the Tahir catch.What a snaffle! In his follow through, Tahir gets down low to his right for a superb reflex catch. And what a celebration! Even by Tahir’s standards this is something, all-but jumping into the crowd ala Pat Cash after winning Wimbledon! The catch looks better on every replay, too. Brilliant cricket. They’re back in business.20th over: Pakistan 97-1 (Imam 44, Babar 7) Oooooh, that’s better. Babar looks a million bucks driving Ngidi off the front foot, crunching through the gap at cover for his first boundary. He was in lovely touch last week at Manchester until falling, the wicket that set off the collapse. It has been a brutal week for Pakistan cricket since but they have bounced back nicely today as Father Time strikes midday.“At least it means Marais Erasmus can umpire the Final,” says Jonathan Salisbury, digging out a tangential positive from this World Cup campaign for South Africa. 19th over: Pakistan 92-1 (Imam 44, Babar 2) Tahir has 19 from his first three, changing the feel of the game as he does so often. The leggie has played five fewer World Cup games than Allan Donald for that same return, the TV says. They’re giving Babar nothing, but he is able to take a single from the last ball to deep point.18th over: Pakistan 90-1 (Imam 43, Babar 1) Ngidi is back and it is two tidy overs in a row, not letting Babar get down the other end making him defend everything.17th over: Pakistan 89-1 (Imam 42, Babar 1) Great start this from Tahir, Imam showing complete respect for the man who now has 38 World Cup wickets, level with Allan Donald for South Africa by that measure. On TV, Mark Nicholas is having a nice gallop about the spirit of cricket and the end of the game at Manchester last night. What an over from Neesham to set it up. He’s a great fella.16th over: Pakistan 88-1 (Imam 41, Babar 1) Imam has to kick on with it now that Fakhar has given his start away. He gets one on leg stump from Morris and is able to flick him nicely through midwicket into the gap for four, moving into the 40s.There is an amazing shot from spidercam on the telly at the end of the over, taken from the top of the media centre. What a beautiful place this is. The building celebrated its 20th birthday last month. There’s currently an exhibition in the Lord’s museum marking that milestone, which is well worth a visit.“Your suggested change of removing the edge defence has its merits but could also be a nightmare to umpire,” writes Nick Clark. “ It would have to be a very fine edge for the deflection to not take it away from the stumps. The small amount of travel between the bat and the pad would not give umpires enough evidence to judge the new path so they would basically need to say no away but can’t use the defence that it hit the bat first.”I hadn’t really thought of that. Fair enough. I’ll put that thoughtbubble away.He adds: “The pitching outside leg thing was brought in to stop very defensive bowling from around the wicket, it enables batters to swing for it in more freedom.”Brian Withington wants me to explain in greater detail my inside edge proposal, but I’m sufficiently happy with Nick Clark’s point to let it go. 15th over: Pakistan 81-1 (Imam 35, Babar 0) What made Fakhar’s dismissal all the more bewildering is that he drove Tahir through cover for four to begin. Alas, it’s all over now. Babar’s turn, the main man at No3. He defends his first delivery. Here is the John Dory with Kohli and his fine. Not surprised to see this.Tahir gets the breakthrough from his fifth ball! It’s such an unnecessary bit of batting from the set man, going for the premeditated scoop. It is edged in the air to Amla at slip. “No, no, no!” says Mark Nicholas. Correct. Sigh. Drinks. 14th over: Pakistan 75-0 (Imam 34, Fakhar 39) Imam gives the strike to Fakhar with a single to third man. The big hitter tries to put him into the stands but misses. A quirky end to the over when the umpire calls it after five balls, Morris then sent back to bowl one more. You don’t see that very often in the pro game.13th over: Pakistan 73-0 (Imam 33, Fakhar 38) A lot to like about Phehlukwayo, as I’ll continue to bang away through his spell. Fakhar has his measure early on here with a couple to mid-off then deflecting two more to third man. But the South African all-rounder bounces back with a lovely delivery that jags away from the left-hander, beating him outside edge. Imam gets his go later in the over and retains the strike with a firm push out to deep point, his preferred target so far.12th over: Pakistan 67-0 (Imam 32, Fakhar 33) Gosh, that hurts: the delivery after the catch that wasn’t is pulled away for four by Fakhar, just to the left of Tahir this time. Sure enough, the Pakistan fans - the vast majority of those here today here supporting Sarfraz’s side - are absolutely loving this turn of events. “Your point about the Allen Stand scoreboard seems also to apply to the one above the Edrich stand,” notes Romeo. “The one over the Compton has shown the score in at least one TV shot I’ve seen, but anyone in the Upper Compton has to either turn round to see it or try and make out what the mechanical one between Tavern and Mound says (and of course that has very limited information). Those in the Lower Edrich - where can they see the score? Anywhere at all? Seems ridiculous.”Precisely. I’m not complaining about my vantage point in the media centre and never would, but from here we can only see the small mechnical board under Father Time. Those below us would definitely be in that same situation, especially at ground level. Seems a bit over the top to take away all the scoreboards for sponsors? I appreciate they fund the World Cup. But still. There’s a balance.NOT OUT! Morris prompts a false stroke from Fakhar, slapping out to Tahir at midwicket who make a fantastic ing take. However, the soft signal is not out, which means conclusive evidence is required. There isn’t that, according to the third umpire, so it remains not out. “But I do wonder had it been soft signal out,” asks Ali Mitchell on TV, “would it have remained out?” I’m with her. du Plessis is fuming about the initial soft signal Tahir certain he caught it. But not to be. 11th over: Pakistan 61-0 (Imam 31, Fakhar 28) Phehlukwayo does the one thing you can’t do with your first ball of the day- he oversteps. The Fakhar free hit goes over mid-on, Ngidi electing to let the ball bounce instead of catching it but keeping it to one. Other than that, it is a good first over from the all-rounder, who has been very good in this World Cup with the ball. “It just occurred to me that all of the qualifications to LBW (pitching outside leg, impact outside off) come from the days before DRS,” says Paul Stubbs. “Are they still needed in today’s game? Could not the rule be simplified? If it is hitting, then you’re out?” Oh, I don’t think it is technology (or lack thereof) that was denying bowlers who pitched outside leg. My preferred left-of-centre amendment would be to eliminate the ability for an inside edge to save the batsman. If the ball is hitting, even via an edge, I say give it out. But I know I’m very much on my own with this one.10th over: Pakistan 58-0 (Imam 30, Fakhar 27) The final over of the first power play is another good’un from Morris - a most underrated bowler, for mine. Fakhar plays him respectfully before they opening pair trade singles to the sweepers at long leg and third man. That makes 58 from the first ten. Nice work but pegged back well by the Proteas in the last few. They were on track for 70-plus until then.9th over: Pakistan 55-0 (Imam 29, Fakhar 25) Two top overs on the bounce from Rabada, targeting Fakhar’s toes then his lid before getting through him with pace. Off strike with a single, Imam is beaten outside the off-stump. South Africa’s best over of the morning. Will Faf keep Rabada on for a sixth? They must break this up.8th over: Pakistan 54-0 (Imam 29, Fakhar 24) Morris is on to replace Ngidi from the pavilion end and he’s immediately driven down the ground by Imam for four, bringing up the 50 partnership! He’s been just as productive as Fakhar, all along the carpet. Oh, until now: that’s a genuine edge Morris has found but between the wicketkeeper and the man at about second slip. Fragmented cordons never work.7th over: Pakistan 46-0 (Imam 21, Fakhar 24) du Plessis shows faith in Rabada to go again and he’s rewarded with a better return. First up, Imam tried to flick and missed, prompting an enthusiastic appeal. They are right not to review it, the ball pitching comfortably outside the leg stump. Rabada sprays the next but is where he needs to be for the remainder, just a single added to third man.“Spent a couple of hours of a sun-kissed afternoon in a Birkenhead pub with views over the river Mersey to the Liverpool waterfront discussing the finer points of Afghanistan run chase with a random stranger,” writes John Norris. “World Cup cricket bringing people together, Adam!” You’re filling my heart. It feeeeeels like this tournament turned a corner over the last four days or so. Let’s hope we can put all the negativity behind us from now.6th over: Pakistan 44-0 (Imam 20, Fakhar 24) Ohhhh, find a TV Fakhar is ON ONE ALRIGHT! I suppose that qualifies as a shortish offering from Ngidi, but the timing on the Fakhar slappull is immaculate, landing it in the grandstand for the first SIX of the day. Both openers are into the 20s at better than a run a ball. Keep going! 5th over: Pakistan 35-0 (Imam 17, Fakhar 18) Ooh, this is joyous cricket! Fakhar given just a fraction of width by Rabada at the better part of 90 miles an hour slaps him off the front foot behind point for another four! Yes, that was in the air but good luck stopping it. My favourite Fakhar innings was when we were at Harare last year for a T20 tri-series and single-handedly (well, with Shoaib) won the final against Australia with a perfectly timed chase. Good little tournament, that.4th over: Pakistan 29-0 (Imam 16, Fakhar 13) Imam’s turn! Ngidi goes fuller than Rabada at the less flamboyant of the openers and he responds with a pristine square drive for four. Lovely. And again from the second ball, this time nailing his cover drive... four more! He makes it a third in the ober from the final ball, timing the pants off a push that bisects where the previous two went, hitting the cover-point rope. There’s an awful lot to like about these two when batting freely.3rd over: Pakistan 17-0 (Imam 4, Fakhar 13) Fakhar is having a pop in this power play! Rabada drops just a fraction short an he’s onto it immediately, pulling out to the Mound Stand for four. Later in the over, from roughly the same length, he goes again with a calculated hoick over square leg, a couple of bounces into the fence in front of the Tavern Stand. Ooooh, I love it when Fakhar is on one. LOOK OUT. “Went for a swim in the morning so I could get into my afternoon nap immediately after lunch \u0026amp avoid watching on tv,” writes Omar Ahsan of his Sunday. “Cheated \u0026amp checked  coverage. I gather we’re batting. Good show. Will check again at my teatime (18.15 pst  14.15 bst) \u0026amp if we are not doing well I will blame it on some I’ll will you harbour ‘gainst my blv’d Sarfraz’s stalwarts.” I’d watch if I were you! 2nd over: Pakistan 9-0 (Imam 4, Fakhar 5) Ngidi begins with the other new ball from the pavilion end. Usually there is a scoreboard in operation down that way above the Allen Stand but not during this World Cup - it has been turned into an advertising screen when replays aren’t being shown. I’m not sure about that. Anyway, Ngidi is played carefully by Imam for the first half of the over before he leans into a compact drive through cover for three. Fakhar tries to play the more a more elaborate version of that stroke to finish but doesn’t get all of it, keeping the strike with one to extra cover instead. Good positive batting from the openers.1st over: Pakistan 5-0 (Imam 1, Fakhar 4) Imam is away first ball with a tuck off his hip. Fakhar is too, creaming a shortish delivery outside the off stump from his back foot through cover for four! A lovely way to begin for a man who is surely due to go big soon. Rabada finds his preferred line and length by the end of the over. We’re ready to go at Lord’s! Kagiso Rabada has the new ball in his hand, running away from us at the Nursery End. Imam is facing the first delivery. PLAY! Anthems. Beginning with the best of them all, South Africa. Pakistan’s is one of the more stirring going around in the cricket world as well, for mine. Nice stuff.Virat Kohli has been stung 25 per cent of his match fee. “Excessive appealing during an international match,” the formal reason. Most amusing that it was Chris Broad handing down the sanction, given the history. Twitter will be fun today. As we wait for anthems, a note in from Kimberley Thonger on this semi-steamy morning. “You ask how we shall be spending our Sunday? Sitting in an interminable queue at the recycling centre in a white van dealing with the aftermath of our daughter’s house move, man(\u0026ampwoman)fully listening to TMS and reading OBO to keep our spirits up. So here’s to white van men and women all over the cricket playing world. May your radio and 3G signals be ever strong.”Mind picking up the tree I cut down before the World Cup and forgot to get rid of before starting this run of 18-hour days? About a mile north of Ally Pally. Ta. “Good morning.” And to you, Anand Kumar. “My son turned 7 yesterday and we are having a lego themed workshop and party happening as I type this. I had calculated that, with the kids engaged with their instructor, I would get to watch the game undisturbed for a bit. However, my phone is now connected to the bluetooth speaker blasting out Marshmello songs. So, I will be relying on OBO to make things interesting. Help me out.”The chance to spend hours a week playing lego is a huge incentive for me to get busy and procreate. But I’ll do my best to give you some over-by-over respite.So, Shoaib Malik has been left out for Haris Sohail. Shaheen Afridi gets another chance too, at the expense of Hasan Ali. Sarfraz says the track is a belter. My below picture is a bit deceptive. It’s turning into a smashing day in London. It’s still a little bit grey overhead but the sun is doing what you would expect it to on 23 June. I saw reports of a green track 24 hours ago but it isn’t that. Some grass remains but I can’t imagine that will be enough to convince a captain to bowl first. Not on the evidence of this tournament, either. They’ll be out for the toss shortly.Couple of compelling games yesterday, weren’t they? Here’s how I saw India’s win. I had a scorched-earth intro ready to go if Afghanistan fell over the line. Next time.It has been a long time coming, the carnival arriving at headquarters for day 25 of the tournament. When administrators were piecing together the schedule, they could not have expected that the first game to feature here would be between two teams who have so far disappointed more than any other. A nice upbeat start!Coming in with one win from six starts, South Africa arrive in eighth spot while their opposition, Pakistan (one win from five), are ninth. Due to that game in hand, Pakistan are the more alive of the two, but that isn’t much of a calling card. The 1992 comparisons with Sarzraf Ahmed’s side have been done to death, but given we’re at that part of the wild ride from 27 years ago, we’ll do it one more time. In short, if they were to orchestrate a remarkable rally, they could finish on 11 points and make the semis. But four on the trot? Remember, this team has won four of their last 24 ODIs. Beat England though, didn’t they. A long time ago.Predicably, the response to Pakistan’s loss to India was unhinged, especially from the crew of ex-players making headlines for any number of zany reasons. Maybe Sarfraz will walk out to the toss in a cornered tiger t-shirt? We can only hope. Mathematically, South Africa can also make the four (I promise this is the only time I will say this today), but that is a fact that the camp themselves weren’t even certain of in the lead up to this game. In reality, nine points – their ceiling - won’t cut it. So much has happened since Faf du Plessis’ team lost to England in the opener on 30 May. But they were gallant in defeat against New Zealand.These sides have never before played at Lord’s, with South Africa enjoying a healthy overall lead in ODIs (50 to 27) and in World Cups (3-1). In all ODIs at Lord’s, the Proteas have won one of four, coming in 2017 against England when they bowled them out for very little on a green top. Pakistan have four wins here.So with expecations, shall we say, suitably managed, let’s hope they are exceeded. We had a superb day in the sun yesterday, let’s have another. I’m looking forward to your company throughout. How are you spending your Sunday? Hit me up.

More far-reaching than any I have seen in more than 20 years as the Observer’s drama critic. Accelerating. Overdue. Irrevocable. Welcome.There used to be a template for the artistic directors of theatres. A template about as restricted as candidates for the Tory party leadership. White and male. Obviously. This was so continuous with the default position for power in Britain that for ages it went unremarked. Not any more. At the press conference to announce his opening season as artistic director of the Donmar in April, Michael Longhurst was asked if, as a white man, he now found himself in a minority among new appointees. Yes, he said. “Quite rightly.”The shift from all-maleness has come in spurts, since the beginning of the 2000s, when Gemma Bodinetz took over at Liverpool, and Vicky Featherstone headed up the new National Theatre of Scotland. The end of the whitewashing of British theatre (or, rather, the beginning of the end) came later – but is moving more decisively. Last year was crucial: a series of appointments of people of colour reordered the alphabet of artistic directorships. From Justin Audibert to Matthew Xia.A look at London’s Young Vic, where Kwame Kwei-Armah took over last year, demonstrates what a difference a new theatrical head can make. His task looked hard: his predecessor, David Lan, had run a superb theatre. But Kwei-Armah has already proved there is another kind of superb. His programming has been distinctive and bold, mashing up text with music (a carnival Twelfth Night) triumphantly casting black actors in parts previously considered the realm of white performers (Death of a Salesman), putting on work that merges dance and installation art (Bronx Gothic). The atmosphere in the bar is galvanising. A couple of years ago, the actor Janet Suzman claimed that “theatre is a white invention, a European invention, and white people go to it”. The Young Vic is a living refutation of this. As is Stratford East, a theatre reignited by the dynamism of its new artistic director, Nadia Fall. Fall says: “Diversity is not our endgame. Our endgame has to be quality of work.” So no plays about her “strict Asian” upbringing – any more than Nicholas Hytner’s National Theatre was heavy with dramas about being Jewish in Manchester. Rather, she has brought a buoyant internationalism – and a fresh emphasis on inventive design. Female designers have been in the vanguard of those remodelling the theatre and its workforce: Rosie Elnile and Joanna Scotcher have made Stratford glow.In bringing new looks, new sounds, new subjects to their theatres, the new directors will expand possibilities and audiences – especially if they keep an eye on ticket prices. In the interviews with the new artistic directors that follow, I was particularly struck by what HighTide’s Suba Das says about reaching out to choreographers and tapping into love of standup. It is hard, though, to guess what changes will be wrought: if we knew what the next thing was it wouldn’t be new. The encouraging thing is that as one barrier is tipped over it nudges the next. The Donmar’s 2012 all-women Shakespeares were a turning point. The publicity was about their femaleness but the productions were Trojan mares, shifting the norm: they featured more black, more brown, more short and more round bodies – and more non-RP accents. We saw talent of which the stage had been starved. We’ll see more under these new bosses. Perhaps we’ll even have many more people of colour as theatre critics.Lynette Linton, 29, was born in Leytonstone, east London, and had early ambitions to be a screen actor. Theatre didn’t appeal to her at first, but after joining the National Youth Theatre in her early 20s and receiving encouragement from director Rikki Beadle-Blair, she turned her attention to writing and directing for the stage. Sustained by a job at John Lewis – she worked in the Oxford Street food hall and edited the retailer’s in-house magazine – Linton wrote her first play, Step, which was staged at Theatre Royal Stratford East in 2013. She went on to direct work for the Gate theatre and the Donmar, where her production of Lynn Nottage’s Sweat garnered five-star reviews last December (it transferred to the West End earlier this month).The Bush theatre, in an “incredibly multicultural” area of west London, is renowned as a champion of new writing talent – it premiered early work by writers such as Stephen Poliakoff and Conor McPherson – and as a magnet for erse audiences. Taking over as artistic director from Madani Younis, who is now at the Southbank Centre, Linton is determined to connect with local communities and open up the building even more to younger audiences and creators. “When I was 15, I wasn’t a theatre person,” she says, “so what can I do to make sure 15-year-olds now feel like they are theatre people?”What three words sum up your theatre?Bold, fresh and west-London (we can pretend that’s one word).Sell theatre to someone who says they’re not the theatre-going type…Do you watch Netflix? Do you go to the cinema? If so, just come a little bit further down the road and see a story live. Because it’s all storytelling. And the liveness of theatre is so exciting.What single thing would improve British theatre?Understanding that community work and “professional” work on the stage are the same thing. The community should be feeding the work on the stage, and vice versa. I always have an open rehearsal room. I invite young people to sit in and learn and be part of it and give their opinions. Who are you making it for otherwise?What show have you seen recently that really made an impact on you?My White Best Friend at the Bunker. It was reacting to events happening that week, and it made me think a lot about theatre’s responsibility to respond to current events.What can’t you live without at work?Yorkshire teabags. That was the first thing I changed at the Bush – they had PG Tips and I was like, “What is this?!” I have five cups a day if I’m in rehearsal it’s worse. My tea is very specific. It’s no sugar, incredibly strong, maybe two drops of milk. You have to put the milk in before taking the teabag out, otherwise it loses its taste. That’s very important.What books are on your bedside table?I have just reread Small Island by Andrea Levy, and I’m about to start Natives by Akala. I saw the production of Small Island at the Olivier and I love Andrea Levy’s writing, so I wanted to spend some more time with the book.Hamilton or Hamlet?Hamilton. It’s one of the best things in years. It’s stunning.Who would be your dream person to work with – dead or alive?James Baldwin. He is one of my biggest inspirations and I remember reading his books at university, Giovanni’s Room and Another Country specifically. He made me see the world differently.What should we come and see at your theatre?Strange Fruit by Caryl Phillips (until 27 July). It’s part of our Passing the Baton scheme, where we revive a work by an artist of colour that should be seen. It’s going to be a phenomenal show. KFIt is quite possibly the most coveted job in British theatre: running London’s Donmar Warehouse, the boutique Covent Garden theatre that consistently punches above its weight. Following in the footsteps of Sam Mendes, Michael Grandage and Josie Rourke, Michael Longhurst has a huge task ahead of him but the 38-year-old seems unfazed.“And we’re off!!!! C’mon down,” he tweeted as he launched his first season in early April under the banner “important stories thrillingly told” and with an air of getting straight down to business.Born in Bromley in 1981, Longhurst studied philosophy at Nottingham University before training as a theatre director at Mountview Academy of Theatre Arts in London. He made his name with Nick Payne’s Constellations, which transferred from the Royal Court to the West End in 2012. Since then his hits have included Amadeus at the National Theatre, They Drink It in the Congo at the Almeida and Caroline, Or Change at the Chichester festival theatre, then in the West End.His mission is “about making sure the most relevant and important stories are hitting our stage”, he says. “We have programmed lots of new writing and revivals that resonate with where the world is at the moment.” They kicked off last week with David Greig’s prophetic Europe, which explores our complex relationship to the continent. “It’s the 25-year anniversary of the play and it reads like it was written yesterday,” Longhurst says.What three words sum up your theatre?Tiny magical warehouse. It’s a miraculous space – 251 seats in the heart of Covent Garden, and the intimacy just makes for this incredible live experience. It’s always described as an actors’ church because you can see the whites of the eyes and the beads of sweat, and that makes for an electric connection.How would you describe your current audience and what will you do to attract new audiences?The current audience is very loyal and generous and they are up for an eclectic mix of work. In terms of new audiences, we will be continuing the Young+Free scheme, giving free tickets to people under 25, and we’re introducing Donmar Daily Release, which means holding back tickets so that 40 can be released every day for a show one week away. This allows people who can’t book in advance to get access to tickets.How would you sell theatre to someone who says they are not the theatre-going type?I would say that theatre mainlines a hit of the human condition like no other art form. It is the best way to receive a story today. The days of wobbly french windows and French farces are behind us. Theatre is in a time when it is using its form boldly to tell really exciting stories, and there is nothing like the live event of it.Is British theatre for all?Historically, it hasn’t been. I think it is waking up fast and that has to do with artists and directors being accountable for who is represented on our stages and who gets to make and tell those stories.What show have you seen recently that really made an impact on you?Death of a Salesman at the Young Vic left me weeping. Wendell Pierce and Sharon D Clarke were amazing. It’s an astonishing play about the hope that parents have in their children and the desire to please parents that children have. That shifting axis of expectation is heartbreaking and the African American lens that Marianne Elliott’s production put on it made me see the play afresh.Who or what first got you into the theatre?I loved panto as a child. Later, it was my English teacher, Mrs Withers, and my drama teacher, Tom Band, at St John Rigby school in Bromley who ignited my passion. It’s devastating that arts subjects are falling off the curriculum.Do you have a mentor or role model?Dominic Cooke has always been a guiding hand and light for me. He gave me big breaks early on in my career at the Royal Court and sage advice on making art and, now, running companies.What are the top three personal skills that you need as an artistic director?Stamina, stamina, stamina. As a freelance director I could obsessively enter the bubble of making a show. At this moment, when I am in rehearsals the building still needs attention and support and funding. Those things don’t go away while you actually make the art.Favourite art form other than theatre?Impossible to answer. But I do love an art gallery. I think plays are kinetic sculptures. I love the design process of the shows: it’s fascinating and magical to me.Hamilton or Hamlet?I’d like to direct both.Who would be your dream actor to work with?There are so many actors I have as crushes it is hard to name just one, but Billie Piper, Olivia Colman, Riz Ahmed – call me. LO’KSuba Das was born in 1984 on a council estate in Ashington, near Newcastle, the son of immigrants from rural India. Twice a week his father, a restaurant worker, would take Das and his twin, Deba, to the library, instilling in the brothers a love of learning that helped propel them to scholarships at Newcastle Royal grammar school and then to Cambridge University. After a postgraduate directing course at Birkbeck College, London, Das started out as assistant director at the Theatre Royal Stratford East, going on to direct at Nottingham Playhouse and the Young Vic, among other venues. Most recently, he was associate director at Curve Leicester, where he oversaw the development of new work. His credits at Curve included Wipers by Ishy Din and Pink Sari Revolution by Purva Naresh.Das made his opera debut in 2017, directing the world premiere of Ravi Shankar’s Sukanya for the Royal Opera. Last spring he joined HighTide, the Suffolk-based theatre company and charity dedicated to discovering and launching new playwrights, which produces festivals in Aldeburgh, Edinburgh and, from 2021, also in Lowestoft. His first major challenge was Waltham Forest council unexpectedly withdrawing its funding for this summer’s HighTide festival in Walthamstow, which meant it had to be cancelled. “It was disappointing but, in truth, a sign of the times,” Das says. “We can no longer rely on traditional sources of funding like local authorities. We need to look for new ways to raise money and new ways of reaching erse audiences.”Why is new writing important?We look to art to help us understand ourselves and our world, and new, normally unheard and marginalised voices enable us to look at life from unexpected angles. We are in tumultuous times where we are having to ask ourselves who we are as a society and who we are as people. Theatre needs to be part of that. I’m interested in developing not only new playwrights but spoken word artists, choreographers and physical theatre-makers, too.What single thing would improve British theatre?An understanding that ersity, a word that gets chucked around in an affirmative-action kind of way, actually makes great business sense. The more different types of people you can attract the better.What are the top three skills you need as an artistic director?Generosity, because leadership is about what you are comfortable giving away. Flexibility, because, Lord knows, your diary will change on a day-to-day basis. And fiscal prudence.What books are on your bedside table?Playwriting by the late, great dramatist Stephen Jeffreys, which is the most astonishing analysis of the craft ever. He was a genius on structure and character, the nuts and bolts of it, the practical as well as the ethereal. And Beloved by Toni Morrison, the most important book I have read.How would you sell theatre to someone who says they are not the theatre-going type?I would say that if you love going to standup comedy, you love going clubbing, you love going to cabaret and you love going to a gig then, actually, you love theatre. LO’KCharlotte Bennett and Katie Posner, who take over as joint artistic directors at the London touring theatre company Paines Plough in August, met while directing separate plays at York Theatre Royal 10 years ago. Bennett, who grew up in Leeds, had just started her own company, Forward Theatre Project, while Posner, a Londoner, was working for York’s Pilot theatre. “Over time, we became artistic mentors to each other,” says Bennett. “And because we were both working with touring companies, we had lots of big chats about the joys and difficulties of that.”A decade on, with Bennett heading up the new writing department at Soho theatre, and Posner directing shows around the country on a freelance basis, both women had their eye on the top job at Paines Plough. When it came up, they decided to pool their strengths rather than compete.Their mission at the 45-year-old company, which focuses entirely on new writing and has worked with writers such as Sarah Kane, Mark Ravenhill, Enda Walsh, Abi Morgan and Mike Bartlett, will be “championing the unheard and reaching the overlooked”, according to Bennett. Posner adds: “It’s about finding exciting artists who wouldn’t necessarily define themselves as playwrights, and telling stories in unique and brilliant ways to make the industry wake up.”What three words sum up your theatre?KP Everywhere, unafraid, immediate.Sell theatre to someone who says they’re not the theatre-going type…KP There’s no one size fits all. You just have a conversation with them. “What do you enjoy? What excites you?” I directed a play about football for Northern Stage, and we’d go hang out in pubs in Newcastle and chat to people about what we were doing – and we genuinely saw such a different audience as a result.What single thing would improve British theatre?CB Placing more value on arts in education. With arts subjects going out of the curriculum in schools across the country, it’s sending a message to young people that the arts are not an important part of their lives or career prospects.Which theatre, Britain or beyond, do you most like going to and why?CB Live theatre in Newcastle, because it was born out of a working-class arts movement in the city. There’s no room for ego or pretension, and there’s a real honesty in geordie audiences. Before Margaret Thatcher died, I did a show that contained a quote from her last day in office, saying: “I feel very happy that I’m leaving the country in a better state.” Every night, the audience shouted back: “Fuck off!” It was amazing.What show have you seen recently that really made an impact on you?KP It’s the same for both of us: Misty at the Bush theatre. Arinzé Kene is incredible. Walking into that space and having a visceral reaction to something that grappled with form in an innovative way, it blew our minds.KP The first play I ever fell in love with was Jim Cartwright’s Road. I thought, this has real people, beautiful storytelling and heart-wrenching drama. It all made sense from there.Best production you’ve seen?CB Ruined by Lynn Nottage, directed by Indhu Rubasingham in 2010. I was an usher at the Almeida, so I saw it a lot of times. It was so funny and vibrant and beautiful but also completely devastating and heartbreaking and difficult. It will stay with me for ever.What can’t you live without at work?KP Laughter. If you’ve had a terrible day and things are hard, but you can still have a laugh, then it’s OK.What’s your other favourite art form, and does it feed into your work?CB Books and music. When I listen to music it helps me think about scenes or feelings in scenes.KP Music and sound are a major part of how I make work. The world is never silent, so I’m always working to find ways of integrating sounds and music on stage.Who would be your dream colleague or actor to work with?CB Joan Littlewood, the mother of modern theatre. She was always looking for what was modern, fresh and original.KP Maxine Peake. We just saw her in Avalanche and we love her. KFSean Foley is a proud Brummie, so becoming artistic director of Birmingham Repertory theatre means coming home. It also means he is deeply aware of the importance of the Rep and its 1971 building in the cultural life of the city and the nation. “It’s a historic theatre, the first in the UK to be based in its own building,” he says. “Pre-National Theatre, it was the place Olivier wanted to go and be seen he trained here along with John Gielgud, Ralph Richardson, Peggy Ashcroft, Paul Scofield – that’s quite some heritage.”Foley made his name as a writer, comedian and actor before turning to directing. He co-founded the Right Size with Hamish McColl, and their stage shows The Play What I Wrote and Do You Come Here Often? became long-running West End and Broadway hits. Other directing credits include Jeeves and Wooster in Perfect Nonsense, which won an Olivier award in 2014, The Ladykillers, Ducktastic and the unloved X Factor musical I Can’t Sing!. He also directed the 2016 comedy film Mindhorn.His predecessor at the Rep, Roxana Silbert (now at Hampstead theatre), left the company in a strong position, having won praise for her promotion of ersity, championing of accessibility and continued nurturing of new writing. Stepping into her shoes is “a massive challenge”, says Foley.What is your current audience like and how will you attract new ones?They are Brummies, so they’ll be smart, self-deprecating and surprisingly sophisticated. Birmingham people have an amazing dry sense of humour they’re very generous, too. Birmingham has the most youthful demographic in the UK and is actually the most erse city, eclipsing even London. Yet, essentially, theatre is still a middle-class sport. It’s less well-funded than it used to be, but there’s nonetheless a lot of public money going into theatre, and the end results are only reaching a very small proportion of people. So that should change. And changing it is really about making shows that can appeal to a wide demographic and genuinely engage the local population by doing what theatre has done since time immemorial: telling stories that people can relate to in an exciting way.Which theatre in Britain or the rest of the world do you like going to?I really enjoyed St Ann’s Warehouse in Brooklyn, recently. The vibe was great, there was a very mixed audience, and the show was superb. It was The B-Side by the Wooster Group, which consisted of three actors telling the stories behind an album of chain-gang songs and singing them. It was incredibly moving.Who or what got you into theatre?When I was at Oxford University in the mid-80s, I could not get on with any of the drama societies, so I ended up joining the Oxford Youth Theatre. The people who were running it happened to know this bunch of crazy cats who had just come back from a theatre school in Paris and set up their own company with an extremely pretentious name: Théâtre de Complicité. To get free rehearsal space they were giving workshops. I went to a couple and thought, Ah‑ha, this is different.Do you have a mentor or a role model?Kenneth Branagh has been a massive influence. He directed me in The Play What I Wrote and I’ve worked with him many times since then and learned a lot from him about leading creative projects. He is a brilliant leader.What can’t you live without at work?Coffee and bananas, not necessarily in that order.What’s your other favourite art form and does it feed into your work?Film is a big love of mine. One of my heroes is Billy Wilder. He understood the importance of rhythm, pace and storytelling, all of which are essential elements in the way I direct, especially with comedy.What books are on your bedside table?A Single Man by Christopher Isherwood because I am reading it with my book club The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin by David Nobbs because I am trying to make a musical out of it for the Rep and Lowborn by Kerry Hudson because it feels absolutely of this moment.Who would be your dream actor or directing colleague to work with?Buster Keaton and Joan Littlewood.Hamilton or Hamlet?This is a naughty question because you’re asking me to choose between an apple and an orange. The obvious thing to do would be to choose both but I’m not going to do that. I’m going to say Hamlet‑ton. LO’KBorn in Sunderland to Egyptian parents, Tarek Iskander lived in Kuwait between the ages of five and 17, returning to England at the outbreak of the first Gulf war. His introduction to theatre came late. He was working as a management consultant at the NHS when, after accompanying his then partner to an audition, he ended up as an extra on Deborah Warner’s 2005 production of Julius Caesar at the Barbican. “Watching one of the best directors in the world, I thought: I could really do that,” he recalls.Iskander went on to co-found the Yard theatre in east London, where he directed two of his own plays including Qudz, “a show very close to my heart about Iraq and the Middle East”. He could only afford to quit his NHS job four years ago, going on to serve as interim director for theatre at Arts Council England. BAC, where he is now artistic director and chief executive, has been staging experimental theatre and testing out works in progress (what it refers to as “scratch” theatre) at its sprawling Victorian premises near Clapham Junction in south London since the 1970s. Iskander has been a regular there for years. “It was a place that always surprised me, where I could see the artists I was most excited about and never really knew what I was going to get,” he says.What three words sum up your theatre?Surprising, unpredictable, pioneering.What single thing would improve British theatre?Having more exchange and dialogue with international work. We are absolute leaders in some areas, such as inclusiveness and ersity, but we would benefit from further exchange, especially around artistic practice. It can come from anywhere – we’ve learned a lot by working with our colleagues in favelas in Brazil – but you have to engage with the world in order to benefit from that expertise.What show have you seen recently that really made an impact on you?Selina Thompson’s Salt has haunted me ever since I first saw it in Edinburgh, and it moved me deeply when I saw it again recently – it’s a remarkable piece of dialogue and conversation.Top three skills you need as an artistic director?You need to be open to possibilities wherever they arise, willing to make tough decisions when necessary, and engaged with what’s happening in the community around you.What can’t you live without at work?Caffeine. It starts with a cappuccino, then becomes really, really strong black coffee by late afternoon.What’s your favourite art form aside from theatre?Recently I’ve really started to get into dance, much more than previously, so I’m finding myself constantly going to dance performances.What books are on your bedside table?I’m reading quite a lot of David Mitchell – most recently Number9Dream, which I think is my favourite of his – and Ben Okri, his poems rather than his novels. Next up is Wolf Hall by Hilary Mantel.Hamilton or Hamlet?Hamilton, because it’s fresh.Who would be your dream colleague?Benjamin Zephaniah, either performing or developing a piece of work, a story that we could really get our teeth into. I’m interested in his focus on ecology and vegetarianism.What should we come and see at your theatre?One by Bert and Nasi (30 September-19 October). I have seen this show twice and it’s that rare combination of hilarious but also deeply profound and moving.

Plus train reservationsThe sight of a gleaming railway snaking over an Alpine pass or hugging a lake has long inspired travellers, and both are well served by rail routes. This itinerary weaves from France through Switzerland to Austria, with spectacular views that will glue you to the train windows.At Lausanne, be sure to take an early morning dip at Plage de Pully, watching the sun rise over the Alps as you swim. Heading onwards, skirt Lake Geneva to the beautiful town of Annecy, and take the chance to paddle a canoe to La Cuillère à Omble, a restaurant at the lake’s southern end, serving local freshwater fish.Eastwards, at Chamonix, take the cable car to the top of the Aiguille du Midi for lunch at the self-service cafeteria of Le 3842 Restaurant, named for its lofty altitude. The journey onwards to Zermatt takes in magnificent scenery as the train hugs the mountainside. The stylish Swiss resort has wonderful hiking terrain, overlooked by the Matterhorn.At Lucerne, explore the cobbled alleys of the Kornmarkt and dine at the intimate, candlelit Grottino 1313 restaurant.

En route to Bergen, on the west coast, the train climbs to over 1,200 metres: you cross a mountain plateau called Hardangervidda and see waterfalls, cliffs and chasms. A sleeper takes you to Lillehammer, a pleasant lakeside town, and then it’s on to compact, wonderful Trondheim, founded in 977 AD. Take a boat trip to the island of Munkholmen – formerly a fort, monastery and second world war anti-aircraft gun station.Back into Sweden, pause for lakeside relaxation in Östersund and visit Jamtli, its historic open-air museum. A must-visit in Stockholm is the Vasa Museum, home of a ship salvaged in 1628 and majestically preserved. For hipster vibes, scoot over to Södermalm, an island within the city, and seek Bar Agrikultur in Nytorget.Speed back to Copenhagen and then on to Hamburg. Get up early for Altona fish market, which sells everything from sea creatures to fifth-hand junk – it’s a wholesome recovery after a big night out in the Reeperbahn district, perhaps.

European sleeper trains can cover vast distances overnight, so sleep to Ljubljana and wake up in a city whose grand central streets are beautifully car-free. Head up Ljubljana castle and then dine out at the Cankarjevo nabrežje, a riverside walkway lined with eateries.Your next train eastward is to Zagreb, with its beautiful Gornji Grad quarter, and Museum of Broken Relationships. Then sleep your way to Belgrade, a city brimming with culture and pedestrianised districts. Once in Niš, in southern Serbia, be sure to spend time at Holy Trinity cathedral, a curious mix of Byzantine, Islamic, Renaissance and baroque styles, replete with intricate frescoes.Onwards overnight into Bulgaria, via Sofia, you’ll alight at Plov, the oldest continually inhabited city in Europe. Eight thousand years after being founded, the city is 2019 European capital of culture. Don’t miss one of the best-preserved amphitheatres in the world.

The train then heads north to Bucharest, home of the vast Palace of Parliament, the world’s largest legislative building. From there, it’s a long sleeper train journey to stunning Vienna, epicentre of cafe culture. Explore museums such as Haus der Musik with rooms dedicated to the Viennese composers, including Mozart, Beethoven and Strauss, and the sumptuous Schönbrunn Palace, where Mozart performed aged six.Travel overnight to Venice, and seek out Gelateria Nico in Dorsoduro, which has been serving homemade ice-cream and its famous gianduiotto sundae since 1935.

This trip s eight countries – a massive dollop of European culture in one tour.

Next, venture south to Madrid, where restaurant Mercado de la Reina is the spot for generous portions of elaborate tapas. A fast AVE train will whisk you to Barcelona, to explore La Boqueria, the epic food market, and the architecture of the Gothic Quarter.Travel back over the border to Lyon, to stroll around the fountained Place des Jacobins and visit the Musée Miniature et Cinéma, a must for film lovers.In Turin, less than four hours away, cobbled Via Borga Dora has vintage clothes boutiques and a weekend flea market. Florence, spiritual – and physical – home of so much Renaissance art, needs no introduction. Tour wonders like the Duomo cathedral, and enjoy wine, pasta and other regional specialities at the Coquinarius restaurant.The comfortable NightJet sleeper train network connects Florence with pretty Salzburg. A network of ice caves 50km away in Werfen is a worthwhile jaunt.Prague, six hours’ ride to the north, is something of a Gothic fairytale. Check out picturesque park Petřínské Sady, Old Town Square and Prague Castle, which dates back to 870 AD.Travel overnight to Kraków, a city that – as well as epic historical sites – has a buzzing bar scene and hip hangouts such as Forum Przestrzenie on the banks of the Vistula. Further north, in Warsaw, admire the view over the city from the 30th floor of the Palace of Culture and Science.Time your overnight journey to Berlin to arrive on a Sunday, and head straight to Mauerpark for the bonkers outdoor karaoke – which attracts an audience of thousands from 3pm.At your final stop, Brussels, try the mussels at family-owned Chez Leon, and a final night out at Café Delirium, with its 2,004 beers.

In poor black Englewood, it’s just 60 – the most ergent of any US city Walking down 69th Street in Englewood, Chicago, near where she grew up, Michelle Rashad gestures to a rundown retail shop, across from a long open lot.The stores here – the few that haven’t been boarded up or burned to the ground – sell mostly packaged goods from behind thick plates of ballistic-proof glass. Even at the Subway sandwich shop a few blocks down, the healthy option in the area, customers have to shout their selections to overcome a muffling bulletproof encasement around the food and register.On a bustling Tuesday afternoon in Streeterville, meanwhile, it’s hard to believe those Englewood streets are just eight miles away. On an open space between the Ritz-Carlton and the Lurie children’s hospital, vendors hawk farm fresh tomatoes, cucumbers and squash in sheer abundance. There are handmade crêpes and fresh pastries. There is small-batch artisanal tofu.The gulf between the two communities which share a city, a mayor, a police force and a school system is just as apparent by the numbers. A recent analysis from the City Health Dashboard, published by the department of population health at New York University, found that the two neighborhoods have the most ergent life expectancy of any in the US that share the bounds of a city.In predominantly white Streeterville, Chicagoans can expect to live to 90. In Englewood, where the population is virtually all black, life expectancy is just 60.“There’s a concept that is increasingly being understood, that your zip code has as much to do with your health as your genetic code,” said Dr Marc Gourevitch, chair of the NYU department and the principal architect of the health dashboard.“Another way to look at that is that your zip code shouldn’t determine whether you get to see your grandkids. And at some level, that’s how I see and feel about these kinds of data. It’s shocking.”Back on 69th Street, Rashad reflected on this 30-year disparity.“That’s the difference of an entire generation,” she says, incredulity in her voice. “But I won’t accept that. Englewood won’t accept that.”Streeterville is almost a caricature of physical and economic health. The lakefront neighborhood, a mere 14 blocks north to south, is home to a Northwestern University campus and three hospitals. On a late spring day, teens toss footballs and volleyballs as joggers zig-zag with leashed dogs in tow. On a full-length track in front of a pair of highrise condominiums, Kate Gardner jogs. She can’t muster one complaint about life in Streeterville, save for a few weeks of unseasonably cool weather.“I know we’re lucky to be here, and that other people in the city don’t have it so good. It’s totally unfair,” she says.Then there’s the violence and the trauma it brings. Walking down 69th, Rashad stops to point.“That’s where, freshman year, my 14-year-old friend was killed,” she says. “A stray bullet went straight through the window while she was getting ready for school. And I have to walk past that block.“We’re constantly having to walk past these traumatic situations. You can literally look at the sidewalk where you’ve once seen blood or people bleed out, and you have to go to school, you have to go to work.”Englewood has long held a reputation as one of Chicago’s most violent neighborhoods. According to the Chicago Tribune, between 2000 and 2017 there were more than 4,800 shootings here.The violence, of course, drives down life expectancy and health outcomes. But health inequities also drive violence. Take lead poisoning. For decades, Englewood had one of the highest rates of residential lead contamination in the country. Research has shown that lead poisoning in children is associated with dramatic spikes in impulsiveness and aggression.“Irreversible brain damage just because of where you live, and you’re too poor to go anywhere else? It’s not fair. You’re cheating kids,” said Rashad, now executive director of Imagine Englewood If, a community group founded largely to draw attention to the lead crisis.It wasn’t always this way.“It was a Mecca!” exclaims lifelong resident Djanie Edwards, rattling through a list of vanished community anchors like the Sears store and the old Empress theatre. Everyone who remembers the community before the decay of the 1980s and 1990s points to the abandonment as perhaps the biggest change.“There wasn’t all these open lots everywhere, these were houses,” Edwards says, at the headquarters of Resident Association of Greater Englewood (Rage), the only occupied building on its block. In seven lots, only two structures are standing.Edwards remembers a time before local jobs began to move overseas, like at the Nabisco bakery where Rashad’s father worked most of his life. Unemployment opened the door to drugs, drugs fostered an environment of violence, the community fell into poor health and dysfunction.“When cocaine hit there was such a rapid decline, and it affected iniduals across the spectrum,” said Rodney Johnson, whose family arrived in the community in 1966. He was one of many who left in the 1980s but he has now returned, in part to deploy his skills as a public health researcher.Johnson is one member of a team of “community health navigators” who this week began conducting a door-to-door survey. One of the most pressing questions they’re trying to answer is why there seems to be a disconnect between services that are actually available in the community and residents who do not use them.“The ironic thing is there are a lot of health resources available here,” said Cecile De Mello of Englewood Rising, one of the community groups involved in the research. “We want to know what are the barriers to people taking advantage of care opportunities in the community. Is it issues around safety? Is it issues around transportation? Is it that people feel helpless, and that they need motivation to help them get into care?”It’s not all doom and gloom. There are patches of hope, like the abandoned lot Tina Hammond bought across from her home for $1, thanks to a city program. She and her husband made it into a green space with colorful planters, murals and space for community events like free yoga. The named it The Promise Land.“It shouldn’t be that we have to have money or a certain income to get this kind of stuff,” Hammond said. “That’s why I envision just a beautiful space, something to get your mind off all the wretchedness that’s going on in life and all on these blocks. A place to just go and sit, relax and bring calm.”There’s economic development too, bringing more healthy options to a community long described as a “food desert”. De Mello found her way to community work after being heavily involved in the siting of a Whole Foods market in Englewood, focusing on making sure products were affordable and accessible.Violence is trending down too – though the reasons are still hotly contested.More than anything, community groups like I Grow Chicago are giving residents hope. Their “peace house”, across the street from a community garden, is a frenetic jumble of answers to unmet needs. Visitors might be there for anything from toilet paper and toothpaste to a Reiki healing session.Ora Bradley, who has lived in Englewood most of her life, spoke to the  at the peace house as Reiki masters “smudged” the room with palo santo.“There was a time I wanted out of this neighborhood so badly,” said Bradley, who watched her son Julius get caught in the drug game, spending time in jail.She says the I Grow Chicago campus, which has essentially taken over her block, is nothing short of a godsend. The organization trains community members in construction and is refurbishing homes as community space or affordable housing.Bradley says she still wants to leave, but for a very different reason. She wants to donate her home to I Grow, to make it part of its growing “peace campus”.“There’s a desire that’s been placed in my heart to do this for our children,” she says, “and I can’t let it go”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a96ffb070a73073dee32aeceb9aa965714a0a71/0_309_6192_3715/master/6192.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc62906f4a98c896fdffafdc4d0468c9","title":"democratic debates 2020 joe biden bernie sanders","story":"Twenty presidential contenders go head-to-head in the opening test of 2020, and the president will loom largeAs he sensed the crowd flagging, Donald Trump switched gears to the all-important question of his re-election slogan. Should the insurgent turned incumbent stick with “Make America great again” (Maga), which he characterised as “probably and possibly the greatest theme in the history of politics”? Or should he switch to “Keep America great”?It was the latter that that turned the stadium into a cauldron of noise.“Ah, I’m sorry, Maga Country, but that wasn’t too close,” the president said on Tuesday night. “I thought you had it won, and then I heard this cheer. My eardrums will never been the same. Keep America great.”This week it will be the Democrats’ turn to search for a magic sentence. Twenty candidates, each vying to make Trump the first one-term president since George HW Bush, will line up over two nights for the party’s first primary debates in Miami. All will be keen to avoid a campaign-ending gaffe all will be keen to deliver a “zinger” that goes viral and can rival the potency of “Make America great again”.Among the oldest candidates in the field is Joe Biden, 76, whose pitch has been described by sceptics as “Make America 2016 again” – a restoration of the Obama presidency, when Biden served as deputy. But the youngest contender, Pete Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has stressed the need to look forwardly, saying pointedly: “There is no such thing as an honest politics that revolves around the word ‘again’.”Neil Sroka, a spokesperson for the progressive group Democracy for America, said: “‘Make America great again’ was clear and very much in line with the bigotry that underlay both the Trump campaign and administration. The slogan did something Trump is unable to to do: keep the loud part quiet and keep the quiet part loud. With ‘Keep America great’ the important point is silent: it means keep America great for straight white men.“The key for Democrats is to articulate a bold, inclusive people’s vision of the country that is easy for people to understand and is as effective as ‘Make America great again’ in that is says something quietly – that is, it’s for all of us. We’re going to need everyone to beat the kind of hate-filled campaign Trump is going to run.”The first Democrat to enter the race was former congressman John Delaney, nearly two years ago. Other candidates have been campaigning and fundraising for months. But for millions of Americans, this week’s debates will fire the starting gun in earnest. The line-up is historically erse, including six women, six people of colour and a gay man.Democratic voters are wrestling with myriad push and pull factors. Is Trump such a uniquely awful singularity that the party should play safe and stay in the centre? Can they contemplate nominating yet another ageing white male? Is this election about turning out the base or reaching out to independents and disaffected Republicans? Or has Trump changed everything?The candidates’ podium positions will reflect their standings in polls as of 12 June. Elizabeth Warren and former congressman Beto O’Rourke of Texas will be centre stage on the first night, giving Warren, who has been surging, a real chance to shine. On night two, Biden and Bernie Sanders will be in the middle, flanked by rivals including Buttigieg and Kamala Harris.It will be a particular test for Biden, whose runs for president in 1988 and 2008 crashed and burned and who has been described as a “gaffe machine”. Last week, for example, he recalled the “civility” of racial segregationists he worked with in the Senate. “He never called me ‘boy,’ he always called me ‘son’,” he said of one of them, citing a racist term and earning a sharp rebuke from other candidates.James Clyburn, who is African American and the majority whip in the House of Representatives, said on Friday: “It was an unforced error that hopefully he won’t make too many of. But like in any tennis match, one unforced error, even two unforced errors, would not necessarily lose the match. Biden was just talking about his ability to go outside of his comfort zone and maybe get a little bit too comfortable saying that.”Clyburn has been described as the “kingmaker” in South Carolina, the first southern state to vote. “Just from the reports I’m getting, people are telling me that Biden is performing exceptionally well,” he said. “He has a tremendous reservoir of goodwill here in the state.” But Biden has to be “at the top of his game” in the debates, he added.Indeed, Biden will be the primary target for his fellow debaters. Henry Olsen, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center thinktank in Washington, said: “He’s a 76-year-old taking incoming from his left, right and centre for two hours under hot television lights. He’s not had that for 20 years. All it takes is one tired moment at 10.35pm and that’s the story. There’a s high possibility of it happening.”Olsen said: “The ideal Democrat will have the personality where Trump’s attacks would seem crazy or just bounce off. Biden’s isn’t that. Amy Klobuchar would be that sort of person. Cory Booker could be.“The Democratic base can only get you so far. To win, you have to do well among disaffected suburban Republicans and blue-collar former Democrats. Ideally, you would not want a strongly progressive platform because that gives Trump something to run against. You want something like the 2018 midterms campaign: House Democrats ran on bland, vanilla issues and won. But I don’t know if the progressive wing is willing to let them do that.”Ever since John F Kennedy outshone a clammy and unshaven Richard Nixon, whose pale suit fared poorly on black and white television in 1960, election campaign debates have also been about charisma and dominating the small screen – a place where Trump feels at home.Aaron Kall, director of debate at the University of Michigan, said: “Viewers do think about that: who could hold their own on a debate stage with President Trump? Biden, given his stature, gravitas and experience as vice-president, would be able to hold it, but he definitely doesn’t have the star quality. If there’s anyone with that ‘it factor’ quality, I would say it’s Buttigieg.”But he added: “None of them has the star power of Trump or is going to get 20,000 people at a rally.”That is what the president pulled off last week in Orlando, Florida. Democrats will also struggle to match the sheer razzamatazz of a Trump rally, a now familiar blend of rock concert, sports fixture, political pantomime and, in the view of critics, a bath in in rancid nostalgia.Just as the “Make America great again” slogan is widely seen as harking back to the 1950s – a nation of idyllic suburbia for white people and Jim Crow laws for African Americans – so the soundtrack of Trump rallies is full of booming golden oldies with resonant lines. On Tuesday there was the Rolling Stones , Luciano Pavarotti (Nessun dorma, or “None shall sleep”), Frank Sinatra (My Way), the musical Cats (Memory) and Queen, whose song We are the Champions contains the Trumpian lyric: “No time for losers.”Equally fitting, the rally was held in a sports stadium and served up a matchday blend of fun, menace and tribalism: fans wearing team colours, performing the Mexican wave, cheering their team and booing the opposition. When the crowd hollered “Lock her up!” about Hillary Clinton, Trump’s 2016 opponent, it was like the muscle memory of football fans chanting about a long retired player. “Build that wall!” is an evergreen favourite too.And Trump himself peddled nostalgia, not only for an America that never was, but for the alleged glories of 2016. His rambling speech of nearly an hour and half recycled the same old populist themes, tropes and falsehoods, from Clinton-bashing to fearmongering about immigration, and offered few policy proposals.When Trump stayed on script and touted his accomplishments (economic growth, low unemployment, conservative judges), he seemed a little flat and the crowd felt it, but when he aired grievances (“We went through the biggest witch hunt in political history”) and went on the attack against the media (“That is a lot of fake news back there”), he became fired up, an ageing rocker playing his greatest hits.Democrats are “a radical leftwing mob”, Trump said. “A vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism, and the destruction of the American dream … This election is not merely a verdict on the amazing progress we’ve made. It’s a verdict on the un-American conduct of those who try to undermine our great democracy and undermine you.”His base, which was overwhelmingly white, lapped it up as they wore T-shirts that included the legends “Make liberals cry again” and “Fuck your feelings”.Bill Galston, a former adviser to President Bill Clinton, said: “Trump’s not all that comfortable with good news. He is much happier on the attack with a clearly identified foe at the tip of his spear. That is his default mode. He defines himself against adversaries and gets strength from an oppositional stance. The core of his support are for him because he shares their antipathies. He’s the only leader in their lifetime who has given full, unabashed voice to those antipathies.”Asked how a Democrat can combat the upcoming tidal wave of hate and mendacity, Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington, said: “Mr Trump’s principal weakness is himself. The issue in 2020 is going to be at least as much his character and conduct as president as it will be about substantive differences.”Democrats’ central theme, he suggested, could be an echo of George W Bush’s pledge to “restore honor and dignity” after the scandals of the Clinton years.Tom Tancredo, a former Republican congressman from Colorado, predicted: “I believe he will win and he will win fairly handily. Part of the Democratic base can only be satisfied by the most radical brand. They’re all leftwing loonies but some are more loony than others. Biden is probably the least loony but, because of that, I think he’ll have almost no chance of making it.”The Orlando rally made clear that Trump will redouble his efforts to mobilise core support and make little effort to claim to govern for all Americans. All the signs point to 2020 being a repeat of 2016 but even more nasty, brutish and long, less “Keep America great” than “Hello darkness, my old friend”.Democrats are anxious to go high and find a candidate who, like Bill Clinton or Obama, whips up huge enthusiasm. The debates will offer a glimpse of alternative futures."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ea0bd1ee209cf6cbc3a4669c849b0b02b767a20/0_11_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb3f5c82086065fccbde3fd5d4433d97","title":"why are we like this the psychology of procrastination","story":"From deleting social media apps to setting limits on your screen time – here’s how to deal with the existential malaise of putting off the important thingsYou know that thing you’ve been putting off doing? Yes, that. What’s taking you so long?Perhaps you need to reply to an important-but-not-urgent work email, or pay an overdue utility bill. These tasks are straightforward enough, so why does alphabetising your books seem preferable instead?Procrastination is the pits. It leaves us feeling guilty and self-loathing. When contemplating, say, getting round to finally sorting out that life insurance quote that’s been on a Post-it note on the fridge for nine weeks, why does scrubbing the shower grouting with a toothbrush suddenly become more pressing?It cannot be that, as a species, we are inherently bone idle and appalling at managing our time, because the tasks we engage in rather than the ones we need to do often require focus and physical labour. In fact, laziness has very little to do with procrastination, which is, in simple terms, a form of self-punishment.Procrastination is not just about delaying. It is about engaging in something we know in our gut to be unhelpful – a painful level of self-awareness. We know that we’re avoiding what we need to do, which feels awful enough, but also that doing something else instead is not a great idea either. But we go ahead and do it anyway.The pattern is irrational. Yet when we start to consider how we feel, things become a little clearer. Procrastination is usually a habit rather than a one-off occurrence. It is unfair to label it as a character flaw (although it may be perceived as such by those close to us). Rather, it is an inability to manage uncomfortable feelings associated with a task.Particular jobs such as cleaning the toilet or unblocking the bath plughole are universally revolting because they involve matter we instinctively know could contaminate us. We’re wired to find them disgusting as a form of protection. However, deeper negative emotions – such as frustration, boredom, anxiety, resentment, confusion or insecurity – may be connected with other, less grimy tasks.If I am sitting in front of my computer trying to write a cover letter for a new job, I might start thinking: “I sound like a fool, they will surely think I sound terrible.” Replacing the task with something monotonous and engaging, such as vacuuming the stairs, is a way for me to cope with those difficult emotions.Research shows that procrastination can be explained as something we engage in as an urgent self-soothing technique, but the comfort is fleeting at best – once we start thinking about what we’re doing, more stress creeps in. There’s even a scientific name for this thought process: procrastinatory cognitions. In turn, this makes us procrastinate even more. We reward ourselves for procrastinating, while the negative emotions surrounding the task remain, as well as self-blame.Particular areas of our brain involved with self-perception interpret the tasks we’re procrastinating over as, essentially, not our problem – in the long-term, at least. As humans we aren’t wired to prioritise long-term needs. From an evolutionary perspective, we prioritise providing for ourselves in the present, because our ancestors never knew what was (or wasn’t) around the corner.So what can we do? Looking in the mirror and saying, “Stop procrastinating NOW” probably won’t work. Time management apps will only get you so far. Really, we need to think about the root cause of why we’re procrastinating. Identifying that it is about emotion rather than efficiency is a good start.Practically speaking, we can make our procrastination activities harder to do. If you habitually turn to social media, try deleting the apps from your phone and creating new, elaborate passwords. If you throw obstacles into the procrastination cycle, it takes longer to feel the reward and changes how your brain perceives the value of something – such as checking social media.Ultimately, loosening the grip of this existential habit comes down to self-compassion. Re-evaluate your tasks by creating a new “evidence base” for when you have done similar things well. Imagine the positive outcome. How will you feel in yourself? How will you – or others – benefit? Try writing that down. Presenting our inner dialogue to ourselves can be very powerful.Another potentially helpful technique is “defusion”. When the urge to procrastinate strikes, set an alarm for three minutes on your phone. Close your eyes. Bring your awareness to what is happening in your inner world – your thoughts about procrastinating (are they streams of words or images?) and the feelings in your body: where do you feel them? Are they familiar? Start noticing the way you’re interpreting what the thoughts and feelings around procrastination mean to you, and how that affects you in that moment. When the alarm goes, you may see your urge to escape your feelings for what it is.There is a robust evidence base to show that mindfulness exercises, if practised regularly, can improve our ability to accept and tolerate negative emotions without engaging in avoidance or actions that bring short-term relief. It might take a little time, but change is entirely possible. Your books can go unorganised for a while yet.For more information, visit avivalife"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4b930284cb475ff38e3f7db087e6683619fd10b/0_0_5665_3398/master/5665.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=faefe82924d073395a3516c66859ec39","title":"three netherlands euthanasia cases investigated","story":"Inquiries confirmed following controversy over death of anorexic teenagerThree euthanasia cases involving women with psychiatric conditions and dementia are under investigation in the Netherlands, the Observer can reveal.Prosecutors confirmed that the deaths, in 2017 and 2018, were being investigated for potentially breaching strict conditions in the 2002 law that allows people in the Netherlands to ask a doctor to help them die.The confirmation comes two weeks after news organisations around the world incorrectly reported that Noa Pothoven, a 17-year-old Dutch girl with anorexia, who had been sexually abused as a child, had died through euthanasia – with even the pope tweeting that the practice was “a defeat for us all”.Separately, in August, a Dutch doctor will be the first prosecuted for failings, in a 2016 case, in which sedatives were put in a dementia patient’s coffee and her family asked to hold her down when she struggled against the euthanasia injection.Dutch euthanasia law requires patients to be experiencing unbearable suffering, with no prospect of improvement, and to have a voluntary, sustained wish to die doctors must also seek a second independent opinion.The latest report by the Dutch Regional Euthanasia Committees – which examine legal compliance in every case – shows prosecutors are investigating a doctor for failing to treat the case of a woman with “due diligence” last year. According to the report, a woman in her 70s with depression had been operated on for abdominal problems when surgeons found evidence of lung cancer. She approached her doctor, saying she was experiencing unbearable psychological suffering and wanted euthanasia. Her doctor’s colleague took on the case, but, the review committee said, failed to obtain a second opinion from an independent psychiatrist, as is required.The two other cases, from 2017, involve a woman in her 60s with Alzheimer’s whom an independent consultant did not judge to be suffering badly enough, and another in her 80s with osteoarthritis and other problems who refused other treatment.The investigations have raised alarm, according to Dick Bosscher of the NVVE, the organisation that campaigned for the euthanasia law. “We think doctors are holding back more, although we can’t prove it,” he said. “Last year, for the first time in years, there were fewer euthanasia cases in the Netherlands. Whether things are clear for doctors is a difficult question, as unbearable suffering is different from one person to another.”The issue has ided doctors: last year, 450 put their names to a full-page advertisement saying they would not give a deadly injection to an incapacitated patient. One ethicist,Berna van Baarsen, resigned from a regional euthanasia committee in protest at the growing role of advance directives for people unable to express their wishes.“Euthanasia law is a constant matter of debate, and inidual cases involve complex consideration,” said Axel Dees, spokesman for the health ministry, which has just launched a campaign OnAbout Palliative Care to encourage people to plan for the end of their lives. He said the government is researching a 2016 euthanasia proposal for those ineligible under current euthanasia law, but who feel their lives are “complete” – something that one member of the governing coalition, the ChristenUnie, opposes.The debate on “complete lifers” is expected to be fierce, but pro-euthanasia campaigners say psychiatric reasons are as valid as physical ones – arguing that otherwise, people would commit suicide, as Pothoven effectively did by refusing food and drink.Elke Swart, a spokeswoman for the End of Life Clinic – which Pothoven said refused her request for euthanasia last year – said that its focus is preserving life. “Patients say: I don’t want to die, but I cannot live,” she said. “Less than a third of euthanasia requests are granted. Most don’t fulfil the legal criteria or people see during the process – which is very intensive and can take years – reasons to stay alive. This is of course the best result.”Swart added: “Euthanasia is the ultimate cry for mercy from someone in extreme need, and every request deserves careful consideration.”In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14. In the US, the suicide prevention lifeline is 1-800-273-8255.

If it was an Islamic state, I wouldn\u0027t have left.The main reasons I left the so-called Islamic State is because they started to kill people I know them personally that are Muslims.I had a group of about 20 friends that all left the so-called Islamic State. They all left at one time. One by one, they started to kill them.Jack Letts in Raqqa, SyriaLetts said that he was caught as he tried to escape the border into Turkey after expecting safe passage through Al Nusra-Front territory.He said: They would help us leave. They would get us a smuggler. Nusra Front not great guys, but they\u0027re a lot more trustworthy than the Free Syrian Army.Letts\u0027 commented on his mental heath, claiming that he was diagnosed with Tourette\u0027s and severe obsessive compulsive disorder.The convert left his middle-class home in Oxford to become one of IS\u0027 most notorious recruits before his eventual capture.Now, after languishing in prison for two years, Letts said that he regretted becoming the poster boy for Islamic extremism.He said: That\u0027s one of the things that I regret I realised that me coming had a lot more meaning than a Syrian becoming ISIS.Jack Letts in Kurdish jailSpeaking about his time in solitary confinement, he said: You wouldn\u0027t be able to sit with me like this. You\u0027d say I\u0027m insane.  Letts faces being barred from returning to the UK under rules that allow Sajid Javid, the Home Secretary, to strip him of his citizenship provided it would not make him stateless.   I\u0027ve repented from what I did, and it\u0027s not important in a sort of legal sense, but that\u0027s why I left. I realized what I did was wrong, religiously and also in a moral sense, he added.There\u0027s a feeling of stress and there\u0027s a feeling of regret. Regret without result. ... we\u0027re just being left like dogs. Boris Johnson supporter Liz Truss warns against \u0026#39complacency\u0026#39 as polls show Jeremy Hunt gaining on front-runnerUS \u0026#39conducted cyber attacks on Iran\u0026#39 in response to drone downingEthiopia foils coup attempt after military chief shot dead by bodyguard in his homeFCO minister arrives in Iran to try and ease tensions with US Boris Johnson v Jeremy Hunt: Tory leadership candidates\u0026#39 Brexit views, policies, team and key supporters comparedComment: If history proves freedom enriches, EU oligarchs could impoverish a continent NHS trust serves notice on Bounty as campaigners call for Government to step in over \u0026#39exploitative\u0026#39 practicesComment: Boris’ two great tasks are to get us out of the EU and cheer us all upStudent who changed name to \u0026#39Mx Name Surname\u0026#39 awarded MA by Royal College of ArtSpotlight on Carrie Symonds will intensify en route to Downing StreetTreasury ignores charity request for Battle of the Atlantic memorialRobots could replace judges to deal with parking fines, justice minister saysIstanbul voters turn out for mayoral election rerun as Erdogan bids to reverse defeat in Turkey\u0026#39s largest cityJudi Dench reveals she has adopted three orangutans as she campaigns to protect the Bornean rainforestKim Jong-un praises \u0026#39excellent\u0026#39 letter from Donald TrumpDonald Trump announces two-week delay on planned family deportation raidsMinistry of Defence appoints first female Chief Scientific AdviserMPs urge Boris Johnson to guarantee Brexit on October 31Dozens of army instructors have been \u0026#39accused of abusing recruits since 2015\u0026#39, new figures revealWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/racing/2019/06/19/TELEMMGLPICT000167122045_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqM37qcIWR9CtrqmiMdQVx7NGU-HGTZsZEkAoc-BSRwZ4.jpeg?imwidth=4","title":"rspca hardline faction behind move charity lobby ban angling","story":"The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA)The RSPCA is under the influence of a group of radical animal rights campaigners who are pushing the 195-year-old institution to lobby for angling and horse racing to be outlawed, The Sunday  can reveal.At recent policy committee meetings vice-chairman Jane Tredgett and her allies on the RSPCA’s ruling council have steered the charity, which is patronised by the Queen, towards hardline stances against two of Britain’s most popular pastimes.Insiders say staff and moderate RSPCA trustees have so far successfully opposed the proposals, which it is feared would jeopardise support and funding for the charity’s animal welfare work.However, there is mounting concern that a planned overhaul...To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA)The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

minister arrives iran try ease tensions us","story":"Tensions have risen significantly since Iran shot down a US droneA minister from the Foreign Office has arrived in Tehran and met with a top diplomat from Iran\u0027s foreign ministry amid escalating regional tensions, state-run IRIB news agency reported.Minister of State for the Middle East Andrew Murrison spoke with Kamal Kharazi, head of the Strategic Council of Foreign Relations at Iran\u0027s foreign ministry, on bilateral ties, regional issues and the 2015 nuclear deal, the agency said.Mr Murrison is expected to meet deputy foreign minister Abbas Araghchi later on Sunday.Mr Murrison is expected to call for an urgent de-escalation and raise British concerns about Iran\u0027s regional conduct and its threat to cease complying with the nuclear deal to which the UK remains fully committed, according to a statement by Britain\u0027s Foreign Office.Tensions between Washington and Tehran have flared after Iran on Thursday shot down a US drone.Iran said the drone violated its airspace - a claim the US denies - near the strategic Strait of Hormuz.In response, the US was ready to carry out a military strike against Iran but US President Donald Trump said he called it off at the last minute.The downing of the drone came after tensions spiked between the two countries following a series of attacks on commercial vessels that the US has blamed on Iran - accusations vehemently denied by the Islamic Republic.Britain is a signatory to the 2015 nuclear deal which saw Iran scale back its nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief, but the US unilaterally withdrew from the accord last year and reimposed sanctions.On May 8, Iran said it would reduce some of its nuclear commitments to the deal unless the remaining partners - Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia - helped it circumvent US sanctions and sell its oil.Boris Johnson supporter Liz Truss warns against

voters turn mayoral election rerun erdogan bids reverse","story":"Ekrem Imamoglu of the opposition CHP hopes to win again after being forced out just 18 days into his term as mayorVoters in Istanbul return to the polls for the second time in three months on Sunday after the ruling party forced a redo of the mayoral election, hoping to reverse a stinging defeat and recapture Turkey’s largest city.The constant campaigning has exhausted some voters, especially those who back the opposition and are unconvinced Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey’s formidable president, will concede should his party lose again.“I’m tired of endless elections, and I’m afraid we will keep having them until the governing party wins,” said Dilber, 33, a security guard who declined to give her surname. “It is difficult to defend my faith in the ballot box.”Nearly one out of 10 Istanbul voters said they were undecided or didn’t plan to show up, according to pollsters at Konda Research this week. Sunday’s election is the eighth vote in five years.Though his name isn’t on the ballot, Mr Erdogan has injected himself into the race to help his party’s trailing candidate, accusing the opposition’s Ekrem Imamoglu this week of treachery and suggesting he could block his path if he wins again.Mr Erdogan held the powerful job of Istanbul mayor himself before becoming prime minister in 2003 and president in 2014. He is Turkey’s most popular politician but his critics blame him for an erosion of democracy by jailing tens of thousands of his enemies, silencing a once-garrulous press and exerting control over the judiciary and other institutions.As for Mr Imamoglu, 49, few were familiar with the former mayor of an outlying suburb for the secular Republican People’s Party (CHP) before his upset victory on March 31. He beat the conservative Justice and Development Party’s (AKP) Binali Yildirim, 63, by fewer than 14,000 votes in a city with 10 million voters.The loss of Istanbul would be a major blow for Mr Erdogan at a time when he faces a number of challenges to his ruleThis time, most opinion polls show Mr Imamoglu ahead by about two percentage points, and he credits the rise to a sense of grievance over his ouster after just 18 days in office, when electoral officials decided that irregular appointment of some polling station officials may have skewed the result.Mr Imamoglu has energised the CHP, banished from power since the 1970s, and attracted non-traditional voters hurt by an economic downturn. He has also appealed to many with a promise to bridge the country’s ides after the tumult of recent years, including renewed violence with Kurdish militants, a failed military coup against Mr Erdogan in 2016 and the crackdown that is still ongoing - 151 people including senior military officers were given life sentences over the uprising this week. The main Kurdish party is campaigning for Mr Imamoglu, and its former chairman, Selahattin Demirtas, this week urged his estimated 1 million supporters to back the CHP candidate in a tweet from his prison cell, where he has been held since 2016 on terror charges stemming from his political speeches.Pro-government media then released a statement from another jailed Kurdish leader, Abdullah Ocalan, in which he purportedly said his party should remain neutral. Mr Ocalan, whom many Kurds regard as a hero but most Turks brand a terrorist, is 20 years into a life sentence for leading an armed insurgency against the state.Mr Erdogan’s intervention in the race comes at a time when he must steady the economy and confront foreign policy challenges, including a looming showdown with the United States over the purchase of Russian arms that Washington says will jeopardise NATO security.But his focus on a municipal election instead reveals how critical Istanbul, accounting for a third of Turkey’s economy, is to his political movement, which has controlled the city - and its lucrative contracts - for a quarter century.Mr Imamoglu has appealed to non-traditional voters with his promises to tackle corruption and heal isions after years of tumultDuring his brief stint at city hall, Mr Imamoglu said he discovered the AKP-run municipality had squandered public money on cars, consultants and charities run by members of Mr Erdogan’s inner circle, striking a nerve among voters grappling with 20 percent inflation and unemployment of 14 percent.For his part, Mr Erdogan points to a tripling in the size of the Turkish economy - despite the current recession - that has improved millions of lives under his rule. In recent days, he has said Mr Imamoglu sided with an outlawed Muslim sect blamed for the abortive coup and may face prosecution for allegedly insulting a provincial official. “I won’t cede Istanbul to liars like this,” Mr Erdogan said.Though Mr Erdogan remains firmly in control of the central government and doesn’t face re-election until 2023, losing Turkey’s commercial and cultural centre would dim the president’s aura of invincibility.But observers said that blocking Mr Imamoglu, should he now win by a wide margin, would undermine the AKP’s own electoral mandate.And it may not crush the challenge that Mr Imamoglu has come to represent, his supporters said.“If they cancel this election, Imamoglu will only come back stronger,” said Mehmetcan Cicek, a 21-year-old street vendor. “The spark has been lit, and even Erdogan can’t extinguish it.”Boris Johnson supporter Liz Truss warns against \u0026#39complacency\u0026#39 as polls show Jeremy Hunt gaining on front-runnerUS \u0026#39conducted cyber attacks on Iran\u0026#39 in response to drone downingEthiopia foils coup attempt after military chief shot dead by bodyguard in his homeFCO minister arrives in Iran to try and ease tensions with US Boris Johnson v Jeremy Hunt: Tory leadership candidates\u0026#39 Brexit views, policies, team and key supporters comparedComment: If history proves freedom enriches, EU oligarchs could impoverish a continent NHS trust serves notice on Bounty as campaigners call for Government to step in over \u0026#39exploitative\u0026#39 practicesComment: Boris’ two great tasks are to get us out of the EU and cheer us all upStudent who changed name to \u0026#39Mx Name Surname\u0026#39 awarded MA by Royal College of ArtSpotlight on Carrie Symonds will intensify en route to Downing StreetTreasury ignores charity request for Battle of the Atlantic memorialRobots could replace judges to deal with parking fines, justice minister saysJudi Dench reveals she has adopted three orangutans as she campaigns to protect the Bornean rainforestKim Jong-un praises \u0026#39excellent\u0026#39 letter from Donald TrumpDonald Trump announces two-week delay on planned family deportation raidsMinistry of Defence appoints first female Chief Scientific AdviserMPs urge Boris Johnson to guarantee Brexit on October 31Dozens of army instructors have been \u0026#39accused of abusing recruits since 2015\u0026#39, new figures revealBoris Johnson row: The couple next door passionate about their opposition to ToriesWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 23 june 2019","story":"Attendees are silhouetted during the opening ceremony of the Africa Cup of Nations in Cairo International Stadium, EgyptBoris Johnson supporter Liz Truss warns against \u0026#39complacency\u0026#39 as polls show Jeremy Hunt gaining on front-runnerUS \u0026#39conducted cyber attacks on Iran\u0026#39 in response to drone downingEthiopia foils coup attempt after military chief shot dead by bodyguard in his homeFCO minister arrives in Iran to try and ease tensions with US Boris Johnson v Jeremy Hunt: Tory leadership candidates\u0026#39 Brexit views, policies, team and key supporters comparedComment: If history proves freedom enriches, EU oligarchs could impoverish a continent NHS trust serves notice on Bounty as campaigners call for Government to step in over \u0026#39exploitative\u0026#39 practicesComment: Boris’ two great tasks are to get us out of the EU and cheer us all upStudent who changed name to \u0026#39Mx Name Surname\u0026#39 awarded MA by Royal College of ArtSpotlight on Carrie Symonds will intensify en route to Downing StreetTreasury ignores charity request for Battle of the Atlantic memorialRobots could replace judges to deal with parking fines, justice minister saysIstanbul voters turn out for mayoral election rerun as Erdogan bids to reverse defeat in Turkey\u0026#39s largest cityJudi Dench reveals she has adopted three orangutans as she campaigns to protect the Bornean rainforestKim Jong-un praises \u0026#39excellent\u0026#39 letter from Donald TrumpDonald Trump announces two-week delay on planned family deportation raidsMinistry of Defence appoints first female Chief Scientific AdviserMPs urge Boris Johnson to guarantee Brexit on October 31Dozens of army instructors have been \u0026#39accused of abusing recruits since 2015\u0026#39, new figures revealBoris Johnson row: The couple next door passionate about their opposition to ToriesWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"labour shadow brexit secretary keir starmer pockets 125000 from law firm derailing britains eu exit","story":"Former Director of Public Prosecutions Starmer - who was also involved with a failed witchhunt of Sun journalists – has revealed he was paid up to £ an hour by Mishcon de Reya.Mishcon was one of three law firms that brought the legal challenge to Theresa May’s Brexit plans in the High Court this week.Starmer, , was elected as a Labour MP for Holborn and St Pancras in May last year – a role which pays £,.Between June and the end of September this year he was paid £, by Mishcon de Reya for  hours of “legal advice” - a rate of £ per hour.Late last year he earned £, offering legal advice to the law firm for  hours – or £ an hour.He also revealed a payment of £, on May , , for work carried out before he became an MP.He lives in a £million house in North London with solicitor we Victoria, , and their two young children. He also co-owns a house in Surrey.Mishcon de Reya first hired him in  as a part-time consultant for its business crime unit.He quit client work for the firm in April , but was reappointed as a consultant to its in-house academy in June this year.The MP stood down from that role after being appointed to the shadow cabinet last month.Starmer is the third key figure from the lacklustre £.m Operation Elveden witchhunt of Sun reporters to be employed by Mishcon de Reya.His former principal legal adviser at the Crown Prosecution Service Alison Levitt and former politan police assistant commissioner Sue Akers – who headed the bungled investigation – have also done work for the firm.This week Starmer refused to apologise after reporter Anthony France had his conviction overturned - meaning not one of  Sun journalists arrested were convicted.A spokeswoman for the law firm said: “Keir Starmer was a consultant to the Mishcon Academy, our in-house centre for learning and development.“The role did not involve client advice on any issue. Keir resigned as a consultant to the academy when he was appointed to the Shadow Cabinet.”A spokesman for Starmer’s office said: “MPs are required to register and declare fees received since the May  election even where those fees were earned before the election.“The register makes it very clear that in the case of Keir Starmer, the vast majority of his declared earnings represent payment for work undertaken by him as a lawyer before he became MP.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And to honour the result of the EU referendum.If you give people a choice you have a duty to implement what they decide. I have done my best to do that.Sadly I have not been able to do so. I tried three times - I believe it was right to persevere even when the odds against success seemed high.May survived a vote of no confidence in December , but repeated thwarted attempts to pass her Brexit deal left her without authority.May will remain as Prime Minister until a new party leader is announced in the week beginning July ."},{"url":null,"title":"tory leadership race candidate brexit views","story":"Below, we take a look at whos still in the running - andfavourite Boris Johnson could get the keys to Number .The former Foreign Secretary quit his role because he disagreed with Theresa Mays plan for Brexit and is currently the bookies favourite to win the leadership contest.Boris Johnson was at the helm of the Vote Leave campaign back in  and nearly beat the current PM to the role after Cameron resigned.Since the referendum the -year-old has been brandishing his leave credentials. In a speech in Switzerland he vowed to take Britain out of the EU with a deal or no deal come October he gets chosen.Johnson said he would hold the EU to ransom and refuse to pay the £billion orce bill unless they agree to more favourable terms for Brexit.He also vowed to slash income tax for three million Brits.He said: Our friends and partners need to understand that the money is going to be retained until such time as we have greater clarity about the way forward.I always thought it was extraordinary that we should agree to write that entire cheque before having a final deal. In getting a good deal, money is a great solvent and a great lubricant.Johnson comfortably topped the poll from the first round of voting, securing  votes from his colleagues.This is well above the  needed to guarantee his place in the final two, making him a firm favourite as it stands.But supporters were reminded that only once in the history of the Conservative party has the favourite ever been elected.The Foreign Secretary who campaigned for Remain in the  referendum is the second favourite for leader.Jeremy Hunt claims his business background would help him negotiate a good deal with Brussels as doing deals is my bread and butter as someone who has set up their own business.The -year-old said he would back a No Deal Brexit with a heavy heartit was the only option left.Hunt has said he wants to slash corporation tax to boost businesses.On June  he claimed Germany’s Angela Merkel COULD renegotiate Brexit with a new Tory PM.He has the backing of Amber Rudd.While in second place after the first round vote, Hunt is trailing far behind Johnson with only just over a third of his share.But Amber Rudd, who is backing Hunt, said he came a good second and was delighted with the result.The Environment Secretary announced his bid to be the next Prime Minister on June .Michael Gove has said he is willing to delay Brexit for as long as needed to ensure a deal is agreed rather than just crashing out on October .He is posing as a unying candidate and said: I believe that Im ready to unite the Conservative and Unionist Party, ready to deliver Brexit, and ready to lead this great country.Gove notably defended Theresa Mays Brexit deal in the House of Commons.However, his chances may have been dented by his cocaine admission.After the first round, Gove came a close third after Hunt and Johnson with  votes.The Home Secretary announced his candidacy in a video on Twitter and was one of the Remain campaigners in .Sajid Javid, , has said his party must get on and deliver Brexit but has positioned himself as a firm Remainer.But speaking to Sophy Ridge on Sunday he said: The policy of any government I lead will be to leave on  October. We will do everything in our power to leave on  October.I will do everything I can to get a deal, butI have to choose between no deal and no Brexit, I will choose no deal.If elected the Bromsgrove MP would be the UKs first Prime Minister from an ethnic minority.He has pledged to end austerity and pump billions into education.Scottish Conservatives leader Ruth Davidson has given him her support.It is thought defeated Andrea Leadsom could back Sajid Javid after he secured  votes in the first round.In a moving message the Home Secretary insisted he was ideally placed to lead a Conservative Government that would aim to bring people from all sides together.He said: “We talked a moment ago about whether someone is Remain or Leave, whether someone is black or white, North or South, urban or rural, and whatever happens this is the number one thing, we have to address in our countrywe are staying together as a cohesive society.“I think it is incumbent upon all politicians, especially when we see around the world, in the US, Italy and others, there are politicians that want to feed off anger and feed off ision, that we as Conservatives always look at the best in people and try to bring them together.”He said he had lived with prejudice for most of his le – but believed Britain was the “most successful multi-racial democracy in the world”.The new International Development Secretary launched his leadership bid in The Spectator and has since told of his one-time opium use.The Penrith MP has been scathing about a No Deal Brexit and claimed it would be a huge mistake, damaging, unnecessary, and I think also dishonest.Rory Stewart has outlined his intention to fulfil Brexit and use a citizens assembly and a grand jury to help parliament to hammer out a deal with the EU that works for the country.Stewart believes a No Deal Brexit would cause huge financial implications for Brexit and is focused on a practical deal.He said he would lock up MPs over the summer to get the deal done.Hes also said hell build two million new homes.Apparently undeterred by winning only  votes in the first round, Stewarts insists hes the only one who can stop Boris Johnson in the PM race.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He’s just done so again.People who want a second vote on Brexit should go and live in North Korea, he said. Meaning that they had no time for democracy.Gallagher — like almost every bloody pop musician — backed Remain in the ­referendum. But he said: “There’s only one f***ing thing worse than a fool who voted for Brexit. That’s the rise of the c***s trying to get the vote overturned.”His message, then, to the relentlessly moaning Remainers who have tried every trick in the book to get that democratic decision overturned is: Don’t look back in anger — get on with your lives and let Brexit happen.As we decided it must.And here’s the thing. I suspect most Remainers think exactly the same. The people I know who voted Remain were saddened by the referendum result and they wished we’d all voted dferently.But they all believe that the vote must be upheld. And there should not be a second vote.And when I talk to them, they don’t call me a Nazi or a fascist for voting Leave.They don’t suggest I’m too thick to be allowed to vote or that I hate all foreigners.They just agree to dfer on that simple issue of in or out, and there’s no bad ­feeling at all.This is the thing. The politicians and commentators insist Brexit has ­brutally ided the nation. That the wounds will take a long time to heal. That we’re all at each other’s throats. The .million versus the .million.It’s not so at all. The only real ide is between the four or five million Remain voters who simply won’t have it — and the rest of the country.A lot has been written about the people who voted Leave — most of it codswallop.“It was just the poor and the left-behind, the uneducated and the ­xenophobes.”The statistics simply don’t bear that out.People of all walks of le, all levels of education, all ages and all ­backgrounds voted Leave.This is not, however, true of that hardcore of Remainers, between a quarter and a third of that million, who demand we run the vote again.They are insulated from the normal world. When they say they don’t know anyone who voted Leave, they’re telling the truth.They work in professions where ­virtually nobody voted Leave.In our ­universities , in schools , and among luvviesand scientists .And the BBC — I don’t have figures for the BBC but I would guess it’s close to  per cent for Remain.This is the real ide. Between a ­liberal middle-class elite who simply do not understand the hopes and aspirations of the rest of us. And react with absolute fury when they don’t get their own way.When Brexit is over, one way or another, that liberal elite will still be with us, utterly out of touch with the rest of the country.That’s the ide that matters today. A small minority determined to inflict their liberal policies upon the rest of us.THE BBC shoved an imam from Gloucester on to its Tory leadership debate programme and has now had to apologise.Abdullah Patel asked questions of the candidates about anti-Muslim bigotry in their party. Turns out he’s been accused of plenty of bigotry himself.A whole bunch of social media posts from Patel attacking Israel and praising Corbyn were uncovered. There were “Zionists” hiding behind the Holocaust, a suggestion that Israel should be transported to the centre of the US and so on. The usual stuff.None of it surprised me – and he’s not alone in pushing this view. Is it any wonder anti-semitism is now so entrenched in the Labour Party, and in our country Bob lived in Zimbabwe. Bob was standing in the middle of a road at night when a car hit him.The car cartwheeled, killing both of the people in it. They were rhino-horn smugglers – scumbags who kill rhinos so the valuable horns can be sold in powder form to sad Chinese men who can’t get a stfy.Anyway, Bob’s now dead. But his le was not given in vain.Thank you, Bob.THE latest social media trend is the bubble-tea selfie. Japanese girls take photos of themselves with a carton of the sugary drink nestled between their baps.Nope, I don’t know why.The craze is spreading west, too.People have been seen doing it in Thailand and Vietnam.Will it reach here Well, it’s got to navigate its way through Pakistan, Iran and Saudi Arabia – so I wouldn’t bet on it.THE Breakthrough Listen Project was a massive scheme using millions of computers.It was dedicated to finding intelligent extra-terrestrial le. It has found . . . nothing. Just light year after light year of utter silence.I think it’s time we accustomed ourselves to the fact there’s nothing out there and we’re all alone. The rest of the universe is cold, silent and devoid of intelligent le. Just like Canada.IT’S a shame to see Rory Stewart crashing out of the Conservative leadership race.Not because I agree with him about anything – I don’t. I’d just thought it was high time we had a PM whose real Christian name is Roderick.If people called Roderick ran the country we wouldn’t be in the mess we are now.Sure, Mr Stewart doesn’t use “Roderick”.He’s shortened it to “Rory” in order to sound more dashing and maybe a bit Celtic. Big mistake.Be proud of your given Christian name, Roderick Stewart. It means great ruler. Rory, I think, just means drunk Glaswegian eating a pie.THE bigger and richer charities get, the less likely they are to do the job they were set up to do. The RSPB is a case in point.It’s very rich indeed, with mugs like me paying for its upkeep each month.Incredibly, this organisation has flogged part of a crucial nature reserve near Middlesbrough – so a huge power station can be built on it. What possible right do they have to do that The RSPB says the Saltholme reserve is not one of high ecological signicance. But it was home to some of the UK’s most endangered birds. Not for much longer. At least the RSPB made a fast buck.HAVE you seen Joe Hart’s new tattoo  Christ help us all.It looks like half his torso has been draped in a torn bin liner.Joe doesn’t care what other people think of it – fair enough.But remembering his performances in goal for England, I wondera dferent sort of tattoo might have been more helpful. On one wrist the words: “Stand in the centre of the goal when facing a free kick, you idiot.” And on the other: “Have a go at catching the ball from time to time.”THE oldest woman in Europe has died at the age of .Italian Giuseppina Robucci credited her long, long le to avoiding alcohol.A week ago, however, the oldest woman in the UK died. Grace Jones was  when she popped her clogs, and put her longevity down to regular glasses of whisky.Hmmm.

It will be a shiny new global currency for the st Century, taking on the dollar and the Pound.But I’m not fooled. I think we all know what Facebook is really up to.This is yet another way to harvest data about our financial habits which it can then use for targeted marketing. Critics are already calling it the “most invasive and dangerous form of surveillance ever designed”.Collecting and exploiting information about us is, after all, the whole reason for the company’s existence.Years ago it was basic stuff, like quizzes asking, “What kind of personality type are you ”Fill that in and you are practically begging to be ­targeted in marketing and ­political campaigns. But handing over our spending details is quite another matter.This may be spun as ­connecting the world and ­revolutionising payments but it is really all about tapping the modern-day version of oil — the wells of data.Facebook already knows who you are. Accept Libra and it will know what you are buying, who you’re paying and how much you have.Will it be regulated by the UK Financial Conduct Authority, as banks are in this country  Certainly, the company has not shown much desire for regulation so far — of which more later.But what do we know about how trustworthy, secure or morally sound this would-be money broker is The Cambridge Analytica scandal, where data from million users was shared with political consultants, led to a fine of £, by ­Britain’s Information ­Commissioner’s Office.Last September the company admitted that data from million of its users had leaked due to a security flaw.In  it failed to stop the live broadcast of the torture of a disabled man in Chicago. It has also refused to take down neo-Nazi content.Facebook is under criminal investigation by US prosecutors who are looking into data-sharing deals with, among other, Amazon and Apple. It has been caught out farming data from apps whose users might have been unaware they were feeding information to Facebook.The company was found to be harvesting the dates of female users’ periods via an app which tracked ovulation.Facebook has also been accused of doing little to protect ­vulnerable children from ­promotions of self-harm. British father Ian Russell has directly linked Facebook-owned Instagram to the suicide of his -year-old daughter, Molly.Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg refused to attend the UK ­Parliament’s committee on ­disinformation and “fake news” last year, amid concern the social media giant is ­positioning itself as a news publisher but without ­compliance with any of the regulation or laws governing traditional journalism.The  has been blamed for spreading hatred. In March this year an ­Australian white supremacist live-streamed on Facebook his massacre of  people at two New Zealand mosques.It has further been accused of putting IS terrorists in touch with each other via its “suggested friends” application.When challenged as to why it does not do more to tackle ­terrorism, it falls back on the explanation that it does not have the technology to watch what its .billion users are doing all the time.Yet somehow that does not seem to stop it farming commercially valuable data from our accounts.The same will no doubt turn out to be true about Libra. This week French finance ­minister Bruno Le Maire warned that the cryptocurrency would inevitably be used by terrorists and criminals to sht money around undetected.When it happens, Facebook will no doubt shrug its corporate shoulders once more and say it is powerless to stop it.In theory, the very complex nature of cryptocurrencies means that it should be near impossible for anyone to steal our money.But we have all heard the horror stories. The best-known cryptocurrency, ­Bitcoin, ­at first soared in value, ­making millions for people who latched on to it early. But  months ago it crashed.Of course, most of us like to shop on the internet — and e-commerce is only likely to grow in the coming years.But most of us do it with our bank cards or direct from accounts which hold our money in a ­currency which is backed by the central bank of a First World country.This means we can be ­reasonably sure the currency won’t ­suddenly disappear or become valueless. It is quite another matter doing business in a currency that is backed by internet firms.How can we be sure that Facebook will still be around in a few years’ time Of course, banks sometimes go bust, but at least we have some protection in the form of the Government’s financial services compensation scheme which will refund up to £, of savings in the event of a failure.Facebook claims Libra will be backed by an independent foundation in Switzerland and will be free from the kind of speculation that drove the value of Bitcoin, because its value will be linked to a basket of currencies.But I’m sorry, I’m just not buying it. I’m sticking with sterling when I do my online shopping.It might not be very exciting but I feel confident it will still be around well when Libra, and Facebook, have long ago ­disappeared. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They feel Hunt is the ideal opponent.He voted Remain in , he has been in Cabinet throughout Theresa May’s premiership with its Brexit failures and he is a mild-mannered figure who struggles to impose himself on debates.One Boris backer jokes that they have never seen, “a more lop-sided two-horse race”.The Hunt campaign bristle at the idea that this is going to be a walkover.They believe he has a route to victory by playing on Tory members’ concerns about whether Boris can actually do the job of being PM.They also think they will do well with the large Scottish membership — Scots are twice as likely to be members of the Tory party than the English — and are planning an early campaign trip there.They expect to pick up the endorsement of Ruth Davidson, the popular leader of the Scottish Conservatives.But for all Jeremy Hunt’s efforts to make this a contest, it is still Boris Johnson’s to lose. Of course, he could. He could make a spectacular gaffe or some scandal could blow up.Last night’s revelations of the screaming match at the flat he shares with his new partner shows the scrutiny that his le is going to come under.If he can get through the next fortnight without any major blunders, he’ll become Tory leader.Why  Because the postal votes go out from July  and most Tory members willthem within two days.As one Tory veteran explains: “A week after the ballots have gone out, it is too late to change anything.”I understand Boris will use the next weeks to set out his Brexit position in more detail.Those hoping to see him in full entertainer mode at these hustings will be disappointed. Instead, he intends to stick to the serious persona of the past few weeks.One of those preparing him for the month tells me that Tory members “know he can do Boris. They need to see him do Prime Minister.”This new, more serious approach won’t stop the attacks.Boris’s critics have lost their judgement and want to attack him as a homophobe, despite the fact he was one of the first politicians to back gay marriage. Just as absurdly, they want to smear him as a racist.Oddly, these attacks actually create a problem for Jeremy Hunt.The more ridiculous the criticism Boris faces, the more Tory activists will rally to him. This will make it harder for Hunt to get a hearing for his far more measured criticisms of Boris.All of these hustings will be broadcast on the internet. I understand the Boris campaign were not best pleased about this, which suggests they still have some concerns about their candidate slipping up.But even in this age of political upsets, it is hard to believe that Boris Johnson won’t be the winner of this contest.EDDIE Lister is to run the transition team that will prepare Boris Johnson’s governing programme.Lister, chief of staff for Boris when he was Mayor of London, will take charge of this process and the working assumption is that having done this, he will move to No as chief of staffBoris becomes PM.Crucially, Boris knows and trusts Lister. In his successful stint at City Hall, Lister showed that he knew how to bring order to Boris world – which is no mean feat.One of those close to the decision tells me: “Boris has made the biggest shout, who is your number one man  It is Eddie.” The need for order is urgent.If Boris enters Downing Street, he’ll only have  days until October , the day by which he has promised Britain will be out of the EU. He won’t have any time to lose.Intriguingly, I understand that Sajid Javid – who was knocked out of the leadership race on Thursday – was interested in doing this role.But the Johnson camp wanted whoever ran the transition to become the Downing Street chief of staff. A key challenge for Lister will be to make sure there is a clear structure.Boris has always liked having multiple sources of advice.As one of those who has known him for years observes: “There are going to be lots of dferent courts, lots of people competing for the monarch’s ear – and he quite likes that.”But this source warns that, “as a recipe for government, it could be quite fractious”.It is Lister’s job to make sure there is a clear chain of command.I understand that the spoilt ballot papers weren’t covered in graffiti, but simply left blank.“THE problem is the ,” says one of those preparing Boris for government.The  is a reference to those Tory MPs who voted for Rory Stewart before his elimination from the leadership contest.If only a fraction of this group decides to try to bind Boris Johnson’s hands on Brexit, then the Government could collapse.One of Boris’s closest allies warns that, “It is going to be really problematic, there is going to be a Remainer counterweight to the ERG”, the group of hardline Brexiteer MPs.To the alarm of Boris’ allies, Rory Stewart is uninterested in serving in a Boris Cabinet. Instead, he is setting himself up as an alternative voice on the backbenches.Stewart and his supporters have to remember, though, that a Corbyn government would be worse for this country than any Brexit outcome.The problem for Boris Johnson is that his Brexit strategy relies on MPs giving him time to seehe can use the threat of No Deal to winkle a concession out of the EU.The only chance of these  MPs giving him this time isthey think it is a bluff.“They have to believe it is a bluff, the ERG have to believe it is for real,” con- cedes one Boris ally.Pulling this off is going to be a political high-wire act.BORIS Johnson and Michael Gove have spoken since Gove’s elimination.I’m told the conversation wasn’t substantive but wasn’t rancorous, despite the tactical voting by Johnson supporters that led to Gove being knocked out.In the next few weeks Gove will get on with departmental business. He’ll introduce “Natasha’s law” for clearer labelling of allergens in products, named after Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, who died after eating a Pret sandwich, and increased sentences for those who abuse animals.I am told that it is “not settled one way or the other” whether Prime Minister Boris would keep Gove at the Environment department or offer him a bigger job. But given the scale of the challenges facing theTories, it would be foolish to not put their most talented departmental minister in one of the great offices of state.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She said everyone knows such photos can be hi- jacked and used to threaten and embarrass.I am sure that Whoopi meant well but it all backfired when an emotional Bella posted a video saying how upset she was at being “shamed” by the presenter and actress, — calling her actions “sick and disgusting”.I find it utterly baffling that Bella was more distressed by the words of a middle-aged woman who had her best interests at heart than the saddo who tried to embarrass her by releasing nude photos on to the internet for all the world to see.It’s a great shame this has now escalated into a row between the two women, because I truly admire Bella for how she has handled the whole potential blackmailing situation.It was a masterstroke and instantly took all the power away from the snivelling little git who was hassling her. Bella was not ashamed or embarrassed by the intimate pictures and would not be held to ransom. Good for her.But surely it was far more upsetting to be the victim of a potential crime than receiving a slight scolding from Whoopi for being naive enough to take and keep those sorts of images in the first place.Bella had a right old rant on Instagram and has vowed never again to appear on The View — a chat show co-hosted by Whoopi which is the US version of our Loose Women.I feel very sorry for Bella because she was clearly extremely upset by what Whoopi had to say but I think her anger is misplaced.Whoopi was makIng a really important point, which affects everyone, not only those in the public eye.She was speaking for worried parents of teenagers and twentysomethings everywhere who are concerned that online photos of their children getting drunk, posing nude or even having sex will come back to haunt them.It is one of the real dangers of social media that our accounts are not really secure. they can be hacked with relative ease, falling out of “the cloud” and on to your boss’s Facebook — or, even worse, getting viewed by your mum and dad.There are people who think it is a jolly wheeze to post explicit photographs of former lovers online, or who do it as “revenge” for being dumped.Of course, there are those who have no common sense and post pictures of themselves romping in hotel rooms with girlfriends or boyfriends or boozily feeling each other up on holiday.The authorities are now cracking down. Last August, a man who hacked into hundreds of iCloud accounts of Hollywood actresses and leaked their nude pictures was sentenced to eight months in prison.George Garofano stole private photographs from movie stars including actresses Jenner Lawrence and Kirsten Dunst. It was horribly distressing for these women and I completely sympathise.However, the ease with which that slimy toad was able to access personal images proves thatyou don’t want to have potentially embarrassing photos put out there, then don’t take them in the first place — or just press the delete button.Maybe even go back to the Dark Ages, invest in a Polaroid camera and keep your naughty pictures under lock and key. The hackers are vile, but let us not give them the ammunition. And take heed of the advice from wise women such as Whoopi.I SINCERELY hope the latest rumours from the troubled set of the new Bond film prove to be without foundation.It’s being claimed that the film’s director, Cary Fukunaga, held up cast and crew during a complicated shoot because he was playing video games on his PlayStation.Apparently the production crew and actors were not amused at having to hang about for three hours because Cary wanted to play with his toys. I don’t blame them.I cannot believe someone would be so inconsiderate to fellow professionals.I was, however, more aghast at finding out Cary isn’t a spotty teenage geek, but a -year-old man.Surely he should have outgrown PlayStation by now – especially when he is already in charge of the world’s best video game, involving Aston Martin car chases, shootouts, beautul women and dastardly villains.WILLIAM and Kate showed how royals should react when their lestyle causes harm to a member of the public.Widow Irene Mayor, , was hit by a police motorbike escorting the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to Windsor Castle. She is in hospital with serious injuries.As soon as Wills and Kate found out, they sent flowers and a hand-written note and have told Irene’s family they want to visit her whenever she is ready.I HAVE never watched Love Island. So it’s odd to see images and videos of strange, orange people with impossibly white teeth, like Molly-Mae Hague on my online news feeds and splashed across magazines when I haven’t a blinking clue who they are.And it is utterly bizarre that they all look and sound exactly alike.To be honest,I really need to see fit youngsters strutting around, uttering meaningless sounds and having sex, I will tune into a David Attenborough documentary.THE Fab Five presenters on makeover show Queer Eye are making the world a better place – one scruffy, messed-up person at a time.Makeovers are hardly a new concept but this series does much more than give someone a new outfit and haircut.The hosts lovebomb shy misfits who ask for help, as well as big-hearted people who just neglect themselves – then change their lives for ever.It’s a show full of heart and soul and I blub during every episode.This week I met the British star of Queer Eye, delightful Tan France, from Doncaster. He had a hard time growing up in a world where he had no role models and he feels a huge responsibility to young gay Asian men such as himself.Tan and the Queer Eye boys feature in the video for Taylor Swt’s new single, You Need To Calm Down, with some of my favourite people including RuPaul and Ryan Reynolds.The song hits you over the head a bit with its inclusivity – no bad thing – but the Queer Eye boys do it better just by being themselves.I HAD to look twice at this gorgeous selfie posted by This Morning’s Alison Hammond.She’s glowing with confidence and happiness.After becoming the spokeswoman for a slimming club Alison has lost so much weight and looks stunning.She has talked about being “embarrassed” by weighing st. But I’m so glad she lost weight gradually with a healthy eating plan and doing exercise she loves.I wish Alison all the best with her battle towards being happier, healthier and fitter and I know she will have helped other women with their weight issues too.I BLOODY love Matt Lucas. The Little Britain star saw on Twitter that Amy Dunn was being bullied because she had lost her hair and was being derided as a “Matt Lucas lookalike”.The comedian immediately sent the -year-old a message of support telling her she was beautul and how flattered he was to be compared to her.Amy, who suffers from alopecia, has had people laughing and pointing at her in the street because she happens to have a condition that means she is bald.I hope having Matt on her side has cheered Amy up and given her the confidence to ignore the morons who hurled abuse, and maybe even feel sorry for them for being such ar**holes.Matt is right. Amy is beautul, and so is he.I’M very much liking the look of Beecham House, the new ITV drama set in th Century India that airs tomorrow night.The trails look sumptuous and now Poldark’s Aidan Turner has gone all grungy, leading man Tom Bateman is a most welcome piece of eye candy.Beecham House is on ITV tomorrow at pm.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I have got other things to do. I have a family to bring up.Defending, Stuart Sprawson said she lived in a rough area and the post informing her of the June date may not have been delivered.He said: I have emphasised jury service is fundamental public duty.

Boris will only be our th Prime Minister since the very first, Robert Walpole, who was in office from  to .The fact that more than a third of them went to Eton , suggests that social mobility in this country is in terminal decline.Indeed, when it comes to the children of ordinary homes reaching the highest office in the land, social mobility is stone-cold dead.Fee-paying privilege provides the fast-track to power. Yet it wasn’t always this way.There was a golden age of ­meritocracy in the last century when it was normal for our PMs to be educated by the state.Eton was still a bastion of academic excellence in those happy years. So was Harrow, which has produced seven Prime Ministers, and Westminster, which educated six.But between  and , there was enough healthy social mobility in this country for Harold Wilson, Ted Heath, Jim Callaghan, Margaret Thatcher and John Major — all educated at state schools — to become Prime Minister.Major and Callaghan didn’t even go to university. Callaghan couldn’t afford it, while Major left school at  with three O-levels.All five came from modest ­backgrounds, although Wilson, Heath and Thatcher were clever enough to get into Oxford University.For more than three decades, state-educated politicians competed with those who were the product of expensive private educations — and beat them to the top job.This is not an argument against Boris Johnson becoming Prime ­Minister simply because he went to Eton. Boris seems like the man most likely to prevent a Marxist government. This would destroy our economy — a fate far worse than either staying in or leaving the European Union.SoI was a Tory MP or party member, then I would probably prefer Boris to take on Brussels, Corbyn and the Brexit Party.But yet another old Etonian in  Downing Street proves that social mobility is nowhere near what it was in the last century. Andwe care about a fair and equal society, then that should concern us all.It feels signicant that the first candidate to be eliminated from the Tory leadership race was Esther McVey — the candidate from  the least privileged background, reinforcing the belief that Westminster is a closed shop.But when it comes to getting on in le, and even getting to Downing Street, it should not matter a damn where you were born.Your ability — and your willingness to graft — should matter far more than Mummy and Daddy’s bank ­balance.Le can never be totally fair. But two Old Etonian PMs in less than ten years is grotesque.  If there is to be a bright, shining future for this country after we leave the EU, there MUST be more social mobility.Once he has sorted out Brexit  and buried Corbyn, perhaps our Old ­Etonian PM will do something about it. Because inequality is still entrenched at birth.And that stinks.WHAT is mankind’s greatest invention  The Internet  The printing press  The steam engine  Penicillin If, like me, you are allergic to penicillin, then the gold shorts that Kylie Minogue wore in her Spinning Around promo probably have the edge on all of them. Kylie’s gold gear might make a comeback when she plays Glastonbury next Sunday.And  years after their debut, nobody has ever developed an allergy to them.As the wolf evolved into the dog, it sussed that making its eyes bigger made the humans go all soft and gooey inside.Dr Juliane Kaminski, of the University of Ports- mouth, says: “The evidence is compelling that dogs developed a muscle to raise the inner eyebrow after they were domesticated from wolves. It seems to elicit a strong desire in humans to look after them.”Those puppy-dog eyes are designed to make your heart melt.Certainly when Stan, our Cavalier King Charles spaniel, looks at me with his enormous, big round peepers, I understand the three little words he is trying to say.Give. Stan. Cheese.IT is weird the way even the greatest TV series can go off the boil.On the surface, the second series of Killing Eve has everything that made the first such a blast.Jodie Comer is still brilliant as psychopathic assassin Villanelle, doing a iety of convincing accents and changing her clothes more often than Diana Ross in concert.Sandra Oh is again wonderful as the sexually confused, domestically challenged spook.But I have watched the entire second series now and it just doesn’t catch fire the way the first did.And that is because the first series of Killing Eve had three female stars in Jodie Comer, Sandra Oh and – behind the scenes – Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who wrote the script.Now Waller-Bridge has gone off to save the screenplay of the next James Bond movie.And Killing Eve badly misses her magic dust.JEW-HATING has become the racism  that is permissible.The Prime Minister of Malaysia, Mahathir Mohamad, told the Cambridge Union debating society that his Jewish friends: “Are not like the other Jews – that’s why they are my friends.”He got a laugh.If he had said “black” or “Muslim”, he would have been nicked.THERE are some scary TV shows out there.Doing Question Time is daunting because you can be certain that at least half of the audience will hate your guts.Have I Got News For You  is forbidding because the ageing team captains and presenters have been doing it since the dawn of time and are used to the show’s format .But nothing comes close to the terror factor of Mastermind.To sit in that black leather chair as the lights go down is to know true stage fright. So Hamish Cameron must have been a very brave man indeed.Hamish held the record for the most appearances on Mastermind –  – and after filming the final last November, he learned he had terminal cancer.Shortly before the final was broadcast last week, Hamish died at the age of .The BBC had considered postponing the broadcast as a mark of respect but Hamish had instructed his family that he wanted the show to go on.As someone who vowed “never again” after sitting in that hot seat just the once, I can only salute Hamish’s courage.The Mastermind catchphrase “I’ve started so I’ll finish” could have been invented for this fearless man.IF Heathrow gets a third runway, then the impact on the environment will be huge, with hundreds of extra flights landing and taking  off every day.And that’s just for Emma Thompson!Their honeymoon must have been filthy.ANDREA LEADSOM says she was told by senior Tory women that they could not back her because the party couldn’t have “another woman” Prime Minister so soon after Theresa May.But the Tories’ past willingness to be led by a woman is surely something to celebrate.  The Conservatives will almost certainly be on their third female Prime Minister before the -year-old male-dominated Labour Party has its first.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So why feel guilty about watching it The appeal of this show is fairly obvious — it’s the intimate access you get.Viewers feel like they’re on holiday on on the island too, as invisible guests.The ultimate fly-on-the-wall experience.We hear the most private of conversations, witness the most explosive fallouts. We even get in the shower with them.It’s so intimate that it feels the same as when you read someone ’s diary.Of course, we are watching insanely beautul people parading around in tiny scraps of swimwear. But no matter how gorgeous the contestants, each one is revealed to be as fragile as the next.I think that is where our real fascination lies.Surely they should all be full of confidence, looking the way they do  And yet they seem to be just as insecure as the rest of us.I like the fact that the show is a portal into a generation to which I no longer belong.I’ve learned so much about how young men and women behave and, until Maura uttered the words, I didn’t even know it was possible to have “fanny flutters”.Another thing I like is the escapism. Surely it’s no coincidence that Love Island is at peak popularity during a time when the news is totally dominated with gloom, doom — and Brexit.Personally, I’m also intrigued by the fake hair and nails — and the very y process of getting ready for a night out. I’m luckyI put a comb through my hair.The amount of make-up they manage to get on to their faces is astonishing — although the irony is that the one girl all the guys seem to like, Lucie, is a surfer chick who doesn’t wear make-up.There is also a real cruelty to the show, though. There is always someone better, someone more chosen. The voting process is brutal and leaves all of the contestants anxious about whether or not people like them.This show strips people of everything that is important, other than their body. They are measured on what they look like and little .As a result, lots of people have questioned the damage caused to the mental health of the contestants.There have been more than , complaints to Ofcom about this series already.But there are good things about Love Island.While it’s not exactly the kind of equality that women have been fighting for over the past  years, there’s no denying that female members in the house are as free as the men to proposition members of the opposite sex.In my day, all we had was: “My mate fancies you.” But Maura said of one guy that he gave her “fanny flutters”.When my daughter Sophia was asked to go on the show, she thought it would be fun to be on a free holiday. You can see her point.But no mother wants to watch their child on Love Island. We all know there are plenty of things our kids do that we don’t know about — and that’s the way it should stay.But it’s not just that. One reason I enjoy being part of the Apprentice is because it celebrates young people for their skills, ambition and what they achieve.They know they aren’t being valued for their looks — they are being valued for so much more than that.That said, no one’s self- esteem should be based on how others value us.I’ve often thought that my biggest superpower is that I really don’t care what people think about me.When I’m on the beach I’m not bothered about which bits and pieces are jiggling.Why  Because there is so much more to me than what I look like in a bikini.Or, rather, as a footballer’s we once said to me: “All I’ve got is my looks — at least you’ve got your personality.”I know it was a back-handed compliment. But you know what, I’m fine with that.LOTTIE Moss said on social media that she feels “uncomfortable” with her weight at the moment – as she posted a picture of herself in a dress on a night out.My first thought was she’s going to look back at those photos when she is in her fties and wonder how she could have felt uncomfortable when she looked like this.My second was she can’t worry that much because the dress she’s wearing is almost completely see-through.BOSSES of the Isle of Wight Festival have been criticised by two mental-health charities for banning Jess Glynne for le after the singer cancelled her show at the last minute, owing to anxiety.Anxiety is a debilitating condition which blights the lives of many people.I’m sorry to hear that Jess is one of those people.But when she knows she suffers from this condition, her choice to stay out partying with the Spice Girls until am on the day she was due to perform seems, well, questionable.Having been out drinking all night before work is enough to make even the most level-headed person anxious.To then go on social media advertising that fact, before effectively phoning in sick to work, is also a tad foolish.By doing that, Glynne gave the impression she chose partying over a commitment – and that is not a good look.If we have one job to do as parents, it is to teach our kids the importance of doing the things that need to be done, when they need to be done, whether you like it or not.When I see a young person doing what they said they would do, despite challenges, I know they’ve got backbone.It’s called resilience, grit, determination, and it’s about being irrepressible. Those are some of the most admirable traits a person can have.Anxiety is awful but it’s certainly not helped by partying until the early hours of a work day.THIS week there has been good and bad news for Boris Johnson. The good news is that it looks ashe is going to be our next Prime Minister.The bad news is not that early-hours row with his partner – it’s his new haircut.He used to have “The Trump”, a sort of comb-forward that hid his balding. But his barber has cut it off and, instead of the long-haired blond bombshell look, he’s now a blond basin with thinning top.Boris, please take it from me, when you go into a hairdresser’s the first thing you do is check out the hairstyle of the person holding the scissors.Anyway, I guess it grows back – and soon will be the haystack it’s always been. Now all Boris needs is a new suit.OOPS! My heart goes out to the mum of the rampaging toddler at a Swiss art show who knocked over a sculpture of a fly worth £,.My main question, though, is how a plastic sculpture of a fly could be worth so much money Someone, somewhere, is having a laugh. Right I WAS trying to work out what was unusual about the recent photo of actor Rob Lowe on the red carpet.I realised it’s this. He is a handsome, successful star who is still with his we – Sheryl Berkoff – after  years without trading her in for a younger model.And they look happy.A rare sight in Hollywood, so good luck to both of them.TO be fair, Sofia Richie pretty much pulled it off when she sported the latest bicycle shorts onesie – the trend you prayed would never happen.But all I can say is, I’m glad I don’t follow fashion.WHAT’S in a word  You might think nothing much. And it’s a small thing in a way, but Sainsbury’s needs to be called out for assuming on its hair-removal product that all doctors are male.Its instructions say: “Consult your usual doctor and show him the packaging.”No doubt lots of people will respond by saying that us women are far too easily offended.But it is assumptions such as this behind the fact that, for every £ a man makes, a woman only makes p.We have to stamp out this unconscious bias by calling it out every time we see it.AMAZING that it’s  years since Friends hit our TVs.But judging by pictures of its stars Jenner Aniston, , and Courteney Cox, , on vacation in their bikinis, they still look fantastic.Even more amazing is that they are genuine friends.It just goes to show thatyou eat well, work out and look after yourself, you don’t have to be fat and flabby at .*Note to self – eat better and go to the gym. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I don’t think the public are concerned about things like that.He served eight years as London Mayor. People know what he’s like in office and that’s what’s important.And there were also reports that MPs told Theresa May that she must inform the Queen that he cant form a majority in the Commons.And Sir Mick Davies, the Tory Party chief executive, allegedly warned ministers that the partys top donors will stop giving moneyhe becomes leader.Last night three Cabinet ministers David Lidington, Rory Stewart and David Gauke all teamed up to slam Boris ideas of leaving without a deal but also having an implementation period.Mr Gauke said it wasnt a credible strategy and added: Its not that dficult.The PMs deputy, Mr Lidington, added: Erm... No Deal exit  no Withdrawal Agreement  no Implementation Period.Senior Tories also fear that Boris might not be in No for long, as he could face a no confidence vote on day ONE of power.No expects Jeremy Corbyn to waste no time and try and bring the Government down as soon as he gets in.And due to Boris isive reception from some Tories, there are real fears he could lose the vote.If they cant form a Government within  days that can command a majority in the House, then an election will be triggered.But Boris-backer Ms Truss insisted this morning on Radio  Live that he will call Remainer Tory MPs bluffShe said:I don’t believe in those circumstances colleagues would bring down a Conservative Government and let in Jeremy Corbyn, a Marxist.Mr Hunt took the chance to troll Boris earlier today by posting a snap of himself with a laptop - something Carrie and BoJo were heard arguing about last week.And he said he would back a third runway at Heathrow, something Boris said he would lay down in front of the bulldozers to stop.In the early hours of Friday morning Boris and Carrie had the police come to the flat they share in Camberwell over reports of a fuming row.She was allegedly heard shouting “get off me” and “get out of my flat” during a bust-up at their home.One neighbour said they heard what appeared to be an angry ­confrontation and recorded it because they feared for Carrie’s safety.In a recording of the row taken by the pair, Johnson can allegedly be heard refusing to leave the flat and telling his girlfriend to “get off my f***ing laptop” before a loud crash is heard.Carrie then reportedly told him he had ruined a sofa with red wine and added: “You just don’t care for anything because you’re spoilt. You have no care for money or anything.”Today we told how Carrie has said to pals she is too scared toto her £, flat after being subjected to what she believes to be a hate campaign.A Boris camp insider said: “As far as Carrie is concerned this is a stitch-up.

It’s not something you can decide minutes before having a baby.During the surgery for a tubal occlusion, the surgeon cuts through the abdomen wall and inserts a laparoscopy, which contains a light and a camera.Clips or rings are then applied to the Fallopian tubes, or the tubes are tied and cut.With hysteroscopic sterilisation, no cuts are required to the abdomen, so general anaesthetic is not needed.A tiny piece of titanium metal is inserted into each Fallopian tube, which causes scar tissue to form and block the tube.If blocking the Fallopian tubes has proved to be unsuccessful, the tubes may be completely removed in a process called salpingectomy.“When I woke up, I was told they’d done it. They took my choice away. It was horrendous.

Police were called to the home she shares with Johnson, , who is favourite to become the next Prime Minister, after reports of screaming and loud bangs. Now her ex, Oliver Haiste, has described their relationship as tumultuous - and said it was full of ups and downs. In an interview with the Mail on Sunday, he said relationships with Ms Symonds can be intense and passionate, but added: That passion can work the other way when she is not happy with you.    Mr Haiste, who was with her for three years, said it was fantastic when times were good, but awful when they werenapost.

Would-be PM Mr Johnson has been in a relationship with Ms Symonds since last year.    The former London Mayor is locked in a orce with second we Marina Wheeler. In September last year the pair released a statement confirming their orce plans, after  years of marriage. During his time in journalism and public office, Mr Johnson had at least four extra-marital affairs and is claimed to have made at least two of his mistresses pregnant.

The Foreign Secretary ramped up his challenge to Mr Johnson on Saturday, saying in an open letter that their character was being tested in the final stage of the leadership race and scrutiny can be uncomfortable. Tory grandee Sir Malcolm Rkind told BBC Radio  Live: If you are a candidate to be prime minister and the police have been called to your house - fairly or unfairly - the fact is there was a police visit.

I was in Tampa with friends when I heard folk music coming from an Irish and Scottish bar, The Harp  Thistle. I liked the music, so I went in. There one night, I met this beautul, lively woman named Linda. We started dating and I soon learned she was heavily involved with Noraid, the US political wing of the Provisional IRA. I didn’t know much about the Northern Ireland conflict, but feigned interest because I liked Linda. She invited me to Ireland and I accepted. We drove up to Sligo and Donegal on the west coast – Linda knew the owners of pro-IRA bars and they all knew her by her first name.    One of the owners, Joe O’Neill, was a long-time IRA man and he took a liking to me and taught me about Irish history. Linda and I broke up soon afterwards, but I was hooked on Ireland by then and went back by myself to meet Joe and other IRA men.I didn’t know it at the time, but the Irish police were photographing me with IRA members and sent the photos to the FBI.One day an FBI agent showed up at my trucking company office. I said I didn’t know about anything illegal, which was the truth, but he insisted on coming back to ask questions. He then said the FBI would pay for me and my new girlfriend, Maureen, to fly to Ireland when we wanted, in exchange for small pieces of information about the IRA.    As I didn’t know anything, I felt I might as well let the FBI pay for our holidays. So we would go back and forth to Ireland and give the FBI very little. Then one day, Joe invited me to the room he used for IRA meetings, which was above his pub. He said he wanted me to smuggle explosive parts from the US, and gave me the address of a primary school where I should send them – the plastic explosives were to be hidden in teddy bears, detonating cord disguised as skipping rope, and electronic parts hidden in radios. This made me flinch – the idea of sending explosives to a school. I said I would, but I passed on the info to the FBI, and soon the spying operation became more serious. I wanted to move to Ireland anyway, and the FBI agreed to pay for the lease on a pub on the Irish border, near Joe’s bar. My bar quickly became a gathering point for IRA members and the information started to come in.  I liked the customers, but some moments shocked me – like watching a granny bouncing a young boy on her knee and telling him some day he would shoot policemen in the North. Pretty soon the FBI asked me to meet MI, which was keen to have spies in the IRA groups that were opposed to the Northern Ireland peace process. I flew to London for a debrief with an MI agent, and soon I was reporting to them as well. Then, in August , the Real IRA set off a car bomb in Omagh, which killed  civilians, including a mother nine months pregnant with twins. Later, Maureen and I watched a documentary about children injured in the Omagh bomb, one of whom was blinded. It was devastating.  I had to remind myself these were the people I was dealing with. There was a tendency to see them as friends, but I also had to find those other feelings at the back of that – revulsion and disgust for what was happening to innocent people. Then I was introduced to the Real IRA’s leader, Mickey McKevitt, along with several of his top men. He liked me straight away, and I liked him. He was easy to talk to and was enthusiastic about American fund-raising money and my ability to get weapons and bomb parts in the US.Over time, I learned he had a sleeper agentin the US who would be brought to the UK when the time was right to shoot Tony Blair , or some other high-level British establishment figure.I met the sleeper several times in Massachusetts and he was keen toget weapons moving to Ireland.Eventually, Mickey suggested I sit on the Real IRA’s army council. I wouldn’t have voting rights, but I could very to US supporters that their money was being well spent and be able to report back on weapons and bomb parts needed by the Real IRA.The army council meetings were held at a farmer’s cottage in the mountains on the border, where the farmer’s we would make us tea, while he discussed bombings in England and assassinations of police officers.I would send detailed emails to the FBI and MI of what was happening.My scariest moment came when I attended the ‘engineering’ orbomb-making meetings.I brought along encryption software for the team that had been doctored by MI.  One of the top bomb makers was very suspicious and said that it might have been tampered with. My heart was racing and I was sweating. I was petried and couldn’t sleep that night. I was really on edge, wonderingthe Real IRA would find out that the encryption software had been compromised. What would happen to me and Maureenthey did  I knew about the torture and death that came to other IRA informers. There was a case in which a woman was beaten to death by three IRA members, while with another informer, they set up a roadblock, shot him in the back of the head and rolled his car into the canal. The police didn’t find his body for two years. That would have been my fate.  I began to wonder how much longer we could stay in this le. Mickey told me he was looking for a foreign sponsor to supply them with weapons and was interested in Saddam Hussein.I told MI, who were excited and saw it as an opportunity to ensnare the Real IRA.It was agreed with MI that I would testy against some of the Real IRA leadership, and in one day there were arrests of leaders in the south of Ireland, the north, and the US. I was flown to a US airbase in Britain, as I was due to testy against three Real IRA council members who had set up meetings with Saddam Hussein’s agents . Then I flew on the British royal jet to testy against Mickey McKevitt, who was arrested at his home. He wasn’t one bit happy to see me this time, and glared at me. I was nervous at the beginning of the trial – there were lots of TV cameras outside the court, and army snipers on the roof of the courtroom. Mickey’s barrister cross-examined me for two weeks. It was gruelling.  After I finally finished testying, the SAS took me by Hercules plane out of Ireland forever. The most stressful part was after I had finished testying and ed to the US in hiding. I had all this adrenaline running through me for years. Suddenly I wasn’t living on the edge any more and couldn’t handle my emotions. I went on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety drugs, Maureen went on them too. We couldn’t adjust to this new passive world after so many years undercover, but I eventually learned to get on with le and enjoy myself. Mickey McKevitt was jailed for  years and I know he will never forgive me. Still, after the Omagh bomb, I have no regrets about what I did.  I also earned millions of dollars from the FBI, but I can never work again because the Real IRA would catch up with me.

She recalled: “I got a call at am telling me Carter had crashed and he was needing a machine to breathe for him. “We were then escorted by police to Glasgow Children’s Hospital. “The journey was dreadful. I remember the paramedic telling me thatwe needed to pull over he’d do what he could to help Carter. I was terried. I thought I was going to lose my baby in the back of the ambulance.”    In Glasgow, cardiologists diagnosed Carter with a heart condition called Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Drainage, or TAPVD. The veins carrying blood to his heart from his lungs were not connected in the right place, and were pumping blood into the wrong chamber of the heart. The condition is thought to affect one in , babies. A major operation was Carter’s only slim chance.    Sheree recalled: “The surgeon told me that Carter was in a critical condition and the chances that he would survive were very low. “He was taken from me at pm and came out just after am. Those hours were the longest of my le.” Even after such a gruelling surgery, Carter wasn’t out of the woods. He also needed a heart bypass and blood transfusion before he left theatre, and his le was still very much in danger. Sheree said: “The surgeon said to prepare for the worst as he still might not survive the next few days. “When I saw him there were so many tubes, a ventilator, wires and drains all over him. “He was so swollen but I was just glad to see my baby again. I didn’t think I was ever going to see his big beautul blue eyes ever again.”    Carter spent  days in the  paediatric intensive care unit and was finally sent home in March. Sheree said: “We take every day as it comes and I hold him a little tighter every night. “He is a blessing. He is bright, thriving with energy. You wouldn’t think anything was wrong with him. He’s a heart warrior.” Carter has now put the ordeal behind him and is a bright, happy picture of health.

But the married mum-of-three was herself summoned to Luton Crown Court on Friday for the whinge. And she could not show cause for being unable to spend time on a jury. Judge Barbara Mensah blasted her selfish attitude and fined the woman £. She said it was her public service to carry out jury service. On the th anniversary of the DD landings when people gave up their lives to ensure the freedoms we have in this country of a fair trial and of innocent until proven guilty, you think you can impose a selfish attitude to jury service, the judge said. She said she would not have to do jury service as she had children and was not  years of age. When Hull, from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, was called to serve in February, it was postponed until June  due to her childcare problems.    The BQ worker deferred her service again until June  but said it was still not enough time to find someone to mind her children. Now the mum is due to start her jury service on Monday. Her husband has taken unpaid leave from a water company to look after their youngster, reports say.  Stuart Sprawson, defending, said: He is taking unpaid leave for five days next week to look after the children. She accepts her defiance to court is not edying. She makes a sincere apology and did not appreciate the situation. If you do not turn up for your jury service or reply to the summons, you can be fined £,.

Part of her fallopian tubes were removed as she slept because Lindsay, , had twice suffered le-threatening pre-eclampsia during pregnancy. But she says she did not give permission and is devastated that she can no longer have children. Lindsay – who received £, compensation – says: “I woke and was told they’d performed the procedure. I didn’t want it and had been told it definitely wouldn’t be done that day. “I was completely distraught, just devastated. Doctors took away my chance to have more children. “How can they do that to someone  How is that fair  I feel like they ruined my le.

On the day of her planned C-section, a midwe asked Lindsay what contraception she planed to use after the birth – and mentioned sterilisation for the first time. Lindsay said: “I certainly didn’t agree to it. I didn’t sign anything and at no point did I give consent to go ahead with the op. I was categorically told it would not be done that day. “It is a huge decision and one I would have needed to discuss with my partner. It’s not something you can decide minutes before having a baby. “When I woke up, I was told they’d done it. They took my choice away. It was horrendous. I kept thinking, ‘What the hell have they done to me’ ” Her daughter Lacie arrived safe and sound – and is now five. Lindsay and partner Martin already had son Harvey, now . He was born after a dficult pregnancy during which Lindsay developed pre-eclampsia.    The condition causes high blood pressure and swelling, with potentially further serious complications. Lindsay adds: “I had to deliver Harvey by C-section seven weeks early. I was in hospital two weeks and Harvey was in for five, because he was premature.” When Lindsay suffered pre-eclampsia again, while carrying Lacie, doctors warned a third pregnancy could put her le at risk. But Lindsay goes on: “I knew it would be risky. But I always wanted more children. It breaks my heart every time Harvey says, ‘Mummy are we going to have another brother or sister  I say, ‘No, we can’t’. It is a very hard operation to reverse and at my age, the chances of it working are slim to none.” Leeds NHS Trust acknowledged its “shortcomings” and said: “We have a more comprehensive approach to recording consent for patients, which fully adheres to legislation.” "},{"url":null,"title":"queens horror after rats seen","story":"NewsQueens horror after rats seen running through Buckingham Palace kitchenThe vermin problem has left the royals at the Buckingham Palace baffled and staff had to called in pest control squadShareCommentsByTfany Lo:,  JUN NewsThe council has sent ratcatchers to the London residence to deal with the vermin problem \"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe Queen was said to be aposhorriedapos after a plague of rats and mice were found running around the kitchen area of Buckingham Palace.

The SBS commandos are experts in covertly removing mines from ships’ hulls. They will be supported by specialist Royal Navy ers, who are trained to defuse a wide range of mines. Tensions are soaring after the Iranian Revolutionary Guard was accused of attacking ships with mines and shooting down an American spy drone. Fears are growing that the US could slide into war with Iran after it was reported that President Trump said his forces were “cocked and loaded” for retaliatory action, before changing his mind with just  minutes to go.    The Special Boat Service frogmen can also launch underwater attacks against vessels, killing or capturing foreign troops attempting to sabotage shipping. Top defence sources said they could have Shallow Water Combat Submersibles, mini-subs used by UK and US special forces. The Pentagon accuses Iran of blasting two tankers in the Gulf after placing mines on them. On Wednesday Iran fired the first shot, downing a US drone with a surface-to-air missile. There are fears Iran may close the Strait of Hormuz by mining the  mile wide waterway or blocking it by sinking ships. A senior defence source said last night: “The SBS is being sent to the region as part of a deterrent. One of its roles will be to gather intelligence on Iranian mining operations. “It will work closely with Royal Navy ers who are the specialists at disarming mines and protecting shipping. “The SBS has a more aggressive role. Everyone is hoping that the tension will be eased and Iran will back down.” The SBS commandos, mainly recruited from the Royal Marines, complete the same selection course as the SAS and have recently seen action in Syria.

Lisa-Marie Wall, , has also had bricks thrown through her living room window and through the windscreens of cars belonging to family members, Wales Online reports.Last week, Lisa woke up in the middle of the night to find her car was on fire. CCTV footage showed a masked inidual pouring petrol on the pavement and into her car before lighting it and running away. She has now had a special letter box installed to prevent burning objects being posted through her door but says she is living in fear of further attacks.  Lisa, who lives with her dad in Cardf, told Wales Online about the series of terrying incidents that led up to the horric arson attack last week, which has completely destroyed her car. The attacks began on June , when her family woke up in the morning to find a brick on the living room floor and a smashed window. My dad woke me up because there was brick on the floor in my living room, she said. Obviously we were all scared. Obviously I was scared for my dadaposs sake, and my sisteraposs baby plays in the front room.  The family told police and installed CCTV cameras outside their home on the advice of officers. Two days later, on June , another brick was thrown through the window of her sisteraposs car outside her home in Cardf. And one week later, on June , Lisa discovered the back window of her own car had been smashed by a large brick. The CCTV showed a person throwing the brick into the back of the car before running away.  Lisa, a customer service manager at Ladbrokes in Cardf, has reported all the incidents to the police, but she said officers told her there was not enough evidence to identy a suspect. He had a scarf over his face so the police obviously didnapost have enough evidence, she said. But the next day, on June , Lisa and her boyfriend heard something outside at around .am and looked out of the window to see her car was on fire. My boyfriend saw it outside our window, she said. He shouted, aposyour car is on fireapos. So I got out of bed shouting and crying because the car is literally three inches from the house. My youngest sister was in the house.  The fire service and the police were called and fortunately nobody was hurt. CCTV picked up a person pouring petrol over the pavement and into the broken window of Lisaaposs car. They lit the pavement on fire and then the car. Lisa, who has been left terried by the incident, said the car was completely destroyed and the police have put her in touch with Womenaposs Aid and installed a fire-proof letter box and fire alarms in the house.  Iaposm really anxious. I havenapost got my car. I donapost want to go anywhere on my own, she said. Lisa said her anxiety has been made worse because of a group of incidents involving her former partner two years ago. In November , her partner stabbed a friend of Lisa’s while they were driving in a car near her home. He was convicted of an offence of grievous bodily harm and putting a person in fear of violence. He was sentenced to  months in prison and a restraining order preventing him from contacting Lisa or her friend was put in place. On Wednesday, South Wales Police said a -year-old man was arrested on suspicion of arson and breaching a restraining order but was released without charge. A spokeswoman said: “Protecting victims of domestic abuse is a priority for South Wales Police and a full safeguarding plan is in place for the female in this case.” "},{"url":null,"title":"baseball legend david ortiz condition","story":"NewsBaseball legend David Ortiz condition update after he was shot in nightclub attackThe Boston Red Sox slugger was shot in the back by a gunman who mistook him for the real target who was seated at the same table in the nightclub in Dominican RepublicShareCommentsByTfany Lo:,  JUN NewsPeople are seen grappling in the CCTV\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFormer Boston Red Sox player David Ortiz has made signicant progress in his recovery as he moved out of intensive care after being shot in the back earlier this month.

Especially here, where they have an extensive menu dedicated to them categorised by flavour and even offer “cocktail experiences” for those looking to learn from their mixologists. Our waiter recommended a real fruit mocktail with lots of real crushed fruit and berries and juices to provide a thirst quenching mix without the alcohol .We relaxed into the quiet and sipped our drinks in the sun as we pondered over the vast menu options.The venue’s interior is a mix of classic wooden floors with soft leathers and muted tartans in greys and brown, combining traditional charm with modern comfort. vw, px\"  The menus are bound in heavy leather books, and there was plenty of choice.My other half ordered bruschetta to startwhich, of course, we ended up sharing. Well, I am eating for two!Who knew that three simple slices of toasted bread with oils and tomato could be so delicious  Also, both of us were pretty in awe of the little yellow tomatoes – spot the uncultured pair.I toyed with the idea of my usual steak pie-pick and even deliberated a fish dish, but in the end we both went for the same main course of chicken tikka curryand it was presented beautully.The plate held rice and naan with a small dish of mango chutney and a large dish of gorgeously bright-coloured chicken tikka.The chicken was wonderfully soft and the tikka sauce was full of flavour, not too salty with just a bit of zing. vw, px\"  I’m notoriously soft when it comes to anything spicy, but this was just enough for me and I only needed water for my tingly lips towards the end of finishing the plateful.We were both equally surprised at the portion size from the Caird. Although it felt upmarket, there was no scrimping on the food.I chose the brownie for dessert and my partner the sticky toffee pudding . Again, both platefuls looked almost too good to eat.My dark chocolate brownie was topped with drizzled caramel sauce next to a scoop of vanilla ice cream with sprinkles of crushed chocolate and chocolate sauce. Strawberries and homemade fudge was presented to the side in a design with shards of wafer and small dollops of salted caramel and strawberry mousse. It sounds like a lot of flavours and it was, but in a good way.My partner’s slab of sticky toffee pudding was also teamed with a large scoop of ice cream, crushed chocolate, a large wafer and a couple of raspberries, sprinkled with icing sugar.We both finished the lot.The whole evening was lovely and relaxing.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll. This includes extra funding for the Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund, more funding for infrastructure and an increase in roads winter maintenance resources across Argyll.As ever, my fellow Conservatives and I will continue to fight non stop to make sure our rural constituency is not sidelined by this unceasingly urban and separatism-obsessed over centralising Scottish Government.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and Islands ward.Sir,I photographed this unusual visitor to Kilduskland Road, Ardrishaig, on April .

Design fleets comprising the Sigma s, Sonatas, Etchells and Hunter s joined the racing at Tarbert.Amid a flurry of rib activity laying and moving marks, it was not long before the CYCA  passage race fleet approached the finish line.The teams later caught up in the bar for the day one prize giving as new event chairman Glenn Porter welcomed everyone to Tarbert. With a number of races omitted due to protests, it was a nice easy start for Glenn.The Hunter s and Sonatas saw a spread of results after some close racing. The CYCA class  fleet on the Largs passage race was won on corrected time by Celtic Spirit. Additional prizes were awarded to Encore for the passage race line honours and Shona of Ashton for toughing it out at the rear of the passage race.Saturday was a much more challenging day on the water with a light wind and dreich drizzle. The race committee nonetheless got two races in for a number of the fleets.Protests concluded, Saturday’s prize giving announced the remaining results from Friday. This showed #s winner and RC Makars Mash class yacht Storm looking strong with a first place.Chimaera showed early signs of being a threat to the Scottish Series crown, taking a first in Friday racing. With no immediate showing of a dominant yacht in the IRC Class  fleet from Friday’s races, it was IRC class four that showed a brewing battle between Lady Ex and F’n Gr. In the CYCA Class  fleet, First by Farr surfaced with the highest number of race wins from Friday.Not to be outdone, CYCA Class  saw the final results dominated by Cool Bandit  before Saturday#s results were announced. With the weather mixing up the league table for Saturday, there were a lot of yachts taking home prizes.Saturday evening saw theof Big Vern and The Shootahs to the Scottish Series for another year and a spectacular fireworks display in celebration of Valhalla of Ashton’s th year on the water.Sunday saw yet another big weather sht with forecasts up to  knots. Loch Fyne likes to mix it up a bit so the fleets ventured out into more sedate conditions than those forecast. But as the weather built, race officers shortened the traditional round Inchmarnock passage race.Sunday prizes featured an additional prize for the best performer in each fleet. Glenn Porter started proceedings with a special award for #assisting mark layers# to the competitor who got tangled up in one of the race marks. In IRC Class  it was El Gran Senor and Forty Licks shining through. The Makars Mash RC class saw Hijacker leading the prize haul. In IRC Class it was Mata taking the #extra# prize. IRC class four saw F’n Gr take a clean sweep of firsts in both races. With only one race in CYCA  and , it was Reflection and Salamander XXII taking home the wins. In the Etchells One,  Design Hero took a win in both races with Squawk leading the way in the Sigma  One Design Class. In the Hunter  fleet Miss Moneypenny was the only yacht placed in both races taking home the best performer of the day for the s. With two firsts in the Sonata one design, Fiddlesticks made the most of the Sunday conditions. Finally, the CYCA restricted sail fleet saw Celtic Spirit take first place.The  event saw the marquee remain open for the Sunday evening as part of additional shoreside activities supported by Event Scotland.An earlier start on Monday was greeted with sunshine and no wind. This time the challenge was just too much for race officers who had to abandon racing for the day.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"here come the girls and they mean business","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowEnterprise was the name of the game as women from six countries boldly went where no women had gone before.Around  women from rural parts of Iceland, Ireland, Sweden, Finland, Canada and Scotland took part in the three day W-Power seminar, in the first visit of its kind to Scotland.Organised by Highlands and islands Enterpriseas part of the Northern Periphery and Arctic programme, the purpose of the seminar was to explore the challenges facing female entrepreneurs in sparsely populated areas # and how these can be overcome.Between June  and , the women visited Portavadie Marina and the Inveraray Inn and took in visits to women-led businesses, including Benmore Cafe by Loch Eck, Beinn an Tuirc distillery, Kintyre  and Argyll Coffee Roasters at Tighnabruaich.The itinerary included presentations on using tools such as virtual networking and digital marketing in tackling some of the challenges of doing business in sparsely populated areas.Accessing finance, peer learning and gender-aware business coaching were also discussed.A networking and learning session featured real le stories about the opportunities and challenges faced by women entrepreneurs and information about support available through the W-Power programme.Cathy Higginson, HIE#s W-Power project manager, said: #W-Power has been in existence for around six months.

These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area.

A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

Itrsquos in such a beautul part of our county that the journey there was an adventure in itself.The loch is hidden, surrounded by a wood which embraces its secrets. Irsquod never visited it before, but Irsquod been told how magical this place is and that it has a story attached to it.Finding an appropriate place to park was our first challenge. There is no direct access to the loch and no car park with signposts, so care is needed in finding a suitable place. A private farm road that takes you to the entrance gate is not an option, so initially I struggled to find a suitable place, but some kind advice from a friendly farmer helped us out.Itrsquos a perfect time of year for such an adventure. The woods are fully clothed and still echoing with birdsong. I like to explore new places initially without a map or guide. It adds to the adventure, as we had to decide which way to go and initially wonderedwersquod taken the wrong route. But there is a circular walk around the loch, so once the path is discovered there isnrsquot a wrong way.It is a beautul and tranquil place, and as we wandered along the tree-lined loch I thought about the story of the man responsible for its creation.That man was Harry Younger, of the well-known brewing family. His ancestor, William Younger, had been the man who had built up the famous brewing business which produced Youngerrsquos Ale. A huge chunk of the Canongate in Edinburgh was taken over by their Holyrood brewery, including the site where the Scottish Parliament now sits.When William Younger died in , he was a hugely wealthy and successful businessman but also, it seems, exhausted and overworked. The empire he left was continued by the family but eventually in , the Younger enterprise was merged with rivals McEwanrsquos, to form Scottish Brewers Ltd.This merger, the reasons for which are another story, meant the Younger family branched out into other ventures. In the s, Harry Younger, the then head of the family, bought the land at Baro and began transforming it into the haven of nature it now is.Harry led an interesting and privileged le. He was an internationally known curler who regularly competed and won trophies. His intention was to create a new home amid the beauty of this area of East Lothian. He set about building a house, but also developed Bara Loch as it now exists and surrounded it with an embrace of trees.But the dark clouds of the Second World War intervened in his plans to enjoy this paradise. He had attended Sandhurst in his earlier years and seen the last months of the First World War. He remained involved in the Territorial Army and in January  he was sent to France as commander of a mechanised unit.It is recorded that he was killed in action on June  at St Valery-en-Caux. His unit, the Lothian and Border Horse, had been part of the brave and ferocious defence of the Dunkirk beaches. Anyone with knowledge of this action will understand the hell and desperation of that defence, and the supreme courage and sacrice of the defenders.Harry died on the day these brave defenders had to finally surrender, after over , had been evacuated from the beaches. How he died, what horrors he witnessed, we can only guess. He lies buried in the St Valery-en-Caux Franco-British Cemetery.And so this is the story attached to this beautul place. The man who began its creation never got the chance to enjoy it.In our walk, we arrived at a stone seat overlooking the loch. It had a worn inscription on it. We could make out the words lsquoin memoryrsquo or lsquomemorialrsquo and lsquoYoungerrsquo, but the rest was too worn.But I knew this must be a memorial to Harry Younger, which was later confirmed when I found a wonderful blog called Walking East Lothian in which the author explained he had traced the inscription to reveal Harryrsquos name and the date , the year of the lochrsquos creation.I sat on the seat and watched my kids play in the wood. The trees on the north side arch over the waterline to catch the sunlight, creating a canopy which dips into the loch. The serene tranquillity and beauty of the place is no doubt what Harry intended.But that in a sense is part of the magic of this place. As the pioneer Nelson Henderson once said to his son: ldquoThe true meaning of le is to plant trees under whose shade you do not expect to sit.It was these words I was reflecting on as I watched my children play. Harry was of course wealthy but we can all plant trees, either real ones or metaphorical ones, as a legacy for others.The recent death of a fellow storyteller and all-round wonderful woman, Ros Parkyn, was also on my mind. I had spoken about this place to her and of my intention to visit it. She loved nature too and would have gladly come along with me.

There are several factors influencing this, but the major factor which has tipped the balance is the extended funding hours and the negative impact this is having both financially on small businesses, like Mary Poppins, and to the quality of early learning and childcare.New Scottish Government policy instructs councils to increase their funded childcare hours from  to , by . This move also includes longer opening hours and a move from term time to year-round opening hours to attempt to make childcare more nationally accessible.Ms Dewar said: ldquoThe money received for funded places does not cover the costs of providing the quality of early learning and childcare which we want and are required to provide, especially with regards to staff costs.ldquoThe timescales and measures that the Scottish Government has put in place to educate a workforce to meet the increased requirements are insufficient, and there is a serious shortfall to meet the requirements of the extended funding.ldquoEast Lothian Council indicated it estimated it would require approximately  staff to facilitate the increase in funded hours in East Lothian. The majority of these posts are early learning and childcare practitioners.ldquoThe local authority advertises early learning practitioner posts at between pound. and pound. per hour. Private nurseries are unable to compete with these rates of pay due to the funding rates we are allocated.A group of parents and staff, including Ms Dewar, are visiting county MSP Iain Gray to discuss the problems, but Ms Dewar added that unless he can ldquowork a miracle and change the policy, then it is unlikely the decision to close the nursery will be reversed.When asked about the nursery, Mr Gray said: ldquoThe loss of any nursery provision is disappointing, particularly with the Governmentrsquos , funded hours policy set to be implemented next year.ldquoIn the case of the Mary Poppins Nursery, the owner has highlighted a number of factors that have contributed to their decision to close.ldquoI have written to East Lothian Council about some of these issues.ldquoHowever, there are also wider issues at play here. The nursery sector has been warning the Scottish Government that private nurseries are struggling in the run-up to the roll-out of its flagship , policy from August .ldquoMinisters must act quickly to address the sectorrsquos concerns and ensure that the capacity exists to deliver the funded hours next year.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoIt is, of course, concerning to hear of any nursery considering closure, and the obvious effects this might have on staff, parents and children.ldquoEast Lothian Council has provided assurance that they will support families to find alternative early learning and childcare places for children who had been expecting to use the Mary Poppins Nursery from this August.Ms Dewar added: ldquoI am distraught that circumstances have forced me to this decision and that such a wonderful place for children to experience their early years is to close.The decision was met with an outpouring of grief on social media.The nurseryrsquos recent th birthday was marked with a garden party.The nursery was founded by Sue Armstrong, affectionately still called lsquoMiss Suersquo, after she had written to Mary Poppins author P L Travers to askshe could use the name.Miss Sue said: ldquoI received many letters from P L Travers about the nursery.ldquoAt the beginning, she wanted to know what the nursery was going to be like. She had no objection to me using the name, she just wanted to find out more. I ended up meeting her as well.ldquoWe were hoping to get her to come and open the nursery  years ago, but her arthritis was bad. We stayed in touch, however. I would send her letters about how the nursery was getting on along with photos, and she would write back saying how she liked it, and ideas of what to do.ldquoShe said that the children should be encouraged to make up their own stories. lsquoChildren like doing that,rsquo she said.Miss Sue sold the nursery to Ms Dewar in  as she was ldquosick of all the paperwork.She said. ldquoWhen I heard it was to close down, well, itrsquos just all so sad really. Itrsquos such a terrible shame.ldquoIt is such a nice and happy place for the children, homely and warm.

Frequency should be half-hourly.Councillor Tom Trotter, who represents Haddington, backed the station bid.He said: ldquoIt is a good idea, especially with the town expanding as it is.ldquoIt would be a tremendous asset to have.However, the councillor felt it was more likely the station would have to find a new site, such as Alderston, to the north of the town.He added: ldquoIn the short-term it is unrealistic, but hopefully in the longer term things can be put in place to make it a realistic possibility.ldquoIt is a great idea and Irsquom sure it would get support from all the local ward councillors, but where it would go and how much it would cost are questions."},{"url":null,"title":"preview-prestonpans-gala-2019","story":"This year is the th anniversary of Prestonpans Childrenrsquos Gala.On gala day itself, the festivities kick off with the crowning ceremony at am at Prestonpans Community Centre.There is then a fancy-dress competition at Middleshot Square at noon before the parade heads off through the town.From Middleshot Square, it heads along Hawthorn Road and down West Loan to the war memorial, then along High Street before turning up Redburn Road, then along North Grange Avenue, where it ends at Mary Murray Park, behind the community centre.The park hosts the gala dayrsquos family fun, which includes a funfair with a host of rides, as well as old favourites such as hook the duck.There is also a vintage fire engine on display, as well as an American police car, motorbike displays, ponies, birds of prey, beat the goalie, Zorbs, safe archery, NERF guns, crazy golf, a tombola and a gala raffle, not to mention ice cream vans, tea and coffee, Mr Donut Man, crepes, waffles, hot dogs, nachos, a burger van, La Favorita pizzas, stalls selling gts, sweets and cake.Gala day marks the beginning, not the end of Prestonpansrsquo week of fun and activities.Events are as follows:Saturday, June Monday, June Tuesday, June Wednesday, June Thursday, June Friday, June "},{"url":null,"title":"tom-gordon-boris-may-not-be-pm-long-enough-to-alter-scotland","story":"It was fun while it lasted. But it was a mania, and all manias are brief and slightly silly. What did we actually know about Rory Stewart  Principally that he didnrsquot look or sound like the other lot. He didnrsquot come across as a greasy, self-seeking weasel. Nor did he look like Theresa May. There was a pulse, for one thing. A personality. A hinterland even.But other than being refreshingly blunt about Brexit for a Tory, we didnrsquot know much. His big policy was not to have policies. No tax cuts, no spending pledges. He was, in effect, continuity austerity. If that had sunk in, the chatterati adoration might have waned.He was no miracle cure for our political malaise, but a symptom of it, a sign of how much people are yearning for an alternative to what theyrsquore being offered. That eagerness to believe in him, in the absence of facts, should have sounded an alarm, not a hosanna.It may be Mr Stewart, for all his apparent guilelessness, is only a smarter sort of self-seeking weasel.Yet he will be missed. When he was in the Tory leadership race, he was a brake on the worst impulses of the other candidates, constantly nagging them over how they might deliver Brexit by October , and that the EU sees the threat of the UK leaving without a deal as no threat at all. Do we really want to join Venezuela and Syria and trade on WTO terms Which brings us to Boris Johnson. The former foreign secretary isnrsquot a lock for Downing Street. His well-chronicled flaws mean he could easily stumble over the next month of party hustings and offer Jeremy Hunt a chance to strike. But as things stand, he is very likely to be the next Prime Minister.This is bad for Ruth Davidson, but possibly not as much as she fears, and good for Nicola Sturgeon, but possibly not as much as she hopes.The Scottish Tory leaderrsquos discomfort over her old enemy could hardly have been clearer this week. First she backed Sajid Javid against Mr Johnson. Then she backed Michael Gove against him. If the empty lectern from the Channel  debate had been running, shersquod clearly have been happy to back that too.Asked by STV news on Thursday whether she was backing ldquoanyone but Boris, she couldnrsquot even mention his name. She and other senior Scottish Tories worry Mr Johnson will prove anathema to Scottish voters.He has already providing the SNP with some choice ammo. His journalistic career is full of sniping at Scotland and the Scots. He didnrsquot really argue in  that a native Scot could never be PM, only an MP with a Scottish constituency, given the West Lothian Question.At the time, Tony Blair, a Scot, was standing for re-election. Mr Johnson, born in New York, didnrsquot attack Mr Blair. He attacked his expected successor, Gordon Brown, as he had a Scottish seat.But the comments were enough for Ms Sturgeon to get her teeth into this week. He has also been very rude about the FM personally, and she about him.So what are the Scottish Tories to dohe wins  In recent weeks there has been a conversation at the top of the party about how to handle the Boris problem.Should they cold-shoulder him, or coach him in the esoteric ways of Scottish politics and hold his hand through the constitutional minefield Itrsquos a bogus debate, a flattering delusion that suggests they have a choice. Ms Davidson and her party cannot distance themselves from a Johnson premiership because by extension they would be backing away from the Westminster system and the Union. That hardly fits with Ms Davidsonrsquos brand.So rather than fuel the SNP claim that Westminster is now so alien itrsquos only sensible to leave, the Scottish Tories can only embrace Prime Minister Johnson.The manic grin of Borista MP Ross Thomson aside, they may well do it through gritted teeth, their skin crawling, but therersquos really no option. Wersquove had hug a hoodie, now itrsquos time to cuddle a clown. For good or ill,Mr Johnson wins this contest, Ms Davidson is shackled to the great lummox.How bad might a Johnson premiership be  Pretty woeful, itrsquos fair to guess. He seems guided by neither plans nor principles. He may survive a while through a lizard-brain instinct for self-preservation, tacking to the centre ground to align with the protective mass of voters. He has already started to squirm out of his Hallowersquoen-or-bust position by saying Brexit by then is ldquoeminently feasible rather than nailed down. But the MPs who backed him because of his apparent Brexit hardline are not the compromising sort. He will soon come up against the same Commons arithmetic and red-faced irreconcilables who did for Mrs May.He may not last long enough to do Ms Davidson serious harm.Ms Sturgeon, meanwhile, is hoping he will be a long-term incompetent, ruffling feathers and setting teeth on edge every time he even mentions Scotland. She said yesterday he would be a ldquodisaster for the UK and Scotland. ldquoIt further demonstrates that Scotland and the rest of the UK are on dferent political trajectories, she told the Herald.But thatrsquos more standard wishful thinking. All things Tory are supposed to move the dial on independence. Just like Brexit. Butall the things the SNP says are boosting independence were actually boosting independence, Yes would be nudging  per cent in the polls. ldquoIt has got to the stage wherethe chicken crosses the road, it will be a boost for Scottish independence, David Mundell said in the Commons this week. Even SNP MPs smiled at that one.So Ms Sturgeon should not mistake her personal needle with Mr Johnson for a looming national backlash. Yes, Scottish voters have a low opinion of Mr Johnson. But they also know he is likely to have a short and inglorious shelf-le before a revival of Rorymania.

Napoleon slept, it is said, with a version of the ldquoCeltic Homer under his pillow as he fought his campaigns in Egypt, and the German literary giant Goethe was famously inspired by the tales of the blind, third-century bard Ossian, and the adventures of Fingal and Oscar, Malvina and King Swaran.Indeed, Macphersonrsquos writings ndash fragments, he contended, of ancient Gaelic stories, tales and songs that he had collected, translated and heard ndash inspired composers, poets, politicians and artists across Europe. In Britain alone, the works of the man from Ruthven, Badenoch, influenced Burns and Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Scott and Byron.However, the Ossian tales as told by Macpherson in a series of publications starting with Fragments Of Ancient Poetry in  ndash largely gloomy stories of wars and loss, tumultuous epic landscapes roiling with storms and conflict ndash were publicly savaged by critics, most notably Samuel Johnson, one of the most famous men of letters of his day.Johnson said the Ossian tales as presented by Macpherson were ldquoas gross an imposition ever the world was troubled with. The charge was that Macpherson was a fraud, and had essentially written the works himself.The controversy was huge at the time: Macpherson defended his work,not as robustly as an author may do in these more media-savvy times ndash one account notes that he challenged Johnson to a duel ndash and the Highland Society of Scotland launched an official investigation, which found, albeit not until , that he had used genuine material in his work.Some  years later, Macphersonrsquos works are little known, and have not benefited from a renaissance in their audience through radio, television or film: Ossian is not a namethat creates many ripples in popular culture.However, a major new show at Scotlandrsquos National Museum ndash Wild and Majestic: Romantic Visions of Scotland, which opens this week ndash hopes to shine a new light on the Ossian controversy. It shows the Ossian tales as crucial to the development of Romantic thought and literature in the late th century, and states clearly, and provides evidence, that Macpherson based his work on authentic texts.Scholars, too, see the whole controversy at the crux of a tension between industrialised central Scotland and the rapidly changing Highlands, and between Scottish culture and the burgeoning idea of British Empire and the dominance of obviously ldquoEnglish culture.Johnsonrsquos ridiculing of Macpherson was much more than a literary argument: the cultural and political undercurrents of the controversy are unmistakable.The exhibition includes one of Macphersonrsquos sources, the Red Book of Clanranald. It adds: ldquoJames Macpherson maintained that his translations of the Ossian cycle were based on authentic Gaelic verse, ballads and songs, collected during his travels in the Scottish Highlands ... Macpherson consulted and collected original Gaelic manuscripts belonging to numerous Highland families.ldquoThese included the Red Book of Clanranald, a volume containing the history and lore of Clan Donald, which was compiled by a member of the MacMhuirich family of bards.The curator of the show, Dr Patrick Watt, said that Macpherson was ldquoscholarly and rigorous in his research.He said: ldquoMacpherson definitely made use of old manuscript sources, we have that one in our show. Itrsquos very interesting to see how he approached his task ndash he had evidence. These are real things, whether he actually changed them or not, we are almost past that now.ldquoI think when you look at it for what it is ndash a lasting interpretation of the remnants of Gaelic poetry ndash then it is fantastic. If you read them, they are incredibly interesting, the characters that are portrayed are fascinating ... the thing that really hit me was that you have a man who goes for himself to investigate these documents. Why did he do this  I doubt it was because he thought it was going to be a best seller.One of the contributors to the show, Dr Domhnall Uilleam Stiugravebhart of Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, believes it is high time for Scotland to move beyond the debate over the ldquoauthenticity of Macphersonrsquos Ossian tales.He said: ldquoYou could talk about it for hours, it is an under-researched part of our own history, which at long last, we can stop being embarrassed about. Put to one side questions of authenticity, and think about how it was put together. It was not just a work of literature, it was seen as a historical document when it was first being produced. It was first produced with footnotes.ldquoMacpherson ushered in an age of romantic nationalism which is still with us. We have never really left that age, and by looking at Macpherson we can fruitfully compare him with other national myths, national epics that were being created, or shall we say recreated, in the th and th centuries, including JRR Tolkienrsquos own attempts to provide the English with national myth in the form of Lord of the Rings.Of the controversy, he added: ldquoIs Macpherson a fraud and a faker ndash or is he perhaps trying to do something possibly a bit more interesting with his own native culture  There is absolutely no doubt, first of all, that he made stuff up.ldquoAt the same time, and we should say that very quickly indeed, he was drawing upon an existing culture of Gaelic, heroic ballads common to both Scotland and Ireland, they date from the middle ages, and they are about Fionn mac Cumhaill and his heroic band, and the defender of Ulster, Cuacutechulainn.Professor Nigel Leask, Regius Chair of English language and literature at the University of Glasgow, says that scholarship suggests Macpherson drew upon about  traditional Fenian ballads ndash that is, medieval and post-medieval heroic ballads in Gaelic relating the feats of Fionn mac Cumhaill and his warrior band the Fianna ndash working from notes of transcriptions made from oral performances and some old Gaelic manuscripts.He added: ldquoBut there was a lot of lsquopaddingrsquo, and his most ambitious long poems Fingal and Temora presented the ballads in the form of epics, modelled on the th centuryrsquos understanding of Homerrsquos Iliad and modern sentimental poetry.Professor Tom Devine, the distinguished historian, has another view of the Macpherson controversy. He notes the tension between the myth that Macpherson was writing, and the reality of Scotland ndash and indeed Britain ndash in the late th century.The stormy epic, godless but noble and ancient, contrasted with a country rapidly gearing up to the Industrial Revolution and, in the Highlands, the Clearances.Devine said: ldquoThe impact of Ossian in Europe was quite extraordinary. Itrsquos dficult now, in the cold light of the st-century day, to think of how the celebrati in Europe were seduced by him. The other aspect is you are dealing with two parallel universes at this time ndash at the same time as this almost fictionalised Highland Scotland was being projected, the break-up of the real traditional society was accelerating rapidly.ldquoOssian was having an impact from the s. And that is the decade when you are beginning to see the rapid commercialisation of Highland society. The s are a real break point in the journey towards modernity in Scotland ... we see the first signs of emigration on a major scale, and the first removals from land at a signicant level. So at the same time as a romanticisation is going on, a quite dferent narrative is occurring at the same time.Devine added that the way Macpherson wrote in the tales suggested ndash sometimes explicitly ndash that Highlanders of the late th century were ldquothe antique past, living in the present, in a way which did not exist anywhere  in Britain, a seductive idea because of the ldquosheer pace of advancing modernity in the UK.The works, too, Leask notes, ldquogave new dignity to Gaelic culture and language that had been crushed in the aftermath of Culloden [in ] and, in a way still seen in modern marketing images for Scottish tourism, ldquocast a romantic light on the rugged mountain landscape, and even turned terrible weather ndash mist and rain ndash into a sublime Ossianic experience, encouraging huge number of tourists to visit the region in the romantic period.Watt notes that the debate over Macpherson and what was authentic and what was his own invention may carry on for many years yet.Stiugravebhart added: ldquoYou can spend your entire time knocking your head against a wall, playing lsquospot the genuine versersquo in Ossian. I am not saying we should move on from that, but I think a more fruitful line of enquiry would be to try to examine and analyse what Macpherson was up to, and beyond that, why at this particular juncture this should be such an attractive literary production, not just for people in Scotland but across the world.ldquoI think the first thing to say about Macpherson is that he didnrsquot work alone. He was the poster boy of a coterie of Scottish enlightenment figures who were interested in Scotlandrsquos past and what that past might tell us about the development of society. So, OK, he was creating literature, but he was also bringing to light these incredibly valuable documents, which illustrated what le might have been like in Scotland, , years before.Macpherson, who died in , perhaps did not help himself.Leask says his original inspiration was existing traditional Scottish and Irish ballads about Fionn mac Cumhaill with which he had been familiar since boyhood in the ceilidh houses of Badenoch, as well as further material he collected in the Highlands and Islands in -.He added: ldquo[The verses] were only lsquoauthenticrsquo in the sense that he had freely adapted traditional Gaelic Fenian poetry ndash it would have been betterhe had admitted as much. He was a dficult and curmudgeonly personality, but made a lot of money from his successful literary career.The Ossian texts are available in current publishing such as Blind Ossianrsquos Fingal, published by Luath Press of Edinburgh.Watt says thata filmmaker adapted the works for the screen, the current general lack of knowledge of Macphersonrsquos works would quickly be overturned. In the meantime, the texts are still available to read ndash Leask says itrsquos best to ldquotry reading it loud, taking long breaths, to capture the flavour of the original.Stiugravebhart added, of reading the often ldquogloomy and morbid works: ldquoYoursquove got to let yourself go, plunge in, and live in the moment. Someit is unreadable, some it isnrsquot. Some of it echoes or gives a foretaste of what other romantic writers, with better reputations, would write over the next two generations.ldquoItrsquos always worth having a go with Ossian, and see what you think.Wild and Majestic: Romantic Visions of Scotland, National Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh, runs from June  until November ."},{"url":null,"title":"headline-to-come","story":"WHEN she talks about her fatherrsquos long and tortured last days her voice begins to crack. It is only when she gets on to who she blames for killing him and failing her and her family that it regains a steely edge.Justine Gordon-Smith holds the Scottish and UK Governments responsible. For their failure, not just to properly compensate for infecting their dad with the blood products which would finally kill him, but virtually abandoning him and his complex needs and leaving her and her sister to provide round-the-clock care as he became more and more ill.Justine is one of four girls, two of her sisters live away, so it was left to her and her sister Rto look after their father Peter in Edinburgh as he deteriorated from a caring and funny man to a bedridden one they could barely recognise. All four were at his bedside when he died and she can be precise about it ndash it was .pm on July , just  days, she notes, after the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service, which infected him, opened its ldquoshiny new pound million building in the Heriot Watt Centre.Peter Gordon-Smith was a well-known figure on the Scottish music and entertainment scene, a musician and primarily double bass player ndash he backed Shirley Bassey and others ndash and he managed night clubs, worked at the Citizensrsquo Theatre in Glasgow under the legendary Iain Cuthbertson, even managed a youth hostel in the Edinburgh.ldquoHe was a very outgoing man. He loved a yarn and a funny story. He could charm anyone, she recalls. ldquoHe was a very talented musician and he was also very handsome.Peter was a haemophiliac. ldquoWhen we were young I remember him having the odd bleed and he would go to hospital for a few days. But it was manageable. ldquoYou were always very conscious of it and how an injury would affect him.It was in  that Peter was told he was infected with the Hepatitis C virus, although he was not told how he got it or when. It is clear, however, from his medical records that he received clotting agents Factor VIII and cryoprecipitate produced by the transfusion services Protein Fractionation Centre and administered by the Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh, the RIE.ldquoHe was absolutely outraged when he was told. There was a distinct lack of information about how he became infected. Dad looked into suing the hospital, but that didnrsquot go ahead.Justine, like all the core participants in the new inquiry, has had to sign a non-disclosure agreement ndash in case information at this stage might prejudice future legal chargesanyone is held responsible ndash but she is determined not to be completely silenced.For  years, from when he was told about the infection which would finally kill him, the family received no help or compensation. In  the UK Government set up and funded three charities ndash while refusing to admit liability ndash one of which was the Skipton Fund.ldquoAround that time R found out about it in a newspaper article and we applied to Skipton. Peter subsequently received pound, as well as pound a quarter. The money was used to do up his house, just a stones throw from the Scottish Parliament.Justine, a filmmaker, who was brought up in Edinburgh with sister R, had been living in London but in  ed to pursue a doctorate at Edinburgh University in film and geography. She and R were shortly to become their dadrsquos full-time carers.ldquoHe had been badly beaten in the  and spent a long time in the RIE in . He developed what they call an inhibitor - the clotting agents were facing increasing resistance - and he would turn over in bed and bleed, or opening the door, even shaking hands.In  he developed sores in his legs which refused to heal. In that same year he had a fall in the bath, which led to him developing even more resistance to clotting. At the beginning of  Justine asked the hospital to perform a liver test on Peter. It revealed cancer.ldquoWe used to call him the Comeback Kid, he was so stoic, but this time he said lsquoIrsquove finally hit the buffersrsquo, she recalled.Skipton awarded Peter a further pound,.In May  he was told the cancer was terminal and there would be no further treatment. He was put on steroids and other drugs. ldquoUp until he took the steroids he was a lovely dad. As soon as he took them he went.Justine and her R were now alternating carers. She says she was repeatedly told she was ineligible for carers allowance because she was a student and was unable to work. Later, the sisters were given  hours a week assistance.Peter tried to kill himself in July, taking a massive overdose. After an alert, because the part-time carer couldnrsquot get in, Justine rushed to the house. Her father was saved.ldquoHe was put on fentanyl [a powerful opioid]. This strange creature then appeared who was not our dad, Justine recalls.There was a second suicide attempt in September ndash ldquoGod knows how many Tramadol he took ndash and again he was brought out of it.ldquoThat was the only time I saw him as my dad again. He was so angry he wasnrsquot dead. He didnrsquot want to be alive.Justine and R installed a drug safe in the house so he couldnt try that method again, but he was later to attempt it a third time by stabbing himself. She adds, on the verge of tears again, ldquoWe had become his jailers and his prisoners.After the sisters had taken turns on seven-nights-a-week suicide watch without any support they were given a carer for three nights.ldquoEventually we got seven nights a week, but only when Dad was so frail he required double staffing, but we got at least to sleep in our own beds, Justine says.In  the Scottish Government set up the Scottish Infected Blood Support Scheme which replaced the Skipton and other charities. While it makes payments to those infected, and to partners and dependent children, non-dependent children, carers like Justine and R, donrsquot qualy.ldquoHow can you say itrsquos generous  Why doesnrsquot the government just hold up its hand like the Republic of Ireland The Irish Government has paid out over euro billion in compensation, with the average award euro,.ldquoMy sister lost twenty-one thousand pounds from not working and Irsquom about seventy thousand out of pocket, she says.But itrsquos not about money, itrsquos about justice. ldquoI am outraged at the way our father, our family and other victims and their families have been treated. I hear of cases on a daily basis that makes my soul weep.

More than % of respondents supported the plans.The plans have been at the centre of controversy after some womens groups, backed by several prominent SNP MSPs and MPs, say the new legislation could put womens spaces at risk.They claim that predatory men could access womens refuges, toilets and other facilities.Now transgender and non-binary Scots have spoken out about their disappointment following Sommervilles announcement on Thursday.Emily Frood, a trans woman from Edinburgh, said: \"Irsquom ashamed, disappointed, and incredibly upset by the actions the Scottish Government have taken this week in relation the GRA reform.\"Trans and non-binary people in Scotland have been let down.\"The Scottish Government has suggested reforming the GRA in a frankly half-arsed capacity. I would rather a broken manesto promise of not getting the reform implemented by , than have a pathetic reform that includes a not fully self-declaratory method, fails to include  and  year olds as eligible, and completely ignores the validation and recognition of non-binary genders.\"Theyrsquore pandering to a vocal minority of ill-informed and bigoted iniduals, many from the within the SNP, who suggest that the rights of trans people have a detrimental effect on the rights of women. This has never been the case.\"Irsquove campaigned on this reform for nearly four years and to see it get ripped to shreds as a result of what comes across as a public pressure from a minority of bigoted people is heartbreaking.Kerry Rush, who is non-binary and from Edinburgh, added: \"To say Irsquom disappointed is an understatement. Irsquom heartbroken, for myself and for the entire trans and non-binary communities. We waited  months to hear from the Scottish government about our rights, or lack thereof. We were led to believe they were working to help usbe legally recognised and instead we received two pitul sentences [In Sommervilles statement].\"Non-binary people are people and deserve to live and love as part of wider society with the same rights and privileges as others. Instead what this so called progressive Scottish government has done is send a message of absolute disrespect and disregard for all non-binary people.\"I exist and I wonrsquot be erased. I will keep fighting for my existence to be recognised.\"One senior SNP source said that the decision to roll back on the manesto pledge is down to \"weak leadership, and the First Minister not having enough control at the top.\"Colin Macfarlane, director at Stonewall Scotland said: \"Now that the government has made this announcement, and it has fallen well short of what we had hoped, they are going to have to show leadership to ensure they tackle transphobic language when they hear it and when they see it, and ensure it is called out. \"Trans people have had their lives put under the microscope now for the past  months, so it is the governmentrsquos duty of care now to ensure that that rhetoric is dialled down while we go through yet another consultation.\"Cabinet Secretary for Equalities Shirley-Anne Somerville said: ldquoWe know that some in the trans community will be feeling a sense of deep disappointment at what they see as a lack of progress on trans rights. I want to reassure them that the Scottish Government is committed to reforming the  Act and to removing unnecessary barriers for trans people to live in their true gender. We are committed to doing so during the current parliamentary session.ldquoHowever, it is important for that reform to be passed with strong support from across the Chamber and wider society. So we want to move forward but we also want to achieve consensus where possible.ldquoThe debate about the rights of transgender people is becoming very polarised and we all have a part to play in reducing tensions and encouraging respectful debate. Everyone has a responsibility to unite against transphobia, just as we do against homophobia and any other form of prejudice and discrimination."},{"url":null,"title":"how-toy-story-revolutionised-animation","story":"The studiorsquos st feature- film, Toy Story , was released two days ago, and though manynot most reviews were highly positive, some critics thought the series had come to a fitting end with its predecessor, Toy Story .ldquoWoody and Co will have you sobbing like a baby, ran the headline in one review in a national newspaper last week, the reviewer being hugely impressed with the filmrsquos emotional impact and with the ldquothought and care that Pixar was ldquostill prepared to lavish on [its] crown-jewel franchise.ldquoSame fun, same charm ndash but now we need to let go, was the headline above another review, the critic noting that while the film is ldquosprightly, sweet-natured and gorgeous to look at it was ldquofundamentally repeating itself.It seems all but certain, however, that Toy Story , which propels Woody, Buzz and the rest of the toys headlong into a new adventure, will become Pixar Animation Studiosrsquo fourth  billion-grossing film.When the first Toy Story made its bow, back in , it was immediately seen as a great leap forward in animation ndash the worldrsquos first computer animated feature film.It was \"a monumental landmark in animation history\", writes Stephen Cavalier in his authoritative guide, The World History Of Animation. \"It is the seismic moment when [director] John Lasseter and Pixar proved to the world that it was possible to make fully-developed, sympathetic characters with human personalities through computer animation.\"Toy Story was a box-office smash, an instant classic, and a film that took its audience ndash adults and children alike ndash seriously. It was nominated for three Oscars, with Lasseter himself being presented with a Special Achievement Academy Award.ldquoSuddenly, writes Cavalier, ldquothe rush was on for computer-animated features.The rush became a torrent, with ious Hollywood animation studios getting in on an increasingly lucrative trend in film-making and opening a new chapter in the history of animation, a history in which key moments had ranged from early Disney classics to works by influential figures as erse as Tex Avery, Ray Harryhausen and Stirling-born Norman McLaren.Today, the list of top-earning animation movies on the Box Office Mojo website is headed by such films as Incredibles  , Finding Dory, Shrek , The Lion King, Toy Story , Frozen, Finding Nemo, The Secret Le Of Pets, Despicable Me , and Inside Out. Merchandising tie-ins and DVD sales have also been hugely profitable.In , the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences launched a new Oscar category, for Animated Feature Film. The first winner was DreamWorks Animationrsquos Shrek, followed in successive yea rs by Spirited Away, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Wallace  Gromit in The Curse Of The Were-Rabbit, Happy Feet, Ratatouille, WALL-E, Up, Toy Story , Rango, Brave, Frozen, Big Hero , Inside Out, Zootopia, Coco, and Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse. Of these  winners, no fewer than half were products of Disney Pixar.Animated films have become increasingly sophisticated in terms of their storylines. Again, Disney Pixar has blazed an adventurous trail, giving the world films about a lonely little robot cleaning up a ruined Earthan elderly widower who tethers balloons to his house in order to embark on one last adventurethe control centre of the mind of an -year-old girland a young Mexican boy stranded in the Land of the Dead .There was also that remarkably daring scene in Toy Story  when for a few minutes the toys resigned themselves to be an appalling fate, in a trash-incinerating facility. This, observed Empire film magazine, was ldquoa scene of such intense, exquisite end-of-the-line poignancy mdash also the scariest moment of the whole [Toy Story] series mdash that it deserves comparison with Snow Whitersquos terried forest flight, or the shooting of Bambirsquos mother.Indeed, much has been made of the emotional palette of the best animated films, and of the \"le lessons\" that can be learned from them. \"Negative feelings are perfectly okay\" is one such, gleaned from Inside Out. Bereavement and grief were powerful impulses in Up.The software used in the making of the films has steadily grown more sophisticated, too.Asnoted this week, the first Toy Story film, in addition to being a critical and box-office success, also helped Pixar to win an ldquoanimation arms race, with visual effects going on to become a staple of blockbuster films. The crucial weapon in all of this, the paper added, is RenderMan, a software tool that enables film-makers to create photorealistic computer images.Toy Story  was made on an updated version of RenderMan, using ray tracing, which, says the , allows animators to achieve granular detail on light shading.Rob Redman, editor of D World  D Artist, is quoted as saying: ldquoThe outdoor scenes in Toy Story  are really where it comes into its own. You get the blues and greens where the sky is bouncing off the floor: it makes everything feel lush and vibrant. \"Realistic\" is not quite the word, but it does feel more real. The textures feel more believable.The Spectatorrsquos film critic, Jasper Rees, concurs. ldquoThe animation now has such a painterly exactness it may as well be real rain stubble tarmac up there on screen, he writes.And while Hollywood may dominate the world of animated movies itrsquos important to remember the influential work of, for example, Studio Ghibli, which is based in Tokyo.It has made a succession of strikingly beautul films, from Spirited Away and My Neighbour Totoro to Howlrsquos Moving Castle and Princess Mononoke.The Red Turtle, a superb animated fantasy ndash a French Japanese production \"presented by Ghibli\" ndash was described in the following terms by the prominent critic, Mark Kermode: ldquoA poignant, wordless tale of a man shipwrecked on a desert island, it boasts a sublime simplicity that unies its complex elements into a singular, universal voice.\"Eloquent, profound and moving, it left me with a heart full of bittersweet joy, a head dizzy with dreamy visions and cheeks wet from tears that rolled like waves on a distant beach.INCOMINGTHE big US studios have an impressive slate of animated films in the pipeline over the next few years. Some of them are sequels, taking the themes of the original hit film and exploring them further.Disneys Frozen , the long-awaited follow-up to s Frozen, the biggest-grossing animated musical of all time, will be in cinemas this winter.Pixar has two films due out next year: Onward , about two teenage elf brothers \"who embark on an extraordinary quest to discoverthere is still a little magic left out there\" and the newly-announced Soul, which will debut next June .

This could take the form of increased headage payments under the existing beef calf support scheme.The SBA, along with NFU Scotland and other industry stakeholders, have been pressing Mr Ewing on the issue and SBA chairman, Neil McCorkindale, was hoping for an announcement by the Cabinet Secretary at the event.This didn’t materialise but Mr Ewing indicated he was sympathetic to the plea and accepted the argument that headage payments would be a more effective approach than area based support which would simply encourage inertia in the industry.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Owners Jonny and Ali Aspden\"  Popular Ellon coffee shop extends opening hoursviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Aby Wilson, Stuart Wood, Elaine Lownds, George Laing, and Director Nicola Alexander of Bethan Customs Consultancy\"  Oldmeldrum start-up doubles team viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"garioch sc launches new children s activities programme","story":"Garioch Sports Centrethis week announced that it islaunching GSCkids, a new programme of children#s activities, in a bid to make children#s activities more accessible in the local area.Launching on Wednesday, August , children will still be able to enjoy their favourites, including additional football classes, and some new additions including Junior Boxercise.GSC will also be offering preschool gymnastics classes in partnership with Donside Gymnastics for the very first time.Sandra Simpson of Donside Gymnastics commented: “We’re delighted to be launching five brand new preschool gymnastics classes at Garioch Sports Centre. “Classes are suitable from .- years old and are the \u2028perfect pathway into our school-age gymnastics programme.”Garioch Sports Centre’s Kevin Bonarius, chief operating officer, added: ‘The aim of GSCkids is to provide a safe and inclusive environment for local children and their families and carers to enjoy active lestyles while having fun.“Our doors are open to children of all ages and abilities.

This year local Scottish Fire and Rescue team will once again have a fire engine at the clinic to help draw attention to the clinic.Councillor Drever added: #The safety checks are carried out by a specially trained Good Egg Safety expert, not police officers # so people should not feel they are at risk of getting into trouble.“Rather it#s an opportunity to get some reassurance that your car seat is compatible with your vehicle, and to get tips and advice on any adjustments that would improve the car seat’s performance. We#d urge anyone who drives children about # whether that#s childminders, grandparents and parents or wider friends – to drop into the clinic. It is five or ten minutes of your time well spent.”The Good Egg Safety Child Seat clinic will be held in the Tesco car park in Kirkwall on Wednesday July , running from am to pm. There#s no need to book — just look for the Good Egg rep in the Tesco foyer, or head for the red fire engine.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Providing practical training for riders where they can improve their skills and understanding of risks through controlled exercises is a vital part of this strategy.“Motorcyclists are vastly over-represented in serious road injuries, so I hope that Orkney’s motorcyclists will take up this opportunity to both become a safer road user and improve their overall riding experience through better bike handling skills.”Anyone interested in attending the course should email: operationriderrefinement@scotland.pnn.police.ukcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Not content with writing just one book, he decided to author two: one will be the scuttle story in photographs, From Scuttle to Salvage, which will be launched this Thursday, June . The  other, The Last Days of the High Seas Fleet, is the more in depth story of the German Naval mutiny, and how the Fleet came to be interned in Scapa. Both are on sale at the Orcadian Bookshop.As with Jutland, Nick decided to tell the story in film. He is passionate about passing history on to his childrens’ generation, and says he felt that this would be a best way of reaching younger people who prefer video to text. The -minute animation has already been seen by more than , people online, and was made possible through crowdfunding and the help of numerous museums and archives, the Kirkwall Library and Archives being among them.Nick will be talking about the scuttle on June  at pm at the St Magnus Centre, where with him, many of the descendants will participate. He’ll also talk at Stromness Academy on Monday June , and at Kirkwall Grammar School that afternoon.

Admirers of the high art of comedy may be familiar with an especially brilliant sketch written and performed by David Mitchell and Robert Webb. The pair – dressed in Germany army unorms – are on a World War Two battlefield, preparing an attack. Webb’s character, puffed up and confident, puts down a field telephone, and declares, “They’re coming. Now we’ll see how these Russians deal with a crack SS ision.”As distant gunfire echoes, Mitchell’s character approaches, nervously clears his throat, and begins, “Hans…”“Have courage, my friend,” says Webb’s alpha.“Yeah, eh, Hans, I’ve just noticed something,” comes the reply.“These communists are all cowards.”“Have you looked out our caps, recently ” asks Mitchell’s beta.“Our caps ”“The badges on our caps, have you looked at them ”“What  No… a bit.”With an anguished look on his face, Mitchell’s character continues, “They’ve got skulls on them. Have you noticed that our caps have actually got little pictures of skulls on them ”“I don’t, um…”“Hans,” Mitchell’s soldier continues, tentatively, “…are we the baddies ”There is more to come and I urge you,you haven’t seen it, to seek out the sketch, online. It is masterful stuff that endures almost  years after it was first broadcast on the double act’s BBC Two sketch show.Perhaps what makes this sketch so timeless, beyond the excellence of the performances, is that it captures something with which we can all identy. Which of us hasn’t, at some crucial point in our lives, been stricken by a moment of crushing self-doubt  Which of us hasn’t wondered whether, maybe, we are in the wrong I watched the sketch again last week and it occurred to me that it could not be more relevant, right now.Self-examination has never been so unfashionable uncertainty is a weakness to be deplored . Among the political classes, absolute certainty must be maintained, even in the face of crushing evidence that destroys one’s assertions.Think of the bluster of former SNP leader, Alex Salmond, who led the war against nuance during ’s independence referendum campaign. Any dficult question about how he might oversee the break-up of the UK was dismissed by Salmond as part of a “Project Fear” campaign designed to terry voters who might not have believed independence to be in Scotland’s best interests. Salmond’s aggressive reaction to legitimate inquiry created a culture in the Yes campaign where the done thing was not to consider the question but to question the motives of the questioner. After all, since we could be certain that independence would be a very good thing with no downsides, anyone who suggested otherwise must have had malice in their hearts. Of course Scotland would retain its EU membership after voting Yes, insisted Salmond, in the face of remarks from the EU that contradicted him. Of course an independent Scotland would enter into a currency union with what was left of the UK, despite assurances from the then chancellor and his Westminster shadows that no such arrangement would or could take place. Of course Scotland, standing proudly alone, would be wealthy and prosperous, even though the price of North Sea oil – on which this assertion was based – was plummeting.This absolute certainty infected the Yes campaign which, often, mistook angry shouting for debate and went on to discover that it needed more than blind faith to persuade a majority of Scots to support the independence project.A year later, as Donald Trump ramped up his campaign to become American President, dangerous certainty reached a new, even more disturbing level. Evidence of Trump’s misdeeds – things like film and audio recordings and paperwork that, by any standard, proved he was unsuitable for the role he sought – was rejected by the candidate as “fake news” and his supporters, so utterly convinced that Trump would make good on his promise to “make America great again”, accepted his words as truth. To question Trump’s claims was to be a traitor.And in , the same characterisation of doubt as weakness proved invaluable to Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson as they bluffed their way to victory in the referendum on EU membership. Their every proclamation about “freedom” and “sovereignty” was accepted, without question, by their disciples. Self-reflection can be a painful business it’s hardly surprising that we are so uncomfortable about doing it. It’s so much easier to blame a former partner for the break down of a relationship than it is to consider whether our own behaviour might have played its part. It’s comforting to think that we missed out on a promotion because the interviewer had it in for us rather than because, maybe, another candidate was better suited. Over recent weeks, we’ve listened as contenders to become the next leader of the Conservative Party and, by extension, Prime Minister of the UK, have set out their “plans” to achieve Brexit where Theresa May failed. With the honourable exception of Rory Stewart, whose decision to engage with reality rather than to rely on fantasy ruled him wholly unsuitable for the \u2028job, these men relied on loud declarations of certainty to maintain their campaigns.The final two candidates – Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt– are still at it. They’re still telling us they can get a new deal out of the EU, even as the EU insists the withdrawal agreement struck with Theresa May is the only one available.Hunt and Johnson – or, more accurately, the parade of lickspittle MPs who have appeared in the media in his stead while he hides from scrutiny –continue to assert, with bullet-proofed certainty, that they have plans to make a success of Brexit when all the evidence says that they damned well do not.The certainty of politicians comes with a large dollop of nauseating moral superiority on top.

OK, yes it isspeeding.Surely the issue is appropriate speed # like doing  mph when there are pedestrians or next to schools, built up areas, where there is a limit etc Kat is so right to complain about dangerous driving.It has become an unwanted fad amongst young menwho must be so stupid and so bored that they are prepared to risk le and limbto get their kicks. My belief is that the pointless and brainless cavortings of silly,silly moronic types on programmes like Top Gear are partly to blame.In addition , street racing in cities like London take place late at night driving people to distraction.Police keep an eye on proceedings but it still goes on. Not easy for police cars to safely keep up with idiots in illegally souped up cars travelling , as reported, at  mph.I understand people that have the need for speed. But keep in mind, just because you think you#re a confident driver, that you are safe because you can drive. Doesn#t mean you#re safe. Just recently there was a news report about a drunk driver going off the road and hitting another car. If you#re going at a high speed and that thing comes at you, what can you do  Swerve  There#s a good chance you#re dead, in hospital or best case scenario, your car is totalled.Just because you think you#re a competent driver, doesn#t mean everyone  is. Drive safe.Of course, accidents do happen even to competent,confident, safe drivers but there are people who cast aside such standards in favour of dangerous, unlawful behaviour.These are the ones who need to be severely apprehended.Try to be less pedantic when reading comments.Johan, youseemto have missed the point of Kat’s letter.Nobody has said that overtaking is illegal or wrong but It was estimated that the Audi was travelling at around  to  mph. An offence.In addition , about six or more cars were overtaken in one fell swoop.Not advisable by any stretch of the imagination. Suppose there had been a need to suddenly pull in due to an unforeseen hazard.Something would have had to give , possibly causingan accident.My father used to say to me when I was learning to drive “ always drive asother drivers are stupid”.In short, drive defensively NOT offensively.It seems to me that the Audi driver falls into the stupid category.Better to be ten minutes late in this world than fty years too early in the next.Have you seen this stretch of road  It is the only place in Shetland where there is a lane for overtaking # that is two lanes going up a hill.Very often you are overtaking quite a few things even at  mph going up because of slow things and other cars not overtaking.Unless she actually had a speed gun she cannot judge the speed of things. I regularly see traffic pouring down Herrislea hill and I know that although it looks fast, some of them are actually sticking to the  mph limit.I maintain that it’s better to be safe than sorry.Ease off and keep the undertaker waiting !! Or,you feel so inclined, speed up and become a statistic.Your choice.You need a fair few horses to go up some of our hills at  mph. She is right in that respect, it would need to be a #sporty blue audio or similar#.Johan, I’ve driven on the roads of Shetland and I can’t recall any that could be called steep.Gentle slopes maybe but nothing to compare with the really steep roads of Scotland and Wales. Even England has some pretty steep examples in the Lake District.The sharpest inclines I’ve experienced in Shetlandare on Foula.I doubt that quad bikes would be much use on the hills though I have seenthem being driven on the low level road.It would be interesting to gauge why people bought a certain model of vehicle in proportion to its top speed, and whether or not this was a deciding factor  The power of an engine could be compared as well  How often would the said person go well over the speed limit just to test the engine or impress a passenger in the vehicle with them regardless of any safety  If a vehicle can do  # mph, why would this be allowed  Why would there not be a limiter to say mph installed If the law allows such vehicles to be sold, why would this be the case Good questionI think more and more there will be speed limiters on cars and insurance companies and Companies already want these.Johan,The EU has already sorted this one for us.Thanks MHJ. Electric self charging cars available by then too I would think.It’s an attractive and interesting idea Johan but I doubt that such a short time scale will see the hope come to fruition.Predictions do not suggest that the high cost of EV manufacture will reduce for quite some time to make such purchases viable in the immediate future.Motor production is going through an increasingly lean time and it seems unlikely to me that the decline will bounce back into the black by trying to incrrease the sales of expensive electric cars.

A deep free-kick headed back across goal fell invitingly for Oates to clinically drill the ball home, before another quick counter-attack saw Daniel Simpson fire home after Lee Gale’s shot had been blocked.Their misery was complete when a long ball pumped forward saw Swanson misjudge, allowing Oates to complete his hat-trick at the second attempt.Shetland manager Kevin Main said after the match that he was #sick of hard luck stories this week#.#It was an extremely competitive match and one we were expecting. They won this competition two years ago, we watched that final and they’re a physically strong bunch of boys#.Despite the defeat, Main#s players can be proud of their exploits and he added: #“It#s been an absolutely incredible week.#It#s been full of full of highs#.This fourth place finish represents Shetland#s best footballing performance at an island games since winning the gold medal at the home games in . raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"shetland footballers lose in anglesey football tournament semi finals ","story":"Shetland keeper Grant Wood saves well to keep out an attack.

whose heart-breaking stories include being tied to a fence and being left by the side of the road - are now ready to find their forever homes thanks to some much-needed TLC by the team at the rehoming centre on Teeshan Road. Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre. Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers. We are so thankful that all four of these dogs were found when they were.“Grace and Bliss were very shaken up by their ordeal when they came into our care and it took them a couple of days to build trust around people again. We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health. Sally is incredibly sweet natured, and just like the others, will make a wonderful addition to the right home.“We are not sure why there has been a recent influx in dogs being abandoned. We always remind people that ‘A Dog is for Le®’ but we understand that le happens, and places like Dogs Trust are there to support any dog owner who experiences a bump in the road and needs our help. Sometimes the most responsible thing we can do as a dog owner is admit that we aren’t coping with our pets, but it is important to ensure they are kept safe and not left to fend for themselves.”If you are interested in adopting a dog please get in touch with the team at Dogs Trust Ballymena on  or visit www.dogstrust.org.uk our-centres ballymenaAbandoned - SallyCouncil defends warning householder they could face hefty fine over unauthorised Irish language street sign Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"try catch "},{"url":null,"title":"this is how many points you ll get on your licence for these driving offences","story":"Drivers who accumulate  or more penalty points from motoring offences within a three-year period can face a ban from driving for up to six months, while six or more penalty points within two years of passing your driving test can lead to a license withdrawal and a re-test requirement.

As a result of its strategic importance both sides concentrated some of their best armoured regiments and equipment in this area. The Guards Armoured Brigade comprised of three tank battalions and had been set up and trained in England. The three battalions were the nd Battalion of the Grenadier Guards, the st Battalion of the Coldstream Guards and the nd Battalion of the Irish Guards. The Irish Guards were recruited from Northern Ireland and the nd Battalion contained men from the Province. You can see it in the tank commanders names. We have Agnew, Brennan, Carson, Connolly, Healy, Harbinson, Mahoney, McCorkell, McGuire, McHugh and Robinson amongst others.The nd Battalion Irish Guards was equipped with American Sherman tanks. These were  ton Medium tanks and mainly equipped with a  mm gun, a useful weapon against infantry but not entirely satisfactory against tanks. The battalion was organised into sub units. There were three squadrons in the battalion, each composed of four troops and each troop had four tanks. The Irish Guards named their tanks after towns and the nd Squadron named theirs with B’s. So we have Ballina, Bangor, Bantry, Belfast, Benbane and Ballynahinch. We also have Ballyraggett and BallymenaBallymena was a special Sherman tank. Ballymena did not have the standard  mm gun. The inconvenient truth for the Allied tank crews was that their tanks were not as good as the best of German ones. A German Tiger tank, for example could destroy a Sherman tank at a distance of over a mile. A Sherman on the other hand would be lucky to harm a Tiger at  yards.  The Britsh crews themselves had already concluded that a Sherman tank was not considered as safe a location as many would have been believed. Hence they covered the front with extra metal tracks and the propensity of the Sherman to do a “Ronson”, that is light up, encouraged the crew to get out very quickly.To deal with the stronger German tanks the Allies devised a way of mounting a bigger gun on some of the Shermans. This new gun was so big it meant redesigning the tank and reducing the size of the crew. These Shermans, now armed with a  pounder gun, which referred to the weight of the shell it fired, were nicknamed FireflyThe Irish Guards arrived in Normandy  days after the initial D Day landings. Caen had still not been completely captured so the Irish Guards eere given a mission to help bypass the city of Caen by gaining ground to the east of the city and drive towards the village of Cagny. This was Operation Goodwood, named after the racecourse in England.Undercover of darkness on the night of th July, Ballymena and the other tanks moved over the River Orne on newly constructed bridges and prepared for battle.The smoke, noise and movement of the battlefield created chaos. Units became mixed up and both sides sometimes got lost. This led to one of the most famous incidents of the battle. By the middle of the afternoon of July th the Irish Guard’s assault is under fire, stalled and mud bound outside the village of Cagny. Lt John Gorman of B Squadron th troop commanding a mm armed Sherman called “Ballyraggett” gets slightly ahead of his comrades and spots a German King Tiger at about yrs. Knowing his gun could do little damage to the King Tiger, Lt Gorman chose a dramatic course of action. He had previously briefed his crew Gunner Albert Scholes, Driver James BaronRadio operator Agnew, and told themhe got the chance they would adopt “Navy tactics”. He instructed Baron to drive at full speed ahead and prepare to ram the German tank. Firing a high explosive shell at close range stunned the inexperienced German crew but had little impact on the tank. However, the high speed collision effectively immobilized both tanks. The Sherman and the King Tiger were abandoned and their crews hid in the fields.Lt Gorman realising the King Tiger was still a viable threat ran towards the nearest Sherman Firefly, in the knowledge only a  pounder gun on the Firefly could do any meaningful damage. This was Ballymena. Some of Ballymena’s crew were already either dead or injured but Gorman jumped in and directed fire on the abandoned King Tiger.  The fighting continued for a while but eventually Gorman was able to rescue his own and other crews and get back to safety.For his exploits Gorman - later Sir John - was awarded the Military Cross. Editor’s note: Sir John, who died aged  in May , was a Northern Irish Roman Catholic Unionist with an unflinching sense of service.After the war he joined the Royal Ulster Constabulary before becoming a senior manager with British Overseas Airways Corporation, then head of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. Finally he was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly as the sole Roman Catholic member of the Ulster Unionist Party, and served as Deputy Speaker until the Assemblys suspension in . He was a frequent visitor to Ballymena during his time with the NIHE and he never failed tomention that he had married a Ballymena woman, Norah Caruth. Lady Gorman, passed away peacefully in Ringdufferin Nursing Home in .

At the time it was taken in the iconic Flamingo Ballroom, they were members of local rock’n’blues band, Tailor.The band was formed in the early s by Tucker McIlwee and John Tennant.“Other band members who played with Tailor over the years were Ronnie McAuley, Hubert Dunlop and Ricky Maybin, Henry McQuillan, Dave Moore Trevor Erwin andGerry McNeely. We were transported to and from the gigs by Brian Surgenor, ” says John.“Our first gig was at a place called Betty Staffs in Belfast but we travelled throughout Ireland playing most of the towns on the circuit.“Amazingly, we had never played in Ballymena until Sammy Barr of the Flamingo approached our manager to offer a booking.”It transpired that Tailor were playing on the same bill as Rory Gallagher. As you would expect, the group were excited but, in their own words, ‘not overwhelmed.’John remembers: “We met with Rory and his band during set up,. Rory was a very down to earth guy. We discussed what songs we were going to play as we were going to have a one hour set. The Flamingo was full to the brim, the crowd were electric and Tailor recieved a tremendous welcome.“Following the gig we met with Rory for the photo call. The rest is history. Tailor continued to travel theand breadth of Ireland entertaining the young and not so young ravers until the group members went their seperate ways after six years of traveling on the road.”After years of inaction the group reformed to play two gigs for Cancer research, The Countryman Inn and the Telecom Club were filled to capacity for the night of nostalgia and entertainment. pound was raised for charity.And John ponders: “Will the group do it again  Watch this space!”Rory Gallagherwas an Irish blues and rock multi-instrumentalist,songwriter, and producer.Born in Ballyshannon, County Donegal, and brought up in Cork, Gallagher recorded solo albums throughout the s and s, after forming the band Taste during the late s. His albums have sold over  million copies worldwide.Gallagher received a liver transplant in , but died of complications later that year in London at the age of .He began playing after school with Irish showbands, while still in his early teens. Having completed a musical apprenticeship and influenced by the increasing popularity of beat groups during the early s, Gallagher formed The Taste, which was later renamed simply, Taste, a blues rock and RB power trio, in .Performing extensively in the UK, the group played regularly at the Marquee Club, supporting both Cream at their Royal Albert Hall farewell concert, and the blues supergroup Blind Faith on a tour of North America.After the break-up of Taste, Gallagher toured under his own name. The s were Gallaghers most prolic period. He produced ten albums in that decade, including two live albums, Live in Europe and Irish Tour . November  saw the release of the album Deuce. In the same year he was voted Melody Makers International Top Guitarist of the Year, ahead of Eric Clapton. Though he sold over thirty million albums worldwide, it was his marathon live performances that won him greatest acclaim. He is documented in Irish Tour , a film directed by Tony Palmer.During the heightened periods of political unrest in Northern Ireland, as other artists were warned not to tour, Gallagher was resolute about touring Ireland at least once a year during his career, winning him the dedication of thousands of fans, and in the process, becoming a role model for other aspiring young Irish musicians.

Rory McIlroy, Graeme McDowell and Darren Clarke, who will all now be competing in the tournament, feature in the design, alongside former Open Champion and Portrush man Fred Daly. Engaging the talents of Hollywood digital CGI artist Mike Campau, the tongue-in-cheek stunt has been designed to reflect how Northern is truly ‘Made for Golf’, illustrated not only by our sporting talents but also in our landscapes and rugged coast. The timing of the tribute could not be more fitting as Northern Ireland golfers celebrate their recent triumphs on the course, with Rory McIlroy winning the Canadian Open by seven shots to secure his th PGA Tour title and fellow Northern Irishman Graeme McDowellafter finishing tied eighth on  under.

It is just one of many activities we have planned to celebrate the enormous pride that the people of Northern Ireland have in the achievements of our golfing greats. “While Northern Ireland might one day boast its own ‘Mount Rushmore’ for golf, we can reassure everyone that this stunt is digital theatre and something we hope will raise a smile ahead of July.” Robin Daly, son of the late Fred Daly, said: “Our family are extremely honoured that my father is being remembered in this way. We are really looking forward to theof The Open to our shores for the first time in nearly  years and this sculpture is a wonderful tribute to the talents of these local sportspeople who have earned their place in the history book of golf.” McIlroy and McDowell will tee up at Royal Portrush alongside fellow local and former Open Champion, Darren Clarke, in front of a passionate home crowd when one of the world’s greatest sporting spectacles - The Open - s to the famous Dunluce links for the first time in nearly  years.

Kenneth stands aghast as chants of ‘Greysteel seven, Ireland nil’ rain down from the stands as the match kicks off.Shell-shocked following the match and all that went on during those fraught  minutes, Kenneth brings Ernie home and begins to question what could be his inevitable pathhe doesn’t start making some changes.Lead actor Matthew Forsythe has a total of  roles to portray in this fast, furious and incredibly demanding one-man show. It’s no easy task but each character is brought to le vividly through his tone, his stance and his voice. Even a simple fold of the arms can work wonders, whether’s it’s Kenneth’s ‘keeping up with the Jones’ snooty we Deborah, his boss Gerry, or Wee Ernie, the bitter and wheezing father-in-law.Chris Hunter’s set design is in a sense the only other character beside Kenneth and that too is brought imaginatively and effectively to le. Astro turf gives us our pitch, but it’s the innovative scattering of cardboard boxes that turn into Kenneth’s car, his desk, chair – even the soaring New York skyline – which work to greatest effect. A particularly effective ploy is the backdrop of a distorted mirror showing us, the audience, and inviting us to join Kenneth on his journey of reflection.The play comes  years after the curtain first came up in Dubblejoint’s Whiterock theatre space. It remains as dramatic, funny, poignant, worrying and challenging as it was when it burst into our consciousness all those years ago. The question is, how much has changed outside the theatre A Night in November runs at the Lyric Theatre until June  and will then go on tour.

Parishioners and well-wishers packed into Corpus Christi Church for am Mass as the Springhill congregation came together to give thanks for Fr Des’ dedicated service to the West Belfast community.Parish Priest of Corpus Christi Fr Paddy McCafferty, who celebrated the special service, praised Fr Des’ “immense strength and dedication” within and to the community and said the depths of gratitude felt towards him are “immeasurable.” “Fr Des is a champion of the people, Fr Des saw was needed to be done and did it, he is a man without equal.”“Fr Des co-ordinated, instigated and educated the community. I’m almost lost for words when it comes to describing him. I was looking up the meaning of the word ‘platinum’, it means hard wearing, hard, Fr Des was rock hard in his work for the community. What would people have done without him ”On celebrating his Platinum Jubilee Fr Des said: “I never thought I would get this far.“There were more than  priests ordained the same day as I was, most of them are gone from this world, a mere handful of us laughing about which of us will reach the th birthday first.“What I want to do now, most of all is to thank God for allowing me to live among such good family, friends and neighbours during those years. You taught me what le means you taught me that especially during the bad, sad times. I believe we are seeing the beginning of a renewed Ireland, a renewed Christianity, a renewed city of Belfast – and we are privileged to live in one of the most beautul parts of the city – between the beautul mountain that is full of surprises like the feast of bluebells in the beginning of summer to the snow topped hills in winter, between the sweeping magnicent valley of the Lough and the Lagan,” he said. “This must surely be one of the most beautul places for a city to be in.”Fr Des continued: “This is where I learned the best lessons about le and I am grateful to family, friends, neighbours who taught me and even had great patience when I learned so slowly. I learned how good people show their dignity even during the hardest of times, show it most of all during the hard times. “So I am grateful to God for being here, grateful, to all whom I have had the privilege of being family and neighbour to. And very, very hopeful for the future.“Coming out of the worst of times we could now be facing into the best of times. May God and good people make it so. Father Paddy, like our friend Father Aiden, you are with us all at the beginning of a newly awakened Church and a people refreshed by what they have suffered and achieved together. We have good reason to be thankful for that and for each other.#"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"from detroit to north belfast how a big name does a big job","story":"TO say the name Kronk Boxing Gym is iconic in the sport would be an understatement. Located in Detroit and once led by trainer Emanuel Steward, the name is a household word in the sport of boxing.But North Belfast has its a Kronk Boxing Gym, located in the Duncairn Centre on Duncairn Avenue.Formed as Belfast ABC over  years ago by Bobby McAllister, one of the best coaches in Ireland at the time, the club has come a long way since.In December , former secretary of the gym, Damien McCann, played a pivotal role in Limerick boxer Andy Lee turning pro. He then negotiated a lucrative financial management agreement for Lee to turn professional with Emanuel Steward from the world renowned Detroit Kronk Boxing GymLee was Ireland’s rising amateur boxing star and when he beat USA champion, Jesus Gonzales in the semi-finals of the World Junior Championship, a new relationship between Steward and Kronk in Detroit was born with Belfast ABC gym, hence its name today, Kronk ABC Belfast.Past professional coach Tony Dunlop has been a key figure throughout the history of Kronk ABC Belfast and spoke about the club’s illustrious time.“This place started over  years ago when Bobby McAllister walked past the building which was derelict at the time and thought it would be perfect place for a boxing gym,” he explained.“He asked people in the community who were very positive and said that it would be great for young people in the area.“After a period of time, a lot of kids came through the doors. Ryan Burnettt and Paddy Barnes both started off here.“Burnett was groomed from his early days in here to become a superstar. He left here at  fights undefeated and was one of the best in the world at just  years old.“The turning point I suppose was when Emanuel Steward from Kronk gym in Detroit, which is the best gym in the history of boxing, got in touch.“He saw some of the work we were doing and Belfast Kronk Boxing Gym was born –the rest is history as they say.“We have continued to bring through a lot of champions including professionals James Tennyson and Daniel McShane.“Tommy McCarthy is also here now fighting professional.”Today, the club is going from strength to strength under the stewardship of a new breed of coaches in the shape of Paddy Saunders and Martin McCullough.The duo have embarked on a new programme of coaching young people from North Belfast with the aim of using boxing to their benefit.Tony added: “Paddy Saunders and Martin McCullough are both fantastic coaches. They are flying the flag for Belfast Kronk Gym today.“They have started off a new programme with the youth of the area. They are both giving it a million per cent. I’ve never seen two coaches work as hard. Kronk Gym could not be in better hands.”Classes for - to -year-olds take place every Monday, Wednesday and Friday from .pm to .pm with classes for  years and older from .pm to pm on the same days.Paddy Saunders explained: “Many of the kids have behavioural problems and some suffer from autism.“These classes are an outlet and something to focus and concentrate on.“It is not all about boxing but something for them to do. They don’t miss classes.“If we get a few champions out of it, then brilliant, but it is for the kids.“Most boxing clubs don’t take kids at eight years old, but we do.“All the kids start off exercising and running about the big hall before they come into the boxing gym itself.“They are putting their energy into something positive instead of being on the street and engaging in vandalism and anti-social behaviour. I believe there is a bright future for boxing in North Belfast. We have a top-class facility and there are a lot of good kids in here.”To find out more about the club and to get involved, check out the new Kronk ABC Belfast Facebook page."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"local mla gets brexit safety alert","story":"POLICE have delivered an extraordinary advice list to the West Belfast home of a Sinn Féin MLA suggesting ways in which he can improve his and his family’s personal security post-Brexit.The document has already been delivered to the homes of all  MPs across the United Kingdom, but officers who called to the home of Máirtín Ó Muilleoir said they are widening distribution of the document to take in Brexit spokespersons of parties in the north. The leaflet – headlined ‘When It Goes Too Far’ – outlines steps that politicians should takethey are targeted by extremists in any wave of public unrest that may break out post-October , the latest deadline for the UK leaving the EU.The document – which Mr Ó Muilleoir yesterday branded “Brexit bollox – has been compiled by a number of UK agencies: the National Police Chiefs’ Council, the Crown Prosecution Service, the College of Policing and the Electoral Commission. Despite its wide experience in dealing with public unrest, the PSNI has not been involved in drawing up the guidelines. But local police officers have been tasked with distributing it to MLAs closely connected to the Brexit issue.To the fore in the security advice is what Mr Ó Muilleoir and his family should do in the event of being targeted with a hazardous substance. Police advice is to:• Leave the house and seek fresh air.• Treat itchy or painful skin with water.• Remove outer clothing – but not by pulling it over the head.• Remove any substance that may contact clothing or skin by using a dry absorbent material or brushing it off.Advice is also included on what signs may signal the presence of hazardous substances in the home.The leaflet also advises politicians not to engage with iniduals who may be “stalking harassing” them, either online or offline. It urges them to seek further advice on personal safety and building security from their local police force and to conduct a review of what personal information about them is available online.The leaflet explains that the advice is being forwarded for politicians to consultthey are subjected post-Brexit to “unacceptable levels of harassment and intimidation”. It continues: “In some cases, these behaviours and actions have reached the criminal threshold. The worst examples have led to violence and injury.”The most serious example of Brexit-inspired violence was the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox in June  in West Yorkshire by a gun- and kne-wieldingman holding extreme pro-Britain views. Mr Ó Muilleor said: “It seems preposterous to me that the PSNI is promoting Brexit security advice compiled at the behest of a UK government which for three years has shown itself so thoroughly inept in its handling of the issue. There’s little in this that isn’t already known to most people and no reason why it couldn’t have been emailed to me rather than dispatching a police patrol. There are Catholic families in my South Belfast constituency living under the jackboot of the UVF and the flegger bully-boys. The PSNI would be better advised to protect those folk rather than wasting their time and my time with this Brexit bollox.”"},{"url":null,"title":"9000 in northern ireland apply to secure status after","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

cannot accept alternative arrangements to checks on the border as a replacement for the backstop, the country’s premier has said.Leo Varadkar said he could not accept the deletion of the backstop insurance mechanism from the Withdrawal Agreement unless it had been demonstrated how such arrangements would work in practice to ensure there are no customs checks on the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .A new body of experts has been set up in the UK to look at potential alternative arrangements.Read MoreExtent of Irish north-south cooperation revealed in secret Brexit impact mapping exercise reportFuture PM seeking to delay Brexit would face EU hostility – VaradkarExpert  appointed to advise UK government on alternative arrangements for Irish border after BrexitMany Brexiteers believe technological solutions could replace the backstop. But Mr Varadkar said he could not see evidence of arrangements being outlined before the October  deadline for the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.If there is a no-deal Brexit at the end of October, Ireland will be under an obligation to protect the single market.Leo VaradkarThe Taoiseach made the remarks at the end of an EU summit in Brussels as European Council president Donald Tusk said Brexit would become “more exciting” than before with a change of British prime minister but that the EU’s position had not changed.Mr Varadkar said: “We can’t accept that alternative arrangements are an alternative to a backstop unless we can see what these alternative arrangements are, know how they would work and see them demonstrated.“That hasn’t been done yet and I don’t see that being done this side of October  which is why we certainly can’t accept the deletion of the backstop.”He added: “For us, a deal without a backstop is effectively no deal because it means that there is no legal guarantee we won’t have a hard border, there is no operable mechanism by which we can avoid a hard border, it would just be a case of trying to pull it off, which I don’t think really is much of a solution.”Mr Varadkar said EU leaders had reaffirmed that the Withdrawal Agreement was not open for renegotiation and they agreed that negotiations would only take place between the UK and the EU.But he said the Irish government would have an “obligation” to protect the single market in the event of a no-deal outcome.“If there is a no-deal Brexit at the end of October, Ireland will be under an obligation to protect the single market, it’s our single market, our economy and our jobs are dependent on it,” he said.“We will have to make sure that Ireland doesn’t become the back door to the European single market.”He added that the only way he could see of being sure of avoiding a hard border was through regulatory alignment.Asked about the Tory leadership race, Mr Varadkar highlighted that both of the candidates, who remain in the running to become prime minister, had voted for the Withdrawal Agreement.He said he looked forward to holding a meeting with the new prime minister and discussing potential changes to the Political Declaration.But he reiterated that there would be “no implementation period for the UKthere is no Withdrawal Agreement and there will be no Withdrawal Agreementthere’s no backstop”."},{"url":null,"title":"22 northern ireland schools could close because

However, the -page mapping exercise gives an insight into the extent we could be impacted.The scope of areas highlighted is broad and includes everything from health, travel, waterways, animal movement and organised crime and drugs to benefit fraud, schooling, library provision and teacher and doctor qualications.For each of the  sectors, the document species the extent to which it is underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement as well as by existing EU legal and policy frameworks.In the case of the North West Cancer Centre, the report points out that the initiative was based on an intergovernmental agreement between Health Ministers from both jurisdictions.It says the centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, which opened in November , \"offers radiotherapy services closer to home for many patients from the north west, reducing their travel time signicantly\".Similarly, the All-Island Congenital Heart Disease Network is identied as ensuring that \"vulnerable children\" receive treatment on the island of Ireland. The network has a single surgical centre in Dublin and a specialist childrens cardiology centre in Belfast, supported by cardiology expertise in local hospitals. There is also cross-border cooperation on organ and tissues transplants. Nineteen areas are linked to the avoiding a hard border objective and include everything from customs and physical checks on live animals crossing the border to rules on movement of national treasures.Current EU rules \"stop national treasures from leaving the country and prevent illicit trafficking and looting\". Other less obvious areas mentioned in the report include the operation of cross-border taxis repatriation of waste and cross-border movement of waste, and even the management of Lough Erne eel stocks.It also species areas such as invasive alien species, chemicals regulation and wildfire initiatives.DUP MEP Diane Dodds said that in the majority of areas ongoing cross-border cooperation would be addressed by retaining the common travel area and pursuing an agreement on free trade and customs. \"In many cases, where frameworks are highly integrated, the circumstances are not unique to our province,\" she said.\"For instance the conditions required to operate both the Enterprise service between Dublin and Belfast and the Channel Tunnel will require a very similar technical agreement with Brussels. Genuine concerns in areas like agri-food and healthcare must be taken seriously.\"Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard said an expert  is not needed to show how disastrous a no-deal Brexit will be. He said: \"The British Government has now convened a  of experts to determine the impact of a no-deal Brexit on the North. \"It neednt have bothered as a range of experts have already given dire warnings of the disastrous impact a no-deal Brexit will have on the Norths economy, our rights and the Good Friday Agreement.\" Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington said the documents were part of \"initial scoping work\" by the Government, supported by the Civil Service here, the European Commission and the Republic.Mr Lidington said they were intended to form the basis of discussion and not final products.

Deputy Leader of the DUP Nigel Dodds, Boris Johnson and DUP Party leader Arlene Foster \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"   Deputy Leader of the DUP Nigel Dodds, Boris Johnson and DUP Party leader Arlene Foster Mr Johnson addressed the DUP annual party conference in Belfast last November.However, Mr Robinson told the BBC’s Sunday Politics show that his party has good relationships with most of the candidates.Youd be amazed at how many people in the House of Commons want to build a relationship with usDUP MP Gavin Robinson“You’d be amazed at how many people in the House of Commons want to build a relationship with us , and we do have good relationships with almost all of the candidates that were seeking to be on the paper to succeed as Conservative leader, and the same is true of Jeremy Hunt,” he said.Mr Johnson earlier this year voted for Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit Withdrawal Deal – which the DUP opposed – despite earlier saying he would not back it.“It clearly contradicted what he had said previously where he had given clear indications that he doesn’t like the backstop and indeed he has reiterated those since, I think there was a quest within the Conservative ranks to get this done in the belief that evenyou were to vote for the Withdrawal Agreement, you could change it afterwards,” Mr Robinson said.“We saw the flaw in that approach at the time so we didn’t back the Withdrawal Agreement because we believed once the structures of the agreement were affirmed, it would be very dficult to change those structures. Boris Johnson now accepts that’s the right case.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Conservative party leadership candidate Jeremy Hunt “I think he recognises our concerns, he sees that a border down the Irish Sea – as does Jeremy Hunt – both recognise that sort of a border, that impediment to trade between one part of the United Kingdom and another, or indeed the insistence from the European Union they should have any say in interrupting the internal affairs of this country is wrong.“So the position they have adopted through this campaign, and previously, is positive from a unionist perspective.”Turning to a future deal under which the UK will leave the EU, Mr Robinson said his party will continue to use its influence to press for the protection of the union.“They are a long way from delivering a deal andwe are involved in discussions with them and advocating our position to them, we’ll be making sure that no outcome is going to be detrimental to this union we cherish,” he said.Meanwhile, Mr Robinson said the wait to find out who will be the next prime minister will not stop the ongoing political talks in Northern Ireland to restore powersharing government.“We approach the talks positively, we want to see a resolution and a re establishment of the institutions at Stormont, we think Northern Ireland as a society benefits from having a democratically elected, locally accountable decision making process,” he said.“We want to see that now and when a deal is right, a deal will be done.“The engagement you could say starts and stops, but there is a level of productivity now where I think the engagement is sincere. “That doesn’t mean that all the issues are resolved, and you’ll have heard other commentary which suggests they are not, but the willingness I think is there and the prize to have a restoration of the Executive is there to be achieved provided you get an outcome which is fair, which is proportionate, which is balanced.”"},{"url":null,"title":"future pm seeking to delay brexit would face eu hostility varadkar","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The time for that has long since passed.”Mr Varadkar had a meeting with the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier on Thursday morning, at which, the Taoiseach said, the pair agreed that the Withdrawal Agreement would not be reopened but that they were willing to consider amendments to the joint Political Declaration.And he warned: “There’s no Withdrawal Agreement without a backstop and there’s no implementation period without a Withdrawal Agreement.”Two years on after the first round of #Brexit negotiations: good discussion with An Taoiseach @LeoVaradkar, @HMcEntee and their team today on Brexit 🇪🇺🇮🇪 pic ybCkhoJUFV— Michel BarnierJune , Mr Barnier, writing on Twitter, said the pair had a “good discussion”.Of the remaining three Tory leadership hopefuls, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said the EU “would be willing to renegotiate” a Brexit deal, and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has said he would delay Britain’s departurehe was on the cusp of deal.Front-runner Boris Johnson has said it is essential the UK leaves on October , and suggested the Irish backstop issues could be solved during the implementation period.Earlier, Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte said the next prime minister needs to realise a no-deal Brexit would be bad for the UK.He told BBC Radio ’s Today programme: “With a hard Brexit, even with a normal Brexit, the UK will be a dferent country.I would say a hard Brexit is a hard Brexit.

It is unavoidable.”And he said there could not be a transition perioda Withdrawal Agreement was not in place, telling the BBC: “As Boris Johnson would say, Brexit is Brexit.“I would say a hard Brexit is a hard Brexit. I don’t see how you can sweeten it.”Nigel Dodds claimed Mr Rutte’s remarks were “utterly uninformed and careless” and saidthe Dutch PM and other EU leaders want to protect the peace process in Northern Ireland “then they will not impose a deal which all unionists in Northern Ireland reject”.The DUP’s Westminster leader said: “The Republic of Ireland’s prime minister has been to the fore in feeding emotionally charged but inaccurate information to his fellow EU heads of government.The desire for murder is not driven by pro-EU sentiments or anti-Brexit sentiments but by a deep sectarian hatred of BritishnessNigel Dodds, DUP“From photocopying and distributing -year-old border bomb stories to repeatedly twisting the Belfast St Andrews Agreements for his own political ends, Leo Varadkar has painted a wildly inaccurate picture for the EU about Northern Ireland and theborder.“London, Brussels and Dublin have all confirmed that even in a no-deal scenario, there would be no hard border. Therefore the comments by Mark Rutte today were utterly uninformed and careless.“Mr Rutte may not realise, but only  days ago the same republican terrorist ideology which bombed the border checkpoints  years ago, attempted to murder a police officer in Belfast.“The desire for murder is not driven by pro-EU sentiments or anti-Brexit sentiments but by a deep sectarian hatred of Britishness.“If Mr Rutte and his fellow EU leaders really want to protect the peace process in Northern Ireland, then they will not impose a deal which all unionists in Northern Ireland reject.“They will work for a sensible deal which everyone can support.“Building a new border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom would run absolutely contrary to the Belfast Agreement.”"},{"url":null,"title":"half of northern ireland population neither unionist nor nationalist survey says","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We asked for the document, face-to-face, in April and July . Despite the publication of a technical explanatory note in December , we did not get the full story until this week, after it was obtained by a member of the public through a Freedom of Information request.The document, which we have now published, lists  areas of le in Northern Ireland that could be impacted by Brexit.It demonstrates very clearly that the residents of Armagh were right to be concerned, as many areas of co-operation are \"not underpinned or linked\" to an EU law but listed because of their link to the Good Friday Agreement.Its deeply disappointing that the Department for Exiting the EU did not choose to share this information with us or with the people of Northern Ireland. Its another example of the Government not giving Parliament the facts which we need to help inform our decision-making.The stakes are even higher now as the clock ticks and the Conservative leadership debate takes up some of the available time until October , just  weeks away.Alternative arrangements for the border are highly unlikely to be in place by then or indeed any time soon, which makes the transition and the backstop as important as ever. And as for leaving with no deal, our committee concluded in January that a managed no-deal cannot constitute the policy of any responsible Government.Hilary Benn MP is chair of the Committee on Exiting the European Union"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts wattlebridge road in newtownbutler closed during security alert","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

This is to ensure that staff welfare is protected and that the delivery of front line services is not adversely affected.\"With overall absence levels at Northern Irelands councils at their highest in   for two consecutive years and consistently ranking as the highest in the United Kingdom, with no indication of improvement, I have decided that councils could benefit from a more detailed report in this area.\"She said the Audit Office would investigate the matter more extensively.Overall, councils are in a financially strong position and managed their finances well in  , the report continued. The £m spent providing services to the public works out at £ on average for every person here.Councils received income of £m, % of which was from district rates.As of March , councils had outstanding loans totalling £.m. In   councils paid almost £m towards the principal outstanding balance and £m in interest costs.Use of agency staff not giving value for moneySome councils are still too heavily reliant on agency staff, leading to warnings that using them is not delivering value for money.In  , total employee costs totalled £m — around % of operating expenditure — with agency staff accounting for a further % .The overall cost of agency staff has continued to increase year on year, rising by £.m last year.Most of this increase was attributed to Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, and Lisburn and Castlereagh City Council.Agency costs at seven councils either reduced or remained relatively stable. That is an improvement on the previous year, when nine councils saw agency staff costs rise.Local government auditor Pamela McCreedy said: “In   some councils continued to be dependent on agency staff to deliver local services.“I will continue to keep the costs associated with agency staff under review across all councils, and I will also focus on the types of work they perform and theof time they have been working in the council.“There is a risk that over-reliance on agency staff over an extended period of time does not provide value for money.”Severance payouts cost £m from  to Almost £m was spent on council exit packages in the last year.Councils are required to disclose the number and costs of these payments.Expenditure includes compulsory and voluntary redundancy costs, pension contributions and other departure expenses.Over the four years from   to  ,  councils have paid a total of £.m in exit packages to staff. A total of  exit packages were agreed, with  exceeding £,.Many of the payments were linked to the reform of local government, which led to the creation of  super councils in .In   councils agreed  exit packages at a cost of £.m. The average cost was £, —  were greater than £,.The number and cost of exit packages has fallen signicantly since  .However, in the four years preceding  , the average number of exit packages was , with an average cost of £.m.Today’s report states: “The number and cost of exit packages in   remained high and is an indication that councils’ workforce plans had not stabilised.”Not one local authority ready for no-deal BrexitNo council is fully prepared for a no-deal Brexit, today’s report warns.It states the UK’s October  departure from the European Union presents a signicant risk to the operation of local government, and councils have been constrained in terms of planning.“The lack of clarity so far on the shape of an exit deal and a clear way forward, as well as the absence of additional funding, inevitably means that councils have been limited in terms of the practical preparations they can make,” the report states.“Exiting the European Union is a signicant risk to local government service delivery, in particular community planning, the economy and tourism.”Auditors found that Brexit preparations y across councils, with some establishing dedicated working groups or committees.It adds: “No council is fully ready, in operational terms, for a no-deal exit. The outworkings will have most impact on those councils which have a border with the Republic of Ireland.”The report also warns thatthe UK Government and EU fail to agree a withdrawal deal, there will be no transition period and councils will need to respond immediately."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38243182.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/Lisburn_Armed_Forces_Day007.jpg","title":"thousands descend on lisburn for armed forces day in northern ireland","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Its the UK that has the border with the Republic of Ireland and its for us to come forward with a solution that would work.\"I think everyone here would agree that what we cant have is ato border infrastructure on the island of Ireland.\"Mr Hunt added that the UK needs to show that it can keep the border open. \"I think that through technology we can do that but we have to do that in a way that doesnt trap us in the customs union,\" he said.Home Secretary Sajid Javid said he was \"% committed to the Good Friday Agreement and keeping an open border\".\"In my department, Borderforce has looked at this issue and its perfectly possible to have an open border with two dferent customs arrangements on either side of the border using existing technology,\" he said - although Ms Maitlis pointed out that the existence of the technology to do so is in doubt. \"Obviously it will take time to put that in place and it will cost money. I would have a time limit on the backstop. There will have to be some sort of compromise.\"International Development Secretary Rory Stewart said that he had visited Enniskillen and Londonderry recently and argued that Mr Johnsons plans wouldnt deal with trade tarfs for farmers in border regions.Mr Johnson said that there would \"be no tarfs or quotas\" and that he wanted a \"standstill in current arrangements\" until a trade agreement was negotiated.Mr Stewart said that the Withdrawal Agreement was legally binding and would not be renegotiated before October , and accused the other candidates of not explaining how they would enact their Irish border plans.Following the answers, the questioner Mark said that there was \"a lot of fear and confusion in Northern Irelandwe come crashing out without a deal\", adding that he had been \"hoping for more\" from the candidates.The backstop aims to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit, but opponents have claimed it could keep the UK aligned with the EU indefinitely and create a trade border in the Irish Sea.The backstop effectively ended Theresa Mays hopes of getting her Brexit deal through Parliament and its failure hastened her departure as Prime Minister.However, the EU has said it will not renegotiate the deal, which includes the backstop.Ballots of Conservative MPs will continue over the next few days to whittle the race down to the final two candidates. The final stage of the leadership race will begin and members will then vote on the next Party leader and Prime Minister, with the result expected on July ."},{"url":null,"title":"climate activist says mp who manhandled her has not apologised directly","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But I certainly didn’t expect that. But I’m fine,” she added.Quizzed on whether she accepts the actions of the demonstrators might have caused alarm, she said their message and peaceful intent was clear – something she reiterated as she was physically forced from the room.“There was over  people in that room at the time and there was only one that reacted in that way,” she said.“We had that message, we had the climate emergency, and I think it was quite obvious that we were there for that reason – for a peaceful protest and we weren’t armed.“I was armed with peer reviewed science – the message that we were giving out. That’s all I was armed with.”"},{"url":null,"title":"liz truss boris has to campaign for job of prime minister","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

said she does not believe Conservative MPs “would seek to bring a Tory government down and let in Jeremy Corbyn”Boris Johnson pressed ahead with a no-deal Brexit as prime minister..pushMs Truss, who is backing the former foreign secretary in the battle to enter Number  – and has herself been tipped as a future chancellor, said it was “dangerous to be complacent”, adding “Boris has to campaign for this job”.She refused to be drawn on police being called to Mr Johnson’s partner’s home after reports of shouting and banging, telling BBC Radio  Live’s Pienaar’s Politics: “There’s no point in asking me, I believe it’s a private matter, I don’t think the public are concerned about that and I think that Boris is somebody who served for eight years as mayor of London – did a brilliant job, he served as foreign secretary, people know what he’s like in office and that’s what’s important.”The South West Norfolk MP insisted Mr Johnson could attract a broad base of support, adding: “My view is that Boris Johnson is somebody who is capable of commanding the support of the country and the support of the parliamentary party and I don’t believe my colleagues would vote no confidence and risk a Jeremy Corbyn government which puts a lot of the economic issues we’re discussing in here completely into the shade, he’s a Marxist.”She went on: “We need a leader with the determination to follow through, go through to the st October, leave preferably with a deal, but without a dealnecessary – and I do not believe in those circumstances those Conservative colleagues would seek to bring a Conservative government down and let in Jeremy Corbyn and his Marxist agenda.”Ms Truss called for a fresh approach to Brexit negotiations with the EU, adding it was “vitally important” to keep no deal on the table. Mr Johnson’s strategy, she said, was to make sure the country was prepared for no deal. She added: “We need new approach and that means redoing things, redoing the negotiations with the EU and being much clearer that we are prepared to leave on the st October.”She said: “What I think would be an absolute disaster is to yet again not follow through on the democratic mandate of the British people which has created a huge amount of mistrust.”On no deal, she added: “To say there are no plans for this and it would be a disaster is wrong, we are prepared for an exit on the st October. “What we need now is to have the political leadership to follow through on that and I believe that Boris Johnson is the person capable of that political leadership and making that happen.”"},{"url":null,"title":"103yearold louisiana runner becomes oldest woman to compete on","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

Durkan said that many of the  staff at Foyle House, on the Duncreggan Road, will be made redundant as it will be \"impossible\" for them to relocate to Belfast.In  HMRC announced that the Derry tax office would close in  .It came as part of a move to reconfgure its offices into thirteen regional centres serving every nation and region in the UK, with one of these centres being located in Belfast.In July  HMRC declared that its Belfast Regional Centre would be based at Erskine House, Chichester Street, Belfast, and expected to open in late . It is on schedule to open later this year.This week, Sir Jonathan Thompson, Chief Executive and Permanent Secretary of HMRC, sent a letter to Mark H. Durkan asserting that based on current plans Foyle House will close in September , with staff moving, where possible, to the Belfast Regional Centre.There are currently around  staff in Foyle House and Mr Thompson accepted that the majority live outside reasonable daily travel to Belfast.Mark H Durkan had asked that consideration be given to the integration of HMRC workers in Derry into the Northern Ireland Civil Service.Speaking to the Derry News yesterday, he said: “The intention of HMRC to close their offices here in September  is something I have been appealing against since it was announced in November .“I had written to Head of Civil Service, David Sterling to consider the integration of Derry staff to available DAERA positions in Ballykelly. Why this obvious solution has not been given due consideration is beyond me.“And while HMRC have acknowledged a duty of care to ex-employees, the current plan to relocate  staff members to their Belfast offices is a highly impractical approachnot virtually impossible for those with families and caring responsibilities. For many the only option they have been left with is redundancy.“It is a ludicrous and tin-eared approach to remove employment opportunities, chronically lacking in the North West, and in effect to move more of our skilled workers to Belfast.“These experienced and highly competent staff would be an asset to any organisation. The inability to provide these people some peace of mind as well as affording them opportunities to apply their skills in similar roles closer to home, has been completely overlooked.”However, in his letter Mr Thompson said, “regrettably, there are no priority arrangements for redeployment of our staff into Northern Ireland Civil Servicedepartments.“The NICS is entirely separate from the Home Civil Service and, as such, HMRC staff can only apply for roles in the NICS which may be advertised externally, including those at the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in nearby Ballykelly.”Mr Thompson added that it has always been made clear that HMRC wants as many people as possible to transfer to their new location and continue their careers in Belfast.“That is why we have committed to hold one-to-one meetings between staff and managers around a year in advance of any move, to discuss inidual circumstances.“The meetings will establish who can and cannot move and what level of support will be needed to keep people working for HMRC. The one-to-ones for this office will commence in September ,” he concluded.The letter went on to say that those who decide to travel to Belfast will be given financial support in terms of travel costs and in some cases with home moves.The option of working in other government departments would also be explored.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"creggan men mixing mayweather dream las vegas boxing encounter","story":"A boxing coach and personal trainer from Creggan has spoken about an ‘amazing’ trip to Las Vegas spent in the company of many of the fight game’s legendary characters never mind his best friend who just happens to be international footballer James McClean.James McClean recently decided to celebrate turning  by inviting a few of his close friends and their partners to go on a trip to Las Vegas.

She would gain on me during the swim and transitions, but I would pull away from her in the shoot and run and luckily managed to keep ahead of her on the last run which involved an incline to the finish, she said.ldquoBy my fourth time up it, this incline felt like Everest, but my training around Stormont Estate had me well conditioned for that. Suzie has an extremely busy summer ahead of her and is so looking forward to the challenges ahead.ldquoMy focus now is Traithle Europeans in June in Madeira, then Worlds in Florida in October.

They have also branded claims the mercury bath poses a health and safety risk as a ldquored herring and fear that replacing the existing mechanism could potentially damage the Fresnel lens.Described as a ldquoworkshop, the January meeting lasted over one hour with the official council record of the debate that ensued only amounting to a paltry two and a half lines.The Lecale Lightkeepers vehemently argued that they had a case for briefing councillors on the impact the loss of the beam would have but, surprisingly, the request was initially rejected.Instead, council officials insisted that officers from the the Commissioners of Irish Lights would be invited to future meetings of the districtrsquos respective DEA Forums to discuss the future of the lighthouse.The local authority said this was to ensure that information could be shared and that local stakeholders and communities were fully consulted on any proposals for the lighthouse in the immediate future, before any plans are finalised.Council officials also insisted that wide ranging public consultation on the future of the lighthouse would take place.Campaigners mdash who were at a complete loss to understand why they were initially refused an opportunity to meet directly with councillors over five months ago mdash have now been told they will get a chance to brief them and outline their case for the retention of the beam.The Lecale Lightkeepers have described the plan to remove the beam as ldquototally inadequate and unacceptable and are looking forward to outlining their case for its retention.They are also pleased that having heard from the Commissioners, politicians can now have face-to-face dialogue with campaigners.Campaigners have held several discussions with the Commissioners and frequently engage with the organisation as part of the bid to retain what they have described as a key facet of Lecalersquos heritage.ldquoWe welcome the opportunity to meet with councillors to demonstrate just how passionate people are about the retention of the beam, the spokeswoman declared. It is a symbol of unity in Lecale and has brought together all sides of our erse community. It must be retained.ldquoMeeting with councillors is particularly important for us. We have put together a detailed presentation on the lighthouse issue and will outline our concerns about the future of the beam which we cannot afford to lose for a whole host of reasons.The spokeswoman said that in the interests of fairness and given the sensitive nature of the beam issue, it was important that they meet with local politicians.ldquoCouncillors have had the opportunity to hear from the Commissioners and it is important that they hear what we have to say as the group representing those opposed to this controversial proposal, she continued.ldquoThe beam must be retained for future generations given that it is an intrinsic part of the maritime history and heritage of the area and is a stunning feature of the Lecale landscape.The spokeswoman added: ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Council is backing the campaign to retain the sweeping beam and it is it important that councillors hear directly from campaigners. The beam must be retained we simply cannot afford to lose it from this area and see it consigned to the pages of history..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Curran steps down from government association position  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK councillor Dermot Curran is stepping down from his role as president of the Northern Ireland Local Government Association this Friday.The group is the representative body for the provincersquos  councils and Cllr Curran will leave his position at the grouprsquos annual conference which is taking place at Newcastlersquos Burrendale Hotel.The Ardglass man is Northern Irelandrsquos longest serving district councillor, having been elected to the former Down Council in , following the reorganisation of local government.He has served as NILGA president twice describing the accolade as both a ldquoprivilege and a challenge.While stepping down as the organisationrsquos president, Cllr Curran will remain a key member of the NILGA Executive.Cllr Curran mdash who was last month re-elected to Newry, Mourne and Down Council mdash has been a councillor for  years and while already Northern Irelandrsquos longest serving politician, some of his council colleagues believe that he is the longest serving in the British Isles.Dedicated to public service, Cllr Curran said he has ldquothoroughly enjoyed his second term at NILGArsquos helm and looks forward to continuing his work with the organisation.He also believes that local councils will continue to play increasingly important roles in their respective areas and that an opportunity exists to unlock the potential of local government as the hub of public services.Cllr Curran said that over recent years councils had changed dramatically, as had the political, financial and legal environment in which councillors operate.He said while local authorities had more responsibilities and power than before, they were also increasingly stretched in terms of finances and resources, an issue which has been compounded since the suspension of the Assembly.ldquoThe  councils are a key element of investment and public service delivery, but they control just % of the public purse.

However, I doubt many think that it is the cradle of horse racing, but it is.We do of course have a famous racecourse, which has just hosted a festival of racing as part of the DownTime Summerfest.Some of you, dear readers, may even know that there is an earlier racecourse in Downpatrick mdash at Old Course Road. So racing has been going on for centuries in our beautul corner of the world. And we have also played a vital role in the foundation of the Sport of Kings.The breed of horse associated with modern horse racing is the thoroughbred. A mere glance is enough to tell even the casual observer that the thoroughbred does not look like other horses.When compared to a pony or carthorse, the thoroughbred is leaner, taller and sleeker. In fact, these horses are perfectly designed for racing. They have big lungs, a big heart and long, slender legs that can move swtly.They also need special care when compared with native breeds. They have thin hair coats and so need to wear rugs or live in stables in bad weather. They need special food to give them energy to race. So these features tell you that the ancestor of the modern thoroughbred came from somewhere hot mdash from the desert, in fact. The ancestor of our racehorses is from Arabia.Back in the th century, horses were bred for work and war, not pleasure. Officers prized horses that were fast to get them in and out of battle and keep them alive. By this time, the medieval charger of knights mdash the destrier mdash was out of fashion. They were too slow and cumbersome, and soldiers no longer wore heavy suits of armour.So the horse evolved through selective breeding to become fleet of foot. There were no horses faster than the Arabian, which was specially bred to become bigger and faster than its wild cousin. The armies of the Ottoman Sultan developed special studs to create this new war machine.In , one of these fine stallions, known as the Byerley Turk, found himself outside the gates of Vienna. The Ottoman Sultan wanted to capture the imperial capital of the Holy Roman Empire, an objective he failed to achieve when the Polish King John III Sobieski led the greatest cavalry charge in history to defeat the Ottoman forces.The Byerley Turk was captured and eventually brought to England, finding himself in the ownership of one Captain Byerley.His adventures were not over though. Recognising a fine animal, Captain Byerley adopted the Turk as his war horse. In  hewas called to Ireland to fight for King William and in  he fought at the Battle of the Boyne. Indeed, Captain Byerley later attributed his surviving that battle to the swtness of his favourite war horse.After the battle, the Turk was entered in a horse race mdash in Downpatrick. Of course, he went on to win that race and go on to be one of the most famous horses in history. The Flying Horse housing development to the east of Downpatrick is named after this famous race.The remarkable career of the Turk continued mdash and now we come to his ultimate destiny. He was put out to stud in Yorkshire. His pedigree was highly prize and he became the first of only three foundation sires of the modern thoroughbred breed.Genetic testing has revealed it is his DNA that is the most common in all modern racehorses. His progeny are successful right to this day including names such as Dr Devious, Ahonoora and Indian Ridge.And it all started with a fateful race in Downpatrick over  years ago. Needless to say,Downe Vets had been around then and caring for his veterinary needs, we feel he could have achieved more..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Hurlers seeking big upset at Croke Park  ","story":"DOWN senior hurlers go into Saturdayrsquos Christy Ring Cup final at Croke Park against Meath as rank outsiders.Few pundits outside the Down camp expect anything other than a comfortable win for Meath, but say that quietly in and around Ronan Sheehanrsquos new kids on the block.The Newry man, who has close connections to several Cork hurling legends, has engendered a new-found enthusiasm and confidence in his charges.His young hurlers are a real surprise packet this season and getting to the Christy Ring Cup final is a major achievement for his fledgeling side.Sheehan has invested heavily in youth and has two schoolboys in his starting .Downpatrickrsquos Tim Prenter, who plays his club hurling for Ballygalget and Ballycranrsquos Phelilm Savage are both in their final year at St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and De La Salle, Downpatrick, respectively.Both lads were in the Down Schoolsrsquo side that lted the Mageean Cup earlier in the season and both hail from famous sporting families.Prenter, who also won a MacLarnon Cup medal with the Red High a few months back, is the son of former Antrim senior football defender Kieran Prenter and his grandfather Seamus Burns was a well known member of the all-conquering Belfast Celtics basketball team that swept all before them in the s and s.Savage, whose brother Liam is also in the team, is the son of former Ballycran and Ulster midfielder Gary lsquoGazarsquo Savage, who was also a noted centre half with Ballycam Celtic in the Newcastle League.There are also several other young players in the  with Portaferryrsquos Matthew Conlon, Ronan Blair, Darragh Mallon, Tom Murray, Caolan Taggart and Eoghan and Daithi Sands all in their early s.Throw in Liatroimrsquos Oisin McManus, P J Davidson and Ruairi McCrickard and Ballycranrsquos Stephen Keith, Gerard Hughes, Huw Flynn and Liam and Phelim Savage and you have the nucleus of squad that could dominate Ulster hurling for years.In addition to Prenter, Ballygalget provide the squad with, John McManus, Danny Toner, Marc Fisher and Cathal Coulter with Newry Shamrocks providing Paul Sheehan and Jordan Murphy.Helping Ronan Sheehan from the sidelines is Cork legend Diarmuid OrsquoSullivan and the Down manager believes his support has been critical in moving the side forward.ldquoDiarmuid has been doing a bit of defensive coaching for us and he has been there for all of the Christy Ring Cup games, he said.ldquoHe would know a lot of the boys from the development squads because he wouldrsquove come and done coaching sessions down through the years.

But it all passed in time. Now five years passes by at an alarmingly swt pace, let alone one.There are ious theories as to why our sense of time changes. The one I believe is the percentages theory — that our sense of time changes the more we experience it.Thus, at the age of one, a year is % of our experience, so it lasts like an eternity. At age , it is % of our experience, so it still feels like a long duration.

They all agreed.The trigger had been a question by a Muslim hardliner, Abdullah Patel, who asked the they accept that ‘words have consequences’. The debate host put this to Boris Johnson, reminding him he had said Muslim women wearing burkas looked like letter boxes and other controversial things.It later emerged that Mr Patel is accused of anti Semitic tweets and had expressed reactionary views about relations between men and women ..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog The controversy that flared up after the debate related to the fact that the BBC had used such a questioner, while making it seem ashe was just a man in the street.A less noticed aspect of the saga was Mr Javid’s response. He committed to the Tory Islamophobia probe and then bounced the others into the same.This was unwise. When people rise up against the odds from a group that has hitherto suffered discrimination — for example Margaret Thatcher as the first women prime minister of the UK, or when Colin Powell became the first black US secretary of state — they almost always do so by not making any issue at all out of their status.They send out an unspoken signal that they might be female or blackbut their minority status is incidental to their persona, not central to it.If even a flash of resentment or preoccupation about that status emerges, then prejudiced people in the dominant group think: ‘Ah, he is as bitter as the rest of them.’Mr Javid has in the past seemed aware of this. Part of his image is that he happens to be the son of a Pakistani bus driver, but he is also a proud British patriot, who is eurosceptic and hawkish on some security and foreign policy issues.He took the harsh decision to cancel the citizenship of the Isis bride, Shamima Begum, who travelled to Syria to back the terror group — a statement that he harbours no ambivalence about radical Islam, evenother Muslims do.But on Tuesday , Mr Javid damaged that image with his decision to extract a commitment from his colleagues. He should have just stated his own view, and used the opportunity to remind viewers of his proven antipathy towards the Islamic extremism that most of us so justiably loathe.Instead, he compounded his error by putting pressure on Rory Stewart to say he would condemn foolish comments by Donald Trump.Left wing politicians tell untruths as well as right wing ones so are as deserving of scrutiny Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"If anyone has demonstrated his credentials of being profoundly respectful of Islam, it is the erudite Mr Stewart, who has spent much time in Muslim countries.I believe there is no need to examine alleged Tory Islamophobia. Consider for a moment the parallel controversy over anti Semitism in Labour. As someone who is strongly pro Israel, I accept that it is legitimate to criticise Israel fiercely, and possible to do so without being remotely anti Semitic.Similarly, it is possible to criticise radical Islam without being Islamophobic. We must be able to say, for example, that a large minority of one section of the UK community, and only one, British Muslims, has shown notable levels of ambivalence about suicide bombing.Liberals should be honest that mainstream Muslim thinking in the UK is now more consistently hostile to issues such as same sex rights as is mainstream Christian thinking.Muddled thinking on ‘Islamophobia’ led to Pastor James McConnell being put in the dock for an anti Islamic sermon after a complaint by Dr Raied Al Wazzan, a man who praised the peace brought about in Mosul by Isis barbarians .Dr Al Wazzan was on the BBC recently rejecting a far right allegation of Islamic extremism in Belfast, yet was not asked about his shameful, extremist Isis remark.Dr Wazzan has been given residency, good employment and opportunity by our wonderful country, yet still he has implied the UK is ungenerous to immigrants. His defence of Isis was worse than anything Pastor McConnell said, yet it was the latter who faced trial.The Tories of all people must speak out against such injustices.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editor• Ben Lowry: The days are getting shorter, again• Ben Lowry: Sad to see departure of colleaguesJPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"left wing politicians tell untruths as well as right wing ones so are as deserving of scrutiny  ","story":"....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+Bootstrapper.ensEvent.trigger]]]]]]]Bootstrapper.ensEvent.trigger]] initInArticleOnlySiteText, initArticleSiteText, isInArticleOnlyTemplateReady. s isArticleTemplateReady. s addCustomTextToSiteTemplate addSiteName.html  TriggerPrompt url  https:survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site_oqfshupypyivmsxzqude + url +  +:  + random + .getTime + afterel.setAttribute head  document[]  document[]headChildTriggerPrompt   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business Subscribe#jp #login-widget #login-flip.flip RegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Opinion Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Offbeat People Read This News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health People Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           Left wing politicians tell untruths as well as right wing ones so are as deserving of scrutinyLetter to the editorPublished::Saturday  June Share this article window.onload  .sharetool \"m.\" index  .indexOf \"ContentId\" pointIndex  .indexOf articleID  .substringSign Up To Our Daily Newsletter ipaddress.getJSON .keypress.focus.on email  .val.ajax\",source_url: location.href,source_website_category: \"Letters\", \"text\".done .removeAttr  .htmlThanks,  + email +  has been added to our newsletter..

Gery Kelly and Bill MontgomeryGerry starts his journey at his home club in Ardglass tracing the beginnings of golf in Ireland and reveals a few surprises as he discovers the relatively unknown Ulster-Scots golfing pioneers who helped establish the sport here.He visits stately homes including Mount Stewart on the shores of Strangford Lough and Grey Abbey House – chatting with Lady Rose Lauritzen and William Montgomery – and travels to St Andrews to explore how the Scots claim to have invented the sport and what part they played in bringing the game across the Irish Sea. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog He also sets out to finally answer the age-old dispute about which club is actually the oldest in Ireland. Gerry, who has been playing golf for over five decades at Ardglass Golf Club, said: “Before I began filming for the programme, despite playing the game for most of my le, I actually knew very little about its history, and that’s a shame because there are few sports with as long and as rich a history.

With all the movement of people between the two countries, that Ulster-Scots connection, why did it take so long for the game to be finally organised here ”Gerry, who has been playing golf since he was a teenager, said: “Golf is a sport you can get easily hooked on. It’s a game for le. I know people still playing in their nineties.“For me it’s not so much now about that standard of golf now. I used to play off single figures, now I’m a teenager , it’s about the craic with your fourball. “We would get out once or twice a weekend and play for a fiver. It’s the most important three or four hours of the week to win that fiver.”Links To The Past: Pioneers Of Ulster Golf is on BBC Two Northern Ireland tomorrow night at pm.The one-hour film has been produced by NPE Media for BBC Northern Ireland, with support from the Ulster-Scots Broadcast Fund.l Morning View, page JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"this is how much it costs to get married in northern ireland  ","story":"....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+Bootstrapper.ensEvent.trigger]]]]]]]Bootstrapper.ensEvent.trigger]] initInArticleOnlySiteText, initArticleSiteText, isInArticleOnlyTemplateReady. s isArticleTemplateReady. s addCustomTextToSiteTemplate addSiteName.html  TriggerPrompt url  https:survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site_oqfshupypyivmsxzqude + url +  +:  + random + .getTime + afterel.setAttribute head  document[]  document[]headChildTriggerPrompt   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business Subscribe#jp #login-widget #login-flip.flip RegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News People Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion Read This News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           This is how much it costs to get married in Northern Ireland   Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...BRIGHTCOVE.createBrightcovePlayerInstance Helen JohnsonEmail Published::Friday  June Share this article window.onload  .sharetool \"m.\" index  .indexOf \"ContentId\" pointIndex  .indexOf articleID  .substringSign Up To Our Daily Newsletter ipaddress.getJSON .keypress.focus.on email  .val.ajax\",source_url: location.href,source_website_category: \"Human Interest\", \"text\".done .removeAttr  .htmlThanks,  + email +  has been added to our newsletter..

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

I will challenge other councillors to back it.Earlier on Wednesday, Cllr Gray made a statement to Vale of Glamorgan Councilrsquos Conservative group to say he was resigning.In his statement, he said he had ldquoabsolutely no issue with the manner in which Cllr Bailey was elected as the new leader of the Conservative Group,But he said he is ldquoat least partially at odds with Cllr Bailey on three issues ndash the proposed lsquoclosurersquo of Llancarfan Primary School, the Dinas Powys Bypass and the incinerator in Barry.On the Llancarfan School proposal, which would see the primary moved to a new building in Rhoose, he said: ldquoI seconded a motion to have the executive reopen the issue consultation and this was ignored by the then cabinet but now that this dficult decision has been made I fear that any attempt to articially prop up Llancarfan School will take funding away from the budgets of Penarth schools which is something I will not tolerate.Cllr Gray said heremained ldquounconvinced that the proposed bypass around Dinas Powys, linking Cardf to Barry, ldquois an issue with a large base of support in my ward, and the efforts to give it even more prominence and funding would I believe be to the detriment of the residents of my ward.Vale council has been waiting for more than a year for Welsh Government to decide whether the Barry incinerator needs to carry out an environmental impact assessment before it can operate.Cllr Gray said any efforts to ramp up the councilrsquos rhetoric on the incinerator ldquowould do a disservice to those residents who are passionate about the subject.ldquoRaising  hope for headlines is not the reason I stood for local government and I donrsquot want to mark my success by how many column inches we are able to achieve on a wedge issue, he said.       ,params: .pushHe added:ldquoThe structures around the group that Vince is proposing seemed to be geared up to act as an opposition party and not to focus on the work of delivering core services for the benefit of the most vulnerable members of our society.ldquoI donrsquot expect everyone to agree with my decision and I donrsquot take this decision lightly ndash I am sure that there will be a great number of people who have an opinion on whether I have done the right thing or not.ldquoI need to remain true to myself and my belief in acting as a positive advocate for the residents in my ward ndash the issues that get me out of bed every morning to work hard for the residents in my ward are not the way the press views me but how I can make a positive dference to peoplersquos lives. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people.

The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre. Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers. We are so thankful that all four of these dogs were found when they were.“Grace and Bliss were very shaken up by their ordeal when they came into our care and it took them a couple of days to build trust around people again. We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health. Sally is incredibly sweet natured, and just like the others, will make a wonderful addition to the right home.“We are not sure why there has been a recent influx in dogs being abandoned. We always remind people that ‘A Dog is for Le®’ but we understand that le happens, and places like Dogs Trust are there to support any dog owner who experiences a bump in the road and needs our help. Sometimes the most responsible thing we can do as a dog owner is admit that we aren’t coping with our pets, but it is important to ensure they are kept safe and not left to fend for themselves.”If you

The application area also stretches or borders on  Areas of Special Scientic Interest from the boundaries of Belfast Lough to the glacial peat deposits of Benburb.“We have serious concerns about the impact oil and gas exploration will have on bioersity, on intensying our reliance on carbon-heavy industry and on people and communities here. “We consider this a regionally signicant application and, as such, the decision is likely to be taken by the Department for the Economy. “It is important that the Department hears and understands the strength of opposition to these proposals,” they said calling for the restoration of an Executive.Cllr O’Hanlon said: “Where we dfered with Councillor Lavery is that he sought to form a Council view in a Council Committee when the correct prcedure is to formally bring a notion of motion to Full Council.We advised Councillor Lavery of the proper process and said we would support such a motion. “The SDLP are opposed to fracking, just as we are opposed to parties trying to form council policy in the wrong manner.“Procedures are there to protect the public and good governance and we will continue to follow those rules.”NIHE offices may close and move

Thats signicantly higher than % of bosses globally. And according to the firm’s latest Global CEO Outlook, Northern Ireland’s bosses are leading the way when it comes to embracing the ‘fast fail’ culture in an effort to make their companies as innovative as possible. Of the Northern Ireland bosses surveyed, % said they want their employees to feel ‘empowered to innovate. On the issue of Brexit, around two thirds of business leaders see the UK’s exit from the EU as the greatest threat to growth. Looking at overall growth, all of those questioned said they expect ‘top line revenue growth over the next three years’. But just % of company bosses said they ‘expect to increase headcount in the next three years of more than %’. John Hansen, partner in charge of KPMG Northern Ireland, said: “Successful CEOs know they need their companies to be as innovative as possible and it’s clear that the right environment is being created in Northern Ireland to do just that. “Our leaders aren’t afraid to give their teams the scope to try new ideas which may have a risk of failure and that opens up a world of potential. This level of freedom will no doubt make sure that Northern Ireland companies are at the cutting edge of innovation in the years to come.” Angela McGowan, CBI director in Northern Ireland, said: “KPMG’s  Global CEO Outlook gives local business leaders some great insights into what is on the radar for chief executives across the globe and raises some important and interesting ideas around what leaders should doing to maintain competitive advantage despite the uncertainty.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glandore_web.jpg","title":"glandore the family flexible workspace on the rise","story":"Posted on Wednesday June  by Ulster Business High-end flexible office company Glandore has expanded rapidly into an all-island family business with further growth on the horizon. Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tradeniiii.jpg","title":"new northern ireland trade alliance formed","story":"Posted on Wednesday  June  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s newest trade body alliance will take its message to Westminster later this year amid the ongoing political vacuum at home and with Brexit on the horizon. Trade NI is an alliance between Hospitality Ulster, headed by Colin Neill, Manufacturing NI, Stephen Kelly, and Retail NI, Glyn Roberts, and aims to represent a wider swathe of Northern Ireland’s private sector amid the “paralysis” surrounding a lack of Executive and therefore a lack of local political voice on the UK’s exit from the EU. The group will take its message to London on September , hosting an event to once again bring together politicians, businesses, stakeholders and the media to raise awareness of the issues and challenges facing companies here. The alliance, which has been supported by the likes of Heathrow Airport, Danske Bank and Flybe, outlined its aims at its launch in the Cathedral Quarter, Belfast, to an audience of business leaders from across Northern Ireland. “Northern Ireland is facing huge economic and political challenges ahead with Brexit, no Assembly, and a rapidly changing global economy,” the group said. “Trade NI will seek to give leadership on behalf of our three sectors and provide new policy solutions to creating a modern local economy.” “The paralysis that has been created with the lack of an Assembly and Executive has developed a situation where very little has been done to address the needs of our sectors or the economy at large. “The sht of power from Stormont to Westminster means that we must press decision makers there to implement policies and make legislative changes that will help grow Northern Ireland. Our local economy and businesses have taken a back seat and we simply cannot afford that situation any longer. “Our three organisations represent most of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland. Therefore, a louder voice needs to be heard on their behalf so that they don’t suffer in the wake of the local political issues. We want a reboot of the economic policy of Northern Ireland, in order to benefit our economy and safeguard our growing business community.” “Last year we held a NI business reception with over  people that brought together the Northern Ireland Secretary of State, MPs, lords, ministers and key political influencers in Westminster to bring focus to Northern Ireland issues.” “This was a great opportunity to be able to discuss the key concerns of the business community with national political decision makers and help them understand the priorities needed for Northern Ireland, and to promote Northern Ireland as a great place in the United Kingdom to locate or start a business.” Kevin Kingston, chief executive of Danske Bank, the main sponsor of Trade NI’s forthcoming Westminster reception, said that “Northern Ireland has a strong business community and should be considered across the United Kingdom as a thriving business hub for the global market”. “The vitality of the private sector is imperative to the strength of the Northern Ireland economy. We must ensure Northern Ireland businesses are well positioned to be able to compete in the post-Brexit environment. We will continue to work alongside the Trade NI alliance and other key influencers to make sure that Northern Ireland, as a constituent part of the United Kingdom, remains a key priority at Westminster.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
