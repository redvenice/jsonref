Coach Justin Langer hopes the methods work against arch-enemy England on Thursday‘People tend to turn to what I loosely term “magical thinking” in situations where there is uncertainty or a loss of control — and sporting matches are prime examples of that, where it doesn’t matter how skilled you are, something may not go your way,’ he says.‘On a rational level most of us know these things are nonsense but they give an illusion of control — and as most rituals come under the heading of “even if it doesn’t work it hasn’t cost you anything”, then mostly people have nothing to lose by employing them.’Langer’s unusual coaching rituals join a rich history of sporting superstitions, as we reveal here...RAFA’S ROUTINESWhile Roger Federer famously eschews superstition, his great on-court rival Rafael Nadal cleaves to a series of small, repetitive rituals before and during every game. Clutching a single racket as he walks on to court, he removes his jacket while facing the crowd. He then carefully lines up two bottles of Evian — one chilled, one room temperature — alongside one another, ensuring the labels face the court. No one is allowed to touch them.Whenever he is serving, Nadal will touch his buttock, then his left shoulder, right shoulder, nose, left ear, nose again and right ear. When heading for his chair between games, he will step over the line using his right foot first and only after he has received two sweat towels.         Wayne Rooney’s unchanging pre-game routine involves eating a bowl of Coco Pops before matchesBy contrast Serena Williams is less high-maintenance: she will wear the same socks from the first round of a Grand Slam tournament — it’s unknown whether or not she washes them in between — to the final. And she always bounces the ball five times before her first serve (and just twice before the second).Perhaps the most famously wacky behaviour, however, belongs to Croatia’s Goran Ivanisevic who, on the way to his unexpected 2001 triumph in the men’s singles at Wimbledon, followed an unchanging and quite bizarre daily timetable.He began each day by watching Teletubbies and ended it at the same table of a restaurant in SW19, eating fish soup, lamb with chips, and ice cream with chocolate sauce.KISSES \u0026amp COCO POPSThere is no shortage of odd little rituals unfolding in the dressing rooms of our football teams before a match. At Everton, club captain Leighton Baines always ties, unties and then re-ties his boot laces in the dressing room before heading out on to the pitch.Former Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas, who’s now at Monaco, kisses a ring given to him by his wife four times — his lucky number — then leaves it in his locker, while Barcelona and ex-Liverpool striker Luis Suarez also has a kiss-based ritual before any match: for him it’s a tattoo on his wrist bearing the names of his children.         Whenever he is serving, Rafa Nadal will touch his buttock, then his left shoulder, right shoulder, nose, left ear, nose again and right earWayne Rooney’s unchanging pre-game routine involves eating a bowl of Coco Pops before matches, emulating his Manchester United predecessor George Best, who would consume a whole chocolate bar.Rooney also practises creative visualisation — the act of creating and ‘rehearsing’ a positive mental experience in order to enhance your ability to achieve a successful outcome in real life.He has said that he often lies in bed the night before a game visualising himself scoring goals.Back in his playing prime, England star Gary Lineker never kicked a ball towards the goal while warming up, believing that if he scored he was ‘wasting’ one of his goals in the match.Former Chelsea captain John Terry had no end of pre-game rituals, from sitting in the same seat on the team coach, and listening to the same music — by American musician Usher — on the way to the ground.He also used to tape his socks exactly three times prior to a game.TEE WHEEZELucky balls, lucky clubs —golfers, whether pros or weekend hitters, are renowned for embracing myriad superstitions.It might involve never using a red tee or never washing a ball with which you’ve played well. One of the greatest of all players, Jack Nicklaus, would only play when he had three coins in his pocket. The denomination didn’t matter, it just had to be three.For others the behaviours are colour based: Lee Trevino was once quoted as saying that he would never use yellow tees because it is the colour of cowardice, while Tiger Woods almost always wears a red shirt for the final round of a tournament — a superstition that comes from his Thai mother, who believes the colour represents power.Female golfer Paula Creamer’s final-round dress code is always pink, a habit that has earned her the nickname ‘Pink Panther.’LUCKY PANTSIn his playing days, rugby star Jonny Wilkinson — another avid fan of creative visualisation — always wore the same T-shirt under his England shirt, claiming that it was a form of routine that helped to keep his nerves at bay.South Africa’s former captain John Smit wore exclusively black underwear on match days, in the belief that any other colour would bring him bad luck.Former Scottish international Simon Taylor had a novel way of revving himself up before a game, doing what he called the ‘Bruce Lee kung-fu wavy hands’ in the dressing room beforehand.WHEELY WACKYThose competing on two wheels have no shortage of quirks: the former American road cyclist Evelyn Stevens took a lucky marble with her on all of her professional races, while Britain’s Olympic star Laura Kenny makes sure to step on a wet towel before she clambers on her bike.Road-race sprinter Mark Cavendish, meanwhile, refuses to bathe before an important competition, while mountain-bike racer Rachel Atherton will never put on her right shoe before her left one. "},{"url":null,"title":"Tennis star Nick Kyrgios brittle ego goes partying coping mechanism losses","story":"Share this articleNick Kyrgios parties to protect fragile ego from fear of failure | Sport | The Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Sandwich generation inherit 50 000 previous one","story":"Share this article Its report said: \u0027For those with a sufficient amount of wealth, the amount they expect to pass on is likely to be significantly impacted, with future retirees expecting to pass on £50,606 less of their retirement pot on average compared with current retirees.\u0027Current pensioners have an average of just over £260,000 in retirement funds and can expect to leave around £125,000 to their children. But St James\u0027s expects this to shrink to £235,000 – with only £74,000 to pass on.Official figures suggest that 624,000 families have two generations of retirees, nearly double the number 20 years ago. This total is expected to almost double again to 1.2million over the next two decades.A survey carried out for St James\u0027s by Opinium found that 24 per cent of those approaching retirement expect to have to support children, grandchildren or a former partner or spouse and their children. Only around 7 per cent of current retirees face such responsibilities.The report said around one in six help other generations of their family with living costs and one in seven help with university costs or childcare.Claire Trott of St James\u0027s said: \u0027Passing wealth on to our loved ones is one of the final acts of kindness we are able to make, so it is concerning that the amount many believe they will be able to pass on is eroding.\u0027With people living longer, the make-up of today\u0027s modern family changing, and retirement provision more and more the responsibility of the inidual, the way we need to think about planning for the future has fundamentally shifted.\u0027An official review concluded last week that inheritance tax should be reformed so that more of a family\u0027s wealth can be passed to children without paying the levy. The Office of Tax Simplification called for the seven-year rule on gifts to be eased and for an overhaul of restrictions on passing on cash and property."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/24/09/4C92564E00000578-0-image-a-13_1527150558875.jpg","title":"Britains fleet fixed wing aircraft shrunk ten cent just year","story":"Share this article The figures, released by the MoD, account for aircraft in the Royal Air Force, Army Air Corps and the Royal Navy.There has also been a sharp drop in the number of drones in service, despite pledges to arm troops with more futuristic kit.The number of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (or UAVs) across the military has fallen by around a third from 443 recorded as being in service as of April 2016 to 281 last year.The MoD said numbers of aircraft do not equate to capability or operational requirements.RAF sources pointed to micro drones going out of service rather than proper aircraft such as Reapers used over Iraq and Syria.The figures also show that the number of helicopters operated by the three services has taken a fall over the same period, dropping from 353 in 2017 to 332 by last year.The figures will fuel concerns that crippling defence cuts over the years have left Britain\u0027s military under strength, at a time of heightened tensions across the world.Nia Griffith MP, Labour\u0027s Shadow Defence Secretary, said: \u0027Years of Tory defence cuts have hollowed out key capabilities.          Labour\u0027s Shadow Defence Secretary Nia

RAF is engaged in an ongoing campaign of air strikes against Islamic State targets in Syria and \u0027air policing\u0027 duties in the Baltic states, as part of NATO\u0027s Operation Azotize, to deter Russian aggression in the region. The RAF\u0027s Typhoon QRA (Quick Reaction Alert) squadrons based at Coningsby and Lossiemouth are also dealing with an increase in Russian military air activity around the periphery of UK airspace. The MOD recently confirmed that last year the RAF\u0027s air defence fighters were scrambled on twice as many occasions to investigate Russian aircraft flying close to British airspace, mainly Tu-160 \u0027Blackjack\u0027 bombers, as during the previous year.Frontline RAF fast jet numbers have reduced with the disbandment of the Tornado fleet.But the MoD said they will steadily increase with the stand up of two additional Typhoon squadrons and the arrival of additional F35s.F35 numbers are expected to increase to 48 by 2024.Even the Royal Navy has seen its surface fleet suffer a reduction from 64 vessels to 60 during the same 12-month period.An MoD spokesman said: \u0027Number of aircraft does not equate to capability.\u0027The UK continues to have the aircraft needed to meet our global operational commitments and we are investing in a world class air force to counter the threats we will face in the future.\u0027Our state-of-the-art F-35

Pharaonic in its scale and ambition, the under-construction metropolis is the vision of the country’s former emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al Thani, born in part from the desire to ersify the Qatari economy and distance it from oil dependence.Financed by the government via the Qatari Diar real estate company, the city was initially conceived in 2005 but development truly took off when Qatar was announced as the host of the 2022 World Cup.It is also a showpiece in the government’s Vision 2030 sustainable development plan, with a range of features from water-sensitive landscaping plans to a district cooling system designed to save 65m tons of CO2 a year.Although an independent urban centre, Lusail is also an extension of Qatar’s capital, Doha. The two cities are 15km apart and will be connected by subways and state-of-the-art train lines. Developers are hoping people will attracted by the city’s marina, one of the biggest in the Gulf, as well as its shopping malls, business districts, golf courses, artificial islands and amusement park. Scores of new cities are rising across the world from previously untouched desert and jungle, or on land “reclaimed” from the sea. While the history of cities built from scratch is long, the scale of the current epidemic is beyond anything seen before.\u0026nbspAnother 2.5 billion people are predicted to move to cities over the next 30 years and the trend shows no signs of stopping.

We remember past visions of future cities and ask, is there ever a good reason to start a city from scratch?Qataris remain in the minority: of the country’s 2.6 million inhabitants, they number approximately 313,000. The exponential population growth is largely due to workers from developing countries such as Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh, working mainly as manual labour for the country’s building projects, including the infrastructure needed for the World Cup.But given the well-documented poor working conditions and effective segregation of these workers from the Qatari population, it seems evident that the manicured environs of Lusail are not aimed at them. Instead, the city seems designed to tempt more highly skilled workers from developed nations as part of the country’s preparation for the post-oil era.I meet two of Lusail’s first residents: Chaiun Chung, a communications specialist from South Korea, and his friend and neighbour Sophie Nowland, an Australian who moved to Qatar to teach. Chung was drawn to the city because of its newness, its cheapness in comparison with Doha and the surprising new architecture springing up every day – the houses in Chung and Nowland’s neighbourhood, for example, are inspired by Italian architecture. Lusail’s planned transport connections to Doha and lack of traffic are also attractive, and not just to Chung. “Two years ago, there was nobody here,” he says. “In the last year, there are more and more people.”The Qatari government hopes Lusail will position the country as a model for the Middle East in terms of sustainability, human development, economy, tourism and sport. When the city’s 80,000-seat stadium hosts the opening match and final of the 2022 football World Cup, the eyes of the world will be upon it.For now, however, only a small part of the city has been built. Just a few offices and one coffee shop are open, but already people are coming from Doha to wander around the marina at night when the weather is cooler. More will doubtless make their way to explore the new city in a few months when the metro is up and running.As the city grows, landscaping turns more and more desert sand green, and yet more land is reclaimed from the sea to be built upon. As I watch this city of the future being constructed before my eyes, I have the very strong sense that anything is possible.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/933249d24608932fc897fcaa5e8c8bb2bdc9e977/269_92_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89438b6d5ef5cb90fc7a6e91e568aa9a","title":"cinema disney broken up","story":"The studio has been consuming its rivals – and creating a film industry devoid of the innovation championed by its founderIt’s the kind of commercial supremacy about which Walt Disney and his brother Roy probably fantasised when they founded the Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio in 1923: just past the midway mark of 2019, the year’s four top-grossing films in US cinemas are all Disney releases. (The same would apply globally, but for the disruption of Chinese sci-fi blockbuster The Wandering Earth.)The four films in question – Avengers: Endgame, Captain Marvel, Aladdin and Toy Story 4 – have collectively grossed more than £4.3bn worldwide, with the studio’s noisily hyped remake of The Lion King set to join their ranks and substantially boost that number next week. More money-spinning sequels – Frozen 2, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Maleficent: Mistress of Evil – lie in wait for autumn and winter.The Walt Disney Company is sitting so pretty that the recent underperformance of its Tim Burton-directed Dumbo remake, which has “only” netted £275m, can be dismissed as immaterial. After all, it’s still twice the gross of fellow “big five” studio Paramount’s top release of the year, Rocketman.On the one hand, this degree of bludgeoning industry dominance is awe-inspiring. At a time when other companies, threatened by the rise of Netflix and other fast-evolving home entertainment platforms, are fretting over how to lure audiences away from the sofa and into the cinema, Disney seems to have little trouble churning out one big-screen event after another. That has, admittedly, come at some cost to its longtime reputation as a house of imagination: you may have noticed that all nine aforementioned Disney titles are either franchise entries, sequels or remakes of the studio’s own back catalogue, following the recent industry maxim that original scripts are a risky sell. (In this year’s list of top 10 US grossers, Jordan Peele’s very adult horror invention Us stands as a lone alien object in a sea of established properties.)“I believe in being an innovator,” Walt Disney once said, though he reckoned without the challenges of today’s cinema market, in which giving the people what they want amounts to giving them characters and stories they already know. That may be the most effective way of keeping the big-screen experience alive in 2019 – but it feels a hollow victory. Disney, of course, is hardly alone in this philosophy: it just has it worked out more consistently than its hit-and-miss rival studios.Yet as long as Disney maintains its box-office stranglehold – and you have to go back to 2014 for a year in which it didn’t top the annual chart – it will be regarded as the principal architect of an ever more uniform and homogeneous popular cinema. In March, Disney subsumed one of its most venerable rivals, completing its $71bn (£57bn) acquisition of 21st Century Fox, a deal that makes its 2009 purchase of Marvel Entertainment for £2.5bn look ever more of a bargain.Save for the Spider-Man franchise – still owned by Sony – Disney and Marvel’s brands are now thoroughly and lucratively intermeshed, both commercially and aesthetically. Now, having shaken off the embarrassment of inherited duds such as Dark Phoenix, Disney will be aiming for similar synthesis with such upcoming Fox heavy-hitters as Steven Spielberg’s remake of West Side Story and, of course, James Cameron’s looming trail of Avatar sequels.This kind of Hollywood imperialism is not encouraging news if you fear that reduced competition begets reduced creativity, even as Disney’s substantial fanbase – umbilically bound by the childhood nostalgia in which the corporation trades – zealously cheers it on. What other acquisitions are on its wishlist? Are we seeing a return to the rigidly controlled Hollywood studio system of the 1940s and 1950s – only with one studio effectively as the system? If so, a movement not dissimilar to the demands to break up big tech currently rippling towards Silicon Valley might be in order.Yet Disney has rather cunningly advertised itself less as one monopolising entity than as a contrasting collective of minds and voices, as tellingly suggested by distribution president Cathleen Taff’s statement before unveiling its 2019-2022 release calendar: “We’re excited to put in place a robust and erse slate that lays the foundation of our long-term strategy, bringing together a breadth of films from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, Fox, Fox Searchlight and Blue Sky Studios to create an extraordinary collection of cinematic experiences for audiences around the world.”So, one big happy family, then. Will Fox and Fox Searchlight – the Oscar-favoured independent force behind such distinctly un-Disneyish art films as The Favourite and Terrence Malick’s upcoming A Hidden Life – continue as before, simply adding a more refined, adult-skewing string to Disney’s bow? Perhaps, though this week brought the surprising announcement that one of Fox’s glossiest autumn prospects – The Woman in the Window, Joe Wright’s Amy Adams-starring adaptation of the Dan Mallory bestseller – has been pushed back to 2020 by Disney after it expressed concern over “confused” test screening audiences. It could well be that the film’s a mess and the planned reshoots are justified. Still, it’s hard not to speculate that Disney has its own firm ideas of what kind of storytelling its viewers want – and as long as it holds all the box-office receipts, it will be awfully hard to argue with.• Guy Lodge writes a weekly film column for the Observer New Review and is the chief UK film critic for Variety"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f512326c666bc1c9e55cc1fc203a309f3f0f5877/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6475ffe99c7390d518250973054ecbda","title":"faith religion politics british attitudes survey","story":"In these dark times the Enlightenment itself can seem in retreat. Fact-free emotion wins over reason and the hard-earned liberalism of centuries is thrown into reverse. Donald Trump and Boris Johnson succeed by flamboyantly disregarding truth.

The frightening rise of anti-vaxxers puts at risk the gigantic progress in disease control. Are we heading back to the dark ages?No, is the answer. Breathe a sigh of relief. These strange irrational phenomena are only marginalia in the onward march of reason. The annual British Social Attitudes survey is the best mirror we have to show us an image of who we are, what we think and how we change over the decades since it began asking the same questions in 1983.For a third of state schools to be run by the religions is an affront: their subtle social selection is the draw that brings young parents (briefly) to their knees in the pews to get their children into church schools. The segregation of children by faith is getting worse – a dangerous trend in a world of populist politicians stirring up race hate. This country’s firmly secular values need to be upheld against the religious resistance to sex and relationship lessons in over-segregated schools. The right to religious freedom doesn’t supersede national education values.This visceral Brexit war between old and young, between regions and outlook, has often felt like a conflict between reason and unreason, between economic fact and emotional national identity. But the BSA report reassuringly finds that beneath the surface of our present turmoil, superstition and unreason are on the retreat, with the onward march of trust in evidence-based scientific truths.

He denies the allegations.Baez and Sullivan started representing Weinstein in January, when the former movie producer overhauled his legal team for the first time. That happened after his original lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, lost a hard-fought bid to get the case thrown out.Pamela Robillard Mackey, who represented Kobe Bryant in his 2003 Colorado sexual assault case, and ex-Manhattan prosecutor Duncan Levin were also hired in January and have since left.Weinstein’s new lawyers, Donna Rotunno and Damon Cheronis, both of Chicago, did not return phone calls on Wednesday.They join Arthur Aidala, a New York City lawyer whose clients have included rapper 50 Cent, former Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz and the late Fox News chief Roger Ailes.Baez and Sullivan didn’t respond to email inquiries on Wednesday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2390a8bc55bddc27f1318e27f82835cce94cd44a/0_19_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b464e756b53de7cecb2774b560dab2ae","title":"iran filmfarsi remains biggest secret in cinema history","story":"For many Iranians, the oft-forgotten films are a souvenir of a lost past, painting a picture of life before the 1979 revolutionShortly after the 1979 Iranian revolution, the country’s national newspapers published a joint subpoena, unique in film history. All the key stars of “filmfarsi” – a form of popular cinema that embodied the aspirations and illusions of a modernising society – were summoned to the revolutionary court. The careers of hundreds of actors and directors ended overnight. Unlike the Hollywood blacklisting of the McCarthy era, there was not even the opportunity for a mock hearing. The cinema, seen as emblematic of corruption, “westoxification” and the decadence of the ousted Pahlavi regime, was consigned to oblivion.So marked the end of one of the most thriving film industries in the Middle East, a cinema of song and dance, sex and seduction, violence and vengeance, which combined the western genres with local flavour – although always with an eye on Shia Islam, as the ultimate code to put everything in its right order. Iranian cinema was anything but limited to poetry and humanism, although both elements existed in some of the pre-revolutionary arthouse films. Millions of filmgoers cared more about a good pop song, the latest tearjerker and a car chase through the streets of Tehran.Cinema was introduced to the country as the exclusive toy of the Qajar kings. Sporadic efforts to create a national cinema were interrupted by the allied occupation of neutral Iran during the second world war. After the war, the new shah, the Swiss-educated Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, was so busy making Iran a modern “island of stability” (to quote Jimmy Carter) that cinema was abandoned in favour of social and military infrastructure.What happened, however, was that people on the ground took control of the camera, telling their own tales. They even created their own national genres such as “jaheli” films, stories of tough guys in hats from south Tehran, pulling knives in the name of honour and hooking up with local cabaret singers, eventually saving them from a life of disgrace.The term “filmfarsi” was coined to ridicule the sloppiness of these films. Today, they can be more properly judged in the broader context of Iranian mainstream cinema: genre films with popular stars village girls lured by the big city but eventually returning to the tranquillity of home – as if everybody knew from the start that the modernisation project wouldn’t last. A miniature of Iranian society, foreshadowing things to come.Not surprisingly, women were stereotyped: mothers or whores with little middle ground. Yet filmfarsi also offered them a chance to be seen. It even offered women agency and power. If the forced unveiling of women under the first Pahlavi was a crucial point in the history of Iranian women, the real unveiling, although highly fetishised, was through these movies, in which women travelled, taught, fought and settled their scores.Something rare, euphoric and mad was recorded on celluloid: the Iranian way of life after the second world war, with all its paradoxes. Even the sleaziest films became documents. If the majority of key Iranian arthouse films of the 1960s and 1970s were set in villages and rural areas (a tradition continued until after the revolution), filmfarsi was about the thriving cities, which were expanding blindly, thanks to petrodollars.Boy-meets-girl stories found an edge, as the Iranian way of life encountered a new world through American, Italian, French and Bollywood films. When Iranians loved a foreign film, they sometimes remade it. There is an Iranian version of Hitchcock’s Vertigo, as well as a feminist version of Billy Wilder’s Sabrina, in which two sisters compete for the affection of the family chauffeur. The result was often camp and only the barest traces of the original storyline remained. However, a confused and frustrating search for an identity through this bizarre process is detectable. Across roughly 1,000 films, they forged it in a remarkable way.For many Iranians today, filmfarsi is the souvenir of a lost past. For me, after spending the past four years making a film about filmfarsi, I view the films as documents of how Iranian society changed its schizophrenic nature in grabbing on to anything “modern” with one hand and rejecting it with the other.It is also the story of a tragedy, both cinematic and real. One of the turning points of the Iranian revolution, and the key moment when the bells tolled the death of cinema, was when the Islamists set fire to the Rex in south-west Iran, where people were watching the second run of The Deer – an immensely popular 1974 drama about two former classmates rebelling against the system, which tested the censors. Directed by Masoud Kimiai and starring some of popular cinema’s best-loved figures, it transformed filmfarsi into something profound and politically committed. Four hundred people burned to death in that cinema. The pain is still there. But out of its ashes arose a new Iranian cinema.Forty years after the Iranian revolution, filmfarsi, with all its joyful vibrancy and popular eclecticism, remains one of the biggest secrets of film history.• Ehsan Khoshbakht’s Filmfarsi will world premiere at Cinema Rediscovered at Bristol Watershed on 26 July"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0592ccb99a7c7998eddf64a3c9d158f48f2a0851/0_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a371667b78c20cfa7df771b3eee15b14","title":"the brink review steve bannon documentary far right","story":"Alison Klayman’s intriguing documentary tracks the slippery strategist following his departure from the Trump White HouseAudiences should be wary of documentaries featuring charmingly roguish, twinkly-eyed reactionary villains who play liberal film-makers for suckers. This is what happened during Errol Morris’s feeble film about Donald Rumsfeld. And Morris’s own study of media executive and White House strategist Steve Bannon, American Dharma, was considered a failure because slippery-yet-cordial Bannon wouldn’t take the bait.Bannon, himself a dabbler in film-making who managed the US video release of Michael Moore’s Fahrenheit 911, knows the score. But Alison Klayman’s film does better than most, as she follows Bannon in the luxury wilderness period that followed his sacking by Donald Trump – pursuing a grisly consciousness-raising world tour of far-right media organisations, breaking bread with blandly self-pitying lite-fascists all over Europe and travelling on a handsome private jet. Who’s paying for that, you may ask? Bannon isn’t saying. And what is he on the brink of? Power? Defeat? It’s an ambiguity that is important to the American far right, so they can be excitingly on the verge of victory while nursing their trembly-lipped underdogvictim status.Bannon himself is on a permanent euphoric high from his celeb status, and uncritical media treatment, particularly among saucer-eyed Euro right-wingers. But as last year’s US midterm election results come in, his cheery manner slips and he starts shouting at people. A Brit underling fails him, and Bannon appoints his gruesome nephew Sean Bannon (Scrappy to his Scooby) as this man’s replacement in the organisation he toe-curlingly calls The Movement.What emerges from Klayman’s film is how very important Brexit Britain is as a self-vivisecting research animal in Bannon’s experimental thinking. He uses irony and satire to disarm his leftie tormentors (“What would Leni do? How would Leni cut it?” he muses out loud after watching one of his propaganda films, naturally meaning Leni Riefenstahl). Gags like these wrong-foot crybaby liberals but give a deadly serious nod and a wink to his base, as if to say, “Of course we’re extremely fascist! Isn’t it thrilling?”The heroes of this film are  journalist Paul Lewis, who politely declines to be bamboozled or alpha-dogged by Bannon, and Good Morning Britain’s Susanna Reid, who directly confronts Bannon about the deadly riot in Charlottesville. The utter creep is Bannon’s slimy Brit understrapper who takes his boss on a tour of London’s Edgware Road, traditionally and uncontroversially the home of Middle East businesses. Like the less-than-speakable Katie Hopkins, he claims it as evidence of Britain recently turning Islamist. • The Brink is released in the UK on 12 July."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b04481bc372a83fe42cfce91717473ce2c555c1/0_198_3504_2103/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5598630626286ef218a77dc832e2fbe","title":"week in geek space evaders sci fi sequels","story":"In explaining their premises, sci-fi movies lose the mystique that makes them great. When aliens invade, sometimes less is moreIf there is a perfect blueprint for sci-fi and fantasy film-making, it is probably something we’ll need a time machine to discover. Until recently, Hollywood appeared to be under the impression that any and all screenwriting issues could be resolved by hiring Tom Cruise – that was until twin turkeys Oblivion and The Mummy left us feeling like we needed to relocate our brains, so nonsensical were their tangled plots.Christopher McQuarrie was partially responsible for The Mummy’s Golden Raspberry-nominated screenplay, but he’s also helped create some of Cruise’s more palatable moments, from two cracking Mission: Impossible episodes as director – Rogue Nation and last year’s Fallout – to the barnstorming alien-invasion tale Edge of Tomorrow, which he co-wrote. Now McQuarrie has taken to Twitter to share his “cure-all” for fantasy storytelling. And it goes a little like this: never explain.In a thread relating to classic movies, McQuarrie told Bill \u0026amp Ted writer Ed Solomon: “The worst scene in Edge of Tomorrow is an attempt to understand the alien’s intention. Compliments of the studio. They are invaders. They invade. As humans, we should not have to have this explained.”Further down the thread, the Logan director James Mangold chimed in: “The Alien in Alien did not feel generic ’cause it had character and personality, predominantly defined by its ruthless killing efficiency. It didn’t need explanation. We understood it and it did not feel generic. It was a shatteringly original creature in its purity of purpose.”Solomon pointed out that the classic Bill Murray fantasy-comedy Groundhog Day was floundering at the production stage until the film-makers “decided to take OUT the explanation of why it was happening. Without the explanation (something studios are ALWAYS trying to get more of), it suddenly worked.”Does this explain what has been going wrong with the genre over the past decade or so? Is there a battle going on between studio executives desperate for expositional screenplays and film-makers keen to avoid ruining the enigma of a story. The result has been such movies such as Oblivion and The Mummy, both of which felt like exercises in fitting dodecahedronal pegs into tessaracontagonal holes.The issue is particularly pertinent in fantasy and sci-fi because it is often the magical, unexplainable elements of a story that make it so intriguing. Hence, Star Wars became infinitely more boring when we discovered, in George Lucas’s horrible prequels, that the source of Jedi and Sith power was a species of tiny aliens known as midichloreans. The xenomorphs in Alien where nowhere near so scary once, in Prometheus, it was explained that they were the result of genetic experiments. Terminator Salvation showed us what all fans of the saga thought we’d been waiting for – the Earth, post-Judgment Day – and we all ran crying for our VHS copies of the 1984 original.Of course, if nothing in these movies is ever explained, they can become throwaway confections, the celluloid equivalent of a bag of popcorn. But perhaps this is McQuarrie’s point. A more cerebral sci-fi movie, such as Denis Villeneuve’s Arrival, requires exposition, or we would find ourselves staring pointlessly at shadowy hand monsters for two hours. It is the film’s shattering revelations about the nature of the aliens’ existence that makes it so memorable.But films such as Edge of Tomorrow, Alien, Star Wars and Terminator, which are essentially pulpy affairs and all the better for it, do not requite such exposition. Which perhaps explains where Hollywood has been going wrong recently. If it looks like a gung-ho action movie, sounds like a gung-ho action movie and feels like a gung-ho action movie, it probably is a gung-ho action movie – rather than the basis of a dozen increasingly portentous and expositional sequels."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9649cc5763b6fdb991e7e38f9c650695cc34eafc/0_650_2240_1344/master/2240.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d87fd437c06b034c4b8354ab67f0ee15","title":"worst holidays in cinema ranked","story":"As Spiderman: Far From Home and Midsommar bring the well-worn trip-gone-wrong back to the big screen, here are 20 of film’s most appalling vacationsThe sequel to the film of the sitcom, The Inbetweeners 2 bravely wrestles with the question of which is more revolting, a faceful of someone else’s urine or a faceful of someone else’s faeces. Judging by all the vomiting that Will (Simon Bird) does after he receives the latter, the answer is faeces. But that’s not all the Brits abroad have to put up with in Australia. Neil (Blake Harrison) kills a dolphin, Simon (Joe Thomas) gets beaten up, and when their car runs out of fuel in the fiercely hot outback, it looks – for two whole hours – as if they will all die of dehydration.If you can forgive the less-than-PC depiction of the primitive islanders in the last reel, Buster Keaton’s most commercially successful film is also one of his most delightful. It’s not so much fun for the characters, though. Keaton stars as Rollo Treadway, a top-hatted toff who proposes to his neighbour (Kathryn McGuire). After she turns him down, he decides to go on their honeymoon cruise to Honolulu by himself, but they end up adrift together on a deserted liner. Highlight: Rollo fends off one swordfish by using another swordfish as a weapon.Any cultural study of British attitudes towards Europe should begin with an analysis of Carry on Abroad. This later, lesser entry in the series sends the regulars on a package holiday to the island of Elsbels (get it?) on the Costa Bomm (get it?). The hotel is unfinished and understaffed, the phones don’t work, sand pours from the taps, mosquitoes pour in through the windows and then, finally, the resort is washed away by a flash flood. No wonder the team opted for a British caravanning holiday three films later in Carry on Behind.By the time the middle-aged, middle-class Anna (Kathryn Worth) joins a group of friends in a rented Tuscan villa, the occupants have already split themselves into the “youngs” and the “olds”. Anna, of course, is relegated to the “olds”, but would much rather hang out with the “youngs”, the teenage Oakley (a pre-Loki Tom Hiddleston) in particular. Her discomfort may be mild compared with the physical pain suffered by some of the other holidaymakers on this list, but Joanna Hogg’s acute debut will be excruciating to anyone who has ever felt uncool and out-of-place.Actual holidays are a risky business, but virtual holidays can be just as hazardous. In Paul Verhoeven’s Total Recall, adapted from a Philip K Dick short story, We Can Remember It for You Wholesale, a construction worker (Arnold Schwarzenegger) pays to have the memories of a trip of a lifetime implanted in his brain. Unfortunately, the process reveals that he is really a secret agent with a history of Martian missions. Or maybe he really is a construction worker, and it’s the Martian missions that are all a fantasy. Either way, he won’t recall it as a relaxing break.We all know that Los Angeles is the safest place on Earth, while Paris is the most dangerous, so when 17-year-old Kim (Maggie Grace) tells her dad (Liam Neeson) that she is off to the city of light, the retired CIA agent assumes, quite rightly as it turns out, that she will be abducted by Albanian sex traffickers as soon as she steps out of Charles de Gaulle airport. You would think that poor Kim would stay in LA after that, but she heads to Istanbul in the sequel. Again, Dad’s “particular set of skills” are required.Recuperating from a throat operation, a rock star (Tilda Swinton) is napping on the beach in Pantelleria when the sun is blotted out by an aeroplane. Yes, trouble is flying her way, specifically, a hedonistic ex (Ralph Fiennes) who is hoping to seduce her, along with the ex’s daughter (Dakota Johnson), who is hoping to seduce her boyfriend (Matthias Schoenaerts). Luca Guadagnino’s sensual drama becomes a thriller when one character is drowned in a swimming pool, but before that it captures the blood-boiling annoyance of having uninvited guests butt in on your holiday.Open Water is a low-budget thriller with a chilling high concept: a scuba-ing husband and wife bob to the ocean’s surface, only to find that their shuttle boat has left them stranded, miles from the Australian coast, surrounded by sharks and jellyfish. What’s even more disturbing is that it is based on a true story, unlike the two otherwise superior films that followed in its wake: in Adrift (2006), six swimmers can’t reach the deck of a luxury yacht, and in Frozen (2010) – no relation to the cartoon – three skiers are trapped in a chair lift.A New Year’s Eve party is in full swing aboard the SS Poseidon when the ageing ship is capsized by a tsunami and the passengers experience what the pithy poster called: “Hell, upside down”. Still, what can you expect when Leslie “Naked Gun” Nielsen is your captain? All-star disaster movies may not win much critical respect, but between the lethal-looking practical effects, and the full-throated yelling by Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine et al, The Poseidon Adventure still holds water, especially compared with the CGI-heavy 2006 remake.Sometimes it’s not the holiday that’s the problem, it’s what’s going on while you’re away. In Stanley Donen’s Hitchcock-ish romp, Reggie (Audrey Hepburn) is happy enough to be on a skiing trip, flirting with the handsome Peter (Cary Grant) and planning a orce. But when she gets back to her Paris apartment, she discovers that her husband has sold all of their possessions, run off with the money, got himself murdered, and set up Reggie as the target of three killers. And you thought it was grim to come home to a houseful of dead pot plants.Filmed in one breathtaking unbroken shot, an avalanche roars towards an Alpine ski resort’s restaurant terrace, where a picture-perfect family is having lunch. The husband (Johannes Kuhnke) sprints away, taking his phone and his gloves, but leaving behind his wife (Lisa Loven Kongsli) and their two children. No harm comes to anyone in Ruben Östlund’s superb Swedish comedy drama, but in that split-second of panic, the holiday is destroyed – and so is a family’s complacent image of itself. An American remake starring Will Ferrell and Julia Louis-Dreyfus is in the works.The series we might now subtitle “the crimes of Griswold” got started with this chaotic road movie, directed by Harold Ramis, written by John Hughes and starring Chevy Chase as Clark Griswold, a man who dreams of introducing his wife and children to the Walley World theme park. For a hit Hollywood comedy, National Lampoon’s Vacation is surprisingly subversive in its demolition of the archetypal all-American family holiday. And, as in so many of the films on this list, a pet dog doesn’t survive the journey.Maybe it’s not such a terrible holiday for Lenny (Charles Grodin). After all, it is while he is lounging in Miami Beach that he meets Kelly (Cybill Shepherd), a blonde goddess he imagines to be his soulmate. The only snag is that he happens to be on his honeymoon. As well as sensing that he and Kelly are not destined to live happily ever after, the viewer can’t help but feel sorry for Lenny’s bride, Lila (Jeannie Berlin). Played by the daughter of the film’s director, Elaine May, she isn’t just betrayed, she is sunburnt to a crisp and confined to her hotel room.“We’ve gone on holiday by mistake!” With that one glorious line, written by Bruce Robinson and snapped by a rain-sodden Richard E Grant, Withnail and I speaks for everyone who has ever been stuck in a dreary cottage in the middle of nowhere with no heating, no food and, at that stage, no access to the finest wines available to humanity. To their credit, Withnail (Grant) and his flatmate (Paul McGann) are resourceful enough to strangle, half-pluck and cook a chicken. But then Withnail’s Uncle Monty (Richard Griffiths) turns up, and things go from bad to worse.You have to hand it to David (David Naughton) and Jack (Griffin Dunne). In John Landis’s wonderful horror comedy, these two Americans eschew the tourist trail in favour of a hike on the Yorkshire moors and a pint in the Slaughtered Lamb (Brian Glover and Rik Mayall play two of the patrons). It’s just a shame that a hungry lycanthrope puts a crimp in their travel plans. Jack winds up as a decomposing ghost, and David – with a little help from Rick Baker’s game-changing prosthetic makeup – undergoes cinema’s most agonising man-to-beast transformation.Jordan Peele’s Us gave the “holiday-home invasion” subgenre a mind-boggling twist, but if any film is going to prompt you to install a security system in your lakeside getaway, it’s Michael Haneke’s Funny Games. From the moment two polite young psychopaths, Peter (Frank Giering) and Paul (Arno Frisch), knock on a family’s door and ask for eggs, the tension never slackens. Yes, Haneke’s nightmarish masterpiece is a postmodern comment of the viewer’s complicity in Hollywood screen violence. But, more importantly, it’s terrifying.Two American backpackers (Jay Hernandez and Derek Richardson) are lured to Slovakia by the prospect of no-strings sex with the eager locals, and when they are maimed with power drills, chainsaws and blow torches instead, it’s hard to be all that upset. Critics were ided on whether Eli Roth’s Hostel was crass torture porn or a satirical caricature of American ignorance, but its gruesome vision of an exotic, treacherous Europe isn’t so different from what you can see at a cinema near you now in Midsommar or, for that matter, Spider-Man: Far From Home.Deliverance is a part of the language. Even if you haven’t seen John Boorman’s Oscar-nominated wilderness thriller, its title alone is enough to conjure up thoughts of savage mountain men, broken bones, twanging banjos and everything you else you might dread when you set off on a canoeing holiday, up to and including the phrase: “Squeal like a pig!” Ironically, despite all the unpleasantness endured by the film’s four Atlanta city-slickers (Burt Reynolds, Jon Voight, Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox), Deliverance is so scenic that it turned its location, Rabun County in Georgia, into a tourism hotspot.When a petrol station attendant urges you to stay on the main road, be sure to listen. That’s the lesson we have been taught by countless backwoods-horror yarns. But Wes Craven’s The Hills Have Eyes was made long before the so-called “gas station of doom” became a much-loved and parodied trope, so we can’t blame the Carter family for ignoring the warnings and detouring into the desert.

Too much deference can be almost as badI had my first waitressing job in Chancery Lane, a very lawyer-heavy corner of London, in 1991. I had been hired specifically to flog dessert wine at the end of the meal, and I learned the following: if people want dessert wine, they ask for it. Getting a person who doesn’t already want it to drink tokay is like getting a baby to take an antibiotic – you would basically have to squirt it into their mouths with a syringe. I also learned every single way in which a lawyer can be rude to a waiter: the cross-examination (“Why on earth would I want dessert wine?”) the stonewall the sneering grandeur (“We’re actually in the middle of a conversation”). What is wrong with these people, I always thought. They can surely see that I’m not doing this on my own account.After that, I had a couple of waiting jobs that were OK – corporate events in museums, where everyone was wild with excitement because they were going to snog someone from HR, and you couldn’t put a foot wrong – but realised quite quickly that if you wanted to be treated like an equal, you had to work in a pub. Indeed, drinkers treat you like an equal at the beginning of the night, and by the end, they are treating you like some kind of angel. Diners, gone bad, are the opposite: you’re staff at the beginning and a serf at the end.This is at the kernel of most significant crimes against waiting staff: treating them as irritating accessories to the dining experience, like wasps. In my wide-ranging focus group (Twitter) on what waiters hate now, nearly 30 years later, it’s all in this category: clicking your fingers saying you’ve decided and then making someone stand next to you like a lemon while you actually decide not making eye contact, especially when you pass back the payment machine (the message of which is especially chilling: this transaction is over, ergo you, waiting person, have ceased to exist). Lots of people said they do a Fawlty Towers when someone’s fingers click – look under the table and say: “Is there a dog under there?”There are strategies galore for dealing with rudeness, which mostly end with a waiter spitting in your food, but the main reason you should behave properly as a diner is that you are human and so are they. You have to do more than not be rude yourself, incidentally you have to be a good ally and police rudeness on your table. I would never eat with anyone who made waiters wait for the sake of it.It may shock and appal you to learn that there are behaviours you think are harmless that waiters hate: folding crisp packets (this is more gastropub behaviour) into tiny squares and wedging them into crevices, bottle necks and suchlike ripping up napkins into tiny pieces and sprinkling them about (I have some sympathy for this – it’s the kind of thing you might do on a terrible date instead of sticking a fork into your own eye – however, don’t do it). Some of these are ways you think you’re “helping”, such as piling an extra plate on to an existing pile, or handing something to someone when they are already laden. “I’m actually trained at this,” one waiter told me. “I know exactly how many plates I can get on to each arm and in what formation.” Chuck a rogue knife into that, and you’re essentially saying: “I have no conception of the amount of skill involved in your work.”It’s annoying, however, when you overdo your respect, such as asking the waitress what she would order. There are restaurants where the staff have tasted everything, a mark of mutual respect and honour between employer and employee, but there are heaps of places where the waiters are just given a bowl of pasta at the end of a shift, and they don’t bloody know what you should order, between the chicken parfait and the asparagus. Then they have to go: “The parfait is very popular,” and you’re in this opinion no-man’s-land – does that mean it’s good or that other people are stupid? – and you cannot either take the recommendation or politely reject it.Good diner behaviour is when you treat the staff as you would a member of your family who was bringing you some food: say please and thank you say thank you like you mean it move your phone when the food arrives, and anything else that is in the way wait until they are free before you stage a fresh request apologise when you spill if you are making a complaint, unless it’s one specifically about the service, frame it as constructive bitching about a mutual acquaintance rather than an accusation.At my first waiter interaction – “Can I bring you some water?” – I always say: “Nah, I’m all right.” It establishes the following: I am not a demanding person feel free to try and flog me some dessert wine later, if you like I intend to enjoy this occasion, by which I mean, really go for it. Of course it helps that I don’t like water."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4328f3ba8f7267620069caaa4fe129e525511551/0_51_5911_3547/master/5911.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6908b189d409062df54e75c7ae422d82","title":"dream holiday rental house decent kitchen knives jay rayner","story":"They’re never sharp, the coffee mugs are too small – and as for those glass chopping boards…Being a fully paid-up member of the acutely tasteful, exquisitely nuanced, belly-obsessed bourgeoisie is a dreadful struggle, and never more so than when summer holidays approach. For with the anticipation – of long lunches on bougainvillea-scented terraces with sea views, of chilled glasses of rosé as dusk falls – comes The Fear. It is the stomach-churning fear of the, oh God, ill-equipped kitchen.This year we have rented a house in Greece, and while I have flicked endlessly through the online photographs, imagining myself inhabiting the scene, it is the pictures of the kitchen I have lingered over, in search of signs. Except there never are any, because images like this are an exercise in advanced OCD. Any clutter, any objects which might leave clues, have been tidied away. I’m delighted there’s a wine fridge, obviously. But what I really need to know is this: what are the kitchen knives like?It’s a stupid question. Kitchen knives in rentals are always crap. They are never bought to be sharp and perfectly weighted. They are bought to look like kitchen knives, not to actually be them. I therefore start making a list of the things I’ll need to take with me, to make this the dream holiday that I’ve been playing out in my mind.Firstly, there really will have to be those kitchen knives from home. And while we’re at it what about a good chopping board? Too many rentals appear to think that glass chopping boards, which produce the sound of nails down a blackboard when the blade gets through the onion, are a good idea. They aren’t. A modest non-glass one wouldn’t go amiss would it. And a cafetière. Sure, there’s a coffee machine in the pictures but it will take me days to work out how to use one of those effectively. And don’t get me started on bloody Nespresso machines and their knock-offs. The coffee always comes out lukewarm.So yes, knives, a chopping board, a cafetière. And, of course, proper sized mugs, instead of those dismal thimbles they always have. I need a bucket of coffee in the morning. I don’t want to keep going back for refills. This is about my needs, and my needs are extremely detailed. Maybe I should take a Microplane. I don’t actually own one at the moment, but perhaps now is the time to get one just so I can take it with me on holiday, along with a really good corkscrew, a proper pair of tongs and …Which is when I begin to understand the attraction of caravanning. You don’t have to take kitchen equipment with you, because the kitchen is always there. Fabulous. Which is also when the words “what have I become?” flit across my mind. If buying a caravan is the answer it must be a pretty stupid question. Where’s my sense of adventure? Where’s my spirit of improvisation?In the trailer for Gordon Ramsay: Uncharted, his new series for National Geographic, he is seen climbing trees freestyle, scaling cliff faces and driving motorbikes along needle-thin mountain paths I do hope nothing awful happens to him. He’s also seen cooking with the barest bits of kit: sticks, flints, a machete and a barely sublimated fear of male inadequacy. I think to myself: “Maybe I should be more like Gordon.”Finally, I come to my senses. Anything which makes me conclude I should imitate Ramsay is a lost cause. It’s back to plan A. I don’t need that many clothes for a good summer holiday. I don’t really need shoes or books. But believe me, I really do need some good sharp knives. It’s time to get packing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63b1a1c1c63facee76450cfe7df60bad29e22dd8/245_440_4862_2917/master/4862.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9b82793c41575377175e147084e40f3","title":"leicester premier league football","story":"Efficiency with transfers and a commitment to youth are signs of renewed ambition from the club who did the impossibleIt says much about the way that Leicester City are operating these days that their transfer plans extend well beyond this window. Forward-thinking is at the heart of an active approach to recruitment that has seen Leicester bring in three new faces already and break their transfer record with the sort of signing that suggests the club who gave us one of the great sporting fairytales of modern times could be ready to ruffle a few feathers again.Three years have passed since that incredible Premier League title success and, realistically, there was always going to be a tricky period of readjustment for everyone at Leicester. For a while the club were trying to find themselves again and, perhaps more than anything, work out where they belonged in football’s pecking order once the Champions League music had stopped playing and the memories of Andrea Bocelli bringing the house down at the King Power Stadium had started to fade.In truth, it has been a little chaotic at times. Three managers were sacked in the space of two years and Leicester brought 23 players to the club in the three seasons that followed their 5,000-1 triumph. Across that period, Leicester finished 12th and ninth twice, which makes those campaigns sound a lot more serene than they were.Now, though, there are clear signs of stability as well as renewed ambition and hunger, partly because of the appointments that have been made and the signings that have come in but also through a collective desire within the club to build on the legacy of their former owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, who was one of five people killed on that awful evening last October, when a helicopter crashed outside the King Power Stadium.Appointing Brendan Rodgers as manager in February and sanctioning the £40m signing of Youri Tielemans from Monaco this week is not a bad start.Tielemans was a class act while on loan during the second half of last season and Aiyawatt, more commonly known as “Top”, was resolute in his determination to bring the Belgium international back on a permanent basis, backing Jon Rudkin, the director of football, even when Monaco were digging their heels in over the finances.Aged 22 and prodigiously talented, Tielemans attracted interest from Manchester United this summer but they never made a formal offer and the midfielder was not going to wait around and find out whether that could change if players left Old Trafford or Ole Gunnar Solskjær missed out on other targets. Tielemans wanted to come to Leicester and made that clear.Crucially, Leicester were decisive when they needed to be with Tielemans and the same has been true with the signings of Ayoze Pérez and James Justin. With both those transfers, clubs tried and failed to hijack the deals at the last minute, after Leicester had stolen a march.Having an owner who is prepared to back the judgment of his manager and staff helps Leicester greatly in that respect and prevents them from being reactive in the market.In the case of Pérez, who had been attracting interest from Valencia, Napoli and Monaco, Leicester had no intention of joining the queue and playing a game. They triggered the buyout clause straight away and by the time that Monaco made a late attempt to sign Pérez, who can play wide on the right or as a second striker, the Spaniard was at Leicester’s training ground and ready to complete a £30m transfer from Newcastle. Something similar happened with Crystal Palace and Justin, who was signed from Luton for an initial £6m and will start as understudy to Ricardo Pereira, the Portuguese right-back.Identifying the right players as early as possible is key to a process that ultimately revolves around three key figures at Leicester: Rudkin, who has the trust of Top and acts as a conduit between the football side of the club and the owner Lee Congerton, who was appointed head of senior recruitment in May after following Rodgers from Celtic and the manager himself.Rodgers knows the characteristics he is looking for in each position and the staff deliver accordingly. That includes Callum Smithson and José Fontes, a multilingual Portuguese who swapped investment banking for the football industry. Those two oversee the technical scouting operation and, while they may not get much of a mention outside of the club, they are highly respected within.There is a collective drive at Leicester to discover, improve and recruit exciting young talent. Harvey Barnes, Hamza Choudhury, James Maddison and Demarai Gray are England Under-21 internationals. Tielemans (22), Justin (21) and Pérez (25), the three acquisitions so far this summer, are at an age where they have the potential to get better and better. Ben Chilwell, the England left-back, is 22 Pereira, the rampaging full-back on the opposite flank, is 25.Throw in the experience and quality of Jonny Evans, Kasper Schmeichel and Jamie Vardy and it is easy to make a case that Leicester have a genuine chance of breaking into the top six, especially now they have a manager in Rodgers who knows not only how to get the best out of players but also how to get them playing with a clear identity – something never apparent under his predecessor, Claude Puel.The one curveball is Harry Maguire and it would be fair to say that Leicester’s prospects of reeling in Manchester United or Arsenal will be considerably stronger if they can hold on to the England international. That appears unlikely on the face of it, although Leicester are adamant that Maguire will depart only on their terms, which is believed to be for a fee in excess of the £75m that Southampton received for Virgil van Dijk.If that valuation is met, Leicester have a decision to make as to whether they pursue a replacement or invest the money elsewhere in the squad, bearing in mind that they paid £19m for the Turkey international Caglar Soyuncu and £13m for the Croat Filip Benkovic last summer, both of whom are centre-backs.No matter how that Maguire saga plays out, though, it feel as if Leicester are in a good place again. There is a real buzz about the state-of-the-art training ground that will be ready to move into next summer, an ambitious manager with a proven track record of developing youngsters, an exciting group of players under his watch, and an owner committed to fulfilling the wishes of his late father. The next couple of seasons could be fun."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f27396f6f6ddd3c0fa46fc443a44d97293c3ea05/0_0_3270_1962/master/3270.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88ed43be7f280ee0e9ed6f3cabf8cd8e","title":"sam allardyce says turned down chance to take vacant newcastle manager job football","story":"Steve Bruce is poised to be appointed as Newcastle United’s manager after asking permission from Sheffield Wednesday to talk to the club.With meetings scheduled to take place in the next 24 hours it is thought Bruce could be confirmed as Rafa Benítez’s successor as early as the weekend, with compensation for Wednesday the only likely sticking point.Wednesday’s chairman, Dejphon Chansiri, is prepared to put up a fight to keep his manager, though given Bruce’s evident desire to speak to Newcastle a more realistic battle may concern the amount of money the Championship club receive. Bruce has been at Wednesday only since January and is on a one-year rolling contract.Newcastle initially felt a payment of around £1m would be enough to secure his release though sources close to Wednesday believe the club feel entitled to ask for more, with some suggestions the full compensation package will be closer to £5m. That might be too much for Mike Ashley, who wanted a reliable replacement for Benítez and believed Bruce might be obtained quite cheaply, and as the 58-year-old is already unpopular with Newcastle fans because of his time as Sunderland manager it might appear the club are paying over the odds for a less than ideal candidate.Yet with less than a month of the transfer window remaining and Newcastle in China on a pre-season tour next week, the club are in need of a manager before they can start signing players, and preferably one with Premier League experience. Bruce, a Geordie by birth and a boyhood Newcastle supporter, has plenty of that and though conditions at St James’ Park under Ashley are presently so unappealing that Sam Allardyce has said he turned down the chance to return, it appears the former Sunderland, Wigan and Aston Villa manager is less capable of resisting the Tyneside challenge. Allardyce told TalkSport: “I was very flattered that I was considered but it’s that thing … ‘don’t go back’.”Wednesday are entitled to feel disappointed if Bruce goes. Even though they had relegation concerns at the beginning of the year they allowed Bruce to take a planned month off following a couple of medical issues and the death of his parents, and they must have been hoping the manager could continue to build on the good work of his first half season at Hillsborough. After an unpromising start Wednesday finished a respectable 12th but if Bruce turns up at Newcastle he will go straight into another battle with relegation.Newcastle spent most of last season in the bottom third of the Premier League, eventually saved by Benitez’s organisational ability and goals from Ayoze Pérez and Salomón Rondón, though all three have left along with the out-of-contract midfielder Mo Diame. No players have been signed, and Newcastle are on the verge of parting with the midfield prospect Sean Longstaff to Manchester United.Whoever takes over can expect to find himself in China as early as next week and will have to supervise a chaotic pre-season before the actual football even starts"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/269e77ed299dabeab509027b6f67f7ad1ec25af5/0_365_7238_4342/master/7238.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb6ea7ce301bb15be8709a4a5c10e34a","title":"usa womens world cup nwsl victory parade","story":"It’s been a non-stop party since Megan Rapinoe and Co won the World Cup. But now the task is to see if they can grow the domestic leagueIt’s been a non-stop party for the US women’s national team since they won the World Cup on Sunday. The champagne started flowing in the locker room immediately after the US beat the Netherlands and, from the charter flight home to a ticker-tape parade in New York City, players’ Instagram accounts have featured bottle-popping, dancing and singing ever since.Once the celebrations stop, however, the players have to return to their day jobs. That means the National Women’s Soccer League, a fledgling competition now in its seventh season. If fans want to keep up with Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan, they will have to watch Reign FC and Orlando Pride. The question, of course, is whether that will happen. There was a spike after the US won the World Cup in 2015, with NWSL games selling out once USWNT players returned, and just about every club setting attendance records. The problem is that crowds then dipped once the World Cup glow faded. Portland Thorns, the biggest club in the NWSL, average more than 18,000 fans a game but they are an exception. Rapinoe’s club, Reign FC, drew fewer than 4,000 a game last season. “For whatever reason, we’re constantly having to remind people that the quality is there, the entertainment is there, and the competition is there,” Rapinoe said of the NWSL. “World Cups and big moments like these always provide that extra boost. You know it’s going to go up a level and maybe it’s not going to sustain – but we hope this time it gets there and levels out a little bit.”The more the NWSL grows, the better it is for the USWNT’s standing in the world as other countries nip at their heels. After all, the NWSL’s talent pool is partly why the US have been so successful in the last two World Cups. But other countries with strong domestic leagues, like Germany, England, France and Sweden also tend to have the strongest national teams.For the teams that made surprising runs into the knockout round of the World Cup, that global success tracks closely with new investment in domestic leagues back home. As Serie A clubs in Italy have started adding women’s sides in the past four years and the Italian federation has invested more money, the national team has benefitted, with Italy making the quarter-finals of the World Cup for the first time since 1991.Rapinoe agreed: “There’s the clearest correlation that you could possibly have with money invested in the federation and the level of play, the product on the field and the level of success these teams are having.”But the NWSL is at risk of being overtaken by its European counterparts. Europe is already a soccer hotbed but the investment has been almost exclusively reserved for the men’s game. As these countries fully embrace women’s soccer, it could negate the USA’s built-in advantage from Title IX, an anti-discrimination law that essentially created the robust and competitive college soccer system for women.And recently, it seems Europe’s women’s leagues have accelerated their growth at a faster rate than the NWSL. Barclays, the former sponsor of the English Premier League, announced earlier this year a multimillion-dollar deal with the English Women’s Super League, which includes £500,000 in prize money. Mastercard sponsor Arsenal and Olympique Lyonnais, the powerhouse French club that features more national team players than any other.In the past, the NWSL has struggled to draw those kinds of sponsors. After the US won the World Cup in 2015, the NWSL could only add sunscreen Coppertone and insect repellent Cutter to its sponsors, which already included the National Mango Board — hardly an A-list group of companies.But there’s reason for optimism that the NWSL can capitalize on the World Cup more successfully than it did four years ago. Budweiser, a longtime sponsor of the USWNT, signed on as the first official beer of the NWSL during the World Cup on a multi-year deal. As Budweiser’s vice-president of marketing said when the deal was announced: “Becoming the official beer sponsor of the NWSL is our way of not just supporting the US women’s team once every four years, but also supporting women’s soccer every single day.”A broadcast deal for the league was also confirmed during the World Cup. After the termination of a strange partnership between the NWSL and the Lifetime Channel, which is known for made-for-TV movies rather than sports, the NWSL will be shown on ESPN, in addition to having games streamed by Yahoo Sports, a much better fit.“We need more things like that,” said defender Kelley O’Hara. “Eyeballs are important and representation is important. For ESPN to have the NWSL on its channels, we need that.”The biggest asset the NWSL has going for it, however, is the players. All 23 women on the US World Cup winning squad play in the NWSL, plus another 35 who represented other countries in France. After the World Cup, the NWSL, which is still trying to find its foothold in the American sports landscape, may feel like a downgrade. But the players, who are paid by US Soccer to play in the NWSL, insist that the club game is important, too.“I haven’t won an NWSL championship yet and that’s on my list of things I want to accomplish,” said Alyssa Naeher, goalkeeper for the US and the Chicago Red Stars. “After I get through these next few days, I have to get back to Chicago to finish my season.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/294cee423a4f51d2ae0a979d08b2ba49e63025aa/0_90_2300_1380/master/2300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab43fbeb998f1d17d5ab4b67da7313a1","title":"manchester city champions league bookmakers liverpool","story":"City are serial winners with a great manager and squad but their short price is unusual when they have never reached the finalThe second week of Wimbledon is probably far too early to be thinking about football and what may happen at the business end of next season, unless you happen to be an ante-post gambler looking for some value in the long-term market before the competitions get under way.In which case you may be disappointed and surprised to find Manchester City priced as low as 4-1 to win the Champions League next season. Most bookmakers and betting exchanges have the English champions as clear favourites, with Barcelona offered at around 6-1 and Liverpool, Real Madrid and Juventus a little further out.On the face of it this seems surprising. Manchester City have yet to make an appearance in a Champions League final whereas Liverpool made it to the past two and managed to add a sixth European Cup to their impressive collection at the beginning of June. What is it about City that the bookies fear, apart from the evident suspicion that a lot of English money will be backing them on the strength of their domestic treble last season?Although it could be argued the unprecedented feat established Pep Guardiola’s side as the most formidable in the country, it could also be pointed out that the title was won by a single point ahead of Liverpool, and when City went head-to-head with their north-west rivals in the Champions League two seasons ago the outcome was emphatically in the Merseyside club’s favour.Guardiola is regarded as the brightest coach around and when Rodri turned up at the Etihad from Atlético Madrid last week he became simply the latest in a long line of elite players to describe in glowing terms the honour of working with the brains behind the marvellous Barcelona teams of a decade ago. Yet though City hired their manager on the basis of his European expertise his last Champions League final was in 2011.Jürgen Klopp has been to three finals since then, even if he did end up on the losing side in two of them. Few would argue with Rodri’s bold claim that Manchester City are amongst the most feared teams in Europe, possibly in the top two or three, though even City’s record capture admitted that Liverpool were up there too. In terms of the fear factor, in fact, especially after what happened to Barcelona at Anfield in May, Klopp’s Liverpool must now be out on their own as opponents even the leading lights of Europe would wish to avoid.It is not the case either that Europe will necessarily be dominated again by English teams. Anyone with any sense would wait and see how Barcelona and Real Madrid strengthen before parting with a sizeable chunk of money on Champions League betting. Barcelona are bound to be improved if they ever get the Antoine Griezmann deal over the line, not to mention the possible return of Neymar, while Real Madrid with Eden Hazard and maybe the odd midfield reinforcement could be a different proposition from last season with Zinedine Zidane back in charge.Perhaps the bookies feel punters might conclude that City will be concentrating on the Champions League, going all out to fill the one gap in their trophy cupboard in the same way that Liverpool simply have to be prioritising the league title after a 30-year hiatus. It is a reasonable supposition but football does not yet work in such a neat and predictable manner, especially when Premier League teams are involved.It is possible that City’s billing as Champions League favourites reflects their go-to status among the European elite. They have established themselves as serial trophy winners, they have the coach and the players in place with the money and the knowhow to strengthen the side a little more before the end of the transfer window. They are smooth operators, smoother than even their Spanish rivals over the past year or so, and at the rate of improvement they have shown in the past three seasons it can be only a matter of time before their conquest of Europe is complete.That’s the theory, anyway. In England at least, Klopp and his players are there to disprove it. One would hesitate to describe Liverpool and their manager as smooth operators in the same way as City – there is something about Klopp that not only enjoys going against the grain but appears to find it productive – but the bottom line is that the rate of improvement on Merseyside is a match for that in Manchester.Last season the two clubs were demonstrably the best in the Premier League and few expect the coming season to be any different, so why should the story in Europe take a new twist? Perhaps Liverpool’s longer odds reflect the unlikelihood of Klopp’s team reaching a third final in succession, which would be fair enough. Yet City’s short price is unusual when the side’s experience of Champions League finals is even shorter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45bfba77a35f7406aaa552ccdc390a33f66e66c4/0_0_2730_1721/master/2730.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d872e21421bbd01898fabc96e2032239 1010w","title":"tell us have you remarried your partner after divorcing them","story":"Does the marriage feel different the second time around?

Putting that extra money into an ISA or an investment portfolio, however, could make a real differencePutting money aside – whether it’s for short-term goals or major life changes – can be difficult. There’s the unappealing prospect of forgoing stuff, toning down your social life, or taking on a side hustle. But with a bit of careful planning, and a clear goal to motivate you, you can pull it off. We spoke to three people who did exactly that.To overcome the daunting prospect of putting away thousands of pounds, she broke her goal down into setting aside a few hundred pounds from her salary per month. When Sarah eventually started The Gluten Free Blogger alongside her day job, she set a new goal: to put away all the money she raised from the website. “It made it easier knowing I didn’t have to sacrifice everything and could still live my life, by funding my savings goal through a side hustle I was passionate about,” she says. Sarah’s savings plan was fairly traditional – using an ISA to build savings and putting away a little each month. Eventually, she shifted to a savings account that gave her better interest rates.Sarah recommends that anyone trying to save for a mortgage should set a monthly goal and stick to it. “I enjoyed being able to save and spend at the same time, but in hindsight it would have been nicer to commit a set amount each month and perhaps reach my goal a little quicker,” she says. Day-to-day she made small sacrifices, such as eating out less and forgoing takeaway coffees. She also decided to put off some overseas holidays until after she had raised her deposit. “As the end came nearer, it felt easier to somehow find the money.” Her next goal? Finding her dream home.She set up an investment portfolio and chose a lower-risk option. “I have always tended to take guidance and invested my money, I got an insurance policy paid out and it was all invested, for example.” Kay says that it was simple enough to amass the capital she needed to invest, by living a little more modestly. “It’s not the fact that I don’t like spending, but I’m just an ordinary, day-to-day person – I don’t yearn for fancy things,” she says. I’m very content. If I can live like I’m living now from today until tomorrow, I’ll be more than happy.”How to save to travel the world as a volunteerDorothy Selleck, 86, has spent 40 years travelling the world, volunteering in schools via the World Organisation for Early Childhood Education (OMEP). While she was still at university, Dorothy, who speaks Welsh as a first language in addition to multiple other languages, was approached by a friend who convinced her to use her skills in charity work. For weeks at a time, Dorothy would take time out from her job as a school’s inspector and visit places around the world, including Japan, India and South America. “We were still at our jobs – you couldn’t leave them for very long, but you could leave them for long enough,” she says.Dorothy paid her own way volunteering. Flights, accommodation, travel expenses and a membership fee to OMEP were funded through a full-time job and living a modest lifestyle. “I didn’t spend a great deal of money on myself,” Dorothy says. As well as setting up four separate savings accounts where she could budget her money for travel and day-to-day living expenses, Dorothy put some of her money into a house and approached HSBC for guidance on setting up an investment portfolio.Dorothy says being afforded the freedom to volunteer has allowed her to see hidden corners of the world and master three languages. Even now, long after her retirement 27 years ago she still volunteers at schools a few days a week – although much closer to home. “I’m still doing voluntary work,” she says. “It’s very important to me.”Top tips for saving for a major life goalInvestments can carry a higher risk than cash savings and you may not always get back what you put in.

The amount you have will determine what sort of plans you can turn into reality.Putting together a financial plan for each of these defining moments can give you greater freedom and choice. You’ll be able to enjoy each stage without worrying so much about money issues.If you are financially secure, you can take more informed decisions about moving jobs or changing career you may even get better deals on products such as mortgages and loans and you’ll have more time to spend on the things that matter to you – like leisure, travel and family.Taking time to set goals, thinking about what your priorities are, and putting in place a savings scheme for the future are all essential elements in good financial planning. The good news is that it’s never too early or too late to start.You would imagine that you need a lot of money in order to start saving or investing. In reality, even relatively small sums can grow into a sizeable nest egg over time.The real secret of financial planning is making regular contributions and sticking at it over the long term. Building personal wealth is not a quick fix. Taking a lot of risk with your hard-earned cash in the hope of securing a short-term gain could be counter-productive.Instead, you should think of managing your money as a lifelong strategy and the key to future freedom, which can change and adapt as your personal circumstances change. When you are younger, you might take a little more risk and perhaps consider investing as a way of protecting your savings against inflation. In retirement you might need to think about how to protect your funds against sudden falls in value.Whatever age you are, the best way to start is to put away a bit of money at a time and allow interest to accumulate and investments to grow. If you save or invest into an inidual savings account (Isa), then everything you earn will be free of income and capital gains tax – giving your savings plan a boost.If you think of managing your money as the key to freedom, rather than a chore, you gain a new perspective on your finances. There are three key elements to planning for the big events in your life: setting goals, making it a habit, and reviewing your progress.What do you want to achieve with your savings and investments? Identifying a tangible goal – such as saving up a deposit for a home, being able to afford a wonderful honeymoon, or taking time off work after the birth of a baby – can be more motivational than having a vague idea of saving for some undefined future event. It’s important to have a rainy day fund first, for those unexpected events, so you won’t need to dip into your goal pots in troubled times.Now build in a timeframe – when will you need the money? What will you need to do in order to start saving? How much can you start with and could you make savings in your monthly spending in order to free up some spare cash? Small changes can make a big difference over the long term. For instance, if you have one less takeaway coffee at £3 a day, this equates to £15 a week, which over a year will amount to more than £700.If you have multiple goals, split your saving priorities into pots of money – short term, medium term and long term. Short term might be money for a fantastic honeymoon or overseas trip in a year or two medium term might be wanting to save for a house deposit over five or six years and long term will be your retirement planning.When you are clear about your goals and your timeframe, then you can start to think about the best home for your money.For funds you want to access within the next five years, you might consider a deposit account. You can make small incremental payments into a savings account or cash Isa. Moving money from your current account to a savings account on the day you get paid, or setting up a standing order, will mean you’re not tempted to spend it. However, as many of these are instant access, you’ll need to be disciplined about not touching it. If you think you might be tempted, consider a fixed rate savings product that locks your money away, often in return for a better interest rate.If your goal is five years or more away, you could consider investing in a variety of ways, at different levels of risk. Although these carry a higher risk than cash savings, they can also protect your money from the effect of inflation if your investments outperform the rate of interest offered by savings accounts. As you start this journey, it might be wise not to chase big wins or follow fashion – but instead to opt for a slower but safer approach, perhaps choosing funds that invest in a broad range of shares rather than trying to pick inidual companies. There are many sources of information about market trends, and it’s always good to become familiar with these.Any money you put into Pension savings has the benefit of being boosted by tax relief, but you can’t access the fund until you’re at least 55 and it’s best to wait until you retire. You should join a scheme at work if they have one, or save into your own private pension.It’s easy to start off with good intentions, and then forget to continue because of a lack of time or motivation.The key to successful money management is automating your financial commitments. Set up a regular amount to leave your bank account and be paid directly into your Isa or savings account. That way, the money has moved before you spend it, and you never have to set a reminder.Playing the long game can work in your favour, because the interest you build up in a deposit account will accumulate naturally. If you are investing for the long-term in the stock market, you’ll be less concerned with the short-term ups and downs of share prices. Sometimes people approach saving and investment in an emotional, rather than a rational way.It’s easy to buy shares when the stock market is doing well, and then panic after they have fallen. Try to take a long-term view, and check how your strategy is working for the long term, rather than from month to month. Remember: investments should be viewed as a five-year commitment, so make sure you think of these as a long-term strategy.Investments can carry a higher risk than cash savings and you may not always get back what you put in. Remember, the value of any tax benefits described depends on your inidual circumstances, and tax rules may change in the future.Whatever your situation, and no matter your level of confidence, HSBC could help you make better-informed investment decisions.

When my neighbour played it for a third time, I was tempted to shout: “You OK?” I knew they weren’t: anyone listening constantly to kd lang’s Constant Craving, a paean to longing and desire, was surely in the throes of a deep and unrequited crush.The track, released in 1992, is the last on lang’s second album, Ingénue. The Grammy award-nominated, multi-platinum-selling album became a cultural milestone – it hoisted LGBT issues firmly into the mainstream, and subverted country music, which was then the preserve of a far smaller, more conservative audience. Ingénue is meditative and personal, its vulnerability and honesty resonating strongly.Now 57, lang is about to embark on a UK tour called Ingénue Redux, where she will play the album in its entirety. “The first time I listened back, after 25 years, was when we were rehearsing,” she says, speaking from her home in Calgary. “I thought: ‘Ugh, this is not going to be easy. It’s a dirge, it’s so slow.’” But when she had completely relearned the album: “It felt like putting on an old pair of shoes.”Each note of the record is as clean and brilliant as polished marble each instrument is given room to breathe the lyrics are clear, so there is no misunderstanding of her message. “We were sticklers for the sonic cleanliness of that album,” she says. While her first album, 1988’s Shadowland, had a much stronger country flavour, Ingénue adds a cabaret influence. But its momentous success nearly was not to be.In 1992, Kathryn Dawn Lang came out as gay during an interview with the Advocate, an LGBT magazine, while promoting the album. Some radio stations stopped playing her music she felt ostracised by the country music industry. In 1993, she appeared on the cover of Vanity Fair. She had continuously played up to, and cultivated, her androgynous looks – rocking a teddy-boy quiff and often a loosely tailored suit on stage. For the magazine shoot, she appears in a barber’s chair, her tie loosened around her neck, with her face being shaved by Cindy Crawford. The image is disruptive, beautiful and poignant: it’s no longer a man’s world. “Elvis lives, and she’s beautiful,” Madonna said at the time.“I was surprised when I heard a rumour that I’d slept with Madonna,” lang chuckles. “I was completely oblivious to it.” How did she feel about being the centre of so much attention? “It’s a byproduct of showbusiness. And really, that’s one of the reasons I don’t like participating in showbusiness.”She says she spends a lot of time with her mother and partner. She cooks – “I’m a great home chef” – and is a practising Buddhist, with her own meditation room. A keen advocate for the animal rights group Peta, she has been vegetarian since she was 19. After seven studio and six collaborative albums, the allure of the music business has dimmed. “I’m excited to tour because, to me, it’s just about singing for people. But it has not ignited a deep thrust to make more music.”It must have been hard, so much of her life being public property. “I grew up with the adage that there is a wealth of purpose in being mysterious,” she says. “And I feel like I haven’t had the chance to be mysterious. My sexuality, and everything, was so much out in the open, and has been for many years. I feel exhausted by being exposed. And it’s truly not that interesting!” She tails off with a laugh.Although it might not seem interesting to her, at the time lang came out, she pretty much represented an entire section of society. The early 90s were a fallow time for famous lesbians – she quickly became a sapphic north star. As someone who was barely scraping into their teens when Ingénue was released, I was aware of lang, although I don’t think I had heard her music. Awareness of her existence allowed me to realise that there was another choice available apart from heterosexuality.Does she recognise that she opened the door for others to walk through? “Um, yeah, although I try not to take huge credit for that because it’s not a competition. It’s something bigger than all of us. I am certainly proud, but at the same time, I’m just one of many. Gay culture isn’t just one sliver of humanity – it’s a huge cross-section of people.”Pop is one of the few cultural movements where the young are ascribed more power than the old. Often, it can feel like young pop stars are given credit for things lang was doing well before they were born: playing with gender and image, blurring the lines between what it is to be masculine or feminine. There is obviously still a power in the subversion, but do they have to fight in the way that she did? A pause. “Women are still fighting, and people of colour are still fighting, and gay people are still fighting.”I mention the recent homophobic assault of two women on a London bus and how it showed that there is still a lot of work to be done. “The bottom line is that everyone wants to feel accepted, including the guys that inflicted the violence,” lang says. “They feel threatened by women who chose to be with women because society has constructed this game plan – right now, there are so many rightwing forces at work providing and fuelling hatred.”While writing Ingénue, lang hoped it would stand the test of time, and it has. In the meantime, humanity has changed LGBT rights have advanced enormously, although still not enough. Desire and vulnerability remain constants. Heartbreak makes you who you are. Feeling you don’t belong is universal – and there is a paradox in feeling “seen” by a poetic outsider. As my neighbour could attest, sometimes you need music, slinky songs of love and lust, to swirl around you on a summer’s day, to make you understand those feelings. As lang sings: “Constant craving, has always been.”kd lang’s UK tour starts on 13 July"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7146b89a08da8dfbc1116ce994fee014e3dfd08d/0_0_2710_1626/master/2710.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e187fe3d9c9aaea64852ed7fbb9cbec9","title":"state capture corruption investigation that has shaken south africa","story":"Gavin Watson was a hero of the struggle against apartheid. But this once-powerful businessman is now caught up in a sweeping inquiry that goes to the heart of how a nation is run. By  Mark GevisserOn 17 January this year, South Africans watched, transfixed, as video from a hidden mobile phone camera was broadcast on TV. It showed a group of men, in corporate uniforms, walking into a vault – where one of them counts out bundles of banknotes: “One, two, three, four, five … bloody Monopoly money,” he laughs through heavy breaths, “must be a million.”The man’s name is Gavin Watson, and the whistleblowers who put this video into the public domain claim it shows him counting out bribes to be paid to officials in the South African government. They have given accounts that implicate cabinet ministers, senior lawmakers and even the prosecutors tasked with investigating the corrupt practices of Watson’s logistics company, Bosasa. The video is the most dramatic evidence yet of corruption within the ruling African National Congress (ANC).But Watson is not just another fat-cat industrialist accused of trying to make a fast buck by bribing officials: his family were legendary in the anti-apartheid movement. He is the oldest of four brothers from the Eastern Cape province, white men who became heroes to the black majority when they broke apartheid laws to play rugby with black people in 1976. They joined the banned ANC and faced numerous depredations by the apartheid state, including time in jail and assassination attempts.The youngest brother, Daniel (known as Cheeky), was the most gifted wing player of his generation, who gave up a Springboks blazer for his stand against apartheid. All four brothers left their whites-only teams and went to play for the black league in their home town, Port Elizabeth, one of the only parts of the country where black people as well as white were rugby-mad. In 2012, Cheeky Watson received a state honour for his fearless contribution to non-racial sport.Watson and his brothers owned a highly successful chain of menswear shops, aimed at black buyers. As white people with resources, they provided invaluable support to their black ANC comrades in the Eastern Cape. At a time when many freedom fighters espoused a racially exclusive “black consciousness” agenda, they also helped set the ANC’s non-racial policies in motion on the sportsfield.After the ban on the ANC was lifted in 1990, the Watson brothers became powerbrokers in both politics and business. They set up companies, fronted by black owners and managers, that obtained shares in mining companies and contracts from the state. “Black economic empowerment” (or BEE) is the state’s primary means of economic redistribution, an affirmative-action plan stipulating that anyone wishing to do business with the state has to have a certain quota of black ownership and management. On paper, Gavin Watson’s company, Bosasa, was majority black-owned as such, it garnered contracts worth $140m from the state between 2000 and 2016, from prison catering to fleet management and information technology.According to the testimony of four whistleblowers, all former Bosasa executives, around $5m was paid in bribes to secure these contracts. They allege an industrial-scale operation that generated cash through money laundering and then distributed it to buy influence, secure contracts and prevent prosecution. They have described cash stuffed into Louis Vuitton handbags as gifts, or handed over in monthly instalments on the sides of highways. State officials received cars and houses free security equipment and school fees for their children – even monthly meat supplies.Jacob Zuma, the former president, has been named in testimony as allegedly receiving gifts from Watson and playing a role in stopping the prosecution of his company, which first came under investigation in 2007. And even Cyril Ramaphosa, the current president, elected on the promise that he would sweep away corruption, unwittingly accepted a donation from Watson to help him in his campaign to unseat Zuma Bosasa also paid Ramaphosa’s son Andile a consulting fee for “advisory services”.Black economic empowerment aims to give black people a greater share of an economy still overwhelmingly owned by whites. But the evidence given to the inquiry against Gavin Watson and Bosasa suggests how easily manipulated it can be: the accusation against Watson is that he and his colleagues have abused the system to line their own pockets, and have “captured” the organs of state to do so.“State capture” has become a buzzword in South Africa. It describes the way private iniduals and companies have commandeered organs of state to redirect public resources into their own hands, and have gutted those institutions responsible for protecting the country against such corruption. These include the police, the prosecution authority, the tax collection service and even parliament itself.If the whistleblowers’ evidence is correct, Bosasa was a textbook case of state capture. They presented the vault video, along with a blizzard of documents and allegations, at South Africa’s independent judicial inquiry into allegations of state capture, corruption and fraud in the public sector, chaired by the country’s deputy chief justice, Raymond Zondo. Zondo began public hearings last August, and they are expected to continue, almost daily, until the end of this year. The state capture commission, as it is known, has been described as a truth and reconciliation commission for our times. Its aim is to cleanse post-apartheid South Africa of its darkest stain, just as Desmond Tutu sought to bring about a healthy transition into the new era by exposing the apartheid years’ gross violations of human rights.The commission’s primary target is the kleptocracy that established itself around the former president Jacob Zuma, and particularly the dealings of another band of brothers, the Guptas, who allegedly ran Zuma’s government as a private piggy-bank. Zuma himself will finally appear before Zondo next week: he is scheduled to be in the witness box for five days, answering questions primarily about his relationship with the Guptas and the decisions that arose out of this. But he is expected to address the allegations about Bosasa and Gavin Watson, too.Gavin Watson has declined to make any public comment since the allegations, but his brother Valence told me: “Our constitutional rights have been trampled upon.” Valence claims that his family are victims of a “dark state” conspiracy today, just as they were under apartheid. He claims that the commission is illegal, in that it has not offered those implicated by the whistleblowers a fair hearing.Although the whistleblowers have implicated all four brothers in their testimony before the commission, only Gavin is directly linked to Bosasa. On the basis of the tax-evasion allegations put before the commission, Gavin is now being investigated by the South African Revenue Service. And in an unrelated case, a high court has found him to have “acted dishonestly and reprehensibly” in a mining deal, by taking shares allocated to a “black economic empowerment entity and appropriating them to himself and his family”.The whistleblowers’ testimony sketches one of the most troubling dynamics of post-apartheid South Africa: as some freedom fighters went into politics and others went into business, support networks morphed into patronage networks, which in turn became criminal syndicates.The Watson brothers were such celebrities in the 1980s that there was even a TV series about them in the works. In a world where rugby was “next to God”, John Pilger wrote in an introduction to a 1997 book about them, they “embodied almost everything that white South African men liked about their breed: they were physically brave … men’s men. Even their Christianity fitted the mould. But their manliness and their faith embraced a universal humanity and morality that was the antithesis of this stereotype.”Television only came to South Africa in 1975, and at the time the Watsons were making news for their stand, the country was obsessed with Dallas, the Texas oil saga that centred on the Ewing family. “They were just like the Ewings,” the former journalist Cate Turner, who fell into their orbit, said to me. “I was starstruck. The Herald had them on the front page every other day: these compelling, good-looking guys and their wives with big hair and shoulder pads.”While Cheeky managed black rugby teams and Gavin ran the family business, the other two brothers, Ronnie and Valence, became underground operatives of the ANC. Ronnie, Valence and Cheeky spent four months in jail after they were charged with burning down their grand family home in an insurance fraud. They insisted the state had framed them, and were eventually acquitted. Their chain of stores, Dan Watson American Imports, had been phenomenally successful, but they went bankrupt shortly after the trial. It took them several years, after the fall of apartheid, to re-establish themselves as BEE entrepreneurs – and to bring many of their old comrades with them, into the business world.Recently, on a visit to Port Elizabeth, I met one of their former comrades, Mike Xego, a former political prisoner who is now a businessman. He drives a Mercedes with the plates “Mr X”, a moniker he also has stitched on to a necktie that is almost as broad as his language. “You must understand, black people are fucking poor,” he exploded, when I asked him why corruption had become so rife in South Africa. “Our ambitions! We wanted to be proper human beings, with bank accounts and a tie. We thought we would be strutting up and down the streets. Then things really crumbled. It didn’t go well for most of us. We remained where we were.”South Africa was recently declared by the World Bank to be the world’s most unequal country. In the boom years after the 1994 transition away from apartheid, if you were fortunate enough to be politically connected, you could soar into the stratosphere of the very wealthy via canny partnerships with white capitalists. This was Cyril Ramaphosa’s route. But, many black people were unable to access these opportunities, writes the South African sociologist Karl von Holdt, “because of political gatekeeping or because they lacked the capital or the skills”. And so “an alternative, informal political-economic system” emerged, through which “networks of state officials, ambitious entrepreneurs and small-time operators, were rigging tenders or engaging in other kinds of fraud … to sustain or establish businesses, or simply to finance self-enrichment”. Von Holdt argues that for some South Africans, criminality has become the route to class mobility.Of course, white South Africans had accumulated their wealth through their own affirmative-action programmes – job reservation for whites – and alliances with the state. Now, post-apartheid, BEE had two distinct, legitimate arms: the private sector handed over some of its assets to players like Ramaphosa in return for political access and government work, and the state set race quotas for public sector contracts and mining licences.The entrepreneurial – white – Watson brothers, seeing how they could parlay their political networks into deals, went down both tracks. Gavin built Bosasa, a company initially founded by leaders of the ANC Women’s League, to gain a foothold in the economy through government business. His younger brothers Valence and Ronnie went into the mining sector, working with a controversial family who bankrolled the ANC Youth League, and bought up marginal goldmines that the big players were getting ready to shut down.To find partners in these ventures, the brothers dug into their political hinterland: they recruited former comrades from ANC intelligence, rugby buddies from the black leagues, Eastern Cape activists. Gavin and Valence gave a major stake in their own companies to a man everyone calls “the fifth brother”, Archie Mkele, a black rugby legend they befriended when they crossed over to the black league. Mkele was severely burned in the Watsons’ 1986 fire, and then tortured into a confession that he had torched the house for his friends as part of the alleged insurance scam in court, he refused to testify against them. The other suspect, another black rugby mate, turned state witness, but was discharged after evidence emerged that he, too, had been tortured.Bosasa’s other major black shareholder is Mkele’s ex-wife, Carol, the sole beneficiary of a “women’s investments” trust. On paper, the Mkeles are very rich indeed, but they lead modest lives in Port Elizabeth: Carol – now named Muneira Oliveria – has a mid-level management job at Bosasa Archie is a priest. The whistleblowers allege in their testimony to the inquiry that the Mkeles’ investment trusts are fronts for Gavin Watson’s own family.Several of the Watsons’ other BEE partners became part of the country’s new political elite there was a revolving door, in these first years of the new government, between political appointments and BEE entrepreneurs. “The minute you have a system where people make money just by the connections they have, rather than the work that they do, the system is ripe for abuse,” says the political economist Moeletsi Mbeki, long a staunch critic of BEE. “It’s a recipe for corruption.”But a perfect storm was brewing: the aspirations that accompanied democracy were maturing at the same time as South Africa’s post-apartheid growth spurt slowed down, and the economy slumped after the global crash of 2008. As unemployment became more severe, public-service salaries and social welfare grants had to feed an increasing number of people. And as the cost of living soared, it became harder for many people to keep a foothold in the middle class: paying off the mortgage on your home keeping your kids in private schools.Central to this political economy is the ANC itself, which makes key appointments, from a local to a national level, except in those few parts of the country where it is no longer in power. The party subsists on donations, and there have been allegations that votes for leadership positions are for sale. There are no controls over campaign financing in South Africa, and so an operation like Bosasa can work on two levels: underground, through bribery, and above board, through making high-profile donations to the party, or running and staffing – as Bosasa did – huge campaign “war rooms” for the ANC out of its head office.“It is impossible to quantify the level of corruption in South Africa,” David Lewis of Corruption Watch, the South African chapter of Transparency International, told me, “but everyone accepts a perception, which is often the only way you make a judgment, that bribery in order to procure public contracts is ubiquitous.”A young business colleague of Mike Xego’s had accompanied him to our meeting, and when “Mr X” jumped up to take a phone call, I struck up a conversation with this man. He was trying to make a go of it, he told me, bringing potatoes from farms to market in his truck, and carrying fuel back. “But the problem is capital.” He had begun his business by bidding for state tenders, and received a sub-contract helping to build a road in his home township. But as soon as he made enough money to buy his truck, he got out of there.Why did he leave if he was doing so well there, I asked, and if state contracts could build his capital base?Judge Raymond Zondo is a mild and ponderous man in his late 50s who runs his commission with a sometimes-exasperating deliberateness. After viewing the video of Gavin Watson counting out those bundles of banknotes in the vault, he asked his witness – former Bosasa executive Angelo Agrizzi – what Watson had meant by referring to the cash as “monopoly money”.Agrizzi told the judge that he had experienced a Damascene conversion after surviving a heart tumour. The Watson camp suggests, with evidence, that he was trying to blackmail Gavin Watson. Agrizzi, in turn, claims Watson was going to throw him under the bus, and so he acted pre-emptively. Certainly, Agrizzi appears to have accumulated evidence, perhaps as insurance. He kept meticulous coded records: of the transfer of orders of “chicken”, or of “bread” in and out of the “oven”, as the vault was known – in what he liked to call his “little black books”, personalised and gold-embossed from Smythson in London. Even the state capture commission’s own secretary, a senior justice department official named Khotso De Wee, was to be found in these books, and had to be put on special leave by Zondo. De Wee has denied the allegations.Two characters were inscribed every month into Agrizzi’s dirty little ledger as “Snake” and “Snail”. Agrizzi told the commission that these were Nomgcobo Jiba, the deputy national director of public prosecutions and Lawrence Mrwebi, who headed a unit of the prosecuting authority that had, in fact, been investigating Bosasa since 2010. Agrizzi’s testimony suggested why, almost a decade later, no one had yet been charged: in his account, Jiba and Mrwebi were paid off to obstruct the prosecution – and even to advise the accused on how to circumvent the charges.Both Mrwebi and Jiba have denied Agrizzi’s allegations, and claim they never received money from Bosasa. In April, they were fired by Cyril Ramaphosa, on the basis of another judicial commission that found they had brought the agency into disrepute: not over Bosasa, but other matters that had to do with protecting Jacob Zuma and his cronies from charges of corruption.Shortly after Agrizzi made his revelations before the commission in January this year, the National Prosecuting Authority snapped into gear under a new boss. Although the state capture commission offers protection from self-incrimination, prosecutors used the charge sheet that had been gathering dust at the agency to arrest Agrizzi and two other Bosasa whistleblowers, as well as two prison officials.One of Agrizzi’s co-accused is a man named Linda Mti, an ex-ANC military commander who was the head of security at the 2010 South Africa World Cup and, before that, the country’s prisons commissioner. Hard-driving and charismatic, Mti is still known by his nom de guerre, “Richman”. He likes to tell the story of how, one day in 1980, while he was working out of the neighbouring country of Lesotho, two conservatively dressed young white men were brought to see him. His mother had joked that he might live to see the day that he could tell a white man what to do, and “now I’ve got two. My whiteboys!”The men were Ronnie and Valence Watson, and they had come to Lesotho at the behest of Chris Hani – the legendary ANC leader, who was later assassinated – smuggling forged documents across the border in their big white Mercedes. Mti became their handler, and in the years that followed, the Watson boys shuttled fleeing activists across the same border, along with intelligence reports about what was happening back home. Both Mti and Hani became close personal friends of the Watsons.When, in 1987, an attempt was made on Ronnie Watson’s life in a hotel room in Botswana, it was Richman Mti who came running to his aid. Three years later, when the last white president, FW de Klerk, unexpectedly unbanned the liberation movements and Mti came back to Port Elizabeth, his hometown, he had nowhere to live. Valence Watson put him up, and he lived there for many months. Mti was elected the first ANC chair of the region the brothers became his fixers and advisers. (Mti declined to speak to me for this story.)Mti became prisons commissioner in 2001, a year after Gavin Watson bought Bosasa: the company provided catering for mine hostels, and ran two detention centres, one for illegal immigrants and one for juvenile offenders. Watson was ready to expand. His man was in place.The state had never previously outsourced its prisons contracts, but inspired by the success of British companies such as G4S and Serco, Bosasa made a pitch to Mti and another senior prison official, Patrick Gillingham, for all the catering contracts in the country’s prisons. According to testimony given to the inquiry and the charge sheet, both men conspired to award Bosasa the prison catering contracts, for which they received lucrative kickbacks, in cash and in kind.A senior career official in the apartheid-era prisons service, Gillingham would have been a strong candidate for prisons commissioner were it not for the timing of the transition to democracy, and the ANC’s affirmative-action policies: he is white. When Agrizzi was trying to explain how he, too, became corrupt while working for Bosasa, he told Zondo: “We were constantly told that we were white males and that you will not find a job anywhere out there … This was drummed into our heads.” Similar statements were made by the other whistleblowers, all white men too. I have seen a video in which Watson does, indeed, emphasise to his white staff their unemployability in a changing South Africa.And so, according to the testimony before the state capture commission, Watson played race two ways. He offered his black collaborators a quicker route to self-enrichment than might otherwise be available to them, and his white ones a solution from the impoverishment they imagined might befall them, now that black South Africans were in the ascendant.When Mike “Mr X” Xego was released from five years in jail on Robben Island in 1982, he was 22 and had no clothes his mother, a domestic worker, could not help. “Go to the Watsons!” he was told. “They will make you look good.” Even before they became rugby heroes, the brothers were renowned in Port Elizabeth’s black community for their shop, which sold the kind of American fashion beloved by urban black South Africans. Most of the customers were black, but white people shopped there too, meaning it was one of the few mixed spaces in the city, a free zone for black people, and a safe space for activists. With their resources, the Watsons did what they could, setting up a makeshift clinic in the storeroom and tending to comrades injured in protests photocopying banned literature gifting clothes to released prisoners like Xego or returned exiles like Richman Mti.Xego acquired his first wardrobe – on credit, with no interest – from the Watsons. A few weeks later, all four brothers showed up in their Mercedes at his tiny township home and sat down to tea with his mother, winning her over with the fluent Xhosa they had learned growing up on an Eastern Cape farm. They wrote off his debt.Port Elizabeth had always been the heart of the freedom struggle and it was here, after the apartheid president PW Botha declared his state of emergency in 1985, that a nationwide consumer boycott of white businesses was most successful. What to do with the Watsons, though?At first they were exempt, but the boycott leaders insisted that they needed to be included: it would be too easy for other retailers to superficially imitate the Watson packaging. Worse yet, vigilantes were enforcing the boycott with violence. If people were found breaking the boycott by coming home from the shops with detergent, for example, they would often be forced to drink it. The only way people could be safe, the leaders insisted, was if the boycott was a blanket one. Others disagreed fervently: “To us the Watsons were not whites,” their friend Max Mamase told the Australian journalist Kristin Williamson. “They were part of us. But a few key people felt the Watsons were making money out of the boycott.”This was significant because of the factionalism in the struggle. You could tarnish your competitors with the slur that they were agents or informers. Ronnie Watson in particular was the master of this game: he had a favourite Xhosa word he would hiss under his breath about anyone who disagreed with him: inywagi – the genet, a small, wily wild cat that struck its prey with lightning speed. “Black or white, we were all spies to them,” Jack told me.The brothers stayed away from the above-ground movement, which was launched in 1983 as the United Democratic Front. When the journalist Gavin Evans set up a UDF affiliate with two other white activists, “they were very threatened,” Evans told me. “They liked to be the only white activists in the village. In various ways, they spread spy rumours about all three of us.”Obviously, Gavin Watson did not clothe people like Richman Mti in the 1980s in anticipation of a future lucrative relationship: no one could have predicted, back then, how quickly apartheid would fall and a new elite would establish itself. But the testimony before the state capture commission suggests a slippery slope: from comradely support into patronage and – in some cases – corruption.In this way, the Watson brothers are reminiscent of another famous struggle family, the Shaiks. The sons of an Indian trader from Durban, the Shaik brothers were deeply committed freedom fighters, and were often detained and even tortured. They answered directly to Jacob Zuma in exile, and they provided both intelligence and resources to the movement.The ANC’s leaders – in jail or in exile – had not a penny to their name, but were expected to take their seats at the negotiating table after their release or return after 1990, and talk themselves into power. Even Nelson Mandela was dependent on the largesse of local businessmen when he came out of jail, supported primarily by a brash insurance magnate named Douw Steyn (although there was no suggestion of an illegal relationship). Richman Mti had the Watsons. And Jacob Zuma had the Shaiks.Schabir Shaik bribed Zuma to get a piece of a multibillion dollar arms deal that South Africa signed with French and German companies in the mid-1990s. Shaik went to jail in 2005, and the reason Zuma is free is because a judge accepted testimony that the charges against him were tainted by political interference. This ruling was finally overturned on appeal in 2018, and the charges were reinstated: the former South African president may yet find himself behind bars.In an image-laundering exercise, Bosasa changed its name to African Global Operations in 2016. Its headquarters are a sprawling campus in a nondescript suburb west of Johannesburg. In its heyday the campus had wildlife roaming around it, a mini golf course, the Watson Corporate University, an evangelical publishing company and a wellness centre. Since the allegations made at the state capture commission earlier this year, the company has lost most of its business and gone into liquidation: most of its staff have been retrenched and its banks have refused to do business with it. Most of the campus’ buildings are dark, and it now has an unkempt air at odds with the regimental Watson style.Gavin Watson liked to call Bosasa a “Kingdom company”: he ran it with a kind of entrepreneurial evangelism. All staff were required to wear smart uniforms, and Watson conducted prayer meetings and offered communion every morning between 6am and 8am. A popular public speaker on behavioural science who ran the wellness centre for over a decade, Denise Bjorkman, says that Bosasa was “a cultish environment” with Watson its domineering leader, and that his “control mechanisms extended into prayer”, as staff members felt compelled to attend if they wished to be in favour. “Attendees had to pray out loud as he believed that if they did so he would know what they were thinking,” Bjorkman says.In April this year, Valence Watson agreed to spend a day with me, first in the Port Elizabeth offices of his lawyers, and then showing me Royalston, the magnificent “coastal wildlife residential estate” he is developing outside the city. He is known to be the most affable of the four bluff brothers: he was good company, despite the difficult conversation.Valence explained the family ethos to me, and how it was rooted in both enterprise and Christianity. His farming parents, descendants of hardy Scots settler stock, also ran trading stores, and there were two biblical precepts that governed their lives: “Love your neighbour as yourself” and “Earn your money by the sweat of your brow”. For the Watsons, “everyone’s money was the same colour”, and the first time he realised it was different elsewhere was when he noticed a wall in the local butchers, iding black and white shoppers.Although all four brothers are implicated by the whistleblowers at the state capture commission, Valence insisted to me that they had no relationship with their brother Gavin’s company Ronnie said the same thing, in a written response to questions. (Cheeky declined to talk to me.) There is, indeed, no evidence that they were directly involved in corruption, except for Agrizzi’s allegation that he saw Valence bribing a senior parliamentarian named Cedric Frolick on behalf of Bosasa. Valence dismissed this charge to me as a lie.Still, everyone who knows the Watson family notes the way the brothers band together, particularly in times of trouble. Perhaps because of the way they were once isolated by other whites as kaffirboeties (“nigger-lovers”) and then targeted by the authorities, they tend to close ranks and keep to themselves, and in my own dealings with them – perhaps exacerbated by their current embattled status – I experienced their notorious “us-versus-the-world” paranoia.“Stratcom” is short for “Strategic Communications”, the apartheid security forces’ notorious dirty tricks department, which sought to discredit key apartheid activists. (Stratcom may have been responsible, for example, for burning down the Watson house and then manufacturing documents to make it look like an insurance scam.) When I asked Valence who might be behind such a plot, today, he suggested that Agrizzi and the whistleblowers were in cahoots with the opposition Democratic Alliance, in an attempt to discredit the ANC before the country’s May elections, in which the party was re-elected, but with its lowest majority yet.Presumably on the basis of the Bosasa allegations, Cyril Ramaphosa dropped at least one implicated cabinet minister, Nomvula Mokonyane, a close Zuma associate who was allegedly at the heart of the Bosasa syndicate, and Watson’s primary beneficiary. Mokonyane has called the allegations untrue, and announced her intention to defend herself before the commission. Ramaphosa has also apologised for the error in judgment in having accepted funds from Watson, given that Bosasa was under investigation. Still, he now finds himself under investigation too, by an antagonistic public protector (a statutory ombudsman of sorts) who believes that he wilfully misled parliament, and might even be guilty of money-laundering through his campaign fundraising.The public protector’s name is Busisiwe Mkhwebane. So aggressively has she gone after Ramaphosa and his major anti-corruption ally, the state enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan, that many South Africans believe she is doing the bidding of the Zuma kleptocrats swept from office by Ramaphosa – allegations that Mkhwebane says are “unfair” and “without basis”. Meanwhile, Zuma will appear before Zondo next week, against his will. In a letter leaked to the press, his lawyer has slammed the commission as seeking its “own truth” and wishing “to deliver our client … for public display and in order to ambush and humiliate him”.The allegations against Bosasa and Gavin Watson are by no means the only ones that have been made before Zondo, or even the most damning, in terms of “state capture”. But they are the most detailed. The way the South African authorities act on them will be a litmus test of whether they are, finally, freed from their “capture” during the dark second act – the Zuma years – of the South African democracy.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8ab0af9750d402af489dde3c033097913239301/0_0_3500_2159/master/3500.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20db2d49f180c60a3db0862822f7d3bb 1010w","title":"cricket world cup free to air final","story":"In the summer of ‘93, everyone at my school became a leg-spinner. We’d never seen leg-spin before Shane Warne arrived. Not that we could remember.No one could do it – ball after ball just looping onto the top of the low hanging cricket net – batsmen waddling half way down the green matting, jumping and trying to hit the ball back to the bowler, hopefully with enough power to do it in one go. We were hopeless, but we were inspired by what we saw on TV.Sky’s conditional offer to put the Cricket World Cup final on free-to-air television could just be a one-off, but what if it was the start of something more? It wouldn’t be hard to put the game on regardless of the result of England’s semi-final but perhaps the ECB have worked out that not enough of us are watching it.Living in a Sky Sports bubble (and being in it for years) makes it difficult to conceive of a world without live sport at my fingertips. Pretty much every office I sit in pumps out every possible sport on every possible TV. Sky Sports Football, Sky Sports Cricket, Sky Sports News, Sky Sports Kabaddi, BT Lorry Racing. It’s all on, all the time.I genuinely forget that others don’t have that luxury, and haven’t had the chance to watch cricket for the last 14 years – during which time the coverage has been consistently excellent. All those summer days watching Bumble and the others teasing Nasser Hussain about the size of his nose, seeing which pundit has been given the third man analysis role against their will. The evenings spent watching Charles Colville and Bob Willis getting increasingly annoyed – perhaps because they’ve been left to do the highlights. And that’s before the winter – getting up at weird hours to watch overseas tours wondering if Tim Abraham has enough sun cream, or getting ready to start your day, flicking on the Big Bash and then realising it’s midday and you’re not dressed.The number of people who’ll understand those references is actually pretty low. As Sean Ingle pointed out in 2015, almost as many people watched a 1974 feature length episode of Columbo on ITV3 as watched Joe Root take the winning catch at long off at Cardiff in the first Ashes Test of that year. And while Ingle clearly fails to recognise Peter Falk’s televisual brilliance, it’s a worry. Eight and a half million people watched the culmination of the fourth Test in 2005.I don’t walk down the street with English cricketers enough to know whether they get stopped every five seconds or whether they’re anonymous when they’re out shopping. Do 20-year-olds have equivalents of Peter Such and Alan Mullally rattling around their brains taking up much needed space?Will the modern day cricketers break into our public consciousness? Will Mark Wood win Strictly? Will Keaton Jennings present Top Gear in 2035?Participation is down. Andy Bull recently noted that 40 sides had disbanded in the last five years in the Hampshire league, with many others losing their second, third and fourth XIs – added to this is the slow acknowledgement that the sport is becoming the preserve of the privileged to an increasing degree.And what a shame. Because there is something so weirdly, but fantastically, different about playing cricket compared to any other team sport. A whole day of playing sport, where you might win it single-handedly, and on another day you might do literally nothing. Not a thing.It’s sad to think fewer and fewer people will create their own cricketing memories – those batting gloves at school with the green rubber spikes which gave you no protection whatsoever, and pads with buckles that pointedly refused to stay in place when you ran a quick single as your box fell out of your pants and wedged itself behind your knee.At university, second XI cricket was not of a high standard. Dan was the only player who could bowl straight. He’d always begin with an orange, aiming for off stump and we’d wait for the glorious sound of citrus on willow.After we’d clear up the vitamin C explosion, we’d apologise and get on with the game. Then came the twist – the ‘keeper would take a Red Delicious out of his pocket – we’d throw it around the field, from slip to point to cover to mid-off, shining it on its way round – and Dan would bowl that.Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsApple on willow, shattering all over the square. On one occasion, their opener played the first ballapple perfectly – a cultured leave outside the off stump. The keeper took it with soft hands and we threw it around the field again, desperately trying to keep a straight face, before the apple hit the middle of the bat on the second delivery. I’m not sure I’ve even been so happy. It was stupid, and we were idiots, but we were idiots playing sport.Probably the most exhilarating single moment of my life (admittedly the bar is low) was playing village cricket. What a thing that is. Teammates decades apart in age and feet apart in waistlines, with one large man lodged at first slip in every side. The tactical toilet break so that you don’t have to umpire the first 10 overs – and if you end up in the middle the complete refusal to give any lbws. There was one game a year when the fair came to town and took up half the village green – I’d be crouching at gully while Chic’s Le Freak blared across the field.In the 2003 Cambridgeshire Junior cup semi-final, requiring five off two for Ashwell, I hoyed one over cow corner for six – it even got a headline in the Royston Crow. That very rare feeling of striking a ball so sweetly that it didn’t feel like I hit it. We won the final – I did not bowl, did not bat. Did not do anything. I still have the trophy in my toilet.Here’s hoping Sky’s free to air offerings don’t stop after this tournament. What about a day of an Ashes Test this summer? A Premier League game this season? If we want more people to watch, play and be inspired, it has to be the right thing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b2682e532a0b835d5ab129e11df6139efd4a879/0_168_4457_2674/master/4457.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=231588fdd16f9dbd1c60d893e51a100b","title":"australia v england cricket world cup 2019 semi final live","story":"A long delay in the 12th over while Jonny Bairstow gets treatment. Hamstring, groin, cramp? He seized up sprinting back for a second run and has been down on the ground since. He lost his footing a bit turning for a second, and things can break in these highly tuned athletes when that happens. After a long break with 14 medical staff, he’s back on his feet. 11th over: England 63-0 (Roy 39, Bairstow 21) “I will say emphatically,” says Reg Gorczynski emphatically, “thank God Vince isn’t (wasn’t) out there. Roy’s recovery unquestionably saved England’s World Cup, no matter what happens from now.”I can verify from time stamps that he sent this before Roy casually smites Nathan Lyon’s first ball for six. Dead straight, front leg out of the way, a golf swing through the line of a full ball. Pow. A few singles later, and a reverse sweep hit as hard as one can hit them, along the ground for four. The over costs 13. England’s top pair are doing it again. 10th over: England 50-0 (Roy 27, Bairstow 20) They’re starting to work Behrendorff around a bit more comfortably now, with Roy driving a couple through the covers amongst some singles. If you think I’m wrong about Roy, look at this. The one on the right was that whip shot.9th over: England 44-0 (Roy 23, Bairstow 18) Pat Cummins nearly bowls a maiden. Almost bowls a maiden. Deserves to bowl a maiden. Saws Roy in half at one stage. Pings a bouncer past his scone. Locks him up on the stumps. But from the final ball Roy somehow manages to flick it away square, and finds a gap for four. He’s going to take England to this total. I’m calling it now.8th over: England 40-0 (Roy 19, Bairstow 18) Behrendorff is trying to sneak through onto the pads, and gives the appeal everything he has when it finally works. He throws his arms out wide and nearly blocks Roy from getting through for a leg bye. Not out. Bairstow responds with a fierce straight drive that scorches back past the bowler and under his attempt to field. Four.“Bearing in mind that there’s been the possibility of some rain around 5pm are there any run marks or scenarios England have to be aware of if the game is curtailed or are we past that point now with a reserve day? Or are the mathematics just way too Zaltzman-esque to be bothered with? Yours anxiously, John Norris.”John, as long as we get 20 overs in then we have a match, and there’s no need to come back tomorrow. I don’t have the DLS score in front of me but England would be well ahead of it at zero wickets down. It’s not as simple as required rate, but they’re ahead of the required rate anyway. They could be behind it and still ahead of DLS given they have ten wickets in hand. The DLS rate will skip upward as wickets are lost, but not much for the first couple of wickets, and increasingly sharply for wickets five, six, and beyond.  7th over: England 33-0 (Roy 19, Bairstow 12) There’s a contrast. Cummins bowls his first over, tight on the stumps and giving no room to swing at anything. Throws in a good short ball as well that has Bairstow tap-dancing. The only runs come from the last ball, pushed through cover for two. Warner gets some pepper from the crowd as he fields back towards the rope.6th over: England 31-0 (Roy 19, Bairstow 10) It... what... huh? I don’t know how to describe that. There isn’t exactly a shot that we know of that looks like it. Starc bowls outside leg stump. Roy reaches for it and whips it, but with a helicopter swish of the wrists, like taking Dhoni’s stroke but then rotating it 45 degrees past point rather than long-on. It’s entirely casual, barely seeming to connect. But the ball soars out over deep backward, and there’s no short boundary today, but it flies over the man in the deep and beyond the second row of fences. And considering Bairstow had already lashed the first ball of the over for four with a cut shot, very profitable.5th over: England 19-0 (Roy 13, Bairstow 5) England even warier against Behrendorff than against Starc. Both batsmen are very watchful for the inswinger, playing straight and just nudging him to leg where they can for a run or two.“Personally I don’t think we should even try to get 224,” emails Kim Thonger. “Better to have a good solid unbeaten opening partnership of 150+ using the full allotted 50 overs as a statement of Ashes intent.”It does feel very Ashes today, coloured kit notwithstanding. Grey cloudy skies, a full Hollies in good voice, a bit of swing, quality fast bowlers making life hard for everybody.4th over: England 16-0 (Roy 11, Bairstow 4) That’s more like it from Roy, though Starc fed him a full ball that was easily driven through the covers. Four runs to start the over is a big help though, and when Starc overcorrects Roy finds a couple more to midwicket. Starc gets it right thereafter, keeping the batsman guessing on off stump, mixing up the length. But it’s the last ball of the over where Roy really takes control. Not a bad ball at all, but he stands up on the back foot and punches through extra cover for four. That’s just asburd. Back of a length, 90 miles an hour, yet he’s timed it away with what seems complete ease. What a difference a Jason Roy makes. 3rd over: England 6-0 (Roy 1, Bairstow 4) Hmm, this is the bit I’m not sure about. It’s a good over by Behrendorff, and Bairstow is beaten once, but he also lets it pass by without really looking to score. Conceding maidens to the opening bowlers from the other team just gives them too much control. It’s a fine line, of course, but it feels like England’s best chance of avoiding any mishaps is for this pair to start in the confident manner that they’ve done so well in the past. 2nd over: England 6-0 (Roy 1, Bairstow 4) The Australians have been being mentored by Steve Waugh, and now Mitchell Starc has a red towel hanging out the back of his trousers. Coincidence? You decide.Starc is the one for Australia, if they can rescue this match. He starts bang on target, left-arm over to Roy and in tight on the stumps for the first four balls. The fourth cuts Roy in half and bashes into his back thigh. The fifth slides down leg for a wide. It’s the only score from the over.1st over: England 5-0 (Roy 1, Bairstow 4) And so, let the chase begin. Jason Behrendorff has the ball at the City End. He took five wickets against England only a couple of weeks ago, hooping one through James Vince to start his day. But Jason Roy is the opponent now, and after a couple of testing deliveries that move a fraction, Roy squeezes a run out to third man. Bairstow gets width and crashes it through cover. Bright start.I don’t know what I’ve had more emails about today: that you want Marina Hyde to do an OBO, or that Liam Plunkett is Irish. Both have been a deluge. You wouldn’t have thought that the Irish could feel underrepresented in Eoin Morgan’s team, but there you go. Look, fine – by the end of this summer we’ll have Marina do an OBO live in Cork, if that will keep you wolves from the door. They’ve done the job, the home side. Half of it, any rate. It doesn’t look that difficult to bat out there, but they just got early wickets and put the squeeze on Australia, and despite a couple of excellent partnerships in defiance, the batting side were always coming from too far back.Smith was the core of that resistance with 85, and built beautifully with Carey (46), entertainingly with Maxwell (22), and desperately with Starc (29). England though made the running, with Woakes and Archer immaculate early and returning for valuable later spells, while Rashid came through the middle and struck three telling blows.Woakes had 3 for 20, Archer 2 for 32, and Rashid 3 for 54, while Wood picked up a bonus wicket at the end.So, what happens? Do England go after this total in their usual ebullient style? You’d hope so. They’ll let themselves in for trouble if they get too careful. But low chases can play tricks on batting teams, where a par score might leave them clearer in their minds.Australia’s big hope is Mitchell Starc. He’s been devastating in the second innings of matches, and guess what Australia bowled out England for a couple of weeks ago? 221.Different time, different place, but this chase won’t be easy. 49th over: Australia 223-10 (Lyon 1) It’s all over! Full, straight, good enough. Behrendorff plays about one third each of four different shots at that ball, and none of them were the shot required. Wood lights up the stumps like a celebratory cigar.48th over: Australia 218-9 (Lyon 1, Behrendorff 0) Nearly another run out, as Lyon just hits and runs towards point, but Archer misses with the throw. That’s the only score from an over that also brought two wickets. Woakes has 3 for 20 from eight.I’m being schooled in the emails by Ruairi O hEithir, who on name alone I would never dare disagree with on any matters Gaelic. “When the Normans came to Ireland in the 12th century some of them were named ‘Blanchet’ and ‘Plunkett’ was the best the Irish could do in pronouncing it. This means Cate Blanchett’s name is really Catriona Plunkett...”Two in two balls! Is Buttler on a hat-trick? Starc took the strike during that run out. He aims another huge drive, but only tickles it as it angles across him. Both members of Australia’s resistance have gone.Brilliant work from Buttler behind the stumps. Smith drops the ball away near his feet and starts running. Buttler tears in from behind the stumps, picks it up, and throws down the non-striker’s stumps with an inch to spare! No century for Australia’s former captain today. Fine fielding.47th over: Australia 217-7 (Smith 85, Starc 29) Smart batting from Starc, knocking Wood out into the deep to leg a couple of times and getting back for two.46th over: Australia 210-7 (Smith 83, Starc 24) Chris Woakes returns to try to close out the the innings. A few more singles and this partnership swells to 44. The last ball of the over hits Smith on the pad, close, zipping in from an angle outside off and beating the edge to hit him above the knee roll. England review the not out, and the reconstruction says that it’s umpire’s call, with the ball possibly grazing or going over the bails. 45th over: Australia 206-7 (Smith 82, Starc 22) A big wind-up from Starc, and he goes down the ground for six! That’s one way to start the over. Clean straight drive in the air from Plunkett. The batsmen trade singles, then Plunkett slips in a wide. Starc flicks square and bails out of the second run, but just as well because Smith goes back early, sets up for the slower ball, and pounds it through midwicket for four.A lot of people are complaining in the emails that this bowler does not have an English name, he has an Irish one. I was thinking of the Plunkett bit rather than the Liam bit. I can’t hear it in anything but a Yorkshire accent. But anyway, we settler Australians can’t tell our Scots from our Welsh from our Dutch. It’s all part of the white colonial hodgepodge. 44th over: Australia 192-7 (Smith 77, Starc 14) There’s the boundary! Starc loves to drive straight, so when Wood pitches up he does exactly that. Mid-off is up, and the ball streaks inside his line and down to the fence. Starc hits an on-drive just as sweetly next ball, but this time it goes straight to midwicket inside the circle. There’s a wide, then a single as Starc digs out a full ball and Smith is live to the opportunity. This partnership worth 26 now. 43rd over: Australia 186-7 (Smith 77, Starc 9) Plunkett to Starc, who pulls for a run. Smith belts through for a scrappy single and could have been run out at the non-striker’s end, but Root’s throw from midwicket misses. Smith is trying to find a method against Plunkett’s slower balls, and eventually cocks his wrists to place a lovely back-cut past backward point. But England’s field is well set and the man in the deep gets around to stop it. The last boundary came from Maxwell in the 34th over.42nd over: Australia 181-7 (Smith 74, Starc 7) Wood to Starc, and Smith is instant in calling for a run when the ball cannons off Starc’s thigh pad. Finally Smith has strike back. But he can only get a leg bye himself in similar fashion. The pair get a few singles going. Australia battling to make 200 at this rate.41st over: Australia 176-7 (Smith 73, Starc 5) Liam Plunkett, such a solid English name and such a solid English over. Starc hits the field a couple of times, misses the swish a couple of times, and blocks one on his stumps. Finally skews an edge away for a run from the last ball.“Speaking of crossover OBOs,” writes Abhinav Dutta, “this one goes beyond ’s offices and into the territory of the sublime or the perverse, depending on what mood Zizek is in. It would be nice to read hairy bear Slavoj sniffling after every over while traipsing through Hegel, Lacan and Marx. Wonder when or what he would deem fit as pure negation in cricket. Glenn Maxwell’s breezy knocks straddle both the sublime and the perverse which I hazard Zizek will turn into an exegesis on the cricket industry’s hype factory.”Wonder if we can tie this in with our correspondent from the Guggenheim earlier. Cricket’s art and philosophy. Yuzvendra Chagall, anyone?40th over: Australia 175-7 (Smith 73, Starc 4) Here’s Mark Wood. He’s not as hard to hit as Archer has been, and Smith stands up tall to drive a couple off the back foot straight of sweeper cover, then tucks a single away. Starc guides a run to third man easily enough. The Australian No9 won’t hold back too much longer, I wouldn’t imagine. 39th over: Australia 171-7 (Smith 70, Starc 3) Smith is happy to give Starc plenty of strike against Archer, taking singles as they arise. Starc edges on his own, then later clips two runs square. Good shot. Can bat. Holds the record for the most sixes in a Test innings at the MCG, actually. Seven, I think it was?Archer bowls out with 2 for 32 from his ten.Hopefully David Murray is feeling better than he was quarter of an hour ago, when he wrote “I can’t bear this. I know we’re doing well but even if we get one of these guys out (Smith or Maxwell) I just know Cummins and Lyon will come in and get runs. The England team won’t like me for it but I’m prepared to make a deal with the powers that be: let us win today and the nice Kiwi boys can have the final. Can you please forward my offer to the appropriate channels.”Offer rescinded? Smith is still out there...38th over: Australia 166-7 (Smith 68, Starc 0) Adil Rashid. He hasn’t had the best tournament, has looked uncomfortable at times with his shoulder, but has put together the most telling performance here today. With the number 95 on his back, one can only assume in tribute to Tino Best, he bowls to Starc, foxing him utterly with a googly that spins past edge and off stump. Then again, with the same result, the left-hander going right back on his stumps and trying to defend them.There it goes! The extinguishing comes not from Archer, but Rashid! The leggie kicks another one out. Cummins backs away looking to cut, but only gets a little top edge straight to slip. Turn and bounce. 37th over: Australia 165-6 (Smith 67, Cummins 6) Morgan keeps Archer on, looking to extinguish this Australian innings now. Good captaincy. Don’t let them build a rearguard. But Cummins handles Archer pretty well, steering a couple of runs, glancing a couple, and playing softly enough that a leading edge doesn’t carry back to the bowler from a slower ball.36th over: Australia 161-6 (Smith 67, Cummins 2) Right then. It’s Smith and Cummins. Remember, the pair that ground England into submission in the Brisbane Test not so long ago? Cummins won’t mind having a long time to bat, that’s more his style than crash-bang. They collect four singles from Rashid.I’ll tell you what, the Marina Hyde OBO is getting wild support. My email inbox has gone into meltdown. Somebody ring Kath Viner and tell her what the people want. We can make a separate subset of the  supporters’ model and launch when it reaches a target. 35th over: Australia 157-6 (Smith 65, Cummins 0) Archer got the chance to take that wicket because he bowled two very high bouncers in a row that were called wide. If that was setting up Maxwell to expect a full-pace ball, then it worked. Clever bowling. It’s been a frustrating World Cup for Maxwell and for those who love his work. Lots of glimpses, never a full picture, after his excellent few months leading into this tournament. Archer 2 for 23 off eight.Archer gets his man! Not in the way you might have expected. Back of a length, and Maxwell is trying to do the sensible thing with the over nearly gone, defending off the back foot. But Archer bowls a smart off-cutter, and it sticks in the pitch substantially, slowing up. Maxwell is through his shot early and the ball loops off the splice to cover. Oh, dear.34th over: Australia 152-5 (Smith 63, Maxwell 21) Lovely shot from Maxwell! He’s got such bat speed when he goes at the ball. Smacks Rashid over midwicket, but a routinely sensational piece of boundary fielding from Bairstow saves two runs. Rashid though doesn’t meet the challenge well, dragging down and letting Maxwell pummel a more violent shot squarer for four! Then he cuts, hard, through cover but again the sweeper saves. Maxwell loving the spin, or taking the chance to get as many as he can while he can.33rd over: Australia 144-5 (Smith 62, Maxwell 14) Archer resumes, and I don’t know if its deliberate but Smith takes up the first five balls of the over. Can’t beat the field a couple of times, and Archer beats the edge another time. Maxwell again plays sensibly and takes a single off his one delivery.“Is it possible to get a Marina Hyde OBO?” asks Ravikiran Ramakrishnan. Or at least an MBM? Imagine her doing the MBM for that England Cameroon game, or even the USA semis...”I’ll tell you what, I hope so. I’m going to kick this up the chain of command. I saw Marina in the  lobby a couple of weeks ago but was too starstruck to say hello.Can I just advise that during the drinks break, Test Match Special’s young and talented producer Henry Moeran has got himself a go on the cricket bat guitar by the sideline. It turns out he can play guitar as well, as he shreds a power solo before flipping his hair back into place and going back upstairs to keep the radio commentary on track. Talented people, hey?32nd over: Australia 142-5 (Smith 61, Maxwell 13) Rashid to Smith. Teases him once. Teases him twice. Lots of loop. A googly. Smith eventually works a single fine. Maxwell on strike, and he goes downtown for six! Didn’t skip down to that one, just saw the length was full enough and got a big stride in, and with mid-on up in the circle, had no hesitation giving that ball everything he has. It soars over the fence. Then Maxwell proves his temperament by defending the last two balls. Drinks.31st over: Australia 135-5 (Smith 60, Maxwell 7) Here we go, here we go. Immediately Morgan brings back Archer to bowl to Maxwell. They want to target him with the short ball once again. A couple of normal length, then the first shorter one. Maybe a slower ball? Maxwell picks it and nails it for four! Pulled through midwicket. Back goes Archer to bowl again. Wheels on that one! It sizzles through at helmet height, and Maxwell ducks early and ducks often. This is some game of cricket today. 30th over: Australia 130-5 (Smith 59, Maxwell 3) Rashid bowls and it’s edged! Suddenly the leg-spinner is whirring down pure terror. Maxwell’s edge goes low and grounded past slip for a couple, then there’s a similar shot for a single.“An inspired piece of captaincy there, making that switch,” writes Robin Hazlehurst. “Rob was obviously flagging a little after that great start to the innings, but you get brought on and immediately a double breakthrough. Obviously makes sense to keep you on for now, but I wonder if the skipper should consider giving a couple of overs to someone from left field to break this partnership if it looks dangerous. Emma John, say? Any idea what the strategy will be in the second innings?”What would the equivalent of Matthew Wade bowling be for the OBO? George Monbiot? Can we get Charlie Brooker back? I’ll tell you what, I would subscribe for a decade to read Marina Hyde’s over-by-over.29th over: Australia 127-5 (Smith 58, Maxwell 1) Smith takes a brace then a single. Hearts in mouths for Maxwell fans the world over, but he eases early fears by taking a sober and sensible single off his pads from Stokes. On strike, Steve Smith decides to up the tempo himself with a glorious cover drive for four. Rob Smyth has just sent me through a Yellow Warning from the Met Office, which sounds dire.28th over: Australia 118-5 (Smith 50) Smith brought up his half-century amongst all that chaos. Glenn Maxwell is coming to the middle after the last ball of the over. Rashid was battling, being hit, but suddenly he has 2 for 31 from five overs.He’s been given! Huge appeal from Rashid, that was a performance like Les Miserables just before the intermission. He spun around, then ran towards the umpire and knelt down before Dharmasena, pleading. Marius to Cosette. A slider that skidded on and hit Stoinis bang in front. A touch high but the replay says yes on umpire’s call. Australia had no review to challenge it anyway. 27th over: Australia 118-3 (Smith 48, Carey 46) Stokes carries on from the city end for a quiet over. Smith glides a single to third man to raise the fifty partnership, then Carey pulls a couple of runs hard through the leg side. He’s played so well.26th over: Australia 113-3 (Smith 47, Carey 44) That’s right folks, today it’s Rob and I with the old roshambo. In my mind that means a sort of dance where we take turns, but then I wasn’t sure and googled it and apparently it’s a game where two people take turns kicking each other in the crotch. I hope that the next 50 overs will be more enjoyable than that. Poor Adil Rashid is rather roshamboed by Carey on the sweep shot out to deep midwicket for four. Throw in a single every other ball plus a wide from the first, and that’s a double-figure over for Rash.25th over: Australia 103-3 (Smith 44, Carey 38) A wide from Plunkett takes Australia in to three figures. They have, almost by stealth, got themselves right back in this game. England are still on top, but only just.24th over: Australia 98-3 (Smith 42, Carey 37) I’m not sure about Rashid today. The ball isn’t turning, his confidence is low and so far he has been milked with ease. England have six bowlers so they aren’t as reliant on him as they might be. An overthrow from Stokes gives Smith an extra run. It’s not exactly unravelling for England, but a couple of loose threads have emerged in the last half an hour. That said, Australia’s response to a crisis - and, in Carey’s case, a mangled jaw - has been so impressive.“I’m at the Peggy Guggenheim in Venice, the Jean ARP exhibition talks about how ‘the rhapsodic evocation of a creaturely art with a life of its own’,” says Tim Woollias. “It’s as if he knew the disappointment of a SmithCarey rebuild after three early wickets.”23rd over: Australia 92-3 (Smith 37, Carey 36) Carey laces Plunkett through extra cover for four, a glorious shot from a player who has been a revelation at this tournament. Smith then flashes Plunkett this far short of Stokes at backward point. It wasn’t a chance, although Stokes’s face suggests he’s annoyed at his inability to e forward five yards, extend a telescopic arm and clutch it with his little finger.“In 1984, the Demon of Frome, Colin Dredge, was Somerset’s leading wicket taker against Warwickshire in the Benson \u0026amp Hedges’ Cup,” says Kim Thonger. “I’m fairly confident that Colin’s mum would have called it Dredgebaston that day, even though Somerset lost and his figures were 2 for 66 off 11.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9086ab3cd28f721c2a7291284242562181bb1257/0_188_4134_2481/master/4134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10c1e456a528992efd8dedf0305ea561","title":"tour de france 2019 stage six live","story":"An email: “My question is: Does it look like Team Ineos will attack and how does GT look today?” asks Ryan. My answer is: no and a vision in burgundy. See for yourself. 42km to go: The gap is 7min 07sec as the breakaway and peloton continue their respective descents. Tim Wellens has guaranteed himself another day in the polka dot jersey, as long as he finishes today’s stage. 50km to go: The peloton is about to crest the Ballon D’Alsace and begin their descent. 55km to go: There’s a closely fought sprint to the top of the Ballon D’Alsace, which is won by Tim Wellens, ahead of an eight kilometre descent. Back in the bunch, Movistar have taken over at the front. Edet abandons! Ah, this just in – Nicolas has stepped off his bike and quite the race. He looked exceptionally green around the gills when an unsympathetic cameraman pulled up beside him earlier this afternoon. Get well soon, Nic. Hopefully it’s just a 24-hour bug. 60km to go: I am becoming obsessed with the plight of Nicolas Edet, who is suffering from an intestinal complaint and has now gone from 30th on GC today to virtual Lanterne Rouge on the road. He’s lost 25 minutes on the field today. 60km to go: The breakaway are five kilometres from the top of the climb with a gap of 8min 10sec to the bunch, which is still being led by three of Julian Alaphilippe’s team-mates. Team Ineos are lined up behind them, dpoing none of the work. Assorted members of Movistar are tucked in behind them. Edet watch: By my reckoning, the 31-year-old Cofidis rider has already lost over 20 minutes so far today and still has a world of hurt to endure. The men in front: Shorn of Herr Greipel, these are the 13 in the breakaway: Benoît Cosnefroy (AG2R-La Mondiale), Dylan Teuns (Bahrain-Merida), Serge Pauwels (CCC), Julien Bernard and Giulio Ciccone (Trek-Segafredo), Nikias Arndt (Sunweb), Natnael Berhane (Cofidis), Thomas De Gendt and Tim Wellens (Lotto-Soudal), Fabien Grellier (Total Direct Energie), Nils Politt (Katusha-Alpecin), Xandro Meurisse and Andrea Pasqualon (Wanty-Groupe Gobert). 63km to go: Andre Greipel has been dropped from the breakaway group, which is now making its way up the hill to the Ballon D’Alsace. The gap is 8min 24sec. It’s looking increasingly likely that one of the 13 members of the escape party will win this stage. Increasingly likely but by no means certain, yet. Feed zone: The riders in the main bunch having some lunch and your reporter is going to grab an energy bar, ahead of the business end of the stage. Back in five. Watch this, from the Global Cycling Network, while I’m away. The gap is now out to 8min 11sec, incidentally.An email: “Greipel quite regularly gets involved at the front on non-sprint stages, it’s one of the reasons why he is such a likeable racer,” writes Simon Thomas. “It may be that he’s just acting as a bridge in the event of an attack by one of his team mates or that he was trying to pick up intermediate sprint points (or stop someone else getting them). Or maybe he just fancied a crack at something different.”Edet watch: The stricken Nicolas is currently 18min 06sec behind the stage leaders and travelling at 15kmh. Hats off to him for carrying on but I suspect he will miss the time cut. 82km to go: The gap from the breakaway to the bunch is 7min 21sec. Julian Alaphilippe’s teammate Kasper Asgreen is at the front of the peloton and is getting no help from any other team. If they don’t get any help to close this gap, Trek-Segafredo rider Giulio Ciccone could finish the day in yellow.He’s 1min 43sec behind Alaphilippe on GC. A lot will hinge on whether or not Team Ineos try to win today’s stage or decide to keep their powder dry for another day. They have no reason to try to go for the stage win today but might fancy doing so anyway. An email: “Do you have any insights into why Andre Greipel is hanging with the breakaway?” asks Zach DeBruine. “It seems like he’s hanging on for dear life. Is he worried about missing the time cut-off at the end of the stage?” Anyone? My guess is he didn’t want to be at the back of the field, downwind of Nicolas Edet. 85km to go: Natnael Berhane is first over Col Du Hundsruck, followed by Tim Wellens. 86km to go: Cracking maths there on my part. That’s six different groups. 87km to go: Going by the official Tour tracker, the field appears to be split into seven different groups: the breakaway, the group of GC contenders, three different groups of stragglers and Nicolas Edet. 88km to go: Spare a thought for Nicolas Edet, who is visibly ill and already 14min 30sec and 10 kilometres off the pace being set by the breakaway. 96km to go: Total Direct Energie rider Anthony Turgis goes wide on a turn and almost goes off the road, but manages to stay upright. Now traditional crash as soon as I abandon my post: Warren Barguil hit the deck near the summit of Grand Ballon, but has got a bike change and is away rolling again. There’s a bit of damp on the road and this descent is technical and difficult. Not a time for risks. 109km to go: The breakaway group head over the short but steep second climb of the day, the category three Grand Ballon. De Gendt is first over, followed by Giulio Ciccone, who was King of the Mountains at the Giro. There’s a serious descent to come, so your reporter is going to hope nobody falls and take this opportunity to attend to collect a couple of bidons from the  team car. Back in five! 113km to go: The peloton is about to crest the summit of Le Markstein having been led all the way up by Deceuninck-Quick Step rider Kasper Asgreen. A couple of wheels back, the riders of Team Ineos are enjoying an impromptu spot of lunch after Gianni Moscon went back to the team car to fetch a musette of energy bars and gels. 116km to go: Already in the polka dot jersey, Tim Wellens is first over Le Markstein. Today’s favourites: Egan Bernal is the favourite to win today’s stage and is followed in the betting by Giulio Ciccone, Thibaut Pinot, Adam Yates, Alejandro Valverde, Geraint Thomas, Dylan Teuns, Dan Martin, Jakob Fugslang, Michael Woods, and Warren Barguil. 118km to go: There are two kilometres to go to the summit of Le Markstein and then it’s onwards and upwards to the Grand Ballon, another category one climb. The gap between the breakaway and the bunch is 6min 49sec. 120km to go: A motorcycle cameraman pulls up alongside a very forlorn looking Nicolas Edet. The Cofidis rider has been dropped from the main bunch and has just been receiving treatment from the medical car. He is unwell today and is apparently suffering from a stomach complaint. It’s going to be a long, long day for the poor sod. 123km to go: The gap from the breakaway to the peloton is now 7min 09sec. Deuceuninck-Quick Step rider Kasper Asgreen is leading the peloton along, as he has been since the breakaway formed. 1. Andrea Pasqualon: 20 points2. Nils Politt: 173. André Greipel: 154. Nikias Arndt: 135. Thomas De Gendt: 116. Dylan Teuns: 107. Fabien Grellier: 98. Giulio Ciccone: 89. Natnael Berhane: 710. Xandro Meurisse: 611. Serge Pauwels: 512. Benoît Cosnefroy: 413. Tim Wellens: 314. Julien Bernard: 2And at 6min 55sec:15. Michael Matthews: 1127km to go: Deep in conversation with Elia Viviani, Peter Sagan gets caught napping by Michael Matthews in the race for the final intermediate sprint point. He gives chase to the Australian, but is unable to catch him. The pair roll over the line, with Matthews turning to share a laugh with his rival. 128km to go: The gap is out to 6min 35sec, while Team Deceuninck-Quick Step continue to lead what passes for the charge behind them. At some point, one would expect the Skybots from Team Ineos to grab today’s stage by the scruff of the neck and squeeze tightly. Egan Bernal is many people’s idea of today’s winner. Intermediate sprint: Andrea Pasqualon wins the intermediate sprint and is followed over the line by Nils Politt and Andre Greipel in second and third. The 11 other riders in the breakaway follow them, meaning there’s just one point left up for grabs for a peloton that is now over six minutes behind them. 133km to go: The gap between the 14-man breakaway and the peloton is out to 5min 46sec and the weather has become inclement. It’s raining, but not heavily. Mitchelton Scott’s stage five diary: Matteo Trentin could not have asked for a better leadout from his teammates yesterday, but ultimately the Italian was unable to get his nose in front of Peter Sagan and had to settle for second place. There’s no shame in that. 139km to go: The riders of Team Ineos are lined up behind their colleagues from Quick Step at the front of the bunch. 140km to go: Giulio Ciccone (Trek-Segafredo) is ther highest placed GC contender in the breakaway in 42nd at 1min 43sec. He’s currently the virtual leader of this Tour and on Eurosport, the commentary team have said he’s capable of winning today’s stage. 142km to go: The gap goes out to 4min 23sec with Deceuninck-Quick Step at the front of the main peloton. Your breakaway: Benoît Cosnefroy (AG2R-La Mondiale), Dylan Teuns (Bahrain-Merida), Serge Pauwels (CCC), Julien Bernard and Giulio Ciccone (Trek-Segafredo), Nikias Arndt (Sunweb), Natnael Berhane (Cofidis), Thomas De Gendt and Tim Wellens (Lotto-Soudal), Fabien Grellier (Total Direct Energie), Nils Politt (Katusha-Alpecin), Xandro Meurisse and Andrea Pasqualon (Wanty-Groupe Gobert) and André Greipel (Arkéa-Samsic) have 1’45’’ lead after 10km. The gap to the bunch is already 2min 44sec and rising. 152km to go: One rider after another is being spat out the front of the bunch, trying to bridge the gap to the escape party of 14. Ciccone, Meurisse, Teuns, Politt, Bernard, De Gendt, Pasqualon, Berhane, Wellens, Cosnefroy, Arndt, Pauwels, Grellier and Greipel are the men in the getaway car and the bunch seem content to let them go. 155km to go: Tim Wellens, currently in the polka dot jersey, is also in the breakaway attempt. Will they get away? They’re racing! The start of today’s race has been semaphored and a group of six riders have attacked off the front of the bunch. They’re joined by another five or six who bridge the gap. Thomas De Gendt, it should go without saying, is among the early pace-setters. Serge Pauwels and Andre Greipel are there too. Happy birthday! Lotto Soudal sprinter Caleb Ewan is celebrating his 25th birthday. Out! We have our first abandonment of this year’s Tour. Team CCC’s Kiwi rider Paddy Bevan has quit the race, having felt unable to continue because of two fractured ribs he suffered in a crash on stage four. The field is down to 175 riders. Today’s roll-out: The neutralised zone is a 10 kilometres long today and the field is over halfway through it, bunched behind the red Skoda carrying race director Christian Prudhomme. They’re going at a fair old lick, a state of affairs that would suggest there’ll be a number of riders anxious to attack from the gun. Today’s intermediate sprint is at Linthal, around 30 kilometres into today’s stage, 15 kilometres from the first classified climb of the day, the category one Le Markstein. La Planche des Belles Filles: Legend has it that during the Thirty Years War (1618 to 1648), young women from Plancer-les-Mines fled into these mountains to escape Swedish mercenaries, who they feared might rape and murder them. Trapped on the mountain top where today’s stage concludes, they opted to take their own lives by jumping from the summit into the lake below, rather than surrender. One of the soldiers promptly engraved an epitaph for “the beautiful girls” into a wooden board and left it as a memorial. Hence the name of today’s brutal final climb: La Planche des Belles Filles (The Board of the Beautiful Girls).

The video and open letter from CEO Pieter Elbers asks: “Do you always have to meet face-to-face?” and “Could you take the train instead?”The campaign aims to encourage travellers and the aviation industry to consider the environmental impact of flying. It describes the “shared responsibility” of travellers and airlines to “fly more responsibly”, and says those in the industry need to “create a sustainable future for aviation”.The KLM campaign, which marks the airline’s 100th anniversary, calls on passengers to consider train travel for shorter distances and to replace face-to-face meetings with video calls. It also suggests packing lightly to reduce baggage weight so that planes uses less fuel, and to consider offsetting CO2 emissions. The airline’s carbon-offset programme (CO2zero) uses passenger contributions for reforestation projects, including a new tropical forest in Panama.However, critics have suggested that instead of asking the public to be aware of their actions, KLM, and other airlines, need to be considering solutions that lie with the industry itself. Justin Francis, founder of Responsible Travel, has called carbon-offsetting a “a dangerous distraction” from reducing emissions.“Voluntary initiatives by customers are not enough the cost of flying must increase … Responsible Travel advocates a Green Flying Duty, with the proceeds ringfenced for research and development into decarbonised aviation,” said Francis. “Carbon offsets are no substitute for carbon reduction. At the same time as telling customers to think about flying less, KLM will be telling its investors about its future growth.”The climate crisis has led France to announce the introduction of an eco-tax on tickets for all flights leaving the country. The new tax will range from €1.50 for short-haul and up to €18 for long-haul in business class. At a press conference, transport minister Élisabeth Borne, said that €180m is expected to be raised annually from 2020, which will help finance daily transport in France, notably rail.KLM has stated it is against this type of national CO2 aviation tax, because it believes Dutch passengers would travel by car to neighbouring countries, and continue to fly from there. On the company’s website, it says: “A global approach makes more sense. If the tax is implemented, we believe that it should be invested in sustainability of the aviation industry. National taxes will just go into the national coffers and won’t do anything to combat climate change.”The airline also said it would not stop promoting air travel: “We are stepping up … progress towards a sustainable future but we are a company that needs to make a profit to survive and to continue to invest in sustainable solutions. We want to still be around when we have succeeded in our efforts to make aviation sustainable.”The International Air Transport Association is backing the KLM campaign. Rafael Schvartzman, IATA’s vice-president for Europe, said: “We support it in the sense you do have a choice. In certain cases you could use the alternative.” But, he added: “The UK is an island. If you want to trade globally, you will have to count on aviation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/193335f911fc261857fd3cfffe05c66af0f1807e/352_563_4952_2971/master/4952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9287b41fd98f6de4086c44f71d6d697a","title":"jaipur jewellery johari bazaar unesco rajasthan photo essay","story":"Unesco has named the capital of Rajasthan, India, a world heritage site, partly for its jewellery and artisanal traditions, which continue to thrive on one of its main commercial streetsby Harry Johnstone, photography by Christopher Wilton-Steer‘Sir, want precious stones?” a man asks me, quietly. I am on the Johari Bazaar, one of Jaipur’s most notable thoroughfares, a straight colonnade screened above by the facades of adjoining houses. Everything is painted orange, terracotta and burnt pink. The man wears white shalwar kameez, and an air of indifference. He unfolds white paper, revealing colourful stones. “Emeralds, sapphires, rubies …” he says. He is among one of several groups of men gathered in this area they’re local dealers, discussing prices. The avenue, whose name means gem shop road, is lined with dozens of shops displaying magnificent necklaces, bracelets and rings.My encounter reveals something of why the “Pink City”, in northern India, has just been named a Unesco world heritage site. Jaipur was selected partly on the basis of its urban plan, featuring colonnaded streets and public squares called chaupurs. The city also contains architectural wonders: the City Palace, Amber Fort, and Water Palace among them. Walking past the pink sandstone Hawa Mahal (Palace of the Winds), Jaipur’s five-storey honeycomb-like wall of 50-odd protruding windows with latticework frames, miniature cupolas and painted motifs, is a breathtaking experience.Along with these ceremonial court buildings, Jaipur was constructed for commerce. As Unesco states, the city was “designed to be a commercial capital”. Today, dealers and vendors animate the streets. And in back alleys and second-storey workshops, curious visitors will find artisans working on ornamental crafts. Unesco recognises how Jaipur “has maintained its local commercial, artisanal and cooperative traditions to this day”.Jaipur is famous for its wood-block printing, tailoring, carpets, wood and metalwork. There are many contemporary boutiques, such as Teatro Dhora, selling elegant clothes, men’s handkerchiefs, notepads, leather handbags and more at (relatively) affordable prices. But it is in jewellery, in particular, where the city has historically excelled.After founding Jaipur in 1727, Jai Singh II is said to have organised a procession through the city where local crowds threw precious stones over him and his entourage. He was infatuated with jewels. Under his patronage, Jaipur started to become a centre for jewellery, attracting artisans and traders from afar. Today, the city is home to hundreds of thousands of jewellers and dealers.By talking to dealers, visitors can find opportunities to meet jewellers, like Narenda, who I chat with in his second-floor workshop off the Chand Pol Bazaar. He examines a jewel on his workspace, while sitting cross-legged on the floor. “When I go to temples, I get a lot of ideas,” he says. On the wall is a framed picture of three Hindu gods, draped with a garland of orange marigolds. Below, at street level, as ever, there’s the din of motorbikes and rickshaws. Through the window, the Nahargarh Fort is faintly visible on the hills beyond the city.Narenda works in the traditional Kundan Meena style. Kundan jewellery is unusual in using wax within the gold or silver frame, as well as incorporating glass and painted illustrations, of white, green, red or blue floral motifs. The results have an ethnic feel but when used in an ensemble of necklace, tiara, earrings and rings, Kundan can look bling. Which can be the point: the style is popular among wealthy brides from Mumbai and Delhi.While rich Indians visit Jaipur for its gems, the city offers jewellery for anyone. Backpackers and tourists can find inexpensive, quality pieces in dozens of shops around the city. It requires patience and a discerning eye.Visitors can develop their knowledge of Indian jewellery at the Amrapali museum on Ashok Marg Road. It is an extraordinary collection of jewellery, displayed over two small floors. A mesmerising foot-long, 19th-century gold braid, from Tamil Nadu, engraved with Hindu gods and goddesses, is just one of hundreds of spectacular pieces.Amrapali also manufactures jewellery at scale. Its 1,500 “factory -floor” jewellers produce pieces that are mostly sold to other companies at a range of price points. The jewellers are Bengalis, I learn, while stone-cutters are generally Muslims, and gem traders are Marwaris, a Rajasthani caste. Most of Jaipur’s jewellers are men, though efforts are being made to employ more women. Tarang Arora, the son of one of the founders of Amrapali, stresses that the company is committed to ensuring its workers’ welfare.To some extent, the Amrapali factory and several others in Jaipur are trying to compete with Chinese industry. When it comes to economies of scale, though, Jaipur would probably lose out. Plus, it may make more sense for the city’s jewellery producers to associate themselves with Jaipur’s “brand” as a hub for handicrafts.This is where Tallin, Akshat Ghiya’s workshop-boutique, is well positioned. The company employs around 20 artisans. The jewellers work in an upper-floor space along the Johari Bazaar. Tallin makes traditional Rajasthani and art deco-inspired pieces. Anyone can visit to see the craftsmen in action and pour over their glittering pieces in Akshat’s office-showroom.Such an intimate environment must be conducive to good craftsmanship. One of Tallin’s jewellers, Srikant, talks about how his trade has allowed him to connect to his artistry, his gift, even. He adds that for him and his fellow Bengalis, crafting jewellery offers something else: “It brings us honour.” No doubt this is something the people at Unesco would like to see preserved.Looking for a holiday with a difference?

Who might join them next?There have been plenty of surprises concerning Meryl Streep joining Big Little Lies. First, there was the Streep Scream, an earth-shattering howl that launched 1,000 memes. Second, there has been her performance as a whole: sometimes Deirdre Barlow channelling Willy Wonka sometimes a less considered Mrs Doubtfire. Yet for many watchers, the main surprise remains that we’re seeing Streep on TV at all.With her three Oscars, Streep is the queen of Hollywood’s old guard, the kind of film icon who at one time would never have done telly. She did appear in HBO’s Angels in America, but that was hardly normal TV – more theatre looking down its nose at a camera. Her appearance in Big Little Lies, a big, silly, schlocky TV series, signifies something else. Here’s a film legend accepting that, in order to stay big, the pictures have to get a little smaller.Streep’s not alone. George Clooney, who fought so hard to shrug off his role as hunky Dr Ross in ER, is back on TV in Catch-22. Sean Penn, has already starred in one series, astronaut drama The First, and will soon star in another, American Lion. Julianne Moore will head up Lisey’s Story, produced by Apple TV, hot on the heels of Julia Roberts in Amazon’s Homecoming, and Amy Adams tackling HBO’s Sharp Objects last year.It’s no surprise that movie stars are now doffing their caps to the growing cultural and financial might of TV and its associated streaming services. With Hollywood seeming ever staler, patriarchal and stuck in the same formats, TV is leading the way in writing and representation. It wasn’t exactly an abasement when Thandie Newton tackled Westworld and Line of Duty, and no one thought their auras were tarnished when Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson tried True Detective. None of this has been a sudden collapse of the defences, more a crumbling after a long siege. It’s likely Streep is appearing in Big Little Lies because season one starred Nicole Kidman, Laura Dern and Reese Witherspoon, who also produced the show. The fact that Hollywood has long struggled to provide decent roles for women over 40 has tipped many towards a medium that will engage with its large female audience.“All these talented women playing wives and girlfriends, I just had enough,” said Witherspoon in 2017. If this didn’t necessarily apply to the very top tier, it is the ecosystem above which they had been hovering anxiously. Kidman’s much-vaunted career renaissance over the last few years is, in part, due to her realising she could get even better opportunities when not working in just one medium.What’s more, the success of Big Little Lies is a reminder of the collapse of a certain type of similar mid-budget film, the “classy” drama on which many of these A-listers have built their reputations. There is a strong sense that today’s movies cater to the either blockbuster crowd – the Avengers, Pokémon – or the arthouse. Roberts, for instance, bagged her Oscar in 2001 for Steven Soderbergh’s Erin Brockovich, but would it be a film today? Surely it would be a prestigious five-parter on Netflix.It is worth bearing in mind, though, that Roberts won’t reappear in Homecoming, and the True Detective cast changes every season – nothing is more ageing, after all, than doing the same role season after season. Other, younger film stars, such as Jennifer Lawrence, are holding back from TV, too, which is strange when you consider how bumpy her recent movie career has been. Indeed, it’s tempting to think that something like her recent Red Sparrow would be much more at home on the Netflix navigation bar. Sitting next to Renée Zellweger’s WhatIf, it could even have looked reasonably sane.Right now, a one-off TV appearance gives you zeitgeist cachet – and a younger audience. TV is where “the conversation” is and you’d have to be pretty hidebound, or rich, not to care about staying relevant. Streep’s scream could be turned into memes and gifs in minutes. Would the same scream, in a cinema, create that cultural moment?Yet some stars are still resolutely holding out, among them Brad Pitt, Tom Hanks and Johnny Depp. The most glaring absentee, though, is Tom Cruise. The big daddy of Tinseltown sticks to the big screen and his Top Gun and Mission Impossible reboots. Is the small screen too small for Cruise? Given that his stardom has been worked at as assiduously as his acting, perhaps he cannot countenance being shrunk by these newer media (although younger fans are watching his movies on mobile phones). Pitt has helped produce some prestige telly (executive producer on The OA and Barry Jenkins’s forthcoming series The Underground Railroad) but hasn’t appeared on TV yet, unless you count his recurring small turn as a weatherman on his favourite comedy, The Jim Jefferies Show. This is a very old-school approach to television, treating it like a place to lark about. In 2019, to make only a cameo looks patronising. What will lure Pitt in? Surely something soon. He’s probably at a table at the Chateau Marmont right now, pondering a witty, woke six-parter on Hulu that would bump up his credibility with the kids. And if he needs a co-star, Liam Neeson doesn’t seem to be doing any telly, either."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adec114e9a3ad1bfdb8da4c2c7bf54e0fc3c08be/0_79_3032_1819/master/3032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0098c2c08d0c16cb0eb413ad6255787b","title":"angela merkel sits anthems after latest shaking episode","story":"German chancellor reportedly requests change of protocol after third bout of tremblingAngela Merkel sat through the German and Danish national anthems during a ceremony welcoming Denmark’s prime minister to Berlin. The German chancellor reportedly requested the change in protocol a day after she was seen shaking in public for the third time in as many weeks.Merkel appeared calm as she and the new Danish leader, Mette Frederiksen, took seats on white upholstered chairs on the red carpet during military honours outside the chancellery in Berlin. The chancellor remained still throughout the hymns, moving only to smile and nod at her visitor.A report in the Bild newspaper suggested Merkel had asked for a change to the protocol in which the leaders would normally stand through the ceremony. A day earlier, Merkel was seen trembling while standing at the same location as she welcomed the Finnish prime minister, Antti Rinne.Afterwards, the chancellor, who intends to step down by 2021, said she was “doing fine” and indicated she believed the cause of the shaking bouts was at least partly psychological.The latest episode, which appeared to stop when Merkel moved, was thought to be less serious than previous bouts. The 64-year-old was seen moving uncontrollably during military honours for the visiting Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in blazing heat on 18 June.“I am going through a phase of processing the recent military honours with President Zelenskiy,” Merkel said on Wednesday. “This appears not to be quite finished yet, but I am making progress and will have to live with it for a while.”After the initial bout, she blamed dehydration, later claiming she recovered after a drink of water. But a week later she had a similar episode in more comfortable weather while appearing with the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, at the Bellevue Palace in Berlin.One German media report, citing government sources, suggested Merkel’s second shaking bout was triggered by the memory of the first. She was also seen shaking during military honours in humid conditions in Mexico City in 2017.Merkel’s decision to sit through the ceremony will further fuel speculation about whether the long-serving leader’s famously gruelling schedule – including frequent all-night marathon meetings – – has begun to take its toll on her health. Explanations floated in the German press range from dehydration to anxiety, overwork and stress."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d6ef72033b6699987e0c24737e3f79164fa38fa/0_44_2659_1596/master/2659.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=204b167e41be3450868e0ed38abfe368","title":"deutsche bank faces us investigation over work for malaysia 1mdb fund","story":"Report says justice officials examining if bank broke foreign corruption or money-laundering lawsUS officials are investigating whether the crisis-hit Deutsche Bank violated foreign corruption or anti-money-laundering laws in its work for the Malaysian state fund 1MDB, according to reports.It follows the bank’s plans to scrap its global equities unit, cut some fixed-income operations and slash 18,000 jobs globally in a $8.34bn (£6.64bn) restructuring programme.Deutsche’s work for 1MDB included helping to raise $1.2bn in 2014 as concerns about the fund begun to circulate, the Wall Street Journal said on Wednesday, citing sources.Much of the $6bn raised by the now-defunct sovereign fund during its years in operation has gone missing.Prosecutors are looking into the role of Tan Boon-Kee, a colleague of a former Goldman Sachs executive, Tim Leissner, who worked with him on 1MDB-related business, the the WSJ said.She left Goldman to become Asia-Pacific head of banking for financial institutions at Deutsche, where she had further 1MDB dealings, it added.In a statement, Deutsche Bank said it had fully cooperated with all regulatory and law enforcement agencies that made inquiries.“As stated in asset forfeiture complaints filed by the US department of justice, 1MDB made ‘material misrepresentations and omissions to Deutsche Bank officials’ in connection with 1MDB’s transactions with the bank,” the bank told Reuters. “This is consistent with the bank’s own findings in this matter.”A justice department civil asset-forfeiture complaint repeatedly describes Deutsche Bank as being misled by 1MDB officers, the WSJ said.It embarks on a period of global expansion, beginning with the acquisition of merchant bank Morgan Grenfell in the UK and other European markets such as Spain, where it buys Banco de Madrid. It consolidates its US operations into one, in an effort to take on the big beasts of Wall Street such as Goldman Sachs, and in 1999 it builds on its US foothold by snapping up New York-based Bankers Trust for $10bn.Deutsche Bank\u0026nbspfloats on the New York Stock Exchange, cementing its position as one of the major players, not just on Wall Street but in global banking.Deutsche Bank becomes a leader in mortgage-backed securities, bundling up homeowners’ debt into huge packages and selling them on to investors. The bank continues to sell toxic mortgage-based investments even as the market turns south and it begins betting against such products itself. The bank reports its first annual loss for five decades for the 2008 financial year, losing €3.9bn.An internal investigation finds that the bank hired private detectives to spy on people it considered a threat – including a shareholder, a journalist and a member of the public. German prosecutors find no evidence of criminal wrongdoing or that senior executives were involved.It is fined $2.5bn (£1.7bn) by US and UK regulators for rigging the Libor interest rate, ordered to fire seven employees and accused of being obstructive towards regulators. Joint chief executives Anshu Jain and Jürgen Fitschen\u0026nbspresign in the wake of the Libor scandal. The bank is\u0026nbspfined a further $258m\u0026nbspin the US for doing business with US-sanctioned countries like Iran and Syria.As regulators continue to sift through the wreckage of the banking crash, Deutsche takes a large slice of the blame. In September 2016, its shares slump on news that the institution\u0026nbspfaces a $14bn (£10.5bn) charge\u0026nbspover mis-selling mortgage securities in the US. It eventually reaches a $7.2bn settlement with the US Department of Justice.UK and US regulators\u0026nbspfine Deutsche more than $630m (£506m)\u0026nbspafter finding that the lender failed to prevent $10bn of Russian money laundering via \u0027mirror trades\u0027, which had no economic purpose and served only to transfer money covertly.New York financial regulators hand down a fresh fine, just $205m this time, for \u0027lax oversight\u0027 in the bank’s foreign exchange business when it was the world’s largest dealer in foreign currency.Christian Sewing takes over as chief executive and after three consecutive years of heavy losses, he\u0026nbspslashes 7,000 jobs\u0026nbspfrom Deutsche’s bloated investment banking arm.Tan left Deutsche last year after it discovered communications between her and Jho Low, the Malaysian financier that the US justice department has described as the central player in the 1MDB scandal, it added.The insurance company FWD Group, Tan’s current employer, said she declined to comment when contacted by the WSJ.The justice department and FWD did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d1a53b147dd8adb8a67db5de6b38a60f4b127f7/0_44_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bfea24948dc4b2700837ffb3de178d0c","title":"iranian boats harass british oil tanker in strait of hormuz","story":"UK government spokesman says three Iranian boats were warned off by HMS Montrose, but Tehran denies involvementThree Iranian boats have “attempted to impede” a British oil tanker in the Gulf, further deepening tensions in the vital shipping channel off Iran.The incident took place in the strait of Hormuz through which the commercial vessel, British Heritage, was attempting to pass on Wednesday.It is the latest in a series of recent incidents in the area which have sent tensions between Iran and the US soaring. It also comes after the UK seizure of an Iranian oil tanker last week, for which Tehran has threatened retaliation.“Contrary to international law, three Iranian vessels attempted to impede the passage of a commercial vessel, British Heritage, through the strait of Hormuz,” a Ministry of Defence statement released on Thursday morning said.The British warship, HMS Montrose, was “forced to position herself between the Iranian vessels and British Heritage and issue verbal warnings to the Iranian vessels, which then turned away,” the statement said.“We are concerned by this action and continue to urge the Iranian authorities to de-escalate the situation in the region.”Iran rejected the claims. Foreign minister Javad Zarif called the British allegations “worthless” in remarks to the semi-official Fars news agency.Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp (IRGC) also issued a statement denying involvement.US defence officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, had earlier told Reuters that the incident happened at the northern entrance of the strait of Hormuz.“It was harassment and an attempt to interfere with the passage,” another official said.A spokesperson for US central command, Captain Bill Urban, said: “We are aware of the reports of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp Navy’s FACFIAC harassment and attempts to interfere with the passage of the UK-flagged merchant vessel British Heritage today near the strait of Hormuz.“Threats to international freedom of navigation require an international solution.”CNN reported that a US surveillance aircraft recorded video of the incident. It said the HMS Montrose, which was escorting the oil tanker, trained its guns on the IRGC boats and issued a verbal warning. No shots were fired.British Heritage was believed to be near the island of Abu Musa when it was approached by the Iranian boats. The island is in disputed territorial waters between Iran and the UAE, but the UK said the HMS Montrose remained in international waters throughout the episode.On Wednesday Iranian president Hassan Rouhani warned the UK it would face unspecified consequences as a result of the UK’s seizure of an oil tanker bound for Syria off the coast of Gibraltar last week. The ship, believed to be in breach of EU sanctions on Syria, remains in British possession.Rouhani was quoted by the Iranian official IRNA news agency calling the seizure of the Iranian oil ship “mean and wrong”. During a cabinet meeting he warned London: “You are an initiator of insecurity and you will understand its repercussions.”The strait of Hormuz, which provides passage from the Gulf of Oman to the open sea, is the most important gateway for oil exports in the world. With Iran on its northern shore, and the UAE and Oman on its southern shore, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) calls it the world’s worst \u0027chokepoint\u0027In 2016, 18.5m barrels of crude oil were transported each day through the strait of Hormuz, compared with 16m through the strait of Malacca, which runs between the Indonesian island of Sumatra, Malaysia and Thailand, connecting the Indian Ocean with the South China Sea. 5m barrels of crude oil are transported annually through the next largest chokepoint, the Suez canal.Last week a former leader of the Revolutionary Guard said the Islamic Republic should consider seizing a British oil tanker in response.Mohsen Rezaei, who led the Guard during Iran’s 1980s “tanker war” in the Gulf, made the comments the day after nearly 30 Royal Marines were deployed to impound the oil tanker Grace 1.Tehran has been accused of sabotaging oil tankers in the strait of Hormuz in an attempt at economic retaliation against the US after Donald Trump pulled out of a 2015 nuclear agreement and imposed sanctions on Iran.The UK and other European countries have been trying to save the deal, in which Tehran agreed to limits on its nuclear programme in exchange for relief from crippling international sanctions.Tehran’s recent decision to ramp up uranium enrichment together with the brinkmanship in the Gulf waters, however, makes it unlikely to survive.The US is planning a multi-nation coalition force to monitor the Iranian presence in the crucial waterway and off the coast of Yemen, Pentagon officials said this week.Marine General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he discussed the matter on Tuesday with acting secretary of defence Mark Esper and secretary of state Mike Pompeo.“We’re getting ready now to move out,” he told reporters at Fort Myer, Virginia.“We have a pretty clear concept of what we want to do.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/228a909806ae47acc2105e120e0feb782c8a9d2e/802_632_3721_2233/master/3721.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5b21f3e1fd95c093af0c0f4727ba170","title":"hong kongs lennon walls in pictures","story":"Hong Kongers have displayed a characteristically riotous embrace of political graffiti in the form of Post-it notes documenting their anger and hope, during their huge anti-government rallies.

Earlier this week at a private meeting, Mr Coveney accused Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt of having an “utterly disingenuous debate” on Brexit in their contest to become British prime minister.Mr Coveney described the contenders as “people who should know better”.On Thursday, he told the Dáil that “the commitment of the Government throughout the Brexit process to prevent a hard border remains the highest priority”.Mr Coveney said this summer, commentary would be dominated by Brexit and the build up to September and October and the challenges of dealing with a potential no-deal scenario.He said he would be available through the Dáil recess to brief opposition TDs or address any queries they might have to “ensure that unity of purpose created in this House around Brexit can be sustained and strengthened” in the difficult time ahead.Former Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams expressed concern that the Government’s action plan highlighted a risk the UK government might initiate a move to direct rule in Northern Ireland. He called for confirmation that the Government was “implacably opposed” to such a move and would use all international forums if the British attempted this.In replay, Minister of State for European Affairs Helen McEntee said that “we have always said - the Tánaiste, Taoiseach and myself as Minister - that that would not be something we would ever accept”.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

government","story":"Ministers are urging schools to put on special workshops for students aged 16-18 to ensure they feel comfortable with the prospect of leaving homeSixth formers are to be quizzed on whether they can cook five hot meals and how often they should change their sheets, as part of a Government-backed scheme to prepare them for university.Ministers are urging schools to put on special workshops for students aged 16-18 to ensure they feel comfortable with the prospect of leaving home.  The course, designed by the university accommodation provider Unite Students, will teach pupils how to manage their finances and how to live independently.  According to the course materials, teachers should ask students questions which may not have occurred to them, such as “what is the price of a litre of milk?” and “list 5 hot meals you can cook from scratch” and “how often will you wash your sheets once you move out of home?”Damian Hinds, the Education Secretary, said: “We are all very conscious that moving away from home and going to university is one of the most exciting things that happens in your life but it can also be very daunting.”He said that an important part of education is preparing children for adulthood so “and it is right that we teach them what to expect for life after school”.Mr Hinds said that when he got to university, he discovered he had “relied on my mum more than I realised I did” adding: “I wish I could have cooked better.”Earlier this year, ministers set up a new taskforce called the Education Transitions Network, which includes representatives from Universities UK, Ucas and the National Union of Students. It is part of a drive by the Department for Education to address the rise in students who report mental health issues during their time at university.Data released earlier this year showed that the number of students declaring mental health problems on arrival at university has surged.Figures obtained via freedom of information requests showed a 73 per cent rise between 2014-15 and 2017-18 in students stating that they had a condition such as depression or anxiety before starting their courses.Britain \u0026#39recommends heightened security\u0026#39 for ships in Straits of Hormuz after Iran tries to block oil tankerTory leadership latest: Theresa May\u0026#39s successor likely to pick next British ambassador to US in boost to Boris JohnsonAngela Merkel sits during national anthem after bouts of shakingComment: In the face of anti-Semitism charges, Labour\u0026#39s flailing paranoia only proves their critics rightComment: Iran\u0026#39s game of dare on the high seas risks full-blown war with the WestAnalysis: Britain\u0026#39s Iran policy is a mass of contradictionsJudge criticises Greater Manchester Police in Anthony Grainger shooting Comment: Harry and Meghan deserve sympathy, not our scathing judgmentInspectors swoop to expose seedy underbelly of Belgian pigeon racingAmber Rudd U-turn on no deal Brexit paves way for job in Boris Johnson CabinetPolice force goes to court over plans to make all new officers graduatesChernobyl to become an \u0026#39official tourist attraction\u0026#39, with new walking trails and better mobile receptionAtheism and Islam on the rise in the UK as Christianity suffers \u0026#39dramatic decline\u0026#39Baby boy chokes to death at private Edinburgh nurseryArchbishop of York: Parishes are \u0026#39enabling abuse\u0026#39 by refusing to punish paedophiles whom they deem \u0026#39lovely people\u0026#39\u0026#39They tell me I’m bewitched\u0026#39: How Malawi is fighting back against the pain and stigma of elephantiasis Tommy Robinson jailed for nine months for contempt of court over social media videoSix tourists killed after fierce hail storm tore through beach front in GreeceHormuz: the strategic strait that may plunge US and Iran into warComment: Darroch has squandered the moral high ground with his undiplomatic resignationWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"angela merkel seen shaking third time welcomes finnish pm","story":"Angela Merkel has insisted she is very well after she was seen shaking at a public occasion for the third time in recent weeks on Wednesday.The veteran Chancellor can be seen shaking at a ceremony to welcome the Finnish prime minister to Berlin in a short video clip circulating on social media.After shaking for a few seconds she gestures to Finnish leader Antti Rinne and then walks away without showing any signs of distress.Reuters has also reported that Mrs Merkel started to shake during the meeting in Berlin.Speaking to journalists afterwards, Mrs Merkel said: I feel very well, there is no need to worry. She added: I think me saying I am fine should be acceptable.Mrs Merkel held her arms during a shaking episode in Berlin last monthMrs Merkel has carried on with her scheduled appointments since the incident, and no official explanation has been offered.The German leader’s first shaking fit came on June 18 when she welcomed the Ukrainian president to Berlin.

His club is now under a cloud because JB would have needed an accomplice to carry out the fraud. Our entire association is being discredited by this matter and all our achievements are now being questioned, said Eric Moors, board member of the De Vrede club, said. The scandal is not the first to hit pigeon racing, which has witnessed accusations of doping and other skullduggery.In 2009, Belgian pigeon fanciers accused the Chinese mafia of stealing 64 racing pigeons before cutting their feet off to steal their identification bands.It is far easier to smuggle the prized bands abroad and put them on a different bird than get a bird-napped pigeon across borders. Tory leadership latest: Boris Johnson would win leadership contest by comfortable majority, poll showsBritain \u0026#39recommends heightened security\u0026#39 for ships in Straits of Hormuz after Iran tries to block oil tankerAngela Merkel sits during national anthem after bouts of shakingComment: In the face of anti-Semitism charges, Labour\u0026#39s flailing paranoia only proves their critics rightComment: Iran\u0026#39s game of dare on the high seas risks full-blown war with the WestAnalysis: Britain\u0026#39s Iran policy is a mass of contradictionsJudge criticises Greater Manchester Police in Anthony Grainger shooting Comment: Harry and Meghan deserve sympathy, not our scathing judgmentAmber Rudd U-turn on no deal Brexit paves way for job in Boris Johnson CabinetPolice force goes to court over plans to make all new officers graduatesChernobyl to become an \u0026#39official tourist attraction\u0026#39, with new walking trails and better mobile receptionAtheism and Islam on the rise in the UK as Christianity suffers \u0026#39dramatic decline\u0026#39Baby boy chokes to death at private Edinburgh nurseryArchbishop of York: Parishes are \u0026#39enabling abuse\u0026#39 by refusing to punish paedophiles whom they deem \u0026#39lovely people\u0026#39\u0026#39They tell me I’m bewitched\u0026#39: How Malawi is fighting back against the pain and stigma of elephantiasis Tommy Robinson jailed for nine months for contempt of court over social media videoSix tourists killed after fierce hail storm tore through beach front in GreeceHormuz: the strategic strait that may plunge US and Iran into warComment: Darroch has squandered the moral high ground with his undiplomatic resignationPoldark season 5: when does it start?

A US aircraft flying overhead filmed the incident, but the footage has not yet been released. The Guards boats withdrew after HMS Montrose, a Royal Navy frigate which had been escorting the tanker, aimed its guns on the Iranians and warned them to move away.Iran on Thursday threatened retaliation for the recent seizure of an Iranian tanker by the Royal Navy in Gibraltar. Now an action that does not need ability but some stupidity has been carried out by them, Rear Admiral Ali Fadavi, a deputy Guards commander, said, according to Tasnim news agency.The American government... and also England... should not have taken action if they had made the smallest calculation, he said.We had rented this ship and we carried the cargo. Their action was very silly and they will certainly regret it. Our reciprocal action will be announced.Iran also denied it had impeded a British oil tanker in the Strait of Hormuz.There has been no confrontation in the last 24 hours with any foreign vessels, including British ones, the Revolutionary Guards said in a statement.A Ministry of Defence spokesperson said: “Contrary to international law, three Iranian vessels attempted to impede the passage of a commercial vessel, British Heritage, through the Strait of Hormuz.“HMS Montrose was forced to position herself between the Iranian vessels and British Heritage and issue verbal warnings to the Iranian vessels, which then turned away.“We are concerned by this action and continue to urge the Iranian authorities to de-escalate the situation in the region.”It was reported earlier that HMS Montrose, a Type-23 frigate, was in the region to safeguard  another British oil tanker in the region, the Pacific Voyager.A spokesman for BP, which operates the British Heritage tanker, said: Our top priority is the safety and security of our crews and vessels. While we are not commenting on these events, we thank the Royal Navy for their support.It is understood the ship was not carrying cargo.Tensions have escalated between the UK and Iran over the Royal Marines’ seizure of an Iranian oil tanker in Gibraltar last Thursday. The Islamic Republic had warned there would be a response to the seizure of the Grace 1, with President Hassan Rouhani saying on Wednesday that Britain “will realise the consequences later.”Mr Rouhani called the seizure of the vessel, which was bound for Syria and accused of flouting EU sanctions, mean and wrong during a Cabinet meeting.He warned London: You are an initiator of insecurity and you will understand its repercussions, without elaborating.An Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander threatened on Friday to seize a British ship in retaliation.Gulf of OmanIran denies the vessel was headed to Banyas refinery in Syria, where the government of President Bashar al-Assad is an ally of Tehran.The Pacific Voyager, an Isle of Man-flagged oil tanker, and the British Heritage had been sheltering off the coast of Saudi Arabia this week amid fears they would be seized in retaliation.The British Heritage was due to dock in the Iraqi city of Basra on the weekend but made an unexpected U-turn.The British-flagged ship, able to hold more than one million barrels of oil, was contracted by Royal Dutch Shell to collect the crude and deliver it to northwest Europe but the order was cancelled.The latest reported incident comes after Iran said it had lost patience with perceived inaction by European countries more than a year after US President Donald Trump withdrew the US out of a 2015 agreement curbing Tehran\u0027s nuclear programme.Washington has since stepped up economic sanctions against Iran and moved to bring the country\u0027s oil exports to zero as part of a maximum pressure policy to make Iran halt actions that it said undermined regional security.Iran has responded to the sanctions by starting to breach limits put on its nuclear activities under the 2015 pact.Several oil tankers were attacked in waters near Iran\u0027s southern coast in May and June, for which the United States blamed Iran.

As for UK businesses, about 90 per cent have some form of contingency planning in place, he said,\u0026nbspand the government has made progress in readying the country’s trade infrastructure such as ports and customs for a no-deal Brexit.But the government is not “all the way there”, Mr Carney added, making the same observation about some UK exporters and noting that firms overall still expect “sales to go down, they expect employment to go down, they expect costs to go up and they expect the economy to slow” if Britain leaves without an agreement.“Even with a smooth adjustment, this would be a major economic adjustment, a major economic shock,” Mr Carney told reporters after the central bank released its half-yearly financial stability report.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe report warns\u0026nbspof a negative impact on consumers and businesses from a likely “sharp” adjustment in the sterling exchange rate and in the prices of other UK assets following a disorderly Brexit.The pound has already lost 15 per cent of its value since the start of 2016 against a basket of currencies that includes the dollar and the euro, according to the document.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersPressed further on the government’s preparedness, Mr Carney said: “It’s a huge exercise to rebuild the customs system from scratch and to build the necessary capacity in order to operate it in an economy that’s a just-in-time economy.\u0026nbsp“It’s a marvel of just how integrated these economies are and how efficient they are under the current system, and it needs to shift from one system to another potentially overnight…\u0026nbsp“There is progress, but there is more to be done in terms of capacity and infrastructure, there is more to be done in terms of companies being plugged into the system, which is under the WTO rules as opposed to under a common market.”Mr Carney also noted that the EU authorities have more to do to prevent disruption to financial services in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Although such disruption would primarily affect households and businesses on the continent, it could “spill back to the United Kingdom in ways that can’t be fully anticipated or fully mitigated”, he said.Boris Johnson, the frontrunner to become the next prime minister, has insisted he will take Britain out of the EU on 31 October with or without a deal.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Firing people is expensive and disruptive so companies only move when they have to, when\u0026nbspthings have clearly entered a downward\u0026nbspspiral.But recruitment behaves a little differently. One way employers respond if they see troubles ahead is by delaying it. They put off making decisions and let things ride until they have a clearer idea of the outlook. If that’s what is starting to happen, the results of companies like Michael Page are where you’ll see it first. \u0026nbspOn the face of it, the latest set of numbers look rather good. The company touted a record quarter with 16 countries growing by 10 per cent or more. Despite this, the share price resembled the final part of a rollercoaster on its\u0026nbsprelease, the sharp e just before everyone gets off and reaches for the sick bag (in the case of the parents).\u0026nbspTough crowd? Not really. The market is less interested in Michael Page’s successful past than it is in what’s coming. The company was punished because it warned that its profits will likely be at the lower end of the market’s expectations as a result of “the current macroeconomic conditions”.\u0026nbspIn English, Michael\u0026nbspPage\u0026nbspis telling us that it’s worried about the global economy slowing and hitting hiring. The signs of that were all over the trading statement.\u0026nbspThe economy is a small boat tossed by the waves of political madnessThe £183m British Airways fine is a game-changer for consumersOcado’s tech gobbledygook has investors in a tizzy Having added more than 600 fee-earners in the first quarter of the year, its\u0026nbspnumbers fell by 122 in the second. Growth in gross profits from temporary hires was much faster than that from permanent placements. If you’re worried about the future but you have a gap, it makes sense to fill it with a\u0026nbsptemp, particularly in places where firing is difficult and expensive (such as France).For those of us living in the Brexit-battered UK, the situation looks worse. This country is the only one of the markets that Michael\u0026nbspPage breaks out to show a decline in gross profits.\u0026nbspIts numbers don’t give a picture of the entire UK labour force, but they still don’t bode at all well for the future. They chime with the Employment Index put out by business adviser BDO at the start of the week. It fell to its lowest level in a year, moving partner Peter Hemington to opine that “the glory years of rising UK employment figures could be coming to an end”.\u0026nbspSo that canary? It’s starting to struggle for breath as the global economy catches a chill. But in Britain it’s on the floor of its cage, gasping.\u0026nbspWe’re just starting to feel\u0026nbspthe whirlwind of the Brexiteers’ folly. Boris Johnson banging on about optimism and believing in Britain won’t come as much comfort if the hiring delays, or even recruitment freezes, Brexit is causing start to turn into widespread redundancy programmes.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They succeeded by offering a lot of value to consumers first and foremost, but also to marketers.Before them, if a firm wanted a consumer to read (F) something, buy (A) something, install (A) something, watch (N) something, or search (G) for something, there were not many other options.But thanks to a new generation of companies, marketers are about to have a lot more options.\u0026nbspPrediction #1: Every company that has a direct relationship with users and access to data will eventually get into advertising.When you reach consumers and you have access to data, you’ll eventually realise the value in monetising that audience beyond your core product – with ads.Advertising is a $600bn-plus-a-year business, and the “marketing market” is even greater than that as it includes all the activities necessary to bring a product or service all the way to the consumer. So a piece of it, even if it’s a small one, is too tempting to pass up.\u0026nbspTake Amazon as an example. It expanded into advertising only around three years ago and has since become the third-largest advertising company in the US, with $18bn in revenue from the business stream. Even Apple, which for all intents and purposes is not an advertising company, is expected to generate $2bn in search ads in the app store by 2020. \u0026nbspThe only reason a company would choose not to enter the advertising business is if it doesn’t reach enough consumers or if it doesn’t have its own data.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.126 Project Scarlett to succeed Xbox OneMicrosoft announced Project Scarlett, the successor to the Xbox One, at E3 2019.

E-commerce companies like Wayfair and Boxed built alternative marketplaces for groups of like-minded customers. Brands such as mattress maker Casper or Dollar Shave Club pioneered new subscription models based around brand story and community, disrupting Sleepy’s and P\u0026ampG’s Gillette, respectively. These companies’ most valuable asset is always their customer relationships (and data) whether they stay private, go public or get acquired.\u0026nbspThis new generation of post-FAANG-era companies is here to stay.\u0026nbspRising stars like Pinterest and Airbnb will continue to thrive, creating new user-friendly online spaces that are compelling in their own right. Activity on these owned-and-operated mobile apps and websites generates hugely valuable troves of first-party data, which can then be used to improve user experience, strengthen customer relationships and convert users into advocates. This virtuous cycle offers a more sustainable and differentiated growth strategy for the rising generation of consumer brands.And in the end, everybody will tap into the advertising market, offering various businesses the option to be promoted natively within their environment.\u0026nbspLast prediction: I’m optimistic about the future of advertisers, and this trajectory is great for consumers.\u0026nbspThese new and emerging companies are evidence that a new era has arrived. While no one can afford to wean themselves entirely off any single major platform, the recent IPOs and those still to come prove there is a huge wave of new companies that will give advertisers more choice.\u0026nbspBoth established and emerging brands will continue to advertise across FAANG, but with more advertising channels in their arsenal. I’m optimistic as there will be less concentration, more value for money and more access to the data advertisers need to succeed.\u0026nbspThis is particularly great for consumers because if advertisers have choices outside of FAANG, their advertising costs will decrease and their product prices won’t have to increase in response.\u0026nbspThese are exciting times for any company or investor looking to engage consumers. We are about to see a whole new crop of marketing companies, and this is great for all of us.\u0026nbspAdam Singolda\u0026nbspis the founder and chief executive of Taboola.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As for UK businesses, about 90 per cent have some form of contingency planning in place, he said,\u0026nbspand the government has made progress in readying the country’s trade infrastructure such as ports and customs for a no-deal Brexit.But the government is not “all the way there”, Mr Carney added, making the same observation about some UK exporters and noting that firms overall still expect “sales to go down, they expect employment to go down, they expect costs to go up and they expect the economy to slow” if Britain leaves without an agreement.“Even with a smooth adjustment, this would be a major economic adjustment, a major economic shock,” Mr Carney told reporters after the central bank released its half-yearly financial stability report.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe report warns\u0026nbspof a negative impact on consumers and businesses from a likely “sharp” adjustment in the sterling exchange rate and in the prices of other UK assets following a disorderly Brexit.The pound has already lost 15 per cent of its value since the start of 2016 against a basket of currencies that includes the dollar and the euro, according to the document.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersPressed further on the government’s preparedness, Mr Carney said: “It’s a huge exercise to rebuild the customs system from scratch and to build the necessary capacity in order to operate it in an economy that’s a just-in-time economy.\u0026nbsp“It’s a marvel of just how integrated these economies are and how efficient they are under the current system, and it needs to shift from one system to another potentially overnight…\u0026nbsp“There is progress, but there is more to be done in terms of capacity and infrastructure, there is more to be done in terms of companies being plugged into the system, which is under the WTO rules as opposed to under a common market.”Mr Carney also noted that the EU authorities have more to do to prevent disruption to financial services in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Although such disruption would primarily affect households and businesses on the continent, it could “spill back to the United Kingdom in ways that can’t be fully anticipated or fully mitigated”, he said.Boris Johnson, the frontrunner to become the next prime minister, has insisted he will take Britain out of the EU on 31 October with or without a deal.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

These are charged by online services used by financial advisers\u0026nbspto build and manage customers’ portfolios. In 2017, £311bn of investments was managed on adviser platforms.\u0026nbspAdviser platforms charge on average around 0.3 per cent of the latest value of investments annually –\u0026nbspa cost that is usually passed on straight to savers and pension holders. AFH Wealth Management, which commissioned the research, provides an example: on a pot of £50,000, invested over 25 years and growing 5 per cent a year, the investor will fork out a hefty £12,500 in platform fees alone, in addition to payments for financial advice.The 41 per cent of oblivious investors is made up of 27 per cent who know about the fees but are not sure how they affect their investments, and 13 per cent who do not even realise they are paying platform fees.While in some cases investors themselves can be blamed for the lack of awareness, AFH sees the problem elsewhere. “These findings simply highlight the crucial need for greater levels of transparency, engagement and education of investors”, it says in a report on the research.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Andy Murray and Serena Williams talk as they play Bruno Soares and Nicole Melichar during their mixed doubles third round match of the Wimbledon Championships.

And experts say the weaker pound since the EU referendum could have made Britain even more attractive as it is a cheaper place to study.Were the fears of vice-chancellors and academics about the Brexit vote unfounded? It seems too early to say.It is likely that some European applicants will be trying to get into the British system before tuition fees go up and they are no longer entitled to student loans.EU students starting at English universities this year are still eligible for domestic tuition fees, which are £9,250 a year, and student loans. They will also retain these benefits for courses starting in 2020.EU students in England will pay same tuition fees year after BrexitHowever, the fee status and financial support offered to students from Europe could change for the worse in the years after the UK exits the EU, which would make studying in Britain less appealing.European students could be deterred from applying to a UK university if they are made to pay tuition fees of up to £18,000 a year – which international students from outside the EU currently pay.Leaders of universities across the country will breathe a collective sigh of relief at the Ucas data showing that non-UK students still want to study in Britain. But is it just the calm before the storm?\u0026nbspThe Russell Group,\u0026nbspcomprising the most selective universities in the UK, has already seen a drop in the number of EU students enrolling in its institutions. Numbers fell for the first time in five years, figures show.And the situation could get worse with a no-deal Brexit as research funding would be up in the air and greater uncertainty could put off EU students from studying at UK universities.So while the positive trend in the Ucas report is welcome, the full impact of Brexit is yet to be seen.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

These are charged by online services used by financial advisers\u0026nbspto build and manage customers’ portfolios. In 2017, £311bn of investments was managed on adviser platforms.\u0026nbspAdviser platforms charge on average around 0.3 per cent of the latest value of investments annually –\u0026nbspa cost that is usually passed on straight to savers and pension holders. AFH Wealth Management, which commissioned the research, provides an example: on a pot of £50,000, invested over 25 years and growing 5 per cent a year, the investor will fork out a hefty £12,500 in platform fees alone, in addition to payments for financial advice.The 41 per cent of oblivious investors is made up of 27 per cent who know about the fees but are not sure how they affect their investments, and 13 per cent who do not even realise they are paying platform fees.While in some cases investors themselves can be blamed for the lack of awareness, AFH sees the problem elsewhere. “These findings simply highlight the crucial need for greater levels of transparency, engagement and education of investors”, it says in a report on the research.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Andy Murray and Serena Williams talk as they play Bruno Soares and Nicole Melichar during their mixed doubles third round match of the Wimbledon Championships.

However, there were several migrations before this that left no DNA trace on the modern population.\u0026nbspThe population of modern humans living in southern Greece 210,000 years ago were probably replaced by Neanderthals - as shown by the younger skull found in the cave.\u0026nbspInitially, scientists assumed that because the skulls were found close together they would date to the same period.Created with Sketch.Representations of skulls in art Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Hirst unveiled this striking artwork in June 2007 at the White Cube Gallery in London. \u0027For The Love Of God\u0027 is a £50m diamond-encrusted human skull.

The early modern humans in Greece were replaced by Neanderthals. It was not one exodus out of Africa but lots of small ones.”Scientists rethink human evolution after discovery of ancient tools ‘Neanderthal-like’ teeth reveal early human evolution in EuropeEarly human evolution was ‘multi-ethnic and multicultural’The research, published in the journal\u0026nbspNature, supports the hypothesis that early modern humans spread out of Africa, where they evolved multiple times.This group was probably wiped out by environmental factors – which could have included climatic events and pressure from Neanderthals.Reconstructions of the Apidima 1 cranium revealed a high and rounded shape – a unique feature of modern humans which contrasts sharply with Neanderthals.Researchers conducted numerous comparisons with different human fossils, using\u0026nbspa highly accurate radiometric dating method to determine their age. They also used virtual reconstructions of the damaged parts of the skulls to discover more about the origins of the fossils.\u0026nbspThis discovery is the latest piece in the jigsaw of human evolution which is continually changing in light of new research.Out of Africa\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Data are weighted. Changes are since 4-7 June.

We have to love more, hate less. We have to listen more, and talk less. We have to know that this is everybody’s responsibility\u0027. Clark Mindock reports from the Canyon of Heroes in ManhattanClick to followThe Independent USWith confetti and ticker tape landing on the shoulders of champions and their fans along the Canyon of Heroes in downtown Manhattan, Emma Morrone saw something bigger than the elite players returning to the United States after their World Cup win in France.In the floats that carried the likes of Megan Rapinoe, Alex Morgan, and Julie Ertz,\u0026nbspalongside the rest of the world championship squad,\u0026nbspthe 17-year-old football player –\u0026nbspor “soccer player” as she, and those around her, would call it here in the US –\u0026nbspsaid she saw role models, not just passing stars.And, the New Jersey high school senior said that she hopes she sees the future in those women who have inspired a nation with their athleticism, and spurred a conversation about equity and rights in America and abroad.“We look up to them, and how they play, and take from their game, learn from their moves,” Ms Morrone said, referring to herself and her two teammates who had made the trek from New Jersey on Wednesday morning, 17-year-old Caitlin Scully and 18-year-old Alex Pardo.That is, they are learning moves from them both on and off the pitch. They see what the US Women’s National Team has done to promote pay equality, an issue that persists for the women in spite of their clear strengths compared to the US men’s team. They see how the players have spoken about and promoted a general sense that one must stand up to bigotry, in general.They want to learn those moves, too.“I think they’re really amazing,” Ms Pardo added. “They make me want to be a better player, and make me want to become involved. When your role model speaks up, it makes you want to speak up.”It wouldn’t be long until Rapinoe herself spoke up once again, hoping to inspire fans like those three teens. On the steps of New York’s City Hall, the co-captain of the world champion team extolled fans to lead in their own lives, and to take on the challenges of making the world a better place.“We have to be better. We have to love more, hate less. We have to listen more, and talk less. We have to know that this is everybody’s responsibility,” Rapinoe said with circular sunglasses reminiscent of John Lennon, and purple hair.She continued, saying that their supporters are more than just fans of a sport who “tune in every four years”.“You interact with your community every single day,” she said. “How do you make your community better?”Rapinoe: US women’s captain sends powerful message to Trump over LGBT+ rightsRapinoe saying ‘I deserve this’ while holding a trophy and a bottle of champagne is a serious moodWith their 2-0 victory over the Netherlands last week, and the run of wins leading up to that world cup victory, the US women’s team has catapulted themselves into the forefront of a national conversation, and the players have proven eager to embrace their platformThey’re currently engaged in that fight for pay equity, with a class action lawsuit including all of the players suing the US Soccer Federation, saying they get paid less than the men’s national team and receive less support, even though they consistently outperform those same men.The proof of that is pretty clear: This year’s World Cup win is the second straight for the American women, while the men’s team didn’t even make it into the same tournament last year. That’s not even accounting for the hard dollars, with women’s games bringing in $50.8m in game revenue between 2016 and 2018, compared to $49.9m for men during that period. The pay structure is complicated, but the women have argued in their lawsuit that there are a range of inequities, including the argument that if they played 20 “friendlies” (where bonuses would not apply), they would earn a maximum of $99,000 while men max out at $263,320 for the same play.That fight, and their representation of the US in France, has brought them some enemies and friends in high places. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris –\u0026nbsptwo presidential candidates, whose merchandise could be seen repped by fans along the parade route on Wednesday – have both praised them. Donald Trump has gotten into fights with them on Twitter.Rapinoe says US Women’s team accept Chuck Schumer’s invite to congress but ‘don’t want to go to the White House’Elizabeth Redwine was among the mothers to line up to catch a glimpse of the champions, and had brought her 11-year-old daughter Lila, and her two friends Ella and Emily.Ms Redwine had picked up a piece of paper from the trash on her way in, and used her lipstick to write a message of solidarity: Equal pay for superior work, her sign read.“I want them to one day be paid as much as their brothers,” she said of the three girls she had brought to see the historic occasion, all three of them athletes.Maggie Gannon, a 24-year-old teacher who moved to New York City from Ohio from Wisconsin on Tuesday, said she chose to start her first full day in the city at the parade because the team is “bringing a voice for young girls and the marginalised”.She said that the chants of “equal pay” that were heard both in Manhattan on Wednesday and in France last week have resonated throughout the country.“We were sitting in a Buffalo Wild Wings in Ohio, chanting with them,” Ms Gannon said, recalling watching the World Cup final.Joanne Shea, a 33-year-old actor, had come with her 18-month-old daughter Maeve, and said that the US women’s team had restored a sense of national pride at a time when she said there are slim pickings.“There’s not been a whole heck of a lot to celebrate lately when it comes to national pride,” Ms Shea said.But, noting that there have been some positive signs in the past few years. In the 2018 midterms, for instance, more women ran for and were elected into Congress than ever before. And, now, the country is taking cues from, and talking about, and obsessing over the women’s World Cup champions that have become the standard bearers of a host of equality issues.“This team has really been a symbol of that,” Ms Shea said. “I think since 2016, women have really been leading the fight.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Show all 5Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The last time radiation was measured was in 2008, when a Russian scientists said they had detected a small radioactive leak.“The results are preliminary. We will examine the samples thoroughly when we get home,” Hilde Elise Heldal of the Norwegian Institute of Marine Research told Norway’s\u0026nbspTV2 broadcaster.She said despite the readings, the radiation levels do not threaten fishing or the scientific teams working in the area.While operating the remote sub, the scientists witnessed an “occasional cloud” rising from the ventilation pipe. The team believes the pipe may have direct contact with the vessel’s radioactive cargo.“We have observed a kind of cloud coming out of this hole once in a while. In connection with the test in which we measured pollution, a cloud came out of the hole. This may indicate that the pollution comes out in pulses,” Dr Heldal said.The team suggested the ventilation hole at the top of the submarine tower was in direct contact with the reactor inside the wreck.\u0026nbspIs the US accepting the world must live with a nuclear North Korea?Pentagon publishes ‘disturbing’ new nuclear weapons doctrineAccording to TV2, researchers will now monitor the opening of the pipe more closely for the rest of the research period, which is scheduled to finish on Thursday.Dr Heldal said the cloud could be caused by ocean currents, tides or other conditions related to ocean movements.\u0026nbspThe fire on 7 April 1989 began due to a short circuit in the ship’s engine room. The vessel was able to surface for around five\u0026nbsphours. A total of 42 of 69 crew members were killed, mostly of hypothermia while awaiting rescue from the freezing waters.\u0026nbspJust four people were killed from the initial fire and smoke.The new research was undertaken by the Go Sars research vessel, using a new type of remote submersible craft which gives more accurate readings than previous surveys.“We are getting closer to the wreck than ever before, and get an even better sampling,” Dr Heldal said.Ahead of the latest mission to test the submarine, Ingar Amundsen, the director of Norway’s Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Directorate said: “The new surveys that Norway and Russia are about to launch are important for understanding the pollution risk posed by Komsomolets.”The news of Komsomolets’ radioactive leak comes days after the Russian government confirmed a fire had broken out on a top secret nuclear-powered submarine killing 14 sailors, in an incident which also occurred in the Barents Sea.Argentinian submarine found a year after going missingA high-ranking military official reportedly said the sailors who fought the blaze and died had averted a “planetary catastrophe”.The incident remains shrouded in mystery after the Russian government refused to reveal the submarine’s name and its mission, claiming them as state secrets.However, the Kremlin has said the accident was sparked by a fire in the battery compartment of the submarine.Defence minister Sergei Shoigu said earlier this week that the onboard nuclear reactor was “operational” after the crew had taken “necessary measures” to protect it.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Iranian boats in the Gulf have for years harassed US and other ships moving out of the waterway, drawing too close\u0026nbspin what American officials often dismissed as annoyances.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhy do you commit such acts? he said. You should instead allow navigation to be safe.On Thursday, Mr\u0026nbspZarif\u0026nbsprejected the claims that Iran had sought to seize the ship. They make such claims to create tension, yet these claims are worthless and they have made many such claims,” he told reporters, according to the semi-official\u0026nbspISNA\u0026nbspnews agency. They say such things to cover up their own weaknesses.Russia, which has increasingly asserted itself in the Middle East as a broker and spoiler, called for restraint and unconditional freedom of navigation following the incident, but refused to endorse either the UK or Iranian version of events. President Vladimir Putin\u0027s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency the Kremlin had registered the information that such an incident has allegedly taken place, and we have also registered the statement by Iranian representatives that this information does not correspond\u0026nbspto reality.Asked whether the UK planned to step up its military presence in the region to enhance protection to shipping, a Downing Street spokesman said: We have a long-standing maritime presence in the Gulf. We are continuously monitoring the security situation there and are committed to maintaining freedom of navigation in accordance with international law.\u0026nbspPressed on whether the UK saw Wednesday\u0027s incident as a response to the seizure of\u0026nbspGrace I, the spokesman said: I\u0027m not going to speculate on Iran\u0027s motivations. Our position from last week stands. We\u0027ve been very clear that\u0026nbspGrace I\u0026nbspis a Syria sanctions issue, rather than an Iran issue.Media reports suggested that British-flagged ships in the Strait of Hormuz\u0026nbsphad now been put on “heightened security” following new guidance from the Department for Transport.A spokesperson from the department told The Independent that they were unable to comment on the reports.The alleged confrontation in the Gulf took place as the US reportedly demanded at a closed-door meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)\u0026nbspin Vienna that world take action against Iran for breaching its commitments under the nuclear deal, even as Washington itself had withdrawn from the agreement at the behest of Beltway Iran hawks, Israel, and Gulf Arab monarchs.\u0026nbspAccording to statements by\u0026nbspIranian and Russian officials, US officials failed to gain traction at the IAEA as much of the world remains committed to upholding it despite relatively minor breaches by Iran that Tehran describes as responses for the failure to remove impediments to trade with the Islamic Republic.\u0026nbspUS terminates support for anti-Iran project that ‘smeared US citizens’Iran nuclear deal at threat over UK seizure of oil tanker in GibraltarBP tanker ‘shelters off Saudi Arabia amid fears Iran could seize it’Iran announces new breach of 2015 nuclear dealIran will increase uranium enrichment to ‘any amount we want’Tehran has offered to return to the agreement, but the US president has rejected the deal, arguing it was too generous to Iran and did not address its involvement in regional conflicts.In May, the US dispatched an aircraft carrier, bombers and fighter jets to the Gulf in response to alleged Iranian threats.The US has also accused Iran of being involved in the bombing of oil tankers in the Gulf and said it shot down an American drone in international airspace.Iran has denied any involvement in the attacks on the tankers and said the drone had veered into its airspace.Strait of Hormuz\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But too often, especially as the memory of wars in Afghanistan and Iraq fades, they have been shunted down the policy pecking order.Previous Governments have, to their credit, taken steps in the right direction. But their activities have often been piecemeal or lacking in an overall direction.Giving the money from interest rate-rigging fines to armed forces charities is a good example.A promise of nearly £bn, but a promise that hasn’t been delivered as fully as it should have been, with Ministers even dipping into the pot to cover shortfalls in their own budgets.We need a sea change — and that’s why we’ve partnered with Help for Heroes and Combat Stress to demand a Cabinet Minister takes the reins on this vital issue under a Johnson or Hunt Government.And that Minister mustn’t just be there to turn up for photo ops at far-flung bases. They must drive through a firmer commitment to the Military Covenant and, vitally, work with the Attorney General to end the persecution of veterans from former conflicts.Everybody who has served has put their le on the line for us — and their families have sacriced plenty, too.Time to deliver.EVERY time you think they can’t sink any lower, Labour’s leadership finds a way.This once great party is now run by a rabble of apologists for anti-Semitism, Marxists and bullies.They think nothing of spending their members’ cash on expensive law firms in an attempt to throttle the free press.And when it comes to policy, their combination of two-faced doublespeak on Brexit and a cripplingly expensive nationalisation programme would send the UK economy into a nosee it might never recover from.Yet still there are decent MPs on those Labour backbenches who think the tide will turn, that evenCorbyn was to enter Downing Street he could somehow be managed. Codswallop.It’s put up or shut up time for them.BOTH Tory candidates to be next PM have promised to deliver Brexit, deal or no deal.It’s the only hope the party has of remaining relevant.So when they take office, they have a mandate to deliver their promises in the leadership contest.

But I had no idea how sneeringly “modern feudal” the whole circus was about to become.What a dismal little VIP gathering Archie’s christening has turned out to be. A PR disaster.Harry and Meghan insisted on conducting the whole thing in secret, refusing even to reveal who his godparents were.I don’t even care who they are —they are Robbie Williams or that plastic Canadian friend of Meghan’s who looks like a Love Island reject, I’d rather not know.But why make such a snitty point of it unless he’s trolling the very people who admire him It seems so unjoyful — the opposite of what a christening is meant to be.I know what his arguments are. He wants a “normal” le for Archie. He hates the Press and the paparazzi.But the truth is the royals get a huge amount of privacy. They have far more privacy than the average citizen.They are not snapped while picking their noses at a newsagent. They are not filmed going on holiday. No one knows where they go on holiday or even where they are when they are not performing their duties.No one sells stories on their private lives or punts pictures. No one takes pictures or follows them at all, because no newspaper would carry the images.Eventhey are spotted by someone, they have huge security teams, paid for by us, to keep us at bay.The royals do not want privacy, they want a private le in public, and no one has the right to that.In spite of this, Harry appears to have gone what I would describe as the full Hugh Grant. Last week it turned out that the actor has become so obsessed with the idea that the paps were following him he confronted an Italian official who was innocently filming rubbish dumped in the street.Everywhere Harry looks, he sees people who want to take advantage of him, which is not true and leads to this sad irascibility in which he forgets what is kind and decent —  and who is paying the bill.What has become of him  If you scan Meghan and Harry’s Instagram feed, you will see how distant the “people’s prince” has turned out. There is no shortage of cloying information on how much he “cares” about alpacas and Mothering Sunday and advancing his sanctimonious “monthly social awareness approach” on mental health or climate change. But it is extra-ordinary how detached from reality the whole thing feels — it is a syrupy, fantasist’s medley of posturing sub-Beyoncean baloney about animals in “gap yah” locations.But does he really care about any of this stuff It is almost ashe has picked a selection of vague, non-committal subjects specically engineered to give no idea what he is thinking, like Leonardo DiCaprio.The overall effect is truly insincere.While it is clear Harry loves the royal tradition of virtue-signalling, it is obvious he does not enjoy being a royal at all. In fact, he dislikes being royal so much, he has waved through this shell of a person called “Prince Harry” operated by an American marketing droid who writes about “sharing” Harry’s “environmental POV”.There are half a million likes for a snap of the prince looking bored.Meghan has similarly vanished.If she had her way, it would not even be a christening, but a naming ceremony with fire pit curators and celebrity mixologists and D-list actresses as earth parents .She is so embarrassing I wonderedit was the godparents who had actually begged for privacy — you can just imagine Beyonce weighing up whether a second-tier royal christening was cool enough for her to openly acknowledge it.And so we have it: A royal christening in a building we paid for, conducted by a bishop whose salary we help foot, featuring royals whose lives we bankroll, in clothes we have paid for, sitting on seats we bought, waited on by staff we fund, with celebs who are not even sure they want to put their name to it.And they think they can say, “Oh, we’re not telling you anything about it” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

After months of dithering, he has finally come out for Remain.From now on, Labour is to be an unashamedly pro-EU movement, dedicated to overturning the  referendum result. Once the voice of the oppressed working class, Labour is now to be the mouthpiece of the Europhile political class.Yesterday, having succumbed to relentless pressure from his anti-Brexit MPs, Corbyn announced that Labour will campaign to stay in the European Union and vote against any deal negotiated by the next Conservative Prime Minister.It is a historic decision, one that graphically shows how Labour has lost both its political compass and its moral authority.The move represents a profound betrayal in every sense — of true democracy, of Labour’s traditions, of its heartland voters and of the cause of national freedom. Corbyn has also savagely betrayed his own values, for he has always been a Eurosceptic who regarded the EU as a barrier to national rights.Now he has emerged as just another identikit member of the chattering, snobbish metropolitan elite, which holds sovereignty and patriotism in contempt.Recently there were reports that when Corbyn was considering a change of stance, his tough Chief of Staff Karie Murphy shouted at him: “We’re not doing that. We’re not selling out our class.” But that is exactly what Corbyn has done.In the process, he has torn up Labour’s democratic credentials and made a mockery of the party’s manesto commitment in the  General Election to “respect the referendum result”.Now Corbyn has shown those words were empty. Labour can no longer pretend it has any belief in the ballot box or any faith in voters.The party was created in  to represent working people in their struggle against the political establishment. Central to the party was a belief in national, democratic sovereignty and a profound hostility to imperialism.That helps to explain why, for decades, Labour was so suspicious of the project for European integration. Clement Attlee refused to have anything to do with the European Coal and Steel Community, the forerunner of the Brussels empire, while his successor Hugh Gaitskell warned that Common Market membership would mean: “The end of , years of history.” In , under Michael Foot, the party openly campaigned for withdrawal from the European Community.But all that soon changed. Under Neil Kinnock, the party — regularly beaten in general elections — began to see Brussels as a vehicle for the introduction of socialism into Britain without the need for support from voters. Labour’s rampant European enthusiasm was born, and quickly entrenched by Tony Blair.It was a development that dismayed me.Through much of the s and s I was a Labour activist in Jeremy Corbyn’s Islington North constituency and I shared his views on Brussels.Indeed, his Euro-scepticism was the only thing I admired about him. But I could not stomach Blair’s servile devotion to Brussels. Disillusioned, I left Labour in .Now Labour’s capture by the pro-EU ideologues is complete. “Labour’s hearts are Remain and our values are Remain,” declared the Deputy Leader Tom Watson recently. The party that once campaigned against imperialism now wants us to be subsumed in the EU’s federalist empire.This shameful step has been dressed up as a political necessity because Labour is haemorrhaging political support, down to just  per cent in one recent opinion poll. But Labour is in decline not because of its stance on Europe, but because of the uselessness and extremism of Corbyn’s neo-Marxist leadership.In fact, by alienating Labour’s voters in the predominantly pro-Leave heartlands of the North and the Midlands, Corbyn’s decision is likely to backfire disastrously.It is estimated that more than four million people who backed Brexit in the  referendum voted Labour in the  General Election. Just as importantly, around  per cent of all Labour constituencies had majorities for Leave in the referendum. In fact, many of the most fervent pro-Brexit seats in  are Labour-held — places such as Ruth Smeeth’s Stoke-on-Trent North, Gloria De Piero’s Ashfield in Nottingham and Melanie Onn’s Great Grimsby, all where virtually  per cent supported Leave.All these seats, and scores of others with slim Labour majorities, will be at risk due to Corbyn’s new policy. Nor will there be any chance of Labour winning any pro-Leave Tory marginals, which are necessary for a Commons majority.The dangers were highlighted in May’s European elections, where Nigel Farage’s Brexit party beat Labour in a string of traditional heartland seats including Hartlepool, Redcar and Bolsover.As the Labour Brexit campaigner Brendan Chilton put it recently: “A pro-Remain policy would be an electoral disaster for the Labour Party on an unprecedented scale. If this were to happen, Labour may never recover.”Well, it has happened. But the sense of betrayal goes far deeper than electoral calculations. This week Labour has dramatically shown where its priorities lie — not with the traditional working class, but with the sneering elitists of the affluent, pro-EU middle class.Tragically, this once proud movement has become a pale imitation of the Liberal Democrats in all their EU worship and disdain for national pride. Instead of embracing its industrial communities, Labour has retreated into its metropolitan enclaves.And this twist has thrown up a bizarre reversal of roles — Corbyn, the eternal rebel, is now the pathetic stooge of the pro-EU establishment, while Boris Johnson, the likely Tory victor, is the real warrior for British justice and liberty. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So why all the cloak-and-dagger secrecy surrounding the godparents to Meghan and Harry’s son Prince Archie He’s seventh in line to the throne and, quite frankly,the majority of us had been standing next to the font, we’d probably struggle to name rumoured godparent Charlie van Straubenzee the following day.I have just typed it and I’ve forgotten it already. So why risk losing the already fragile goodwill of the public by treating them asthey’re tiresome selfie-hunters  It’s like those celebrities who put a “no photos” hand up when you haven’t even got your camera out.Or the ones who tell journalists the most anodyne fact about themselves, then add: “But don’t quote me on that.” As .It reminds me of the time when I found myself as a “plus one” at the wedding of a Z-list celebrity who had flogged his nuptials to Hello! magazine.Post-ceremony, the guests were left hanging around as the happy couple did their contracted, painfully proooootracted photoshoot, so I sauntered off to the shade of the nearest tree to make a phone call. Within seconds, the groom appeared at my side and hissed: “If you’re filing copy on this, I will have you removed.”I was simply calling home to say goodnight to my five-year-old. Harry and Meghan’s disproportionate defensiveness over their son’s christening smacks of a similar celebrity narcissism.The reality, one fears, is that this whole “privacy please” charade is yet another example where the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are blurring the lines between “royal” and “celebrity”. Being the latter means you pay for everything yourself.But being royal means you have -hour police protection funded by us, transport and living expenses funded by us, a £.million refurbishment of your house funded by us and your child is deemed important enough to be baptised by the Archbishop of Canterbury.And inyou perform the occasional public duty and follow the royal traditions that have sustained the Monarchy for hundreds of years.One of those traditions being the inclusion of godparent names in the royal register. So omitting them from the official court circularis bordering on the non-constitutional.And when the tourist magnet of tradition, pomp and ceremony is pretty much all the Royal Family has left as a bargaining chip with the already hard-pressed taxpayers who fund them, that’s a bold, some might say reckless, move.A recent poll asked, “do the Sussexes have the right to keep godparents’ names secret”, and  per cent said “yes”,  per cent “no”, and  per cent “don’t know”.Don’t know, or don’t care  And therein lies the rub. The impeccably dutul Queen is hugely respected but, after she dies, what then The public may well feel that Harry, Meghan et al can have all the privacy they desire.

And the direct but illicit involvement of Magic Grandpa himself in what were meant to be independent investigations.Even before that came out, three peers resigned from the party because of the vast numbers of Jew-haters in Labour.One of those to quit is Lord Triesman, a top bloke. He was once a very capable boss of the Football Association. He resigned saying Labour was “instit- utionally anti-Semitic”.And he added that “the experience of le in the party has become sickening”.Even Corbyn’s closest allies among Labour MPs have had enough of him. Diane Abbott, for example. And the Shadow Chancellor, the sinister John McDonnell.Other Labour MPs are sick of being bullied by the convocation of weird Maoists, Trots and Leninists who surround Corbyn. People such as Seumas Milne and Andrew Murray .All of this has helped Labour sink to an astonishing all-time low of  per cent in the polls — at a time when we’ve had the worst Conservative Government in memory. Or at least since John Major was in charge.And now the party has finally turned its back on the people it was set up to support, the working class.It has decided to back the idea of a second referendum on Brexit, junking its previous decision to “respect the vote”.Hundreds of thousands of Labour voters in the North of England will be lost to the party as a consequence, possibly for ever.So the knives are out for Grandpa and I don’t see him lasting much longer. It is now a case of WHEN he goes, not IF he goes. But even when he goes, what can a new leader do with this rabble Don’t forget, the party is controlled entirely by the activists. And those are the , middle-class, liberal lefties and perpetual adolescents who joined the party en masse for three quid to ensure Corbyn was elected leader.They have nothing in common with Labour’s old voter base, the working class. They are opposed to Brexit. They are in favour of Hamas, Venezuela and Cuba. They support identity politics, with its endless hierarchy of victimhood groups.So the likelihood, then, is that a new leader will also come from the juvenile far Left.There are some great Labour MPs who would make excellent leaders of the party — Caroline Flint, for example, or Jon Cruddas. But do they stand a chance any more, seeing how the party is It’s more likely we’ll end up with John McDonnell, an unrepentant Marxist who thought IRA bombers should be given honours by the British government.

Sir Kim Darroch, our ambassador to the US.Caught out when leaked messages revealed he thinks Donald Trump is “inept” and the White House dysal.He had to go, evenhe has become a darling of the liberal establishment here for hating Trump.Here’s a suggestion. How about we get as his replacement someone who understands Trump and Trump’s appeal to US voters DO you really think Boris Johnson is going to get us out of the European Union  Properly, I mean, much as we voted for If so, pass the hallucinogens. I could do with getting out of my head too.My guess is we will leave in part, with a deal slightly weaker than the dog’s breakfast Theresa May put before us. And don’t be too surprised by a general election pretty soon. That will cheer us all up.Never have so many people been let down by their leaders. You can read about how Brexit was betrayed in my new book, The Great Betrayal, out next week.It’s a sorry story and it should make you angry. Mind you, it’s also quite funny,you have a warped sense of humour.THIS is Geronimo the alpaca. Take a good look at him because he’s not going to be around much longer.The Government has decided he must be slaughtered because, according to a possibly flawed report, he carries a strain of bovine tuberculosis. His owner, Helen Macdonald, is utterly distraught.The killing of Geronimo, and the wholesale slaughter of our badgers, has been forced on the Government by the farmers. They have way too much power.They create sterile landscapes on vast subsidies.It’s time for all this to stop. For our sake, as well as Geronimo’s.HAVE we ever had a member of the Royal Family who was smugger, more full of herself, more truly bloody irritating, than Meghan OK, King John was a bit of a t***er . . . but things were dferent in the th century. And more recently there’s been Fergie, I suppose.She had a few airs and graces and, like her ex-husband Andrew, was a bit of a . But at least she wasn’t a hypocrite.Meghan is insufferably woke – forever bleating about social-justice “ishoos” but happy to swan around in a private jet and have us pay millions for her cottage in Windsor.Now she’s decided she doesn’t like people taking pics of her when she’s on another freebie to Wimbledon.Get real, love, before you alienate the entire British public . . . instead of just chippy little monkeys like me.Or: “We had fizzy pop delivered.”More pertinently, “I have six teeth left,” or: “I remember hating Leeds United even before Don Revie arrived.”But that’s ten words and thus inadmissible.I SEE that Nicki Minaj has cancelled her concert in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.Everyone told her it’s a foul country where they don’t treat women especially well.But she seemed determined to push on.My worry is thatNicki dressed on stage the way she usually dresses on stage, she’d be on permanent display in Saudi, with her head on top of a pole. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But nine out of ten of Britain’s .million veterans don’t know about it.So The Sun has teamed up with the Ministry of Defence-backed ­initiative as part of our vital Never Forget Them campaign.We want all veterans to get a better deal when shopping or paying for services — including meals out, travel and even holidays — not just the , who have signed up.And we are calling on more businesses — of any size — to swell the ranks of the , firms offering money off.It comes after The Sun this week demanded our next Prime Minister back our three-part Veterans’ Pledge:Julia Cooper, , landlady of The Don bar, a hub for many veterans, in Stockton-on-Tees, Co Durham, said: “I can’t thank The Sun enough for standing up for former servicemen and women.“Many of the men who come here served in Northern Ireland and they live in fear of being arrested and charged for serving their country.”Key to the Defence Discount Service scheme is the Defence Privilege Card, which veterans can use in stores and at businesses large and small and get up to a third off. Discounts can be found online and via an app.George Rogerson, , who served seven years in the Gloucestershire Regiment, including three tours in Northern Ireland, hailed the scheme as “a recognition of service to the country”.The former Lance Corporal, who was mentioned in dispatches after saving the le of his wounded­ commander under sniper fire in Belfast, has used the discount card since .George, from Chirk, Clwyd, said: “Veterans like me did our bit for your country and I use my card virtually every week and save money. I don’t regard it as charity.When I show my card and get discount, it’s like a recognition of my service to the country and a ‘thank you’. I’ve lost count of the hundreds of pounds I have saved over the years.”Another veteran saved £ on his phone alone from EE. Yet virtually none of the veterans The Sun spoke to yesterday in The Don had heard of the scheme.Among them was Pete Gaines, , of Sedgefield, who served  years with the Royal Artillery. Pete, who has not worked since a heart attack at , vowed: “I am going to sign up and save myself money.”Or visit Google Play or the Apple App Store and download the Defence Discount Service app.The app allows members to search for discounts in their local area as well as browse discounts on the move.It is FREE to join butyou want the Defence Privilege card, which you can carry in your wallet, there is an admin fee of £., which lasts for five years.Tony Walls, , from Thornaby on Tees, was another in The Don keen to join in.An ex Corporal who served  years with the Pioneer Corps, leaving in , he thought the scheme was only for those still serving.He said: “I had heard of this scheme but I didn’t think it was for me. I am certainly going to check it out.”The scheme means veterans and serving Armed Forces can enjoy discounts ranging from ten per cent off to, in some cases,  per cent discount on thousands of everyday items.It is not just giants such as Starbucks, National Express, Jet holidays, Enterprise Rent A Car, Halfords and KFC that take part. Thousands of small businesses are also on the list of , firms — such as bridal shop Willoughby  Wolf, in Marlborough, Wilts.Victoria and Spencer Wolf only opened the shop last September but signed up to the DDS scheme because former Warrant Officer Spencer, , serv­ed  years in the Royal Signals.Victoria, , said: “We benefitted from the scheme with discounts on things like cinema tickets and when we became business owners we wanted to pass that benefit on to other veterans.”Already they have given discounts totalling around £ to serving soldiers or former servicemen and women.Victoria added: “The first thing I ask our brides-to-be is do they have a brother, husband, father or close ­relative who has served or is serving  I point them in the right direction. Spencer spent over  years serving this country. Being able to pass on some benefit is really important to us.”The Sun is urging more companies to sign up. And the message is already getting through.Last night food giant Iceland confirmed it is considering giving discounts to veterans.And Cadbury World in Birmingham said it offers a  per cent discount for the military, who can bring up to six people with them on a booking. They just need a form of military ID or be a member of the Defence Discount Service.We will pass them to the Defence Discount Service so your firm can help those who served and boost your business by gaining loyal new customers.The more companies that get involved the more we can help our ­veterans.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

As he himself said, his job had become “impossible”.But this whole episode has been utterly depressing, and there is plenty of blame to go around.Perhaps Sir Kim was a little loose in his language, but no diplomat could ever expect his confidential notes to senior figures in London to end up on the front of the papers.The tributes since his resignation certainly suggest that this was the first time he’d put a foot even slightly wrong in his entire career.And the President — who is a friend of Britain — should have realised that when it comes to diplomacy, the shoot-from-the-hip style he uses on social media can have consequences.No newspaper complains about a leak, but whoever undermined Sir Kim by releasing his not-quite-diplomatic cables should reflect on the damage it has done to not just our international standing but to the Foreign Office’s ability to do its job.As for the Boris “row”, it’s unedying to see his detractors weaponising this sorry saga against him.Whatever he had said on the TV debate, Sir Kim’s position was already sadly untenable.Moving forward, the Special Relationship must remain special.Our links with America are stronger than one ambassador, from security to our shared culture.But we must never be complacent about the ties to our closest ally.YOU can see why Labour has turned on the journalists behind last night’s Panorama investigation into the party’s dreadful handling of anti-Semitism in its ranks.The programme was damning from start to finish. It details the most extraordinary levels of racism in all corners of the party and a total refusal of the leadership to do anything about it.Indeed the party appears to have actually tried to strangle worthwhile investigations at birth, and to have actively interfered in the disciplinary process.Corbyn’s useful idiots have predictably turned on the whistleblowers – ironic, considering Labour’sShadow Chancellor once handed a petition to No calling for better protection for those brave enough to call their employers out for bad practice.Hypocrites, the lot of them.It may not be the case that Corbyn himself is a racist, but goodness, he does seem to attract an awful lot of them — and be too thick or ignorant to notice they’re there.The party’s rotten, from top to bottom.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Their action was very silly and they will certainly regret it. Our reciprocal action will be announced.Confirming the Montrose standoff yesterday, a Government spokesperson urged Iran to de-escalate the situation in the region. The Government spokesman said: Contrary to international law, three Iranian vessels attempted to impede the passage of a commercial vessel, British Heritage, through the Strait of Hormuz.HMS Montrose was forced to position herself between the Iranian vessels and British Heritage and issue verbal warnings to the Iranian vessels, which then turned away.We are concerned by this action and continue to urge the Iranian authorities to de-escalate the situation in the region.Iran later accused weak Britain of lying about the incident in a bid to inflame tensions in the region.Tehrans foreign minister Mohammad Jawad Zar appeared to deny the Islamic Republics boats were being confrontational.He said: They make a claim to create a tension that these claims are not worthwhile, and raised many claims.Mr Zar also said England was attempting to cover their weaknesswhile blasting America for engaging in economic terrorism referring to the sanctions imposed on Tehran by Washington.Initial reports from the US said that five Iranian vessels had harassed the tanker.Responding to the reports, US Central Command spokesman Cpt Bill Urban said: Threats to international freedom of navigation require an international solution.The world economy depends on the free flow of commerce, and it is incumbent on all nations to protect and preserve this linchpin of global prosperity.UK defence officials have previously confirmed that the Montrose had been deployed to the region to perform a maritime security role.A spokesman for Theresa May said the Prime Minister is concerned about the incident in the Gulf and called for a deescalation.The British Heritage ship - operated by BP - earlier made an “abrupt” u-turn and ed to the safety of Saudi Arabia’s coastline on Sunday.It had been heading to Iraq’s Basrah terminal when satellite trackers showed it changing course.Tensions continue to rise between Iran and the West after the Islamic Republic last week announced it was upping its uranium enrichment programme.Tehran plans to increase its production beyond the limits imposed by the  Iran Nuclear Deal - which the US walked away from earlier this year.US President Donald Trump said the deal had been too soft - but it was still supported by other western backers including the UK.Following Irans announcement, Trump vowed on Wednesday that sanctions on Iran would soon be increased, substantially!Last month, President Trump called off a planned airstrike on Iranian military targets at the last minute in retaliation for the shooting down of an unmanned US drone.Iran had earlier been blamed for a series of devastating sea mine attacks on US-linked oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz."},{"url":null,"title":"four bed house incredible secret bar inside","story":"The £k property in trendy Hackney comes with a private garden and a bespoke fitted kitchen -

So when it came to applying for disability benefit, they struggled in a world of websites and online forms. That was when Nick Leaman came to the rescue. The advisor with Bristol-based financial education charity Talking Money came to their house, and took care of everything. “Nick is a hero to us,” says Emlyn, . “He comes over and immediately puts you at ease. He knows exactly what to say and is so knowledgeable. “I am from the old school, and to understand something I need it in my hand. I don’t even know how to switch a computer on. But everything is online these days. I can’t even print out a form.  We are just relieved that Nick came over and explained everything to us and help us out.” Nick’s help was invaluable for the couple, who are both disabled and struggle to get out, and were falling behind on their rent. Nick’s work with Talking Money involves helping people who find themselves victims of fraud or who may be struggling with debts and don’t know where to turn. And the financially qualied advisor helps people access the benefits they are entitled to, with free specialist advice and ongoing support when they need it most. Over the last year the charity has received more than , enquiries and helped more than , people with advice and casework.They have also secured £.m for vulnerable low-income households by identying and applying for additional benefits they’re entitled to, including appealing negative decisions around housing benefit, sickness and disability benefits and Universal Credit .The majority of Nick’s work is through face to face consultations in Bristol and the surrounding area.  And he says many of his older clients struggle with the internet. “Older people are missing out because they can’t navigate online. I do feel compassion for them. They suffer from a lack of knowledge and access to information. Many of the best deals are online too so they miss out in that way too.” But the majority of people Nick helps are of working age. “It used to be the case that they had racked up huge credit card debts. But it has changed. The issues are now that they are struggling to pay rent and utility bills because they just don’t have the funds. Often they are in work, but they don’t get given enough hours or just not being paid enough. Or it might be the case they are facing financial crises because of unexpected le changes, such as relationship break-up, redundancy and bereavement. “It is also scary how much fraud is out there and how many people get scammed. Fraudsters are getting increasingly confident and can be so convincing. I had one lady who received a text saying she owed thousands to HMRC. It was a con, but she almost fell for it and was going to pay even though she was barely able to afford her rent. The problem is thatyou are desperate you are more likely to fall for scams like this because you just don’t think sensibly.” Despite the enormous demand on him, Nick loves his work. “It can be stressful but it is also really fulfilling because you are here to help people.  Evenyou can improve their lives just a little, that can make a huge dference to them. For others it can be le-changing.” For more Stories of Local Pride, click here "},{"url":null,"title":"only john major can save","story":"NewsopinionOnly John Major can save the Tories now.

You will not have heard anyone say: Jeremy Hunt  Brilliant! No-one has made the effort to describe what a great bloke Boris Johnson appears to be. And nobody, but nobody, has rhapsodised about what a great idea Brexit is for ages. While they spin, bluster and refuse to tell us what they wonapost do, itaposs the subjects theyaposre dancing around we all ought to be paying attention to. Subject : Sovereignty of Parliament The Brexit twats said we had to Brexit so Parliament had more power over our laws. Before we have even Brexited, they have decided Parliament has too much power, and should therefore be shut down so laws can be enacted without it. Subject : Control of our borders We were told we must Brexit to to control the flow of trade and people across our borders. The Brexit twats are now furiously denying there will be any controls at all on the one border we share with the EU. Subject : Letaposs spend £m on the NHS insteadThis works out to £.bn a year, but because the number is entirely wrong itaposs actually £.bn. Either way, the NHS funding gap is about £bn a year and growing.Youaposll note they didnapost say the EU costs us each p a day, letaposs spend it on the NHS instead. Subject : Brave new trade deals Secondhand bassoons, jumpers from the Faroe Isles, and selling the NHS to Donald Trump. Let us say no more about it. Subject : The will of the people This one is still occasionally mentioned, although in increasingly-quieter voices. Because the will of the people has, for the best part of two years, been solidly Remain. Leave constituencies have voted in Remain campaigners, there were more Remain than Leave MEPs elected last month, and everyone whoaposs not a blind, bonkers Tory can see Brexit has gone the way of the Norwegian blue. Today, what theyaposre not telling you is that John Major was once considered the most pathetic, grey, boring, rudderless, bastard-beset, pea maniac Prime Minister weaposve ever had. And he is now the Tory Partyaposs best hope.While Vanilla bitchslaps Marmite on the TV hustings, a man once ridiculed by the entire nation for being a middle-aged Clark Kent without the superpowers has snapped his power pants back on and declared heaposll wrestle either one of them to their political death.Stop staring at our potential PMs for a moment, asking yourselves how it is possible these two unappetisers are the best the natural party of government can offer. Marvel instead that the voice of sanity now looks and sounds a lot like an aged Mr Bean. Sir Johnaposs reputation has changed since he left Downing Street. We have since been exposed to claims that he shared bathwater, among other things, with Edwina Currie.Once upon a time that was one of the more shocking political sex scandals. It was news that made people stop eating their dinner with their fork halfway to the mouth, their eyes widening as they said: Wha  But those were more innocent times.  Major was the last Tory PM to defeat the anti-European wingnuts in his own party. In  he signed the Maastricht Treaty, the deal which helped to form the modern European Union.The fact he won that fight is the reason a more youthful Nigel Farage left the Conservative Party. It is why, a year later, UKIP was founded by an economist. And a little after that, a faction led by Farage ousted that leader on the grounds he was too intellectual.To be fair, then, this is very much Majoraposs fight. If you criticise David Cameron for running away, mild-mannered Major should be praised at least for coming back.It must be coincidence that Mad Cow Disease is coming too.   We all know proroguing Parliament, and making laws only a minority want, is undemocratic. But by threatening a judicial review, Major has exposed the fact itaposs un-Tory, too.No patriot should seek to destroy civil institutions that work just fine. No democrat should hold the people to an opinion they no longer hold. And no Tory should f*** business. Prostitutes, pigs, secretaries - these are all, sadly, expected. Perhaps even Edwina, in extremis. But Brexit means destroying Parliamentary sovereignty, promising a total lack of border control, ignoring the will of the people and wasting billions of pounds on schemes we currently enjoy with % cashback.   Boris Johnson will tell you to be optimistic about all of that. Jeremy Hunt says it must happen. Both of them are wrong. Because John Major, for all his flaws, are all the things they are not.He is a former Prime Minister. He is an election-winner. He defenestrated Margaret Thatcher. He saw off the Eurosceptics. He survived not only ridicule but the worldaposs worst Currie.And he s bearing the Brexit kryptonite - facts, democracy, the rule of law, and good old British sovereignty which says we are ruled by the Parliament, the courts, and the governments we choose. Not emotion, wish-fulfilment, or a government imposed upon us by the insane. But Supeaman is not alone. There are millions of us, from all parties, classes, and walks of le.

Donna Bettiss, , was devastated after James Routledge, , suddenly ended things last month after a seven-year relationship . Sheaposs now listed her £, Sophia Tolli aposMonteapos sleeveless tulle and sequin gown on Facebook for £ as it remains a constant reminder of what had happened.Their pal Paige Hannington, , had offered wedding advice over cocktails after she tied the knot some months before. But during a work trip recently, James and Paige drunkenly confessed they both werenapost happy in their relationships. James called off his wedding and began dating Paige weeks later.    Donna, from Horsham, West Sussex, said: I really liked Paige, she helped me so much [with the wedding] so I feel completely betrayed. I was distraught that someone I knew and trusted and was discussing such an important time in my le with, could do that to me. However the way I feel now is very paranoid to discuss how amazing my relationship is with any other woman. She totally destroyed my confidence. When James decided she was who he wanted there was nothing I could do but let him go. I didnapost cause them any problems or try to stop them progressing. I even saw them on a night out but I just left them to it. I wasnapost going to make their night out with their friends awkward so I kept my distance and kept my friends away from saying anything to them.  The day I let James go was the day I realised he no longer loved me and I couldnapost force someone to love me or stay with me, that would be selfish. “The dress has been at my uncle’s house until recently, but now it’s hanging in my wardrobe. “I can’t keep it, there are too many bad memories. I desperately need it goneI want to move forward and rebuild my le. “Having it hanging there is a constant reminder of what happened. “I originally listed it for £, on eBay but there was no interest in the dress, so then I listed it for £ on Facebook and wrote what my partner had done. “Since I wrote that I’ve received lots of positive messages.”  The advert reads: “Open to offers, never worn. Wedding was cancelled due to [redacted] fiancé. “Desperately need gone, cost me £, had it a year and it’s a constant reminder. “Sophia Tolli dress size  never altered.” Donna and James met in March  at a nightclub in Horsham, West Sussex, and the following day Donna searched for him on social media and sent him a message. Six months later loved-up Donna moved in with James who then proposed and presented her with a diamond cluster engagement ring. Donna said: “I instantly fell for him and we soon spent every single day together. After a couple of months he told me how in love with me he was. “We were both really, really happy and so madly in love - head over heels - I wanted to spend the rest of my le with him.”  The pair were happily engaged and bought a two-bed end-of-terrace house where they lived together with Donna’s cat Sammie. Bride-to-be Donna excitedly booked four-star Nutfield Priory in Redhill, Surrey, as the April  wedding venue and picked her dream wedding gown, bridesmaid dresses and busied herself making hand-crafted decorations. As Donna immersed herself in wedding planning, newly-married Paige regularly offered her wedding planning advice over cocktails. Donna said: “The whole time from June up until November was wedding planning. “Paige and I would meet up for a cocktail and she would give me stuff for my wedding. “She even gave me her spreadsheets which were a massive help. “We also did a lot of over text and Facebook and she would tag me in dferent things. In September Donna picked up her designer wedding dress and said the gown, which hugged her curves, made her feel like royalty. Donna said: “When I went to pick up the dress with my mum and tried it on I said ‘mum I feel like a princess’. “I felt so pretty and elegant and it struck me that I really was getting married and wanted to spend the rest of my le with him. “Mum was crying and other people in the shop were welling up too.”  However two months later, in November , Donna was stunned when James delivered the bombshell news that he didn’t love her anymore and the wedding was off. Donna said: “When he told me he didn’t love me anymore and that we weren’t going ahead with the wedding I was broken. “I collapsed to the floor and cried my eyes out. “I went for a walk to get away from the house to process what had happened - the James I had loved had gone. “When I came back to the house, he told me there was nothing to talk about. I had no option but to leave. “I rang a friend who told me to pack a bag and go to her house straight away. I was up all night crying my eyes out. Devastated Donna fled to her friend’s house as she processed what happened. Donna said: I didnapost go to work, I didn’t eat, sleep or talk. I didn’t do anything. My friend said she’d never seen anything like it. “I just went completely numb and sat in the same spot for four days.” Newly-single Donna eventually moved back in with her parents and lost three stone in weight due to the stress of the break up and not eating properly. Since the break-up Donna has slowly started to rebuild her le and met her current partner -year-old data analyst Nick Pashley four months ago. Donna said: “Last October I started to rebuild my le - I changed job and have been focusing on my wellbeing. “I met someone new on Bumble called Nick - he’s my rock. “If Nick was to say ‘let’s get married’ I don’t think I could go through it again as the experience has turned me into a commitment-phobe. “I’ve only just got my dress back as it’s been hanging up at my uncle’s house. “Now it’s in my wardrobe, the fact I know it’s here, I need it gone so I can move forward. It was really expensive but there are too many bad memories attached to it. “I put it up for sale on eBay but had no interest, since sharing it on Facebook I’ve had lots of people sending me positive messages of support, which has been nice.” Donna has yet to sell the dress but hopes a bargain-hunting bride will get the chance to enjoy the dress on her special day. Donna said: “It’s a really beautul dress and will make someone’s day. “The a-line dress draws you in at the waist and then it flares out and covers everything up, it makes you look like you have the tiniest waist.” James said: I paid for pretty much everything for the wedding. Donna paid for some small craft items to make personalised champagne flutes, but I paid for the big stuff. “Her dad contributed £ towards it but was reimbursed once the wedding was called off. Paige, a photographer, said: “Donna has never attempted to contact me to try to have it out. “It would be hard to hear that James and I are incredibly happy. “We’re in a fantastic situation and I’m aware Donna is in a new relationship. I personally wish her happiness. I was married to another person. I worked with James and we had been friends for three years and we went away, with other people, on a work trip and we got chatting.

Sarah Mennell, from Hull, says she does not mind spending hundreds of pounds on school unorms because they are an investment in her childrenaposs education. The mum-of-five claims the massive outlay gives her children pride and a push to do well at school, Hull Live reports. Ms. Mennell was speaking following a campaign to reduce the cost of unorms to make it poverty proof. Her eldest daughter Tiamarie joined Kingswood Academy in Hull last year and her eldest son, Jackdaniel, joins this September. Having purchased their full branded unorms, including PE kits, the mum has spent more than £ each.  Mrs Mennell, also mum to Sydney, ten, Princess, six, and Albert, four, said: I personally think the price is reasonable. The full Kingswood unorm with rugby tops, shorts, tracksuit, rugby socks, ties and all shoes are around £ in total. It’s a investment in their education. If the kids feel smart and look smart it really helps them and it helps them fit in. The unorm campaign has gained support from parents who urge schools to cut the cost of unorm by removing the requirement to use branded, more expensive items. The children wear this unorm for nearly seven hours a day. The quality is better than cheaper brands and my daughteraposs looks as good as it did a year ago.    Having the whole school unorm really gives them a push and makes them feel proud. My daughter has  per cent attendance for the time in her first year at secondary school. Usually she has the odd day off in primary school, but no, she has to attend and keep her  per cent. This is not us making her go, even when she might be a little off she literally never wants to miss a day’s education. She is up at .am, school unorm on and is dressed. As soon as she home she in her non unorm and folds it up and hangs it herself because she’s proud to wear it.Where my kids usually sling it in the floor the value of the unorm teaches them respect. I could have probably got it cheaper buying cheaper trousers and shirts shoes but the quality is not as good.I would rather pay that little bit more and get decent comfy quality items once then buying them all again every three to four months. At Kingswood Academy, the blazer, tie, jumper, skirt and PE kit must be purchased at the school.  Parents have the option to purchase trousers where but parents are warned even where shops describe unorm as school wear, the clothes may not meet the schoolaposs policy.  Mrs Mennell said the price is fair due to the quality of the clothes, and said her daughteraposs lasted all year during her first year at the school. She said: I think you pay for what you get,you want cheaper unorms you will get cheaper made unorms that won’t last. The quality and design is much better then cheaper options from supermarkets I think the price of the unorms are fair becauseyou break it down over the year you spend around the same as cheaper unorms. Tiamarie used to go though trousers and shirts and shoes every three months when we got them from supermarkets, but the Kingswood unorm has lasted all year and her shoes are spotless. Mrs Mennell says she budgets so she is able to afford it and even has unorm accounts for her children.

Mum-of-three Jenner said she has been sucked into a poverty trap, Stoke-on-Trent Live reports . She says her financial woes have not been helped by the controversial Universal Creditchanges. Now Jenner is one of  researchers who have gone into communities on behalf of Staffordshire University and the Hardship Commission to try to lt the lid on what le is really like below the breadline. She said: “I lost my pride a long time ago to keep the family going. Are you a struggling parent  Email webnews@mirror    “I have got  O-Levels and four A-Levels, but I can’t get a job. I applied for four jobs recently and didn’t even get an interview for any of them. “My husband died in  and I had to pull myself together for the kids. When he was diagnosed with cancer he was given two years, but he lasted . But what this has done is given me strength to know that I’m not alone.” When Jenner and Haydn moved to Stoke-on-Trent they bought a derelict property at auction and planned to renovate it themselves. But that was not possible after Haydn’s health deteriorated and the property was so bad that some rooms were uninhabitable. It meant the couple and their three children - who are now aged ,  and  - all had to sleep in the same room - until BBCaposs DIY SOS came along to fix the house.

His departure became inevitable after Boris Johnson threw him under Donald Trump’s presidential limo. When a foreign leader belittles your PM and starts dictating who serves as your ambassador, you stand up to them. Mr Johnson shamed the nation with his craven response. Sir Kim was a pawn in a much bigger game. He was targeted as he was viewed by Brexiteers as sympathetic to the EU and an obstacle to a more slavish ambassador in Washington.  In their desperation to secure a post-Brexit trade deal with the US, the Brexiteers destroyed the career of a most respected diplomat and humiliated the UK on the world stage. They have dragged us away from Europe and want to place us at the mercy of a president who should be served with an ASBO. The next humiliation would be a trade deal that lets US firms export their chlorinated chicken and batter down the doors of our NHS. So much for seizing back control. Pension scam Thousands of women have been penalised by the change in the retirement age. Now they are being punished yet again for taking time out of work to raise a family or look after an elderly relative. A report says women have £, less in pension pots than men.  The shortfall is compounded by the fact they often earn less than their male counterparts and are more likely to be in part-time jobs. Auto-enrolment is helping bridge the gap, but more must be done to help women remain in work. That means providing better childcare and social care.

HMS Montrose was escorting the British Heritage tanker through the Persian Gulf when the stand-off with three Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps boats took place on Wednesday, according to CNN. It is claimed the boats told the tanker to change course and enter Iranaposs territorial waters, with a US aircraft recording the incident. HMS Montrose, which was trailing the tanker, then trained its guns on the Iranian vessels and warned them to back off. The Iranian boats are said to have obeyed the frigateaposs instructions, which were issued over the radio. However, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has denied that it tried to stop the tanker, according to the semi-official Fars news agency.  One US official told Reuters: The Royal Navy HMS Montrose, which was also there, pointed its guns at the boats and warned them over radio, at which point they dispersed. Another official added: It was harassment and an attempt to interfere with the passage. A British Government representative said: HMS Montrose was forced to position herself between the Iranian vessels and British Heritage and issue verbal warnings to the Iranian vessels, which then turned away. We are concerned by this action and continue to urge the Iranian authorities to de-escalate the situation in the region. Early reports stated the Royal Navy ship faced down five Iranian boats. Thirty British commandos stormed an Iranian oil tanker bound for Syria last week, prompting Iranaposs President to threaten the UK with retaliatory action. Speaking on state television on Wednesday, President Hassan Rouhani said: “Youare the initiator of insecurity and you will realise the consequences later. Now you are so hopeless that, when one of your tankers wants to move in the region, you have to bring your frigatesbecause you are scared. Then why do you commit such acts   You should instead allow navigation to be safe.

Liz Travis, , was on holiday in Halkidiki with her family when they got caught up in the extreme weather in Greece which has seen six people killed and more than  injured. The grandma described her family crouching on the floor of a taxi with their heads down, guarding her two year-old grandson as the storm lashed outside. She described fearing the car would turn over as it rocked, with tree branches hitting the vehicle on their way back to Halkidiki after visiting a nearby village. Liz said they were shaking, thought they would die, and said she began praying in fear despite not being religious. The sales negotiator from Bishopstoke claims they even saw a car appearing to slip over the edge of a clf and admitted she woke up from a nightmare this morning following the traumatic scenes they saw. Have you been caught up in the storms in Greece  Email webnews@mirror    Speaking to Mirror, Liz said: We thought we were going to die, it was horrendous. Iaposm not even religious but I started praying. I was doing cross signals across my chest. She added: We saw a power cable come down on the motorway. We saw a car slip over the edge of a clf, we just canapost believe it. The Greeks said theyaposve never experienced anything like it. I woke up this morning having had a nightmare and shouted aposget the car off the clfapos. I have been traumatised.  Liz and her family went on an evening excursion to nearby village Afytos, about  minutes from their hotel. As there were seven of them, they had arranged for two taxis to pick them up at pm last night. Liz was in the car with her husband James Travis, , her -year-old daughter Sian Yates and grandson Finley Yates, two. In the taxi behind were Sianaposs husband Jamie Yates and his parents. As soon as they got in the cars, thunder and lightening hit and all the lights went out in Afytos amid a power cut. Within two minutes on the road, golf ball size hail stones began falling and the taxi driver desperately searched for a safe space to hide.  Liz told: The taxi driver said aposIaposve got to pull over, there are stones coming out of the skyapos. She said aposIaposve got to find a safe place to parkapos. In minutes there were golf balls of hell coming out of the sky hitting the car. We couldnapost see where we were going, cars were putting their hazards on. We were only going a few miles per hour as the taxi driver couldnapost see, she was crawling. We found a driveway and pulled into it - five minutes into the journey. The gates were swinging back and forth. The car was rocking and we thought we were going to turn over. Tree branches were hitting us, we could hear the sound of the water gushing. When they stopped in a driveway, Liz said they all sheltered on the floor of the car. She told: We were all crouching on the floor of the car. We got Finley out of his car seat and positioned him between me and my daughter and we were guarding him. Finley thought it was a game. We were all shaking. We all had our heads down incase the windows smashed. Water was leaking through the roof of the other taxi. We couldnapost see the other taxi behind but the taxi driver rang through to the other driver so we could speak to them.  The family were on the driveway for about half an hour before they slowly made their way back to the hotel when the hail stopped. At the hotel they were wrapped in towels by kind hotel staff who looked after them as they were shaking and shocked, but luckily all the family members made it back safely. Describing the aftermath, Liz said the metal poles on umbrellas by the pool were bent in half, gazebos were blown over on the beach. Another holidaymaker, Bethany Cooper, was also affected by the storm in Halkidiki. She told : We were sat on a beach front restaurant in Hanioti when it all happened.  She said it was very sudden, adding we currently have no electricity or water in the hotel.  Bethany said: We were eating at a restaurant on the beach front, and the power went off which we thought nothing of and everything was calm.Suddenly, a storm hit and there were chairs and items from the tables flying around.Everyone ran to get inside.could hear people screaming and children crying - and people were trying to barricade the doors closed.Today we cannot get any power or running water. All the restaurants are closed and not serving food."},{"url":null,"title":"neil armstrong describes moment stepped","story":"NewsNeil Armstrong describes the moment he stepped on the moon for the first timeThe first man to step foot on the moons surface left a detailed account of what it was like, before he died in ShareCommentsByClare Fitzsimons:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsAstronaut Neil Armstrong, commander of Apollo  and the first person to walk on the moon \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIn the second part of our series celebrating the Moon landing  years on, the late Neil Armstrong shares his memories of the mission – from setting foot on the lunar surface before fellow astronaut Buzz Aldrin to splashing down into the Pacic Ocean... We had landed. Getting down on to the Moon was less important but, to actually touch your boot into the sand was signicant. It took much longer to depressurise the cabin than we anticipated. When we got the cabin pressure down to a very low psi – it took ­something like two hundred pounds of pressure to open that up. So we had to wait until we got to a very low pressure dference between the inside of the door and the outside of the door before it would break free. When I first exited the Lunar Module out on to the porch, Buzz [Aldrin] turned on a circuit breaker powering the camera. I asked Houstonthey were getting a picture and they said yes, but it was upside down. I’m at the foot of the ladder. The surface appears to be very fine grained as you get close to it. It’s almost like a powder. The ground mass is very fine. I’m going to step off the Lunar Module now... “That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.”  I didn’t think about what I was going to say until after landing. I didn’t have confidence in our ability to get down safely, so I didn’t bother thinking about it under after we had landed. Once on the surface and realising that the moment was at hand, fortunately I had hours to think about it. I thought, ‘Well, when I step off, it’s just going to be a little step’. But then I thought about all those , people that had given me the opportunity to make that step and thought, ‘It’s going to be a big something for all those folks and, indeed, a lot of others’. Even so, I have never thought that I picked a particularly enlightening statement. It was a very simple statement. Stepping on the Moon was special, but it was only instantaneous because there was work to do. There was a checklist of things we needed to get on with.    I was surprised by a number of things. I was surprised by the apparent closeness of the horizon. And I was surprised that there was no dust when you kicked your boot. Where you don’t have an atmosphere you don’t have any clouds of dust. It has a stark beauty of its own. It’s much like the high desert of the US. It’s dferent, but it’s pretty out here. You generally have the impression of being on a desert-like surface with rather light-coloured hues, yet when you look at the material in your hand you find it’s a charcoal grey. The optical properties on the moon are most peculiar. It’s a brilliant surface in that sunlight. It’s an interesting place to be. There was substantial discussion before the flight on what the flag should be. It was questioned as to whether it should be an American flag or a United Nations flag. I thought the flag should just be draped down, that it should fall down the flagpole like it would be on Earth.  It shouldn’t be made to stand out or put into any rigid framework, which it ultimately was. We had dficulty getting it into the surface. It ran into the sub-surface crust. Then they said there was a phone call for me, and it was the President of the United States who was speaking from his office from the White House. I didn’t know it was going to be the President. A very nice congratulatory message from the President on behalf of everyone who had been working on the project. And that was a very pleasant surprise. And again there was work to be done, so get back to the job. NASA officials limited our surface working time to two and three quarter hours on that first surface exploration to assure that we would not expire of hyperthermia. We were operating in a near perfect vacuum.  The temperature was well above  degrees Fahrenheit, with the local gravity only one sixth that of Earth. Because normal air conditioning is inadequate for lunar conditions, we were required to use cold water to cool the interior of our suits. There was just far too little time to do the iety of things that we would have liked to have done. There were rocks in the boulder field that were three to four feet in size, very likely pieces of the lunar bedrock. It would have been very interesting to go over and get some samples of those. It would have been nice from our point of view to have had more time to ourselves so that we could have gone out and looked around a little bit.  The ascent to the Colombia command module had a characteristic unlike any other portion of the flight. The rockets would fire and move the vehicle upward then they would shut off, and we would be pushed the other way, then they would kick in again. The whole thing was like a rocking chair through the entire ascent trajectory. It’s a pretty spectacular ride.Watch  Days: To The Moon And Back on BBC iPlayerConspiracy theory More than  million people around the world watched the live televised footage of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walking on the Moon. Since then, NASA has brought back kg of Moon rock, while in  the NASA Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter found the footprints left behind. Yet a poll found that % of Americans think it was staged. Conspiracy theories began in  when American Bill Kaysing published a pamphlet entitled We Never Went to the Moon: America’s Thirty Billion Dollar Swindle. He argued that the Moon landing was staged in a studio. NASA and other experts have debunked the myths. But hoax stories continued, encouraged in popular culture.

Scottish Cup win over Stenhousemuir on January .After that the -year-old was sent on loan to struggling Dundee.Wright impressed in his  appearances for the Dark Blues, but was unable to stop them finishing bottom of the Premiership and being relegated at the end of last season.However, Wright believes the pain he felt at Dens Park will help as he s to Pittodrie and tries to become a first-team regular in Derek McInnes’ side.He said: “Personally I loved Dundee, I loved staying down there and playing there. It was just bittersweet with the way it ended with relegation.“But it’s weird because going to Dundee was a good and bad experience for me.“It was good because I was playing regularly and I think it rounded off my football education and has made me stronger coming back to Aberdeen.“But it was bad because unfortunately Dundee were relegated.“Before the move we spoke about going away and playing regularly.“I went to Dundee and did that and I was part of the team. We were all pulling in the same direction trying to keep the club up.“Unfortunately we just weren’t able to do that.“From being at Dundee I’m used to playing more games and coming back here there’s a dferent kind of pressure. You’re expected to win every week and be at the top of the table.“At Dundee it was a relegation fight, but the games were just as important in terms of trying to stay in the league.“I think I’ve come back a better player with more experience and I’m hungry and ready to go.“If I’m picked hopefully I can force my way back into the team and keep myself in the team. The most important thing for me is trying to nail down a spot in the team and make it my own.“The pressure on us here is what you want as a footballer. It’s a case of channelling it in the right way to get results.”Tonight’s game will be the start of Aberdeen’s sixth straight European campaign under gaffer McInnes.In the previous five the Dons have fallen at the third qualying round stage on four occasions and the second qualying round last year.The Reds’ target once again in the Europa League is to reach the group stages.To achieve that they will have to come through four qualying ties.It’s a tall order, but Wright hopes this evening’s opener against RoPS can be the start of the journey to the groups and added: “We have to aim for the group stages and just take it game by game and tie by tie to try to get there.“Our focus is on RoPS and we’ll take it from there.“We know that they like to play a bit, but hopefully we can have the majority of the ball at Pittodrie and get on top of them and get after them.“The onus is on us to get forward because we’re playing in front of our fans and that’s something we’re looking forward to.”With a potentially challenging trip to Lapland awaiting the Dons next week Wright believes it is import to take a lead into the second leg.He said: “We recognise it will be dficult going over to Finland with the plastic pitch and the conditions.“Realistically we would love to get a win at home, but we won’t panicwe don’t.“We know the onus is on us to attack, but realistically it’s important we keep a clean sheet – that is perhaps the most important thing for us.“If we keep a clean sheet it gives us a  because the tie is over two legs.“We’ve been in Europe for a few years now so we’re experienced and know what we need to do.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/07/2.44042206-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/07/2.44042206-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/07/2.44042206-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/07/2.44042206-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"mcinnes and docherty agree new dons deals","story":"Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes and assistant Tony Docherty have agreed new contracts to keep them at Pittodrie until .The pair joined the Dons in March  and have held the Reds to the League Cup in  as well as qualying for the Europa League six seasons in a row.Pittodrie chairman Stewart Milne said: “I think everyone recognises what Derek has achieved during his time at the club and I am delighted he has agreed to extend his time at Pittodrie, making him our longest serving manager since Sir Alex Ferguson.“The board and I strongly believe that with Derek leading this club we have a real  for further success, and I am confident the team he has rebuilt over the summer will continue to see us competing for trophies, keeping the pressure at the top of the league, and hopefully a strong run in Europe.“Derek also played a critical role in enabling us to secure consent for Kingsford and it will be a real milestone for the club to see him take his first training session in our first owned and dedicated training facility in our -year history.“I look forward to continuing our work together as we strive to deliver success for our great club.”McInnes added: “I am delighted we have been able to agree new contracts with the club.#The staff, players and I are committed to trying to deliver success and build upon all we have achieved in the past six years.“With the opening of our new training campus at Kingsford on the horizon I am excited about the prospect of training professionally in a modern facility, something which should be in keeping with the ambitious club we are.“It’s no secret that I love working for this club and I will strive to continue to try and create those special moments for our supporters.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"monsters and magic come to lochgilphead booksigning","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead#s Argyll Book Centre is holding a book signing with Lari Don.The Secret of the Kelpie author will be in the indie book shop on Saturday June  to read her new book to eager ears and talk to readers about their favourite folk tales and inventing monsters.After a quick break, Lari willto read excerpts from her spellbinding Spellchasers trilogy to inspire you to imagine magical adventures of your own and tell one of your favourite myths.Born in Chile, Lari Don was brought up in Scotland where she has worked in politics and for the BBC.

collaboration between the Westminster and Holyrood Governments and local authorities in the region.It is hoped that the investment will create more than , jobs within the Borderlands region.Infrastructure Secretary Michael Matheson said: ldquoI am delighted we have reached this important milestone in signing Heads of Terms for the Borderlands Deal.ldquoSuccessful delivery of the deal will create jobs, protect existing ones and extend the benefits of economic growth to even more communities across Scotland.ldquoAlongside the establishment of a new enterprise agency for the south of Scotland, and activities of the South of Scotland Economic Partnership, the Scottish Governmentrsquos pound million investment will deliver signicant and lasting benefits right across the region.A full cross border feasibility study in to bringing the Borders Railway to Hawick, Newcastleton and on to Carlisle also forms part of the deal.Transport agencies either side of the Border will work on a cross-border study for the A corridor as well as exploring an integrated transport system.The package of investment will also include broadband and mobile signal investment designed to bring the region up to UK wide levels of connectivity and a Borderlands Energy Investment Company to generate cheaper energy for the region and help the Borderlands become the first carbon neutral region in the UK.A pound million Mountain Bike Innovation Centre in the Tweed Valley aims to establish a world-class destination for research, development and tourism around mountain biking.John Lamont, MP for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk, said: ldquoThis is fantastic news for the Borders ndash this deal is packed full of projects which will boost the Borders economy.ldquoFor too long, the Border at Berwick has been viewed as this line which prevents collaboration.ldquoIt is great to see this deal ignoring this Border and looking at how the whole region can be better served, and the economy better supported.ldquoEvery penny of this pound million investment is set to benefit the whole Borderlands region by bringing in thousands of jobs, millions more visitors and improving connectivity.ldquoI am particularly pleased that the Borders Railway extension will receive this pound million boost for a full study into how we can bring the line to Hawick, Newcastleton and on to Carlisle.ldquoLess tangible but equally important is the investment in broadband, tourism, business and energy which the whole of the Borders is set to benefit from.Scottish Secretary David Mundell said:ldquoItrsquos fantastic news that the UK Government is to invest up to pound million in the Borderlands Deal.ldquoThis is an ambitious approach to cross-border working between Governments, local

visitors.ldquoThe Borderlands Deal has made huge progress in the last  months.ldquoId like to thank the five lrmlocal authorities who have worked so well together, along with the UK and Scottish governments, to achieve this.ldquoThe south of Scotland and northernmost parts of England operate as a single economic area and it is important the border is not allowed to become an obstacle to development.South Scotland Labour MSP and Scottish Labourrsquos Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Infrastructure, Connectivity and Transport, Colin Smyth, has welcomed the news but warned that the Borderlands deal will not provide a quick fix for the challenges facing the region.He said: ldquoHaving been involved in the Borderlands since the beginning, Irsquom pleased to see this deal finally agreed as it has been a long time coming.ldquoThe five local councils deserve enormous praise for developing the projects and getting to this stage, given that many people predicted it would be impossible to bring councils from across the border together in this way.ldquoEveryone now needs to get on with delivering the projects.ldquoThis will not be a panacea for the regionrsquos massive

after Scottish Borders Council approved a controversial planning development on the foot of the Eildon Hills.Rural Renaissance, the contracting arm of Melrose-based JS Crawford property developers, wants to build  homes on the Croft, near Dingleton Road, Melrose.Some of the new properties would tower m about the height of Dingleton Road, and the council has so far received  objections and representations.However, councillors sitting on Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning and building standards committee, which met on Monday July , opted to stick with planning officerrsquos recommendation to approve the development.Speaking at the meeting on behalf of the lsquoDonrsquot Build on the Eildonsrsquo campaign group, Melrose resident Carrie Henderson told councillors: ldquoBad design has been compounded by certain stipulations made in the planning brief.ldquoThe requirement for a road to loop around the nursery, when combined with the awkward levels on the site, have results in plans for houses on the southern slopes being some  metres higher than the level of the road.ldquoBe in no doubt, this housing estate will be dominant, intrusive and jarring. It will be an eyesore.Philip Neaves, from Edinburgh-based Felsham Planning and Development, spoke on behalf of Rural Renaissance.He said: ldquoThe Croft is an allocated development site that was allocated in .ldquoThe reporter who allocated the site would have been well aware of the sensitivity of the site but has still allocated it.ldquoWhat we have is proposals for  houses for private sale and seven affordable housing units.ldquoThe site, when viewed from Melrose, appears as part of the settlement, not the countryside, and views of the site from the Eildons are limited.ldquoThere are signicant economic benefits to the development, not just for employment during the construction phase but for nearby residents as well.Nearly all of the councillors expressed reservations about the development, but only one, Galashiels councillor Sandy Aitchison, voted against the proposals.He told the committee: ldquoThe fact is the reporter has made a big mistake here and the land should never have been allocated for housing in the first place.ldquoFurthermore, I donrsquot like the fact wersquove got affordable housing as a token gesture, itrsquos not spread out in the site and there are no family homes.\"Do people who need affordable homes not have families ldquoThere are so many objections. Many are from where and they are asking us to step in and protect this site which we as a local authority are charged with protecting.ldquoI really object to this application for a number of reasons.Melrose and Leaderdale councillor Tom Miers, who chairs the committee, also criticised the proposals but said he believes it can be acceptedthe council imposes certain planning conditions: ldquoI have real problems with the design and concept. I think the houses at the back are much too high and they stick out too much.ldquoThe middle three in particular, which will be at the back of the site, should be reduced in height.He suggested that the houses be reduced, by way of a planning condition, from three storey houses down to two storey.All councillors except councillor Aitchison were in agreement, and as he failed to find a seconder for his motion to reject the application, the proposals were granted planning permission without the need for a vote.Speaking after the meeting, Ms Henderson said: ldquoOver  people objected to this development and yet in the end it felt like their opinion counted for nothing. Todayrsquos decision is obviously a huge disappointment for them.ldquoUnfortunately, the planning committee couldnrsquot, or wouldnrsquot, see past the fact that this site is in the local plan.ldquoThe arguments we put forward that the proposal for the Croft is sub-standard and would irrevocably scar the view of the Eildons fell on completely deaf ears and the committee happily waved it through.ldquoFuture generations will look back and wonder how it was possible that a housing estate was ever allowed to be built on the beautul Eildons. But by then, of course, it will be too late.ldquoThe members of the planning committee, bar the one councillor who objected, should be ashamed of themselves for the decision they made today."},{"url":null,"title":"homophobic-selkirk-man-ordered-to-pay-compensation-to-couple","story":"A LABOURER from Selkirk has admitted hurling homophobic abuse towards two men.Then a month later Andrew Gillie approached both and told themthey didnt drop charges he would kill them.The -year-old of Buccleuch Road, pleaded guilty at the towns sherf court to behaving in a threatening or abusive manner and making abusive and homophobic comments in Yarrow Terrace, Selkirk, on August .He also admitted a charge of threatening the two men in Bridge Street, Selkirk, on September .Procurator fiscal Graham Fraser said the first incident happened at .pm when the two men, who are in a relationship with each other, became aware of Gillie and a female standing on a pavement.Gillie made a homophobic comment about one of the men.Mr Fraser said: \"He is fed up being targeted about his sexuality and was alarmed at what had taken place.\"The fiscal said Gillie had been cautioned and charged over that but came across the two men at about .pm on September  when they were walking their dog.Mr Fraser said: \"He said you better drop the charges or I will kill you.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

It is better than some human beings are treated ndash that is the sad truth.Mr Farnsworth was presenting an annual report on the racecoursersquos performance over the last financial year.The Beast from the East snow storm, an outbreak of equine influenza, and a long spell of dry weather all contributed to what he described as one of the worst years the course had been through in his memory.A number of key fixtures were cancelled and profits fell.In December, four horses died during one day of racing at the course but a subsequent review by the British Horseracing Authority ruled that the course and race organisers were not at fault.Councillor Gordon Mackett asked Mr Farnsworththe racecourse had been affected by animal welfare concerns.The course manager said: ldquoWe did have a horrible day when there were four fatalities however, these were all completely separate incidents.ldquoIn a sport like this you will get injuries and fatalities from time to time. It is horric for the people involved.Mr Farnsworth said that the public were becoming more aware of incidents like these through social media which, he said, ldquofuelled the debate around animal welfare.However, he said there had been no indication that it had had an impact on events at Musselburgh, which saw record crowds at its Easter Day racing this year and another sell-out Ladies Day.His report to the committee revealed that the racecourse had reported a loss over the last financial year after it paid over pound, of legal costs relating to the ongoing process by East Lothian Council to find new third-party operators to run the course.Councillor Kenny McLeod questioned why the costs were being met by the course and not the council itself.However, depute chief executive of the council Alex McCrorie told the councillor that the costs were charged to the racecourse because when the new operator was procured it would be the racecourse that benefitted.He conceded to Mr McLeod that, without the legal costs being taken from the coursersquos funds, it would have been in profit last year.East Lothian Council replaced the previous governance committee which oversaw the running of the course with a new committee last year after relations between members of the old committee badly deteriorated and the British Horseracing Authoritythreatening to suspend its racing licence.The new Musselburgh Racing Associated Committeendash which is made up of four elected councillors and two representatives of the racing industry, currently members of Lothians Racing Syndicate ndash has been overseeing the hunt for a new operator.However, the BHA has only granted temporary licences and extensions under the new committee as it continues to monitor its performance.Mr Farnsworth said that the introduction of the new interim committee had caused some problems too.

I have heard many dferent versions of this tale, and most recently come across one version in a book by Taffy Thomas, who is a renowned storyteller. Here is my version of the story, which I have titled lsquoThe Riddle Rulersquo:IT WAS to be the final race of the tournament. The two knights had been equally matched, and now they would race each other for the prize of a gold cup filled with gold coins.There was an air of excitement as the crowds gathered for this race. Sir John and Sir Harry arrived together, each mounted on their stallions. Sir Johnrsquos horse was called Lightning, while Sir Harryrsquos horse was named Spear.They were equally matched, both knights had won an equal amount of races, and both had won against each other. There was no favourite, everyone knew this race would be very close.The atmosphere was electric with anticipation.Then the kingrsquos storyteller leaned over to whisper in the kingrsquos ear: ldquoYour majesty, this race is the last of the tournament. I feel it should be a race with an extra challenge, so that the crowd are better pleased.The king agreed, but asked the storyteller what he thought the extra challenge should be.ldquoThe race should be a test of the knightsrsquo wits as well as their riding ability, replied the storyteller. ldquoSet them a riddle rule and see how they solve it.ldquoAnd what is the riddle rule to be  asked the king.The storyteller smiled: ldquoDeclare the rules of this race to be thus: the horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and coins for its owner.And so the king declared the riddle rule just before the beginning of the race: ldquoThe horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and gold for its owner.There was a murmuring amongst the spectators. The knights looked at each other, thinking.When the starter flag was lowered and the king cried ldquogo, both knights stayed at the starting line. ldquoYou go first, said Sir John to Sir Harry. ldquoNo, after you, said Sir Harry to Sir John. But neither knight was willing to leave the start line lest they be deemed to be first.Soon there were boos and clapping from the crowd, but the prize was too great for either knight to risk going first.ldquoThis race is no fun, said the king to the storyteller, annoyed now that hersquod agreed to the change in rules.ldquoGive them until this afternoon to find a way to race, replied the storyteller, ldquothere is a way but they must discover it. It will challenge their wits and also their riding skills.And so the king stood: ldquoThe race is postponed until pm this afternoon. The knights must find a way to race to the riddle rule, otherwise the prize will be forfeited.For the rest of the day there was an excited buzz as people began to discuss possible solutions to the riddle rule with the knights.ldquoWhy donrsquot you agree to cross the finish line together  was one suggestionldquoBut then they would be equal first and the prize would be lost, commented another.ldquoBesides, said Sir John, ldquoI do not trust Sir Harry not to pull his horse back at the last moment. ldquoI do not trust you either, said Sir Harry.The deadline was fast approaching and no solution to the riddle rule had been found.ldquoPerhaps being first is more important than winning the gold, said an old woman.The knights looked at each other, thinking about this. Then they both said ldquonaw and shook their heads.It was  minutes before the race and a child came up to the knights and said: ldquoI have an idea. Everyone looked down at the child and laughed. How could a poor child know the answer when the knights themselves and all the spectators were scunnered But the storyteller was walking by and overheard the laughter. ldquoChildrenrsquos wisdom is not to be laughed at, he scolded them.And so the knights asked the child for the solution.The child said two words to the knights.In a flash, the knights got mounted and prepared to race. When the starter flag was lowered and the king shouted ldquogo, both Sir John and Sir Harry raced as fast as they could, each being desperate to be first across the finish line. Their riding skills were well challenged by this race.Who won does not matter in this story. What matters are the two words that were said by the child. They were the answer to the riddle rule, and so made the race possible.What were those two words If you havenrsquot already worked it out then re-read the story carefully. If you still donrsquot know, and want to know the answer, then I will give it next week.Or perhaps you could ask a child.

History is the way we view and see things that happened in the past. That view is limited by a number of factors. The availability of surviving records and evidence is one.The vast majority of what happened in the past is inevitably lost to us. This is true even for our own personal memories. So history is the small tip of the iceberg of events and times gone by, brought to the surface by the survival of some accounts more than others.And these records are never unbiased. Often historical records and evidence are purposely partial, influenced by ideology and personal allegiances. But all are biased in some way, as the limited viewpoint and interests of those recording events is based on their experience or motives.As a result, we can only see historical events through a narrow keyhole, with most characters and goings on out of view. Itrsquos the common people who are most always invisible in history. Our own ideological preference and belief in what is important will then affect how we interpret the limited evidence we have.This is why history is often subject to furious debate, and rightly so. Irsquod say itrsquos almost impossible not to allow our own perspectives, interests and values to influence the way we interpret the broader meaning of historical events and their signicance for contemporary society.Such a debate is being had in East Lothian just now, as to the name of the new town to be built on the Blindwells site, between Prestonpans and Longniddry and just to the north of Gladsmuir and Tranent.The name can be romantically translated to mean lsquohidden springsrsquo and it was across this once-marshy ground that the Jacobites crept stealthily at night to mount a surprise attack on the Redcoats on September , . That famous battle lasted  minutes and was a victory for the Jacobites, and the launchpad of Bonnie Prince Charliersquos march into England.Consequently, the Scottish Battlefields Trust has submitted a petition, as reported in the Courier last week, to name the new community Charlestoun and build a statue of Charles.When I was at school, he seemed a dashing and heroic figure. The songs and stories about him are infectious and I totally understand how the stories told about him have created a romantic and thrilling image.But then I studied the topic in more depth, at both university and afterwards. The period has suffered from the romantic treatment but there are fascinating stories of loyalty and sacrice to a man who, in reality, saw the common people chiefly as cannon fodder for his personal and family ambitions.It is for this reason I feel there are enough name places and statues to aristocratic and powerful men whose main historical role was to make and wage war, evenhe has a famous and romantic reputation.This is not to say we shouldnrsquot remember the fascinating history of the area, including that fateful day of battle when the Jacobites crossed the land.But itrsquos how we commemorate it and who we include. What makes the Jacobite period truly fascinating is the tapestry of stories of the many people involved, on both sides. It was a brutal time, in which there was certainly deep loyalty on both sides, but there were many other reasons why people found themselves on one side or the other. It was a brutal civil war, brought on by the aspirations of the exiled Stuarts.Do we commemorate the memory of the man who caused that war or do we commemorate those who were caught up in it  Is it really the case thatwe do the former we do the latter  Irsquom not convinced.There are other stories to consider of course for the site. There was coal mining there for generations. The lives of mining families, men, women and children who toiled in horric conditions, still remains mostly unheralded by history. Maybe itrsquos not lsquoromanticrsquo enough. Likewise with farming, which was a constant economic activity in the area for generations.There was also another unusual underground activity on the site after the early mine closed. Smugglers made an illegal whisky still deep down in the mine shaft once it was disused. It took a while for the customs men to realise East Lothian had an illicit whisky-making enterprise deep below ground in the old mine workings. When they finally raided the mine, they found the still, but no sign of the makers of the whisky. It kind of gives new meaning to the name lsquohidden springsrsquo!It is suggested the children in schools should have the final say in the new name, which is a great idea. But let our children be introduced to all aspects of our local history and allow them to understand how the way history is taught influences what we believe is important in contemporary society as well, and that there is no lsquocorrectrsquo view on this.Irsquod love to be part of that discussion and debate."},{"url":null,"title":"parents-launch-petition-school-bus-operator-change","story":"Families whose children attend two secondary schools in East Lothian were stunned to discover that local firm PrenticeCoaches would no longer be used to transport the youngsters when schoolsafter the summer.The news was broken to them by Prentice, which is based in Haddington, last week, sparking a furious reaction from a number of parents.Now a petition has been launched calling for Prentice to have the contract, which has allegedly been awarded to a rival firm, given back.One mother whose children attend Knox Academy in Haddingtonand are bussed in from Gford said that she was shocked by the news.She said: ldquoPrentice have been looking after our children for  years and they are being replaced with no consultation or discussion.ldquoParents know the drivers and trust them to look after their children.ldquoIt is beyond belief that the council would simply put a dferent company in place without even consulting with the families affected.A petition calling for theof Prentice has collected more than  signatures since it was launched online.It says: ldquoPrentice provide a community service where parents feel reassured and comfortable putting their children on the buses.ldquoWe believe East Lothian [Council] has chosen to put cost over service and safety.ldquoThere is absolutely nothing wrong with the current service.ldquoThis is simply a cost-cutting exercise which could potentially put our children at risk.Prentice provided bus services for Knox Academy and North Berwick High School but has now lost the contract for those services.Ross Prentice, the company boss, admitted that he was ldquodisappointed by the councilrsquos decision.The company said: ldquoIt is a sad day.

Now its never. A flat no. Forget it. Youll have had your referendum.Both Boris and Hunt made clear at the Perth Hustings that there will be no independence referendum, eventhe SNP win outright in . Thats a sobering message for the independence movement, and for Nicola Sturgeon. She still regards the Section  route to a legally-binding referendum as the only plausible one. That is now road-blocked.There has been a dramatic hardening of rhetoric against Scotland during this campaign. Theresa May came to Stirling to proclaim that Nicola Sturgeon ldquocannot be trusted. That the Scottish government is incapable of negotiating ldquoin good faith. Why, Sturgeon had the temerity to portray the UK governments takeover of powers repatriated from Brussels as a ldquopower grab. You just cant deal with these people, May concluded.We all know what Boris Johnson thinks about Scotland. A nation of ldquofreeloaders. He described Scotland having free care and free tuition as ldquopretty monstrous. Jeremy Hunt has tended to be more emollient, but on Friday his gloves came off too. He condemned the Scottish Government as: ldquothe most bullying, isive, duplicitous, anti-business government Scotland has ever seen.Given that the Scottish National Party dominates the opinion polls, and has more seats in both parliaments than all the Unionist parties put together, this could be taken as an oblique criticism of the Scottish voter. I mean, are Scots so stupid that they dont realise they are being run by bullying charlatans  Its almost asthey cant be trusted to know their best interests, deluded as they are by the hypnotic rhetoric of separatism.This was all rather redolent of how British imperialists, like Churchill, used to talk about nationalist leaders in the old British colonies. They were all wily demagogues, up to no good. Cant trust them as far as you can throw them. The subtext was: the only language they understand is firmness. Just tell them what the score is and let them get on with it.This is very much the line taken in the Dailylast week by the Thatcherite former Scottish Secretary, Lord Forsyth of Drumlean. He says that the real threat to the Union comes from ldquogiving in to Nationalists demands. The Tories best bet is to tell them politely but firmly that they can stick their independence up their Great Glen ndash or words to that effect.All this is, of course, exactly what the SNP want to hear. There is nothing better for drumming up support for the Nationalist cause than hearing a phalanx of crusty Tory grandees telling Scotland to like the Union or lump it. Support for independence is creeping up ndash slowly but steadily ndash and is now % in the latest polls, and %Boris Johnson wins.True, demand for an early referendum on Scottish independence is certainly muted. But after Mr Johnson enters Number Ten ndash a racing certainty according to the latest YouGov poll ndash and a no deal Brexit looms, things could move fast. The SNP expect support for Yes, which has been stuck for five years, to jump dramatically. Possibly approaching that % which Nicola Sturgeon allowed the media to speculate back in  was the threshold for calling a repeat referendum.But its going to be messy. There is already disquiet in the party and in the wider Yes movement at the SNP leaders apparent lack of enthusiasm for leading the independence revolution. But after this Tory leadership campaign, she can be in no doubt that there has been a sea-change in attitudes to Scotland from the governing party. No more Mr Nice Guy. Scots will have to learn to love Brexit Britain or take the high road out of the Union.Yet, its a little odd that Scotland should have become such a touchstone issue in the Tory leadership race. There are hardly any Tory members in Scotland, after all, and it is they wholl be doing the voting in the campaign, which is now reaching peak empty promise as the ballot papers go out. But both contenders seem to have chosen to make the Union and Scotlands place in it central to their respective campaigns.They each claim, rather improbably, to have an almost religious attachment to the Union. Its blood-in-my-veins stuff for Hunt. The ldquomost successful Union in history according to Boris Johnson, clearly believing that the United States somehow fails to qualy as a union.Perhaps this relates to something deep in the Conservative psyche: that Great Britain needs to retain its subject nationalities to prove that it is still a going concern. Certainly, the loss of Scotland - taking with it a third of the UK landmass, most of its hydrocarbons and all of its nuclear weapons - would be a devastating blow to Brexit Britain. The UKs prestige, already diminished as a result of the three years of chaos and indecision, would take an even greater knock. It could lose its place on the UN Security Council, become an empty chair at G Summits...So, there was a bit of carrot to go along with the stick. Boris Johnson has declared himself ldquoMinister for the Union with the implication that devolution is now as important to the Prime Ministers role as First Lord of the Treasury . He is going to take Scotland well in hand, and ensure that all policies in future are stress tested for compatibility with all four nations.Jeremy Hunt too came bearing gts. Scotland is to become a ldquogreen Silicon Valley, a post-Brexit digital entrepocirct. He presumably avoided saying ldquoSilicon Glen because that would have reminded Scottish voters of what happened the last time Scotlands future was predicated on new technology, back in the days when the Tory George Younger ran the Scottish Office.At its height, in the early s, Scotlands technology industry made one third of all the computers manufactured in Europe. Not any more. They went where as the UK de-industrialised under Margaret Thatcher. Mr Hunt also hyped his proposal to slash corporation tax to .% - something Alex Salmond used to argue for. However, this is a policy for the UK as a whole, not Scotland, so there is no obvious comparative advantage, still less any promised to devolve business taxes.But the headline message from both Tory candidates in the Perth hustings was withering contempt for the independence movement. This will no doubt please Conservative members in the southern shires, who have already largely given up on Scotland and regard the Union with pointed indference. As YouGov discovered recently, the vast majority would willingly let Scotland goit meant saving Brexit.They may get their way sooner than they think."},{"url":null,"title":"uk-government-must-permanent-39-campaign-mode-39-strengthen-union-theresa-may-39-s-cabinet-told","story":"With several political voices warning that the Union is now under threat like never before - including that of David Lidington, the Prime Ministerrsquos de facto deputy ndash Mrs May told the weekly gathering of her senior ministers ndash dubbed the ldquoUnion Cabinet ndash that the ldquoUnion had never been more important.Several ministers contributed to the hourlong discussion, which heard how support for Scottish independence had increased as Brexit had hit gridlock and that the  Holyrood elections would become ldquoa referendum on a referendum.One minister expressed concern that Jeremy Corbyn ndash who has repeatedly stated that he does not support a second independence referendum ndash would not oppose a second vote on Scotlandrsquos futurehe needed the backing of the SNP to form a government.:Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson trade blows over Brexit, leadership and Trump in live head to headThe Cabinet was told that strengthening and sustaining the Union needed to have a ldquopermanent campaign focus for the UK, requiring resources that ran into tens of millions of pounds.Ministers were told that far more spending on communications to make the case for the Union was needed as it was pointed out that the UK Governmentrsquos overall marketing budget was pound million but just pound, or . per cent was spent promoting the Union in Scotland.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Theresa May will not break up UK\",\"description\": \"Theresa May says she will not break up the United Kingdom following SNP independence claims\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": The discussion on the threat to the United Kingdom and the desire to strengthen it across policy, spending and communications came as last night Tory leadership candidates Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt squared up to each other in the one and only live TV head-to-head before a studio audience in Salford.There is a particular concern among some senior ministers about what a Johnson premiership might mean for the Union in Scotland, especiallythere was a no-deal outcome on October .

The word menopause often has that effect. As anyone who has gone through it knows, it is the condition whose name nobody dares speak for fear of mockery or revulsion. Periods used to be taboo, but thanks to enlightened education, they are fast losing their power to humiliate. Not so the m-word. While itrsquos okay to arrive in the office nursing a humdinger of a hangover, to admit to the Grayrsquos Medical Dictionary of complaints that the middle-aged woman endures is like raising a flag of shame. Not that we need any flag. When in its grip, some of us emit as much steam as the Hogwartrsquos Express.Thanks to the courage of Ms Davies and her lawyer Kate Wyatt, we should get used to hearing more about the menopause, and to wiping the smile off sniggerersrsquo faces. Despite the hurdles they faced, they won their case. Awarding the complainant pound, compensation for lost pay, and pound for ldquoinjury to feelings, the judgement also said Ms Davies should be given her job back.So what , you might be thinking. Itrsquos hardly as dramatic a step in the fight for womenrsquos equality as Wade v Roe, or the recently expanded definition of what constitutes domestic violence. In fact it is every bit as revolutionary. Possibly even more so, since almost every woman will go through it. By proving that menopausal symptoms can have as deleterious effect on a personrsquos well-being and ability toas an illness or disability, this landmark case will go down in legal history as ndash forgive the phrase ndash a red-letter day for womenrsquos rights.In Daviesrsquos instance, she had to cope with very heavy bleeding, anxiety and loss of memory. To hold down a job while contending with all this must be hard. All women will sympathise. Even those who sailed through the Change of Le, as our grandmothers called it, know that itrsquos not always easy. It can last a decade or more, bringing with it a smorgasbrod of side-effects. Lost names, sentences that cannot be finished, tasks left undone and forgotten are all part of the mental fog that descends asyoursquore scaling the Matterhorn.

With invisibility comes power of a dferent sort, as Miss Marple knew to her advantage. But the fluster that the menopause creates brings attention of the wrong kind, a self-perpetuating vortex of public mortication that can only be cured by half an hour in a wind tunnel.It sounds comic, but itrsquos no joke. Especially not when you consider the escalating number of women working into their fties and beyond. Indeed,you were a conspiracy theorist, yoursquod think the cosmos was enjoying a grand jest at our expense. First, women need time off work to have, and raise, children. As a result, they risk slipping down the career ladder. Once back in harness, they scrabble to catch up.

Davies, who had a -year unimpeachable work record, believed that she had been discriminated against when dismissed for ldquogross misconduct, when in fact she was suffering debilitating physical and mental problems because of severe menopausal symptoms.Already I can hear sniggering in the back row. The word menopause often has that effect. As anyone who has gone through it knows, it is the condition whose name nobody dares speak for fear of mockery or revulsion. Periods used to be taboo, but thanks to enlightened education, they are fast losing their power to humiliate. Not so the m-word. While itrsquos okay to arrive in the office nursing a humdinger of a hangover, to admit to the Grayrsquos Medical Dictionary of complaints that the middle-aged woman endures is like raising a flag of shame. Not that we need any flag. When in its grip, some of us emit as much steam as the Hogwartrsquos Express.Thanks to the courage of Ms Davies and her lawyer Kate Wyatt, we should get used to hearing more about the menopause, and to wiping the smile off sniggerersrsquo faces. Despite the hurdles they faced, they won their case. Awarding the complainant pound, compensation for lost pay, and pound for ldquoinjury to feelings, the judgement also said Ms Davies should be given her job back.So what , you might be thinking. Itrsquos hardly as dramatic a step in the fight for womenrsquos equality as Wade v Roe, or the recently expanded definition of what constitutes domestic violence. In fact it is every bit as revolutionary. Possibly even more so, since almost every woman will go through it. By proving that menopausal symptoms can have as deleterious effect on a personrsquos well-being and ability toas an illness or disability, this landmark case will go down in legal history as ndash forgive the phrase ndash a red-letter day for womenrsquos rights.In Daviesrsquos instance, she had to cope with very heavy bleeding, anxiety and loss of memory. To hold down a job while contending with all this must be hard. All women will sympathise. Even those who sailed through the Change of Le, as our grandmothers called it, know that itrsquos not always easy. It can last a decade or more, bringing with it a smorgasbrod of side-effects. Lost names, sentences that cannot be finished, tasks left undone and forgotten are all part of the mental fog that descends asyoursquore scaling the Matterhorn. There can be sudden catastrophic loss of confidence, when ordinary tasks seem scary. Add to these meteoric mood swings and general aches and pains, and there are surprisingly few days when you feel like your real self.It doesnrsquot help that you wake in the small hours thinking yoursquove left the electric blanket on high, only to discover itrsquos you whorsquos imitating a kettle.

There is, therefore, a clear disjunction of opinion between the nations of the UK. In such a situation, what is the role of a Scottish Government  To act in such a way as to represent the clear wishes of those who elected it in Scotland  Or to suppress those wishes and act in accordance with the instructions of a government where in the United Kingdom that has minority representation here  That democratic paradox is the inescapable contradiction of the Union of which we are currently part.Mr Brown is likewise contemptuous of the efforts of the All Under One Banner marchers, worrying that our foreign visitors have ldquoto witness flag-waving and marching from tartan-clad inflexible SNP supporters. It is therefore ironic that John Kennedy directed his quote to the ldquoordinary citizen, enjoining them to not be passive consumers of government policies and actions, but to become involved in their communities and in that way to enrich their country. I would expect anyone of a Unionist opinion to disagree with the actions of the All Under One Banner marchers, but, in that way, they demonstrate the same contempt for anyone of contrary opinion to their own, that the Westminster Government has displayed to Scotlandrsquos Remain vote.It is therefore no real surprise that Mr Brown can write that he hopes Theresa May will ldquobe remembered as a PM who viewed democracy as sacrosanct, overlooking that this was a Prime Minister who had to be dragged to the Supreme Court to ensure that leaving the European Union would have to be approved by the whole House of Commons and not just her and her Cabinet.

History will in due course record a verdict on Mrs Mayrsquos Premiership and indeed the whole Brexit imbroglio, but, somehow, I doubt a positive commitment to democratic process at Westminster will loom very large in that judgement.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.BILL Brown sees the aim of independence for Scotland as a malignant threat and a negative impact on our lives ndash although he refers to the SNP rather than the much-larger independence movement. I can readily understand that the increasing numbers seeking independence, currently around  per cent of the voting population, will create disquiet and fear of change among those who prefer the instability of the status quo, a view I am prepared to respect. It is a pity that Unionists cannot respect the opposing view while disagreeing with it. History tells us that the clamour toto being an independent country, which Scotland has been longer than in the Union, commenced the same year as the Treaty of Union and has raised its head periodically ever since and only dampened when there were wars to be fought.In the modern campaign for independence, or war of attrition as Mr Brown would prefer, he might spare a thought,not a care, to how those seeking independence might feel with the might of the UK media and the forces of the Westminster Establishment ranged against them. One might ponder why this country of Scotland is so ldquoheavily in debt and subsidised to the hilt by Westminster after a -year oil bonanza  At the time of the Union in , Scotlandrsquos population was around one million against . million in England, or  per cent of the total. At the start of the th century before immigration to the UK changed the demographic, Scotlandrsquos share of the population had fallen to  per cent of the total ndash the only Western country where this happened, with the one exception of Ireland then still part of the UK. Ireland has now reversed the trend and a large percentage of the population are young.

Every year since then, right up to the present day, it has underspent its budget. Currently the underspend is at poundm. Constantly coming in under budget is not prudent management, it is mismanagement. This means money has not been going to departments where it is needed, like the NHS or police over the past  years.

And like many people in senior positions, particularly women, I have had moments of self-doubt but I believe it’s important to be open about that and to be a role model to young people. But more than anything, I am grateful to have the opportunity to help make Scotland a better place to live.What is the Parliament’s biggest achievement in the last  years  Twenty years on there are so many achievements that we can be proud of, and that have made Scotland a better place to live, work, study and grow up in. From free personal care to the abolition of tuition fees, the ban on smoking in public places, a minimum pricing for alcohol and the introduction of equal marriage. There’s a long, long list of these inidual policies that wouldn’t have happenedwe hadn’t had a Scottish Parliament.Across the world there are other countries now looking to Scotland to learn from the globally ground-breaking things we’ve done on public health, on tackling climate change, and on the work we’re doing around renewable energy.But above any inidual policy, there is a much more fundamental achievement, and that is that,  years on, the parliament has reinvigorated Scottish democracy and become an accepted, established part of Scottish le. We should all take great pride in that.What has been the most dficult challenge the Parliament has faced and you personally The sad and unexpected death in  of Donald Dewar – the man who had driven through the Scotland Act and then become the first First Minister – was no doubt a moment of great uncertainty for all MSPs in the early days of the Parliament.On a personal level, I’d have to say assuming the office of First Minister was my biggest challenge. Despite having spent  years in frontline politics, and seven as Deputy First Minister, nothing can prepare you for the moment where suddenly you are the last word, where there is no longer anyone above you to seek a second opinion on somethingyou want it – everyone is looking to you.What is your most memorable moment There have been many memorable moments. The passage of the Equal Marriage Act and the Minimum Pricing legislation are two key ones for me. I also think the referendum campaign has to be one of them. It not only saw Parliament at its best – with robust debates and intense scrutiny – but also sparked an enormous outpouring of democratic engagement across the country. Although the result didn’t go the way I wanted, the legacy of a more politically involved country is one we should all cherish.I have a lot of memorable moments. It’s not the famous names or the big events, but the stories I hear from iniduals around the country that inspire me. I’ve spent a lot of time lately listening to the le experiences of Scotland’s care experienced young people. Their stories will stay with me forever and drive me to improve their lives and opportunities.In  years’ time, how do you hope the Parliament will have evolved It should evolve in line with the way people in Scotland want it to. The Parliament was established in large part because of the democratic deficit that opened up during  years of a Tory government which became more and more unpopular in Scotland. Despite devolution, Brexit in particular has demonstrated that Westminster is willing to ignore the views of people in Scotland and disregard votes of the Parliament. I have absolutely no doubt that by  we will have completed the powers of the Parliament and become an independent country. That means we will have established a genuine partnership of equals with the rest of the UK and will have ensured that people in Scotland always get the governments they vote for.Are there any people you would like to thank We should never ever forget those who campaigned for decades to see a Scottish Parliament – many of whom never lived to see it become a reality.Then there are those who have worked tirelessly behind the scenes. We couldn’t do our job without the work of the parliament staff, led by the Parliament’s chief executive, Sir Paul Grice, who recently announced he was moving on to a new job after  years. He might not be well-known by the wider public but, as someone who was there from the very beginning, all MSPs and staff owe him an enormous debt of gratitude.For me personally, I certainly would not be where I am today without the support of my mum and dad and my husband Peter.Everyone is invited to join the partySaturday, June ,  is gearing up to be a great day.From am to noon, the Queen will address Parliament and each of the party leaders will speak in response. The audience will include those young people who were born in  as well as finalists from a competition for student film-makers who produced a short film on the impact the Scottish Parliament has had in their area. There will also be a number of performances celebrating the best of Scotland’s culture and music and the Makar will perform a new piece of work.In the afternoon, the Parliament will open its doors for a day of celebration – a party everyone is invited to join from pm to pm.There will be a chance to sit in the Presiding Officer’s seat and see how it feels to take charge, as well as retro games like giant Jenga, Kerplunk and space hoppers. There will also be live music, dancers, face painting and caricaturists.And of course, there will be birthday cake and food too. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: “It will be a great day, full of colour and energy. Parliament always does these events well and brings in so many people from across Scotland. “I hope we spend the day not just looking back on what has been achieved, but focused on the work the parliament still has to do.“The public are often sceptical of politicians, but I hope people across the country will reflect on how far we’ve come with the parliament and the dference it has already made to so many people’s lives.”"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon the scottish parliament s greatest achievements","story":"The Scottish Parliament will celebrate its th anniversary today .Her Majesty the Queen will take part in the th anniversary celebrations today, with the iconic Parliament building in Edinburgh being open from pm to pm for visitors to join in the birthday celebrations.And in an exclusive QA, Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told us what she believes the Parliament’s top  greatest achievements are.The country’s top politician also shared her thoughts on Brexit and the future, sounding a note of caution for the UK’s next Prime Minister.Here, in her own words, Nicola walks us through the Parliament’s success story...Right from its earliest years, the Scottish Parliament showed that it was ready to take policy decisions substantially dferent to those at Westminster to help build a better country.A clear early example of this was the introduction of free personal care for the elderly. This was a substantial commitment but was vital for Scotland’s long term interests, preparing ourselves for the challenges of an ageing population. We’ve recently extended free personal care to cover all those who are assessed as needing it, no matter their age.MSPs also charted a dferent course when, following a change of administration in , parliament voted to scrap tuition fees in Scotland, restoring Scotland’s long and proud tradition of free education.Similarly, the decision to abolish prescription charges brought to an end what was little more than a tax on ill health. The NHS of course is the greatest, and most valued, example of a universal service where care is provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay. Our health service, like others across the world, faces challenges. But it is a real achievement of the Scottish Parliament that we have resisted the marketization moves south of the border while ensuring that under the current government Scotland’s AE departments are the best performing in theUK.On other occasions, the Parliament has led the UK in making bold policy choices, such as the ban on smoking in public places. Our Climate Change Act includedthe most ambitious emissions reduction targets of any legislature in the world and, as Health Secretary, I was heavily involved in the campaign to introduce a minimum unit price for alcohol, which we knew would play a key role in tackling Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with drink – another world leading measure.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"As the Scottish Parliament prepares to celebrate its th anniversary, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on both its journey and her own.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on  years of the Scottish Parliament viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"It took a decade of hard work to make this policy a reality and I am personally very proud of the campaign, working with stakeholders, to persuade MSPs to back minimum pricing, as well as overcoming a legal challenge that went all the way to the Supreme Court.I am personally committed to making sure every child and young person in Scotland gets the best possible start in le. We have already delivered an increase in free, high quality childcare for all three and four year olds and extending entitlement to eligible two year olds and will increase it further before the end of this parliament.Scotland has also become a much safer society under devolution. Recorded crime has fallen to some of the lowest levels seen since the s. In particular, non-sexual violent crime has fallen substantially, thanks in no small part to the excellent work of the Violence Reduction Unit, which was established over a decade ago with cross-party support and is now being copied across the UK.In recent years, new powers have come to the Scottish Parliament and with those powers come increased responsibilities for MSPs to deliver for the people ofScotland.Income tax policy is now a key feature of the annual Scottish budget. We’ve used these new powers to introduce a fairer income tax policy, with most people paying less tax than they would south of the border – while continuing to raise revenue to support investment in the economy and public services.Last year Parliament passed the wide-ranging Social Security Act, paving the way for devolution of a number of benefits, as well as creating a number of newbenefits such as increased carers’ support allowance and best start grants for families with young children – and a new social security agency to deliver them. This new agency has a culture of dignity and respect at its heart and early feedback from service users has been overwhelmingly positive.I also appointed the first gender balanced Scottish cabinet and we are encouraging more women to stand for parliament, and bring a better balance to ourpublic le.Over the course of the Scottish Parliament consistent action has been taken to ensure communities have the opportunity to own the land they live and work on.Many communities have benefited from the right to buy that now covers rural and urban communities.Of course, the foundation of our country is a strong and resilient economy. That’s why we have slashed or abolished business rates for , premises –saving almost £. billion for our small businesses.We have invested in our infrastructure with all governments building new schools and hospitals and, of course, the iconic Queensferry Crossing.And, to help make sure we have the workforce we need for years to come, we have delivered just over a quarter of a million Modern Apprenticeships in the lastdecade.In April this year, new legislation to tackle controlling and coercive behaviour came into effect, giving Scotland some of the most robust domesticabuse legislation in the world.I’m also proud of the many steps we’ve taken to make Scotland a fairer society, including the introduction of equal marriage rights – attending one of the first same-sex weddings in Scotland is a memory that will stay with me for a long time.And we all worked together over many years to help Glasgow successfully host the  Commonwealth Games. This helped to inspire Scots to get more active,delivered new facilities and put Scotland on the world stage. It was a sight to behold.My final achievement is perhaps harder to quanty. There is no doubt that the re-establishment of Scotland’s parliament has profoundly changed our political culture for the better, with our nation’s lawmakers much more accessible to those they represent. It has also enabled us to have conversations we wouldn’t have had and to debate our own future, with the  independence referendum generating an increase in democratic engagement.Looking ahead, we now face the signicant challenges posed by Brexit which, of course, Scotland’s people and parliament overwhelmingly oppose. Given the long-term damage that Brexit will cause to Scotland, and the material change in circumstances this represents, I believe it is only fair that people are given the choice of whether to become an independent country. Indeed, the current SNP Government was elected on a clear manesto commitment that people should be offered that choice should Scotland be taken out of the EU against its will. Polls consistently show that people living here believe the decision on whether to hold a referendum should be a matter for Holyrood and not Westminster. Twenty years after it came into being, that is an important measure of the way people in Scotland view the Parliament and one that the new UK Prime Minister would do well to heed."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : amIt#s the penultimate day of competition at the NatWest International Island Games in Gibraltar and Orkney#s athletes are again in action in a multitude of sports.

The countryrsquos privacy laws are very strict on such personal information.Mrs Merkel, who turns  next week, also has kept up a full schedule lately, attending a Group of  summit in Japan and a marathon European Union summit. On Sunday, she is due to attend Francersquos annual national day military parade.At a news conference after Thursdayrsquos meeting with Ms Frederiksen, Mrs Merkel sidestepped a German reporterrsquos question as to whether she has consulted her doctors and,so, what the results were.ldquoYou can assume that, firstly, I am aware of the responsibility of my office and act accordingly, also as far as my health is concerned, she replied. ldquoAnd secondly, you can assume that I also have a great personal interest in being healthy and taking care of my health.Asked what her upcoming th birthday means to her, a smiling Mrs Merkel said that ldquoit means yoursquore not getting younger, but perhaps more experienced. Everything has its good side.All three incidents in which Mrs Merkelrsquos whole body shook in public took place as she stood still without talking, and ended immediately once she started walking.

I anticipate resistance that they inevitably face, not only politically, but the spite and anger aimed at women’s general visbility, played out in online readers’ comments, social media posts, and antagonistic media framings that dfer remarkably little in their intent to shame and belittle. Headlines and captions can be subtly hostile from the off, drawing on words with gendered, demeaning stereotypes: cat fight, slapped down.Recently though a few particular stars have shown up their critics by pressing on regardless, refusing to linger at stumbling blocks of self-justication demanded of them. They know they won’t win over those holding retrograde views of women and so don’t even bother, instead publicly laughing them off and continuing. It’s a defiance that makes their detractors appear all the more irrelevant, and relies on media savvy and knowing their true audience is looking on.For all social media can focus the lens of hatred, it’s also where contemporary stars across sport, politics, and entertainment communicate with audiences directly, and the audience with one another. When the USA national women’s football team get a hard time from many quarters, their strategy in dealing with it is knowing others are taking inspiration. Like our team in Scotland rising to new prominence, these footballers have won many new fans nationwide. A strong contingent among that are the women and LGBT communities who see them winning and being defiant in the face of familiar attack on the world stage, and, crucially, having a good time while they’re at it. You can join the party or stay under the bridge shouting at women moving on by.: How artists can defeat the politics of hate – Laura Waddell: Donald Trump cleared  Don’t be so sure – Laura WaddellTimes may be slow to change in many quarters, but a palpable new buoyancy comes from the groundswell of support and celebration social media has made visible, cheering on successes but also that defiance itself. We share everything online, sometimes ill-advisedly, but small pockets also share experiences and feelings, building community. Seeing, for example, Megan Rapinoe celebrate after a goal collectively feels good not only for football fans but for the queer people and feminists among them who have grouped together in mutual admiration and recognition. Rapinoe celebrating with theatrical flair in her now trademark arms-wide pose, a visual ta-da, a bow without the bend, is also a win for self-expression and cultural acceptance, all the more so for doing it in spite of detractors and during Pride Month’s spirit of celebration and protest. The momentum of the Women’s World Cup has gathered speed like a cork popping, the potency of representation mixed in with the adrenaline of high-level sports. For decades, sports audiences and commentators have taken men who smash tennis racquets and scream at referees in their stride. Only during the Women’s World Cup can I remember public discussion, facilitated by media phone-ins, about whether the winners have expressed their delight too confidently, their arms spread too widely. If they can’t stop them, they’ll police their tone. Think pieces have sprung up like mushroom spores about whether celebrating visibly is arrogant. Career controversialists have lined up to stick the boot in. In short, the resistance is ancient: to women taking up too much space, expressing their bodies too freely, moving without shame, and being confident in themselves in public. If John Knox were alive today, he’d be on a sofa, gesticulating about Megan Rapinoe.It was inevitable the thin-skinned Trump would bristle at these women, representing many things his Administration opposes, and particularly Rapinoe, with her history of ‘taking the knee’ in protest during the American national anthem. After the President tweeted “Megan should WIN before she TALKS,” the team responded by criticising Trump’s exclusionary policies, racism, and homophobia. When a Fox team covering the World Cup final from a bar went live, patrons began chanting “F*** Trump”.As much as it has felt radical to see women’s sports celebrated in the mainstream worldwide, and for those sports stars to harness the moment as a protest, it has also felt radical to see women’s happiness on the big screens.Visual symbols matter, and few politicians have made use of them as well as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, known by her initials and Twitter handle AOC, with her innate understanding of digital media and intent to turn celebrity into action. She’s shown up, with remarkable ease, attempted smears on her character that however weak, might have caused a less digitally reactive politician to flounder. When a video of her dancing in college was dragged into the public eye, its youthful frivolity used in an attempt to damage serious credibility, she put it in its place with a short clip released on Twitter dancing outside her office. She’s also taken viewers on storytelling journeys while questioning in Congress. A five-minute video of her talking about corruption went viral, despite being full of official ins and outs, because she framed it as a “lightning round” game, playing the role of dodgy dealer trying to game the system in order to show up those who have.AOC’s ease on camera helps. But while there’s a long road ahead of her, and recent polling has shown she might need to invest more time in her constituency to retain support, Ocasio-Cortez’s savvy should serve her well. She’s used media attention to shine a light on political causes, knowing press who’ve snfed her out as a rising star will follow where she goes, whether laudatory or critical. Her recent trip to migrant camps on the US-Mexico border forces others to bear witness.Although we know from the meagre information released by human rights associations and charities that conditions are horric in these camps, now openly being referred to as concentration camps by AOC and others, the tide of public opinion has typically relied on visual prompts when it comes to human rights.Several years ago Amnesty International published a report into digital abuse and its impact on freedom of expression, marking it as a factor in dissuading women from speaking publicly. Hostility takes its toll and not everyone is equipped to rise above it. But the new wave of women stars who very visibly press on in spite of their critics is a strong and impactful message about ignoring, not placating, those stuck in the past, and doing it for each other.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"disruption continues at gatwick after air traffic issue","story":"Flights to and from Gatwick Airport continue to be disrupted following an air traffic control problem.Thousands of passengers are affected as airlines struggle to move aircraft and crew to their scheduled location after an issue at the West Sussex airports control tower caused flights to be suspended for more than two hours on Wednesday night.The problem was resolved but the knock-on effect is continuing to cause disruption, with six flights cancelled and a further  delayed between am and midday on Thursday, according to aviation data website FlightStats.British Airways, easyJet and Norwegian were among the airlines affected by the closure of the runway.: Flights resumed after air traffic control issue On Wednesday, at least  flights were erted and eight cancelled as the airport worked with ANS, its air traffic control provider, to fix the problem.Gatwick issued an apology and urged passengers to check the status of their flight with their airline before going to the airport.Travel journalist Shilpa Ganatra, who was supposed to be flying to Bilbao for a festival, learnt her flight was cancelled at the airport on Wednesday night.She said: \"Vueling, who I was flying with, rebooked me on a Friday, indirect, overnight flight, which is obviously pointless.\"Im just trying to find out how to reject that - Ive had to rebook myself on a .am Ryanair flight from Southend tomorrow, at a cost of £ plus £ in hotel and yet-to-find-out train fare.\"Im hoping either my travel insurance or the airline will cover it, but its the stress of not being % sure and the hassle thats the most infuriating thing, apart from the lost holiday time.\"She said other travellers \"had it worse\", with people \"waiting hours to find out what was going on\".: Warning for drone owners after Gatwick chaosJenner Jones, , from Hertfordshire, said her Norwegian Airlines flight which left Stockholm at .pm on Wednesday was erted to Birmingham Airport.Passengers were sat on the tarmac for an hour-and-a-half while their plane waited in a queue to refuel and fly to Gatwick.\"Everyone is pretty relaxed but bored I think,\" she said.\"A few people have asked for food but they said they cant do a food service right now.\"The airport was forced to shut its runway four times in two days in April  after only one air traffic controller was available to work due to a staff shortage.The runway was closed every time the person took their two mandatory breaks per sht.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form. One of mine wanted to go, the other didn#t. One asked a question at the Town Hall and I am very proud # not that she had to protest # but that she had the courage to do so, and silence many there.Well done young folk # out of the mouths of babes as they say.It hardly takes any courage to join a protest, especially one being encouraged and congratulated onby so many folk! The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed. A bit like supergluing yourself tp a bus or train, outstanding!!!I didnt say it took courage to join a protest, I said it takes courage to speak at the Town Hall. Andit was about time off school, they all would have gone. Please have more respect for our bairns and young folk.And these bairns are, for your information, studying the stem subjects at school.It is not a case of having respect for the bairns, Johan Adamson. It is just a case of having absolutely no respect whatsoever for those who politicise them and drive them like sheep. Primary children used in a political strike!! Repulsive behaviour, you should be ashamed, so socialist, child exploitation is the words that come to mind.They had to complete a form, primary children! What next, form a political Union and become militant  Little Orwellian sheep bleating for the Pigs.These were AHS pupils Ian, not primary pupils, and no one has politicised them.Educated them yes, but then I forgot you have the monopoly on climate change education and stem subjects.The organisers were I think over , so young adults.The fact is I will always criticise revolting behaviourand ignorance and I am not referring to the children.Yes I do believe sixth year pupils are capable of organising thisWhy do you assume Ian that these bairns are not studying stem subjects and that only you know about climate change then Ian Infantile comments  Pot kettle springs to mind.Now just who printed these forms the children had to fill in  Which teachers OKed the strike and arrange for Brae and Aith schools also took part, as well as bairns from the Sound Primary School and organised and paid for transport  I do not believe that was AHS sixteen-year-olds for one second.Whether by accident or design this provides a very convenient fig leaf for the council#s lamentable performance on child poverty.Much was made of the #children#s march# at the SIC#s education committee meeting today however in a news report about the part of the same meeting that dealt with the council#s child poverty action report, it was clear that the council have done next to nothing since the Shetland Inequalities Commission reported in March .know. All these admirable young citizens are guilty of is taking a stand based on commonly accepted information. I could ask what special knowledge does Ian think he has that allows him to lord it over them# but nerves fail me.On Ian’s earlier point, it is self-evident thatwe need some people with a high level of competence in STEM subjects who can take critical stand on matters scientic. Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course. Nuclear Free Council, Declair Climate emergency,climate justice what a load of utter bunkum. Especially stop allowing political activists to exploit our children.I put forward the question : Is nuclear power the only solution to stop greenhouse gas emissions and the only way to stop climate change progressing further  It may be the worse case scenario in terms of our power demand solution, but what are the alternatives to our demand for energy without causing further environmental and ecological damage to the planet by in using fossil fuels or cleaner alternatives like wind or solar   It has been suggested the Sahara Desert could be used for solar energy to power Europe, but how much land would be required and could this be expanded  The alternatives to fossil fuels may be cleaner, but how would this affect global weather patterns or the depletion of species due to the destruction of natural habitats being replaced for energy production Very sadly the SG SNP has committed to wind energy with its catastrophic environmental damage and only intermittent supply, but that is the policy of the scientically ignorant and utterly stupid.Thank you for your comments, Ian. I fear humanity will have no choice but to go nuclear for its energy production in the future.Alternative resources, like wind or solar, may be the short term answer, but as mentioned, the downside to this is the large amount of land which will be required with the ability to vastly expand as demand increases. What would be the environmental damage and the destabilization of le on the planet have in the long term with such technologies  There is also the issue of economics dictating progress on future energy production, and would this be counter-productive due profits taking priority over progress and the reduction of the pollution into the environment  I agree with your comments Ian, in regard to nuclear based energy production. However, like many issues to do with progress, something catastrophic will have to take place before we realize we should have acted sooner.There it is again, the abusive and arguably ignorant use of that word “stupid”. Having reread all contributions above it seems Ali denies there’s a problem by saying there are dangerously low CO levels, John distracts by arguing the council should care more for child poverty, and Ian disparages, disparages and disparages again. Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet Ian’s singular approach is getting between him and his key message. I’ve long been puzzling as to what makes the good doctorso determined to overuse petty insult so freely, but it would be helpful to know just whathis specic problem with climate change protests is. If he could but answer his own Ice Age question to Brian , his motive might become a little clearer. And apologies in advance to Ianhe has already made his point and I’ve missed it, but it wasn’t me who thought it smart to surround it with invective. Wouldn’t it be just lovelyIan could contribute tolerantly without using putdowns  It’s almost as though he needs them to build himself up# Oh. Hold on# Eureka!#Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet # What a plonker, Peter, just cannot resist going political. Is thisLabour or SNP talking, he often points in both directions or is he now Green Maybe the characters on here who hate the idea of young people protesting about climate change should head down to the school and start shouting some of this stuff over the wall.But, then again, that might make them see . . . well . . . insane.Folk writing to the paper to have a go at the protesters is one of the most depressing contributions to local public debate imaginable.Hopefully, though, the usual naysayerswill only encourage them to do it more.There#s nothing wrong with anyone, of any age, having an opinion on whatever they like, and expressing it. But in their own time, only.The problem with this is that participation in this protest was permitted and facilitated,not encouraged by the education authority, which by default is an endorsement of the opinion being expressed in the protest and the timing method by which the protest was made, by the education authority.Education authorities and schools are supposed to be impartial, by granting #authorised absence# status to a politically motivated protest, that impartiality is now seriously called in to question and a dangerous precedent has been set.There was no reason other than a cynical publicity stunt for this protest to take place during the school day. If those still at school feel strongly enough to organise a protest like adults do, that#s fine, let them, but also like adults, it#ll have to happen in their own time, or they suffer the consequences of #unauthorised absence#, for it to be taken seriously.If they want to play in the big bad world, they play by the big bad world#s rules, not by special favours like this was.Only a few nutters are #impartial# about climate change these days.Do you mean that civil disobedience would have been better Well said Mark! The evident concern trollingis intended to deligitimise the voice of young people who, lets remember, are meant by right to have a say in matters that concern them. Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens. Therefore no one involved in supporting the reported protest has done any wrong, other than in the eyes of seemingly knee-jerk reactionaries who may well be hiding their true motives. Artfully comparing these identiable young people to Orwell’s unthinking farm animals, in order to subvert their point# well it more than lacks sensitivity and compassion. It is desperate, pitul and contemptible in equal measure. It may well also fall foul of observing normal standards of decency and tolerance that contributors to these pagesare meant to adhere to. Those joining the protest were not “stupid”, as has been claimed above. The overuse of that intolerant word may be though. I note you mention #Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens.# now could you explain how taking time off school and striking for the declaration of aclimate emergency makes the child an active and responsible global citizen  I rather feel they are being played by our Greeny ignoramuses and SNP political propagandists! Never mind, I am sure they enjoyed their day off school.Nuclear power  Thatgreat physicistRobert Oppenheimer , on seeing the first atomic bomb explode said with horror—-“ I am become death , the destroyer of worlds.”. The people of Japan and Chernobyl have had a taster and I suspect they arenot eager for a repeat. .However,Shetland is####..Hmm.Rock on.Haydn, Thorium reactors, not Uranium! no atom bombs, no long term isotopes decaying for millennia. Almost infinite clean energy with really cheap fuel.Where would your preferred site be for the Shetland nuclear power station be Dr Tinkler  Aith  Bigton  Would bring plenty work to the west side. You could include it in your manestoyou stand for the council again.Well, Ray Purchase, it is already here. Thousands of Shetlanders have had radiotherapy and had their lives saved by a nuclear atomic reactions of one type or another.I seriously doubtthere is a single person on Shetland who has not had their own, a member of their family or close friends le saved by the products of nuclear reactors.Are you so moronic as to deny that or is that a bit too deep for you to understand or Oh dear Dr Tinkler, it seems you’ve come down with a nasty case of whataboutery. I didn’t ask you about the undoubted benefits of x-rays and radiotherapy I asked you where you would build a nuclear power station in Shetland. Now do you think you could give a straight answer to a straight question  Physician heal thyself!If thorium proves viable, I would be happy for such a station in Lerwick. Safe, clean, small and less damaging than the district heating woodchip waste burner we have at present and infinitely less toxic. I also asked is that a bit too deep for you to understand  # So it seems to be!!Well done Ian, you answered the question! There was a lot of unnecessary waffling and needless aggression but you got there. So, in the incredibly unlikely event of a, totally safe, nuclear power plant being built in Shetland you’d still want it as far away from where you live as possible. Fair dos.Instead of nuclear power or gas have you ever put any thought into wind power  I’ve heard that they don’t cause any carbon pollution at all, so they’d be ideal. They’re very pretty too and scientic. Like an actual windmill, I’m a big fan.Sadly Ray, you are being misled. take Viking for example. Peat disturbance alone. over  kilometres of tracks, the ground footprint of over  square kilometres. A fair amount of COreleased there. Then tens of thousands of tons of concrete basses.emissions, Chatham House.  kilometres of the interconnector, Copper plastic!!! Now just imagine the peat is so unstable that helicopters are being used, just to move survey teams to reconnoitre the site. Tracked vehicles to damaging for the peat!! . Just what is that carbon footprint  Laughableit was not so sad!How something you and Mark Ryan Smith may understand. The very latest scientic information on controlling climate change “Tree planting #has mind-blowing potential# to tackle climate crisis” , now would not planting a tree be a more rational action for these children  That would be the sensible, intelligent and educated option. PS, could someone please inform the SIC SNP SCT and Green Lunatics!No one here has denied climate change Brian Smith. Just a discussion on the merits or otherwise of the School children#s strike. Our youngsters being encouraged to jump on the #Greta Thunberg# bandwagon. There you really do have a sacricial lamb to the European Green lunatics but that is another really sad story!You mustcarefully, Mr T.Well, Brian, I have never denied Climate change. I just dispute the best way to combat it.Deft footwork here from Ian. His, and his hero Farage’s position # not that he cares to own up to it # is not that there is no climate change. Obviously the climate changes over time. What he is conveniently avoiding are the questions around cause and appropriate response.Please do not make up speculative little stories porkies Peter. Farage is not my hero, however, I find him infinitely preferable to Corbyn and Salmond, however, here is not the place to digress further.Will Hell freeze over before Ian tells us what he presumes the protestors are ignorant of  Answering the question he posed Brian is not too mammoth a task for him surely. I suspect he is trying to dodge it for a reason.Read and weep Peter. If your intellect stretches that far. !! In the most simple of Science, It is set out below. The protestors are ignorant of the very most basic understanding of carbon capture and the prevention of climate change. Trees!! Only the very most utterly stupid, like yourself cannot see the wood for them!It is not clear the protest had a position on biomass, however Ian has firmly stated the need for those taking any position to be able to answer #how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age #Ian has thus far excitedly cited three articles, none of which reference any ice age. The first: #Tree planting ‘has mind-blowing potential’ to tackle climate crisis#, has Professor Crowther emphasising #it remains vital to reverse the current trends of rising greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and forest destruction, and bring them down to zero# this is needed to stop the climate crisis becoming even worse and because the forest restoration envisaged would take - years to have its full effect##Reafforestation, necessary as it is, isn#t no silver bullet, nor a speedy enough solution, though many on the protest would likely love to plant some trees.The second and third articles focus on biomass, which is contested.To help Ian make his point, does he mean the Cryogenian, the second last ice age or the Little Ice Age  Again, other than to spread scorn and belittle, what is Ian#s actual point Sorrymy point is beyond you Peter. My question # “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ”That would require a thesis at post-graduate level to answer. Hardly space here! My point was that these children simple to not have the science to have a considered and informed opinion based on knowledge. The science is actually simple, I suggest you look it up and read it.Lest anyone thinking of studying the sciences, physical or social, be put off, Ian’s approach to advancing a scientic argument is far from typical. Thomas Kuhn made a very useful contribution by proposing that as a science advances some innaccurate claims will inevitably be made and indeed built on, but will later be corrected as sufficient contrary evidence emerges. Hawkins himself corrected some of his own foundational work. A settled consensus generally emerges over time through reasonable and reasoned dialogue and argument in which peer reviewed sources, research evidence and the thinking they provoke are made apparent.This is perhaps one reason why the Shetland Times asks contributors to observe normal standards of decency and tolerance for the opinions of others. It helps to bring forth the truth.It is, however, more than unusual for anyone taking themselves seriously to make a strong central scientic claim then refuse to back it up, clary it’s meaning or intent# unless of course Ian is proposing rhetoric, cant and distracting insult are now sciences, in which case top marks are due to the happy fellow.What a load of pretentious twaddle. You have outdone yourself here Peter. The word Science simply means knowledge, no more no less. It is just as simple as that.Whilst he remains intent on running away from clarying and substantiating his own point, here is an easier question for Ian: Why does he call Greens lunatics  There must be some point of disagreement between him and them, in his own head at least.That would be self-evident Peter. Read up the following. Bio-Fuels, palm oil plantation. Diesel fuel promotions, particulates. Germany non-nuclearpolicy,brown coal burning. Shetland exports clean gas imports polluting wood chip. Tree planting reverses CO build up, wood chip more polluting than coal burning and deforests huge areas. The EU % of renewable, Biomass .Greenies promote non-nuclear. more people killed in wind farm accidents in Uk than nuclear ever has. All the above would indicate a somewhat lunatic approach from the Greens. Now we have, using helicopters to survey Viking Energy sites as peat too unstable for tracked vehicles to reach, unbelievable!!! I hate to say the cult of #Greta Thunberg#,depression, eating disorders, and anxiety attacks,Asperger’s syndrome, high-ing autism, and OCD. She also suffers from selective mutism and self-harm. The sacricial lamb of the Greens across Europe. The inspiration behind the school strikes!!!!! Nowthat#s not lunatic, what is Ian’s position on global warming is either well grounded or is, well, hot air. He knows how this goes. Either he has a reputable theorist publishing an article in a reputable journal, or even a weblink to a news story referencing such, or he doesn’t. Because some vested interests have bought and paid for their own pet scientiststhere may be dferent opinions regarding whatever his as yet unclear point was with his unnamed and undated second ice age. If he really wants to be taken seriously he should put up or# consider his alternative.C’mon Ian, one reference to one reputable scientist backing up whatever it is you so obviously don’t want to say. You know you can do it.I am would be intrigued to opinions relating to climate change due to agriculture and what would be the answer to providing food but reducing or stopping climate change due to agriculture. I may be wrong but I believe agriculture produces  times more greenhouse gases than all of transportation put together, but this has, conveniently, been avoided by the media and scientic community. There is a terrible dilemma between producing food to this of attempting to reduce green houses gases and the progressive climate change taking place Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough and we are confused.One minute providing grants to preserve Shetland#s peat carbon store, and the next proposing digging acres of it up, releasing all that carbon, to build Viking.Giving out paper straws in McDonalds with juice in a plastic cup .I mind askingabout planting trees on my croft. They said #oh we dont want these clumps of trees any more, not our landscape#, when I had always thought tree planting was good.Such a mixed message. Why dont we have a green rating system like we have for our washing machines. You could rate biomass, nuclear, windfarms from construction to operation in terms of green to red, so we would know where we are in the scale with our choices.Any way, still have a patch of high hill that would be great for a mini woodsI referenced Greta with a very heavy heart, a truly exploited child whose background would fire concern with any child specialist in the UK, psychologist or Social worker.Sorry, Johan, who isn#t #taking climate change seriously# Theresa May and the Tories are taking it very seriously, indeed, passing Mrs May#s unilateral # net zero# plan into law. The Treasury says it will cost over £ trillion , enough to fund the salaries of , nurses for  years.Too little for Greta Thunberg and her #Extinction Rebellion pals, apparently.This will find its way on to consumers# electricity bills, including those in fuel poverty, a clear majority of homes in Shetland #  percent, before the recent price hikes.The Shetland Labour Party that I grew up with was concerned with alleviating poverty, not creating it. They were not interested inwinning #Green Blue Peter Badges# for futile, bourgeois bagatelles like#tackling climate change#, without any hope of success.Britain, far less, Shetland, can achieve nothing alone.The only candidate to exhibit concern for Shetland#s poor is Ian Scott.Im confused. You state that the Tories are proposing  net zero and then you say Labour creating poverty.I am very seriously concerned about fuel poverty everywhere and especially in Shetland. I hope that there are no price hikes in our fuel bills, this is something we need to resist, and I also hope more help is forthcoming for retrofitting better heating systems and more insulation to improve housing quality.Please do not try to tell me what I believe.Johan, I don’t recall you ever mentioning fuel poverty before. Do you support or oppose “ net zero”, which was done in knee-jerk response to the campaigns of Greta Thunberg and her pals “Extinction Rebellion” Only, you have been supporting Ms Thunberg’s “climate emergency” campaign at local level, have you not Mrs May’s , nurses salaries for  years isn’t “emergency” enough for them, they want more.You can huff and puff as much as you like, the cost will find its way to the fuel poor, increasing their number.I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Greta Thunberg AND the fuel poor, whom you have now mentioned for the first time.Mr Scott has been arguing for Shetland’s poor since long before he became a councillor.No John I have not been supporting Greta#s campaign locally and yes I have mentioned fuel poverty before and I think I can support greener politics and the poor. It is an important point tho, how we are going to pay for it all. I heard somewhere the Tories are going to pay for it from the proceeds of G.Johan, I responded to your comment above that Greta Thunberg is right .You have also defended the Shetland schools strike “climate emergency” demonstration in this self, same thread.I quote: “Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough#..etc..”That sounds awful like you think Mrs May committing  years’ worth of , nurses salaries isn’t “taking climate change seriously enough” If you are now saying that you do not support Greta Thunberg and do wish to tackle Shetland’s lamentable fuel poverty, will you be making a clear, prominent statement to that effect in your campaign literature Including your and Shetland Labour’s proposals for solving the fuel poverty The twisting of my words is really uncalled for, and completely ignoring the main point of my post which is that we need a green rating system to stop you all arguing about what is green and what is not # but then you enjoy the fight too much and would poo poo any system anyway I suppose.Strange move of support from Wir Shetland to Ian Scott  You#re scraping the barrel, now, Johan, getting personal. After your Up Helly-Aa performance, your comment about #enjoying the fight# is, frankly,a bit rich.It appears you are not prepared to make the campaign commitment I suggested. That#s ok.I#m not supporting anyone yet as I haven#t heard from all the candidates. I merely pointed out that Mr Scott is the only one so far to have shown any real concern for Shetland#s poor. He needs to say more about that. Under the present arrangements #climate emergency# will dump on the fuel poor. They have votes, too, of course # more than  percent of the electorate.Good luck with your campaign.Yes, Ian can answer a question when he chooses to. And there is sense in some of what he says. Wind farms on peat, for example, happen when commercial interests chase subsidies, so it is up to governments to get the correct approach. Not all that blame goes at the Green’s door, and they are either correct to claim there is a climate emergency or they are not.On the climate emergency Ian’s thoughts can only be guessed at. They have something to do with an ice-age, which is appropriate as progress towards getting him to answer his own question is, as yet, glacial.A big problem inside these debates stems from some people get beguiled by fake scientic claims. This is why genuine people making genuine scientic claims are generally happy to back them up by referencing the work of the real scientists involved. This offers folk who may or may not be less expert than Dr. Ian Tinklersome protection from charlatans with an axe to grind. Again,Ian is serious, rather than just being a contraryIan, he will reveal his ice-age source s. Or would doing so would reveal his actual movitation  C’mon Ian, youknowyouwantto.I actually sent them to the Times. They failed to print them as perhaps regarded as irrelevant pertaining to the school strike. I will do so again so Peter can untwist his knickers.The book you really should read, Mr T., is The Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace Wells. Things are far more precarious than you think.Having read these pages for a long time Peter, it should be apparent by now that Ian is a dental surgeon by training and therefore qualies for Dr status.No need to have a PhDor any other bits of paper !Ok, well thanks to Ian, andthe Times did withhold the links as irrelevant to the school strike they maybe had a point. It was Ian that insisted to Brian Smith way back when that this issue was relevant, for whatever reason.I#m still not clear what Ian draws from these articles though, or why anyone would have to have this knowledge to take a view on the current level of threat, but I get that global warming isn#t about to lead to another ice age. I don#t recall the protest saying it would# It#s a welcome change to have Ian express himself without resort to petty insult though. Long may that continue. On his earlier point on science, however, I#m not sure most scientists would agree science means knowledge only, as Ian proposed, without including the search for it by using scientic methods.But here is the big unanswered question # whatever it is Ian take from these links # does he, or does he not, think we are facing a climate crisis  If we are then surely the kids are right to be concerned, especially as some government sponsored action on climate change is potentially green-wash.Slight problem with the colour test Johan.About % of men have problems when distinguishingbetween red and green .

Herbinson had survived the slaughter of the first day on the Somme where he had performed gallantly under fire and subsequently moved with the remainder of the thDivision to the British sector in Belgium. The th RIR Association were on their annual pilgrimage to the WW battlefields, taking part in the July  ceremonies on the Somme before visiting other sites. Editor’s note: Robert Herbinson was born at Clonavon, Ballymena and is buried at Ration Farm Cemetery Annexe, Ploegsteert, Belgium and commemorated in Wellington Street Presbyterian Church. Ballymena Observer, September ,  - Miss Herbinson,  Hill Street, Ballymena, has been informed that her brother, Sergeant R. Herbison th Royal Irish Rleswas killed in action on Sunday, August th. Sergeant Herbinson was, prior to joining the colours, an employee in the Phoenix Weaving Factory, Ballymena.He was a member of the Ulster Volunteer Force and of Ballykeel LOL . His brother, Lance Corporal James Herbinson, Royal Irish Fusiliers, is serving at the front. A letter received from the Rev. A. Gibson, Chaplain to the Central Antrims, states that Sgt. Herbinson was killed while out on duty in no-mans land. He states:He was a most excellent soldier and a very good NCO and the regiment will miss him very much. He had done very fine work when the battalion went into action on st July and I have heard from his officers how nobly he did his duty that day. He was buried in a little cemetery near the firing line.Lt. W.B. Stuartwrote: Dear Miss Herbinson, I cannot tell you with what regret it is hat I am writing to tell you of the death of your brother. He was killed by a bullet passing through his brain so that I am glad to say that he suffered absolutely no pain. I have known your brother personally for nearly two years and I feel that I have lost a real friend as well as an excellent sergeant. I have never met anyone whom I trusted more than your brother. He was absolutely fearless and could always be depended upon to do anything.“Perhaps you have heard that he was recommended for bravery at the battle of the Somme, when, after three attempts had been made, he collected eight men of his platoon and was going to make another attack, when, luckily, he was stopped as the chance was hopeless. I was present at the funeral and he has been laid in a British cemetery just behind the firing line so there will be no dficulty in locating the grave after the war.

If you or a young person you know is faced with the habitual struggle to fill those days with excitement, then look no further than the New Lodge Art’s packed programme of summer events.The inimitable arts group will once again host a range of activities in the coming weeks including drama, sports, comedy, music and dance. The programme will culminate in the jam-packed Festival of Fun in Lepper Street on August  and there will be no shortage of events and activities along the way, such as a local production of Disney’s High School Musical.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Anne Delaney, Arts Programme andOperations Manager at New Lodge Arts, said: “For a lot of the young people that we work with they may not be going on summer holidays, or they may not be getting out of the area. These types of activities are ersionary activities for them to take part in.“It brings young people from ious communities across North Belfast together. We work with kids from the Lower Shankill right up to Rathcoole. It’s about the personal and social development of young people, but also the good relations is really important in the work that we’re doing. It also provides ersionary activities around the time of unrest related to the internment bonfires. We see these projects as bringing a positive outlook to these areas during these times.”She continued: “We have our festival of fun event, which is on the th of August on Lepper Street. It’s our headline event, so it will be full of comedy, street theatre, music, dance, amusements, a roller disco – there is loads happening that day. Over the last few years there has been a lot of negativity around the bonfire so we’re working with Féile on this event as part of their wider Belfast ersionary programme.“It’s a good opportunity for young people to meet new friends, it gives them something outside of their school le and it helps to improve confidence and self-esteem. It’s brilliant for the young people themselves, but also then you see parents coming along who are so proud of what their child has achieved. I think bringing the likes of High School Musical to the Mac, which is one of Belfast’s best theatres, is brilliant. It’s a great opportunity for young people to be involved. It’s on our doorstep and a lot of young people might not have the chance to use it. Tickets are £, so they’re affordable for local families – no other tickets at the Mac are that price. We really want to encourage people to come and support their local young people.”"},{"url":null,"title":"more chinese students apply to british universities than northern irish","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Derry City area over the next few weeks.Large brown wheelie bins are being delivered to domestic properties within test scheme areas for people to dispose of items including grass cuttings, weeds, flowers, twigs, cold ashes and small amounts of kitchen roll and animal waste.Collections will take place fortnightly along with either black or blue collections depending on the area.Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Councillor Michaela Boyle, welcomed the scheme: “More and more people in our District are recycling and our Council area now boasts one of the highest recycling rates in the North,” she said.“The introduction of new garden waste collections are very welcome, particularly during the summer season when people are generating more green waste.“Living in a more eco-friendly way by embracing initiatives like recycling is so important to help build a more sustainable region and to protect our environment for future generations.”Council’s Waste Services Manager Nicola McCool added: “Recycling garden waste is good for our environment as, like food waste, it is turned into compost which we use in our local cemeteries, roundabouts and parks.“It will also help reduce the amount of material we are sending to landfill which is costly to ratepayers and harmful to our atmosphere.“We have ambitious targets to make our region more sustainable by making it easier for people to reduce the amount they waste and helping them recycle more.“If this pilot scheme is successful, we would hope to roll this service out to more households in the future.”Council’s recycling team will carry out follow-up door-to-door engagement with people who are part of the garden waste rollout offering advice and support on how to recycle correctly.Information is also

The Inquest hearings took place over a twelve-day period last year.The British Army have claimed for the last  years, that Mr Bradley a -year-old IRA member, was armed when they opened fire on him close to the Bishop’s Field area of Creggan. This claim has consistently denied by the Bradley family over the decades.Danny Bradley, brother of the deceased man told the Derry News: “At the end of the day this is good news. It has taken  years and caused a lot of hurt for so long.“I am hoping that the findings will come out the way that we want it and we will be travelling together as family to Belfast next month to hear the outcome.“It destroyed our family, but I had to get the answer about what happened and I am certainly looking forward to that. After  years I will be glad to put it to bed because it has been a struggle.Seamus Quigley, solicitor for the family told the Derry News: “We share the relief of the Bradley family that after  years the findings of the case are now finally in sight.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshIn April this year the Public Prosecution Serviceannounced that it would proceed with charging a former British soldier with the murder of a teenage boy also killed on the morning of Operation Motorman.-year-old Daniel Hegarty was shot in the head on the morning of July , . His cousin Christopher Hegarty was also struck in the head by a round fired by the same soldier but survived the shooting. Soldier B, the man responsible for both incidents will also face a charge of wounding with intent in relation to Christopher Hegarty.The decision to prosecute the soldier represented the reversal of a decision taken in  not to prefer charges against the former British serviceman. That decision was however overturned after a Divisional Court ruling last year.Previous decisions not to prosecute in the Hegarty case were taken in  after the original Inquest and again in  following a review of the case by the former Historical Enquiries Team.Announcing the decision in relation to the Hegarty case, Director of the PPS Stephen Herron said: “I have given careful consideration to all of the available evidence. This has included material obtained in the course of the initial investigation by a later investigation carried out by the Historical Enquiries Team material generated by Inquest proceedings and a number of forensic reports-the most recent of which was provided after the Court ruling in .“I have concluded that the evidence which can be presented at court is sufficient to provide a reasonable prospect of conviction and the Evidential Test for Prosecution is met.”Nine people also died in Claudy on July ,  as three car bombs tore through the heart of the County Derry village.CAPTION: -year-old Seamus Bradley who was killed by the British Army on July , . "},{"url":null,"title":"welshpool hand cyclist takes land s end john o groats charity","story":"Andrew Paddison from Welshpool and his Lands End to John OGroats hand bike chaltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtrity ride..Picture bltspan classtruncate-full-screengty Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Theres nothing stopping me from doing anything: Welshpool man to hand cycleof UKAndrew Paddison from Welshpool and his Lands End to John OGroats hand bike chaltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtrity ride..Picture bltspan classtruncate-full-screengty Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Theres nothing stopping me from doing anything: Welshpool man to hand cycleof UKAndrew Paddison from Welshpool and his Lands End to John OGroats hand bike chaltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtrity ride..Picture bltspan classtruncate-full-screengty Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Theres nothing stopping me from doing anything: Welshpool man to hand cycleof UKAndrew Paddison from Welshpool and his Lands End to John OGroats hand bike chaltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtrity ride..Picture bltspan classtruncate-full-screengty Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Theres nothing stopping me from doing anything: Welshpool man to hand cycleof UKAndrew Paddison from Welshpool and his Lands End to John OGroats hand bike chaltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtrity ride..Picture bltspan classtruncate-full-screengty Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"last call hunt champions businesses powys","story":"Powys Business Awards Launch Event  at County Hall, Llandrindod Wells last Tltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtuesday th June ltspan classtruncate-full-screengt..Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Last chance to enter county’s premier business awardsPowys Business Awards Launch Event  at County Hall, Llandrindod Wells last Tltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtuesday th June ltspan classtruncate-full-screengt..Pictured is Cllr Rosemarie Harris .Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Last chance to enter county’s premier business awardsPowys Business Awards Launch Event  at County Hall, Llandrindod Wells last Tltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtuesday th June ltspan classtruncate-full-screengt..Pictured front left to right, Cllr Martin WealeCeri StephensBeverley Blt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Last chance to enter county’s premier business awardsPowys Business Awards Launch Event  at County Hall, Llandrindod Wells last Tltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtuesday th June ltspan classtruncate-full-screengt..Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Last chance to enter county’s premier business awardsBiz awards logo\" Last chance to enter county’s premier business awardsITVrsquos Coast  Country TV presenter Andrew Price will be presenting thiltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgts yearrsquos Powysltspan classtruncate-full-screengt Business Awards.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":"http://www.countytimes.co.uk/ource srcset=/resources/images/10119000.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"uknewsnational","story":"Get involved with the news in your community Send your stories and photos now  d  document.getElementsByClassName.style.display  blockLoading...Most popular         ,Promoted stories       Loading...Most popular Contact UsNewslettersNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There needs to be swt action as an enhanced facility could alleviate the problem people are currently facing.A Department for Infrastructure spokesman said the current Driver and Vehicle test centre network was built around  years ago.ldquoMuch has been done to maintain and modernise the test centres in that time, particularly to meet the growing demand for vehicle tests. However, present and future legislative requirements, coupled with increasing and changing demands for testing services, mean that the current network is no longer sustainable, he said.ldquoAs such, we have been reviewing the network with a view to determining the most appropriate network of test centres to meet our future needs. To date, with the exception of a new test centre being built at Hydebank in Belfast, no decisions have been taken on the size of any other specic test centres within a future network.The spokesman said the new test centre at Hydebank and will provide additional testing capacity for the Greater Belfast area.He added: ldquoOur plans for a new network are continuing to be progressed, specically in terms of the design for the new test centres and the acquisition of land.ldquoHowever, in the absence of the NI Executive there is currently no means to progress proposals beyond the construction of the new test centre at Hydebank..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Carryduff man honoured with major accolade  ","story":"A CARRYDUFF country sports enthusiast has been honoured with a major award.John Leighton, who is the president of the Ulster Gundog League, has been presented with The Great Game Fairs of Ireland letime achievement award.The awards, made each year at the Irish Game Fair at Fine Food Festival held at Shanes Castle, Antrim, are designed to recognise and reward outstanding iniduals who devote themselves to nurturing rural heritage.Announcing Johnrsquos award, Albert Titterington, managing director of The Great Game Fairs of Ireland, said: ldquoIt is an absolute pleasure each year to have the opportunity publicly to recognise some of the outstanding members of the game show family who commit their time, talents and enthusiasm to preserving rural traditions and promoting country sports.ldquoThese people work tirelessly behind the scenes and without any thought of reward mdash and John epitomises that blend of modesty and high achievement.ldquoOver the years John has enjoyed considerable sporting success with the dogs he trains and we have been proud to have enjoyed his support and insight as he served as spaniels directorrsquo with our fairs, shaping competitions and ensuring top quality entries.Mr Titterington said Mr Leightonrsquos  years of gundog competition experience commanded ldquoinstant respect in gundog circles and described him as a ldquopopular figure across this island and beyond..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Cormac delivers at Irish Open  ","story":"ARDGLASS golfer Cormac Sharvin has just had the biggest week of his le.The  year-old was the top Irish finisher at the Dubai Duty Free Irish Open at Lahinch.He finished joint th place on nine-under par to earn the biggest payday of his le, pocketing a cheque for euro,.It was almost three times the amount he has earned on the European Challenge Tour so far this season.Unfortunately, he missed out on securing a dream spot at next weekrsquos Open Championship at Portrush.After signing off with a final round  on Sunday he said: ldquoI felt I didnrsquot play much dferent from the first three days.

These are two key elements of Delamontrsquos future success.Cllr Walker said he hopes that the public will be given time to view the content of the master plan when it is completed and that money to provide a raft of new facilities can be secured to allow work to potentially start next year.ldquoThe Education Authority stuck to its promise to invest in Delamont and I hope that the local authority will honour its commitment and start planning to provide more facilities at the country park which offers huge development potential, he said.ldquoWhile already a signicant tourism attraction, there are not that many facilities apart from a childrenrsquos playground, stunning walks and the hugely popular Steamerrsquos cafe and miniature railway.ldquoWhile I am not advocating that the beauty of the area is spoiled in any way, there are hundreds of acres of space which could be used to boost the parkrsquos tourism offering.Cllr Walker said the availability of finance to enhance the park is critical to its future development, providing new attractions and creating a boost for nearby businesses in Killyleagh.He added: ldquoThe eagerly-awaited master plan is the key to unlocking Delamontrsquos future development and can also pave the way for much-needed investment.

If Fascism hadnrsquot been beaten we would be living in a very dferent world today. ldquoWe would be living in fear of a regime which would not tolerate any descent. We are very lucky and should be thankful to those veterans who risked all and gave their tomorrow for our today.Cllr Hanna said the districtrsquos surviving veterans were small in number and well into their nineties, and that society owed a debt to them for their part in the battle to secure the freedom people enjoy today.He said he included the Merchant Navy in his proposal because many risked their lives on merchant ships to ferry supplies which helped win the war.ldquoThis was a cruel war where many lost their lives and I really hope we never have to face anything like this again. Those from Northern Ireland who fought and served during World War Two came from all sections of the community.ldquoBefore it is too late, I believe this council should acknowledge what these brave people did for us all by presenting surviving veterans with a silver poppy at a cross community service in November, said Cllr Hanna.He added: ldquoI hope that the council will support this motion as a mark of respect for the generation which has given us freedoms we take for granted.The SDLPrsquos Declan McAteer said he was ldquosomewhat dubious about the suggestion for the council ldquoto go out on a limb and procure silver poppy medals.ldquoI fully respect the sentiment of those wishing to identy with what is essentially a British symbol which wonrsquot by endorsed by all Irish men or women. The poppy, for better or worse, is associated with all conflicts that Britain was involved in from the First World War right through.ldquoI would say that perhaps thatwe do anything around this we take a lead from the British Legion in Ireland which decided on a shamrock poppy which has been worn by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.Cllr McAteer proposed that the issue be referred to the local authorityrsquos Good Relations Forum, with Sinn Feinrsquos Mickey Ruane in agreement.Cllr Ruane said he was respectful of the motion Cllr Hanna and his party had tabled, suggesting the Good Relations Forum was the ldquoideal committee to send the issue to.He added: We need to look at this issue and decide what event we are going to have and come to a respectful decision.At the debate conclusion, Cllr Hanna reaffirmed he had no issue referring his proposal for further debate, highlighting the need for the matter to be dealt with quickly.He also said he had no dficulty with awarding veterans a

problems within the districtrsquos planning department have been laid bare in a Newry, Mourne and Down Council report which has been made public.The local authority mdash which is responsible for district planners mdash has revealed in its annual audit committee report that the current number of live planning applications in the system is just over ,.The confirmation comes after local politicians recently pointed to what they described as ldquoserious problems at council management level for not taking the planning backlog seriously enough.Politicians have expressed concern that planners are not responding to their telephone calls and emails, with people who lodge applications also concerned that they are not getting any information from officials.Elected representatives say while all the fault does not rest with planners, they are firmly of the view that there are simply not enough staff to deal with the huge volume of work.Concern has also been expressed that the planning department is having problems retaining staff to work in a department that receives the second highest number of applications across the Provincersquos  councils.Politicians say there is a need to ensure the planning department is running properly which the council explains in the new report is exactly what it aims to do.A major review of planning has already been undertaken and amendments made to the so-called scheme of delegation which is a set of rules which determines whether a planning application will be decided by the local authorityrsquos Planning Committee or planning officers.A critical look has also been taken at staffing structures in tandem with the arearsquos chief planner, with council officials conceding that while there are issues with staff turnover, positions are filled as quickly as possible.In addition, the council has admitted there is a communication issue within the planning department with the change that needs to happen something that cannot be achieved overnight.Signicantly, the new council report warns that failure to deliver timely planning decisions is a ldquorisk within the corporate risk register, with the number of live planning applications increasing, not decreasing, with the figure standing at , at the end of May.The report says an internal audit of the planningrevealed that there are a number of key controls absent from the local authorityrsquos planning system, in particular, its performance against legislative targets, the completeness and validation of documentation supporting applications and enforcement actions.The audit also points to a lack of clarity in respect of key performance indicators within the planning department and the lack of non-compliance by the local authority with its own planning and enforcement procedures.The report says senior council management is considering ways forward to ensure compliance with policy and legislative targets, while maintaining the number of live cases to an acceptable level.Council officials say that over the coming months they intend to take steps to address the ious issues within the planning department to further enhance governance arrangements and are satisfied that these steps will address the need for improvements..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Plans for new

I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nstreet1.jpg","title":"belfasts north street arcade to be redeveloped","story":"Posted on Tuesday  June  by John Mulgrew A former Belfast shopping arcade left derelict after being gutted in a blaze more than a decade ago could be brought back to le amid fresh development plans.

It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/droad_1.jpg","title":"major new apartment building planned for dublin road","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew The Dublin Road in Belfast A new serviced apartment building could be developed along Belfast’s so-called ‘Golden Mile’ on the Dublin Road, it can be revealed.

The paper, which examines the negative impact of a ‘no deal’ EU exit, warns the “Northern Ireland Civil Service’s assessment remains that a ‘no deal’ would have a profound and long-lasting impact on NI’s economy and society”. Among its key points, it says a ‘no deal’ “could lead to a sharp increase in unemployment, with at least , jobs at risk, based on EU export exposure”. “The impact of EU tarfs could reduce NI’s exports to Ireland by % and the inclusion of non-tarf barriers could see a decline of %,” it says. Once again, it raises serious concerns over the agri-sector in particular, meat in particular, and beef especially, in regards to “increased vulnerability to low cost non-EU imports in the GB or NI market”.
