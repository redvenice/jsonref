He lost his children, his wife, and his international standing after Sir Andrew McFarlane, president of the Family Division, found he had conducted a ‘campaign of fear and intimidation’ against Princess Haya, forcing her to flee to London with their two children last April.

She and Shamsa are still captive in Dubai.Sir Andrew said the sheikh’s actions, on balance of probabilities, ran ‘contrary to the criminal law of England and Wales, international law and internationally accepted human rights norms’. The sheikh, who did not attend court, denies any wrongdoing.

This is a theoretical method of transmission – poor sanitation caused many SARS infections – but there is no evidence yet that Covid-19 has been passed on like this.HOW DOES IT MAKE US ILL?By forcing the lung cells of the infected person to replicate its RNA, Covid-19 disrupts normal respiratory functioning. This includes the constant waving motion of cilia: tiny hair-like projections in the lungs which sweep out mucus and dirt or particles that have been breathed in from the air around us.With this vital defence mechanism impaired, the lungs are more vulnerable to potentially deadly infections like pneumonia.We know that our immune systems are strongest when we are younger, so it is not surprising that children appear to be the least vulnerable to developing the worst symptoms of coronavirus.The opposite is true of elderly people, especially if their lung function is already compromised – for example, by life-long smoking or conditions like COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).       In people of all ages, the symptoms can be worsened when the body’s immune system goes into overdrive in its response to infection. White blood cells dispatched to fight the virus and reduce the inflammation in the lungs can damage healthy cells in the process.The fever experienced by many victims is another immune response, with the body raising its internal temperature to a level at which the virus can no longer operate.The majority of people infected with Covid-19 will experience symptoms so mild that they will not even know that they have had the disease.WHAT IS THE VIRUS’S ‘AGGRESSIVE’ STRAIN?Viruses mutate all the time and what the Chinese scientists have identified is a minor variation (known as L-type) to the existing Covid-19 (S-type) rather than a new and insidious new virus.The word ‘aggressive’ is being used to describe it but the facts are less alarming. The S-type which kicked off the epidemic in China appears to be milder and less infectious L-type seems to be more infectious – it currently accounts for 70 per cent of cases – but does not appear to be causing symptoms that are any worse.Bear in mind that new strains of influenza are evolving constantly. That is why our annual flu jabs contain two or three different vaccines which change year on year.Any future vaccine against Covid-19 will similarly take account of the different strains out there.WILL IT DIE DOWN OVER THE SUMMER?Respiratory infections are certainly more common in winter. There is no simple explanation for this, but one theory is that viruses can survive longer in colder weather when there is less UV radiation (which can kill microbes) from sunlight bearing down on the hard surfaces on which they linger.Or it may be that people get together in confined spaces more often in winter.Whatever the explanation, there is no way of knowing what warmer weather will bring for the coronavirus. During the 2009 swine flu pandemic, UK cases peaked in July.CAN YOU COMPLETELY PROTECT YOURSELF?Short of wearing a spacesuit, or stopping the people around you from breathing, the answer is no.But public health control measures proved highly effective in eradicating SARS in 20022003.Even if we are not completely rid of Covid-19, it may eventually evolve into different strains of the common cold – a recurring winter infection which many of us build immunity to, having caught it once.That said, there is no room for complacency. And if we can draw anything positive from the spread of Covid-19, it’s as a reminder that we cannot skimp on funding if science is to keep pace with the ever-evolving threats to our health both now and in the future. "},{"url":null,"title":"PLATELLS PEOPLE Boycotting Amber Rudd Oxford University just makes red","story":"Share this article That does not include their allowances for housing, gold-plated final-salary pensions and expenses.The armed forces, teachers, prison staff and police officers all got less than that, without the perks.

We had a town hall meeting with our CEO and our publisher. After we were able to raise our questions with them in a public forum, we grabbed our things and walked out.”The employee did not think the company would change course but on Friday, it did.Hachette “will return all rights to the author”, its statement said.“The decision to cancel Mr Allen’s book was a difficult one. At HBG we take our relationships with authors very seriously, and do not cancel books lightly. We have published and will continue to publish many challenging books.Hachette said it was committed to “making sure every day in our work that different voices and conflicting points of views can be heard” but also “offering a stimulating, supportive and open work environment for all our staff”.Allen, 84, denies the accusations by his daughter Dylan Farrow, which were the subject of two investigations. The director was never charged.Allen rose to fame as a stand-up comedian and comic writer and has made films for more than 50 years. He reportedly came close to publishing a memoir in 2003, reaching a deal with Penguin before changing his mind. Hachette said it made its deal with Allen last year.Hachette published Ronan Farrow’s Catch and Kill, an account of his work on #MeToo stories including the case against the Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, who was convicted of rape in New York last month.In a statement in response to news of his father’s deal, Farrow said he was “disappointed” his publisher had “concealed the decision from me and its own employees while we were working on Catch and Kill – a book about how powerful men, including Woody Allen, avoid accountability for sexual abuse”.This year, Macmillan will publish a debut novel by Dylan Farrow.In her own statement on the decision to publish her father’s memoir, she said it was “deeply upsetting to me personally and an utter betrayal of my brother whose brave reporting, capitalised on by Hachette, gave voice to numerous survivors of sexual assault by powerful men.”On Friday, Hachette concluded: “Over the past few days, HBG leadership had extensive conversations with our staff and others.“After listening, we came to the conclusion that moving forward with publication would not be feasible for HBG.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/264eadc1e29b55f13aad802aa8ce2099cf8faa1c/0_100_2732_1639/master/2732.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2968b98a95b716625ba2a49e1cc038ff","title":"bong joon ho parasite graphic novel","story":"By publishing the storyboards of Parasite in book form, director Bong Joon-ho continues to show how stories break down barriersNot long ago I scraped together all the coins I had and went into Gosh!, a comic book store in Soho, London, so that I could buy a copy of Black Hole by Charles Burns.

It’s amazing how much emotion can be conveyed in those little panels – which is perhaps why some of them have been so successfully turned into movies (think Ghost World by Daniel Clowes and Watchmen by Alan Moore).Imagine my extreme delight when I saw that Bong Joon-ho, director of Oscar-winning Parasite, will be flip-reversing this and publishing the storyboards of Parasite as a graphic novel. Before shooting the movie, Bong drew every scene as he saw it in his mind. This translates to a 304-page retelling of what we’ve already seen on the screen. As someone who loves graphic novels, I’m thrilled. As someone who doesn’t know how to plan, I’m inspired. Here’s to you, Bong Joon-ho, a director who keeps reminding the west that story alone, and the various ways of telling it, can break down barriers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5b3eaede683fb828167e8ac4c472a377e8ad682/0_265_3360_2016/master/3360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3cf8412e6c2849132fdf0f8ec4ca2431","title":"shock of new novelists stories europe","story":"From a Dutch bestseller about childhood loss to a passionate lesbian romance in France, a refugee’s journey from Iraq and the dark side of Sweden ... six novelists telling fresh stories about EuropeWhen Marieke Lucas Rijneveld was three years old, Rijneveld’s 12-year-old brother was knocked over and killed by a bus as he walked to school from the family farm. Rijneveld’s response to this early confrontation with the unthinkable was not to draw a veil over it, but to build two books around it. “I think it’s unfortunate for a family to have a writer born into it,” says the 28-year-old author, serenely.In the devoutly religious rural community among which the Rijneveld family still live, the exposure was sudden and extreme. When Calf’s Caul, a poetry collection, was published in 2015, its young author was heralded in the national media as a new star of Dutch literature. More challenging still for the family was the novel that arrived three years later, De avond is ongemak, which appears in English this week as The Discomfort of Evening (Faber, translated by Michelle Hutchison), and has just been longlisted for the International Booker prize. “All the shopkeepers and the hairdresser were talking about it, but my family are too frightened to read it,” says Rijneveld, who uses the pronouns theythem.In The Discomfort of Evening, Matthies dies in a skating accident, leaving his 10-year-old sister Jas fantasising about how to prevent the family from being destroyed in the aftermath. She keeps two toads in a box under her bed, thinking that if they can be persuaded to mate, her parents might too, and everything will be all right again. Meanwhile, left to cope with the emotional turbulence of adolescence without adult support, she plays games with her surviving brother and sister that become increasingly wild and dangerous.The novel is set over the two years in Jas’s life when hormones corral children into adult sexual identities. Rijneveld resists such categorisation, self‑describing not as trans but as “in between”. “As a small child I felt I was a boy, I dressed like a boy and behaved like a boy, but children at that age are still neutral in their gender. In adolescence, when the separation became clear, I dressed like a girl and became a girl, then at 20 I went back to the boy I was at primary school.” Their middle name, Lucas, comes from an imaginary boyfriend they had as a young child. Elegantly dressed in trademark suit and braces, Rijneveld’s composure only breaks when they struggle to remember the name of the film star they aspire to be. It finally emerges in a burst of giggles: “Timothée Chalamet, star of Call Me by Your Name – I want to be a beautiful boy.”They have not yet decided whether to take hormone treatment, so when they read their work publicly it is in an unbroken voice, radiating an androgynous charm that has made them one of the poetry circuit’s rare breakout stars. “What a sweetheart,” wrote a commenter in response to a Dutch TV chatshow on the environment, in which Rijneveld signed up to the David Attenborough fan club, urged listeners to heed his warnings about the climate emergency and reported that they had never flown in a plane.Only their hands betray their other life as a one-day-a-week dairy farmer, with scrubbed nails that are bitten to the quick. “Farming keeps me grounded. The cows are my best friends I like cleaning out the stables and shovelling the shit.”This unglamorous side of farming slops through both the novel and the poems. Jas’s mother doses her children with worm medicine and slathers them with udder ointment to protect against the cold. One of the poems in Calf’s Caul is titled “Lice Mothers”. “People from the city get scared of these things that villagers think of as normal.” For example? “For example, torturing frogs – it’s not very nice but it happens and children will experiment with it.”Despite being published three years apart, the novel and poetry collection began in tandem, even sharing some lines. “The challenge was how to write them when I didn’t have many memories of my brother’s death. So I started with Matthies, and only during the writing arrived at the shape the novel has now. I saw Calf’s Caul as preparation for writing The Discomfort of Evening.”The collection, which has yet to be published in English, is full of the anxieties that Rijneveld’s chosen identity has created in a family who are god-fearing members of the Reformed church. “Papa has been searching for a daughter for years,” reads one poem. “It’s difficult for my parents to understand that I’m not the girl that they raised,” Rijneveld says. “It’s not in the Bible.”Whether the papa of the poems is any more Rijneveld’s own father than Jas’s papa in the novel is left open by a writer who admits that they regard their public identity as a performance, to be donned along with the braces. “Writing is playing with who you are. Being an author makes me feel more confident.”Rijneveld was born on 20 April 1991 on a farm in the north Brabant, a province in the south of the Netherlands. The date is significant, they disarmingly disclose, because it means they share a birthday with Adolf Hitler. “As a child I thought it was a funny idea to be born on the same day as such a monstrous man, but it made me wonder if I was a good or a bad person.” In the novel, Jas builds a fantasy about a Jewish family her mother has hidden away in the basement. She acts out her social alienation by making a Nazi salute at school and cracking a joke which was judged too offensive for the English edition of the novel.It’s part of a strand of black humour that is as dangerous in its way as the children’s games (one gruesome scene involves a dummy cow and an insemination gun). Asked why the novel pushes so hard at boundaries of what is acceptable, the author shrugs: “It is related by a child and children are naive. They say these things. They don’t know any better, so they can get away with an innocent joke.”At nine years old, Rijneveld says, “I had a very strong belief in God and was convinced he was living in the attic.” The novel is full of glimpses into what it was like growing up in a strict religious household. Jas’s father restricts their TV channels for fear of nudity, which he pronounces “as if a fruit fly had just flown into his mouth – he spat as he said it” her mother daringly watches a quiz show involving words that are not in the Bible. “She called them ‘blush words’ because some of them made your cheeks turn red.” When her children try out these words, she attempts “to wash them out of our mouths with a bar of green soap, like the grease stains from our good school clothes”.Of their own experience Rijneveld simply says: “Behind the book is such a strong force. After leaving school I didn’t know what to do. I started living in a room in a new city and I just knew I had to write it. In daily life it’s hard to be as strong as I am behind my laptop.” They now live in Utrecht, and work on a farm that is not their parents’.There are only two responses to the death of a child, Rijneveld says: either it draws a family closer or rips them apart. So what happened in their own family? “I have to think about the answer to that … ” Rijneveld says solemnly. “No, it hasn’t torn us apart, but all the relationships changed.” One brother and sister are now teachers, and a second brother is in the police. None of them has read the novel. “I hope that my parents will read it one day and be proud that they will understand it’s a novel, it’s not all about them. But it is probably too soon.”Meanwhile Rijneveld’s writing has gained them a new cultural family, which stretches beyond the Netherlands to Italy and Germany. Calf’s Caul has gone through 11 editions to date in Dutch while The Discomfort of Evening has sold 55,000 copies in the Netherlands it will be published in French in April and is currently being translated into Spanish, Korean, Chinese and Arabic. A second poetry collection is already out, and Rijneveld is working on a second novel. All of which bears out their fervent belief that “there’s always light in darkness, just as there’s always humour in gruesomeness. It’s just the way things work. There must always be something to laugh about.” Claire Armitstead• Marieke Lucas Rijneveld’s The Discomfort of Evening, translated by Michelle Hutchison, is published by Faber in the UK and out now.As a young man travelling around Europe in the late 1990s, the Malmö-based writer Andrzej Tichý remembers telling friends about the conditions endured by marginalised groups in Sweden. “And they just would not believe me,” he recalls. “From the outside Sweden was this harmonious, social democratic paradise and people preferred to believe the folk hymn that here was a society that looked after everyone. But it was never actually true.” He cites historic state-sanctioned forced sterilisations of those deemed to be mentally or physically impaired, and discrimination against Jews, Roma and indigenous peoples. “And there has always been the day-to-day treatment of the poor and of immigrants, let alone the junkies and criminals,” he adds. “Of course there were places in the world that were worse, but Sweden was never perfect.”The poor and the immigrants, the junkies and the criminals, loom large in Tichý’s prize-winning novel Wretchedness (Eländet, translated by Nichola Smalley) which will be published in the UK in June by And Other Stories. It is his fifth novel, but the first to appear in English, and opens with a cellist on his way to a classical concert being asked for money by a drug addict on the street. The encounter summons a swirling sequence of flashbacks from the cellist’s own chaotic past. Graphic depictions of crime, racism, poverty, drug use and violence are rendered through paragraph-free slabs of text that propulsively veer between voices and minds, times and locations: “Suddenly my mouth is full of it again,” the musician declares, “of names and places, of events and movements, of memories and images.” The inescapable realisation is how easy it would have been for him to have become that junkie.Tichý was born in Prague in 1978 to a Czech father and Polish mother. His family moved to Sweden when he was three, and he was brought up on a Malmö housing estate with a large migrant population not unlike the one featured in Wretchedness. “I’m not interested in autobiography or autofiction, but I know there are always borderline areas between the writer and the subject and I am not a stranger to many of the things in the novel. Much comes from personal experience, although sometimes indirectly.”As well as the Swedish estates, the novel draws on Tichý’s experiences of living in Hamburg and London to paint a picture of a pan-European community of the excluded passing through squats, underground clubs, petty scams and cash-only employment.This internationalism is also reflected in the language he deploys. “A lot of it is written in a sort of slang encompassing many different languages. Some words have long been incorporated into standard Swedish, from Roma for example. But now there are also a lot of Arab words, Serbo-Croat, Polish, Spanish, Albanian. It’s all mixed together, but interestingly while one sentence can contain several different languages, people will know what you mean.”Tichý’s early creative life centered on music – playing guitar in the hardcore scene rather than classical cello – which led to him starting up fanzines for which he first wrote poetry and then prose. There is a sense of musicality inherent in the dense text of Wretchedness, as episodes from the composer’s past repeatedly return, with references ranging from Snoop Dogg and Mobb Deep’s hip-hop to the concert hall avant garde of Julius Eastman and Italian composer Giacinto Scelsi’s atonal drones. (There is a coolly eclectic Spotify playlist that accompanies the book).Literary and philosophical influences include Simone Weil and Thomas Bernhard, and Tichý admits that his is a potentially demanding kind of literature. “I sometimes go out and talk to young people on the estates, people not really interested in books, and some of them find it hard. But they are interested in the themes, which is partly why rap lyrics have always been a huge influence on me. They can be complex and sophisticated yet can describe street stuff in a wonderfully direct and concise manner and so make art out of what is thought of as low life.“That is partly my project too. I’ve always wanted to depict lives and environments under-explored by literature. These lives not only deserve to be chronicled, they deserve to be elevated.” Nicholas Wroe• Andrzej Tichy’s Wretchedness, translated by Nichola Smalley, will be published by And Other Stories in the UK in June.It is no longer the curse of the Irish author to be compared to James Joyce: these days, if they happen to be sharp, socially conscious and writing about twentysomethings living now, they will be announced as the new Sally Rooney, and also as some kind of child prodigy, even when they are well into their 20s. Naoise Dolan, 27, finds this all hilarious. “In any other career, it is completely normal to get going in your 20s – we’ve just normalised the desperate state of affairs around writing,” she says. “And the idea that young women couldn’t ever have had an emotional or interesting life, or that it’s somehow cringeworthy to capture the present moment – both are ridiculous to me.”Despite the inevitable comparisons, Dolan’s debut, Exciting Times, published in April by Weidenfeld, is more caustic and cynical than Rooney’s writing, if just as clever. It follows Ava, a 22-year-old who had “been sad in Dublin, decided it was Dublin’s fault and thought Hong Kong would help”. There she meets 29-year-old banker Julian, an only child who went to Eton. (“These were the two least surprising facts anyone had ever told me about themselves,” Ava notes.) Their relationship is sexual, if carefully ambiguous, and is built mostly on their mutual enjoyment of acidic banter over any deeply-felt romance. Ava admires Julian’s cushions and willingness to give her his credit cards his highest praise for her is that she is “good company”: “Really it was amusing that we were having sex,” Ava muses. “He was attractive and confident, whereas I was willing to centre my emotional life around someone who treated me like a favoured armrest.” When Julian temporarily moves away, Ava meets Edith, a young and wealthy Hong Kong lawyer. It is here that Dolan’s novel feels most contemporaneous all the fretting over love and class could be compared to Austen or Wharton, but her light treatment of bisexuality and polyamory is utterly 2020. Ava, Julian and Edith are never really a love triangle but a hinge, with Ava in the middle of two people who benignly tolerate each other. The only drama in their arrangement lies in the choice Ava feels she must make, despite Julian’s indifference and Edith saying things like: “I have many opinions about the nexus between monogamy and patriarchy, opinions which are available on request should they interest you.”Dolan is less interested in sexuality than in relationships: “Sexuality only affects the ability to be attracted to someone – how that manifests is more about who that person is. As a queer person, I have no understanding how it might feel different to experience heterosexual attraction, though I’m quite interested in that. But there are plenty of novels about straight people already. And I think it is more interesting to write about relationships without the assumption that it has to be a monogamous one.” She suspects older readers will be baffled by the dynamic. “There is this expectation that you should write to people who are powerful in ways that you’re not, to explain to them why you’re different. I think it’s better to just throw it out there and if they don’t like it, fine. For people my age, the most important question is: are you treating your partners well or poorly?” When in conversation with older writers, she says, “I sometimes feel like I’m trying to prove that it’s OK to write stories about people who aren’t them. It’s not a gendered thing, there is a class element too. A lot of things that we call ‘the millennial experience’ were always part of a universal experience for some social groups – middle-class people are just upset that those things are happening to them now.”Dolan grew up in Dublin, studied English at Trinity College and was published in Stinging Fly magazine – by Rooney, who was editor until 2019. (This makes Dolan “such an Irish cliche”, she says.) She was always interested in literature, but never had any aspirations to write – “firstly because it’s not financially possible for most people, and secondly, I don’t stake a significant amount of my self-image in how I relate to the modes of production. It was a hobby, not a career goal. I have a limited amount of patience for the writer-as-personality thing – it is a very mechanical and somewhat distant thing for me. I just make things up. I don’t relate to accounts that people give of being struck by ideas or their characters taking over. Writing was always just kind of something that I plugged away at.”Dolan, who is autistic, “doesn’t like talking to people”, so to get away from colleagues and students at her teaching job, she spent five months hiding in coffeeshops on her lunch breaks. “I find it easier to relate to people by thinking about why they are the way they are. I aim to observe people rather than empathise with them,” she says. And her observations are brilliant, often simultaneously comic and bleak. “Julian often reminded me to eat. It made him feel better about liking that I was thin,” Ava notes. Or, at a party: “Ralph’s girlfriend Victoria was good at wearing clothes. She was so beautiful I couldn’t see why she was talking to me. Sometimes her eyes said: I don’t know why, either.”With the emergence of Rooney, Eimear McBride, Lisa McInerney, Nicole Flattery and others, Ireland has been held up for its almost mythic ability to cultivate brilliant women writers – but Dolan puts this down to Ireland being a more egalitarian playing field than the UK. “Ireland isn’t perfect, but we still have relatively good support for the arts so literary writing doesn’t have as much of a bourgeois connotation as it does in the UK. We have a better range of writers here. UK journalists always ask the oddest questions, like, ‘have you had a job before?’ I’m a normal person – yes I have.”Dolan stopped travelling by plane in September, after the fires in the Amazon moved her to reconsider her impact on the environment. “It might hold me back from promoting the book, but to be pumping all that CO2 into the air to push a novel just seems like such a ridiculous thing. If my novel doesn’t get promoted, someone else’s will. The literary world will be much unaffected.” Her decision, she thinks, comes back to her feelings about being a novelist. “I don’t think that I’m a special person who has an innate entitlement to exist writing novels while demanding other people do less pleasant things with their time. I’m lucky to, but there are a lot of things that I’m not willing to do to keep that situation going. Flying is just one of them.” Sian Cain• Naoise Dolan’s Exciting Times is published by Orion in the UK in April.“The thing I write best,” Hassan Blasim says, “is violence.” His acclaimed short-story collections, The Madman of Freedom Square and The Iraqi Christ, are fervent, unblinking depictions of post-invasion Iraq, the country of his birth, though their violence is focused through the lenses of surrealism, humour and poignancy. The former was longlisted for the Independent foreign fiction prize in 2010, and the latter won it in 2014, becoming the first title translated from Arabic to do so.In 2000, Blasim left Iraq, where he had been persecuted for his film-making and where his writing is still banned. He spent four years walking illegally across Europe, eventually settling in Finland. His debut novel, God 99 (translated by Jonathan Wright and published in July by Comma), draws on his experience: its protagonist (called Hassan) is an Iraqi refugee attempting to establish himself as a writer in Finland. But he stresses that “the book puts reality and fiction in dialogue. Autobiography is a fiction – we lie about things we misremember and misrepresent. So too fiction has truths. Luckily, I’m not famous enough for people to know my life, so I can still play with it.”God 99, he says, is “born of dialogue – always in conversation are death and life, war and peace”. In the novel, Hassan traverses Europe and interviews 99 refugees, examining the effect of war on their lives, and their impact on the countries they make home.Blasim is ambivalent about the label “European writer” – more ambivalent than he is about “debut novelist”, which he flatly rejects (“I just write. This shift to long-form is not important”). In his mind, his identity is simply “writer”. “In England,” he says, “and other parts of western and southern Europe, you have a history with immigrants. In Finland, it’s relatively new, and while some people embrace me as a Finnish writer, others resist.” Because he writes in Arabic, he is ineligible for Finnish literary prizes, and cannot join the Union of Writers.This context, combined with censorship of his work in the Middle East, means translation into English has been vital. But although Blasim attributes his success to translation, he stresses that it was never something he sought: “When I came to Europe, I didn’t know where to go. I had this romantic idea of reaching France, because of the literature. But you just go wherever you can. How can you think about the future, when life is like this? How can you think about succeeding as a writer? About reaching English-language readers?”Translating Blasim’s work – which is as experimental linguistically as it is formally – is no light task. The Arabic of God 99 is what Blasim calls “street Arabic”, and it’s another reason he’s reviled by some in Iraq: “They call me a ‘dirty writer’ – they say that I do not respect the language. Nobody can touch classical Arabic because it is a holy language. But nobody uses holy language on the street. And when I dream it is not in classical Arabic.”Does he still feel at risk? “Of course,” he says. He has returned to Iraq only once, secretly, and does not believe he will again. But his new home in Finland is not one of undiluted Scandinavian peace he is working on a project about the Finnish far right, and confides that he fears for his safety if he publishes it. “Maybe I’ll meet you in England, a refugee again,” he says. “As a refugee, you are always between two fires. Your first home, and your new one.” Will Forrester• Hassan Blasim’s God 99, translated by Jonathan Wright, will be published by Comma Press in July.A Russian writer of Armenian origin, Narine Abgaryan is already renowned as a children’s author and blogger in Russia. Her novel Three Apples Fell from the Sky has sold more than 160,000 copies since it was first published in 2015 and won Russia’s most prestigious literary award, the Yasnaya Polyana prize (founded by the Tolstoy estate). A magical realist story of friendship and feuds, published in English this month by Oneworld, the book is set in the remote Armenian mountain village of Maran, where the villagers pick mulberries and make baklava. An ancient telegraph wire and a perilous mountain path that even goats struggle to follow is their only connection to the outside world. Abgaryan cites One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel García Márquez, set in the isolated fictional village of Macondo, as her favourite book. But she was haunted by the ending of Márquez’s multi-generational saga of the Buendía family, as all traces of Macondo’s existence are wiped away. In Three Apples Fell from the Sky (translated by Lisa C Hayden), she resolved to write a fable that did exactly the opposite. “I wanted to write a story that ends on a note of hope,” she says. “Humanity is in dire need of hope, of kind stories.”“We live such fast-paced lives, barely managing to speak to one another, to ask how things are going,” she says. “The thing that bothers me is how young people are leaving their elders behind.” Abgaryan, who now lives in Moscow, points to how the villagers in her novel spend their days “cultivating wine that nobody wants or needs”. “Globalisation has benefits, of course, but also negative side-effects, when national customs, the things which define people, are taken away.”Her work has already been translated into 12 languages, and with English being the 13th, she now calls this her lucky number. “When you’re published in English there’s a greater chance that your work will resonate more widely,” she says. “When your work is translated, you start to work with greater joy and hope. You start to believe in yourself more.” Jade Cuttle• Narine Abgaryan’s Three Apples Fell from the Sky, translated by Lisa C Hayden, is published by Oneworld and is out now.Pauline Delabroy-Allard’s first novel took the French literary world by surprise. She wrote it to get the story out of her head and then stuck it in a drawer. “I didn’t expect anyone would want to publish it.” A few months later, with her 30th birthday approaching, she decided she had nothing to lose by posting the manuscript to a few French publishers. “I told myself I would get a load of rejection letters and then I could stop dreaming and get on with my life.” When publishers began calling the following week, “I thought someone was playing a joke”. Delabroy-Allard eventually chose Les Éditions de Minuit, whose catalogue includes the writers she most admires, including Annie Ernaux and Marguerite Duras. “I signed the contract on my 30th birthday. That was a real party.”Ça raconte Sarah (All About Sarah) won a literary award even before it was published in 2018 to almost unanimous praise. The book was shortlisted for a the Prix Goncourt, the most prestigious literary award in France. Translated into English by Adriana Hunter and published this month by Harvill Secker, it is a story of desire and desolation. Its narrator is a bored secondary school teacher and single mother in Paris whose comfortable but humdrum life is upended when she falls in love with Sarah, a professional musician, who is loud and impetuous.The narrator and Sarah embark on an all-consuming, passionate relationship. The first part of the novel concludes when they separate and Sarah reveals she has breast cancer. In the second part, the narrator flees Sarah’s apartment, telling nobody and leaving her child behind. It is unclear whether Sarah has died or dumped the unnamed narrator, who descends into despair.Like the book’s narrator, Delabroy-Allard is a teacher, has a daughter and is in a relationship with a professional violinist called Sarah. But that is where the similarities end, she insists. “I’m not bothered if people think it’s me, but it isn’t. I find it difficult to invent things from nothing, so I use reality as a base. Once I have that base I can create the rest.”She says she left Paris to live in isolation in the countryside to complete the second part of the novel. “It was very hard being in her head – almost physically painful. I was happy to finish it.” She is now working on a second novel that she is racing to complete before she and her pregnant partner have a baby in July. The 31-year-old says she wanted to write about a passionate relationship between two women because there are so few “lesbian novels”. “But really this is a portrait of one woman, because everything we know of Sarah is through the narrator and in the second part there is no Sarah.”The novel ends leaving readers in limbo. “Several editors wanted me to rewrite it, but I didn’t want to change it. Everyone is free to imagine their own ending.” Kim Willsher• Pauline Delabroy-Allard’s All About Sarah, translated by Adriana Hunter, is published by Harvill Secker on 12 March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b90185405b464236a43d6a147d746abbb4fe5abc/598_4_2757_1654/master/2757.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40bcff00b40f513fb72c1425714b4fe9","title":"how small businesses can defeat the issue of late payments once and for all","story":"With some small tweaks, SMEs can better prepare themselves against the damage inflicted by late paymentsAfter one large online retailer paid Pietrasik late two seasons in a row, she decided to walk away and now prioritises small independent boutiques and her own website. “We’re focusing on staying strong and small,” she adds, “not needing to grow big and unstable.

He is a meandering, unfocused speaker, often unable to complete a sentence, let alone a thought, with a record in office that is decidedly patchy, marred by several past positions he struggles to defend. And yet Biden is now the frontrunner for his party’s nomination to take on Donald Trump. What’s more, the current mood, and specifically the threat of coronavirus, might just turn his defining weakness into a strength – and give him a serious shot at the White House.I saw his limitations for myself last month in Hudson, New Hampshire, as he paced around a high school gymnasium delivering a rambling monologue that suggested a politician well past his prime. Stronger on autobiography than policy, he strung together childhood memories, mottos taught him by his father and a kind of perplexed outrage that Trump’s America was not a country he recognised any more: “What’s this all about?” he asked, as if befuddled. “What do we stand for?” In New Hampshire, he finished fifth.Yet in the last seven days Biden has staged what is surely the most remarkable turnaround in modern US political history, a massive win in South Carolina setting off a chain reaction that brought victories across the south and midwest on Super Tuesday. Only Bernie Sanders now stands between Joe Biden and the nomination, with the map of upcoming primary contests tilted in the latter’s favour.Sanders likes to say it was the “political and corporate establishment” that handed victory to Biden, but that’s a stretch. For one thing, the Biden campaign was all but broke going into Super Tuesday, outspent by Sanders by a ratio of seven-to-one (and outspent by Mike Bloomberg by 100-to-1). Biden had only a skeletal presence on the ground, dwarfed by Sanders’ vast grassroots operation. Besides, it was not the establishment that turned out for Biden, but African-American voters – the most consistently faithful group within the Democratic coalition – who backed him over Sanders by huge, crushing margins. Along with suburban women, it was black America, not corporate America, that made the difference.There are plenty of lessons here. One is that money and organisation are not the decisive factors they were assumed to be: just ask Bloomberg, who spent $500m and won not a single state, while Biden won states he didn’t even visit. Another is that sexism and its offshoot - second-guessing other people’s sexism - pervades US politics. Elizabeth Warren was the smartest candidate in the Democratic field, the most accomplished debater and may well have made the best president, but she could not make headway. I saw part of the explanation for myself in New Hampshire, speaking to countless women who admired Warren enormously, and were desperate to see a woman in the White House, but who had ruefully concluded that their fellow citizens were just not “ready” to make that happen. They had seen how misogynistic unease with an older, opinionated woman had proved fatal to Hillary Clinton in 2016 and they were not prepared to risk a repeat of that in 2020. So they voted vote for a man instead. Perhaps inevitably, the face it chose was a familiar one, belonging to a man whom Democrats feel they’ve known for ever, whom most of them trust and like. Even the voters I met who were not backing Joe Biden described him the same way: as a “good man”, as a “really decent person”, as someone of warmth and “empathy”. Americans know the losses he has endured. His first wife and daughter were killed in a car crash when Biden was 30 his eldest son, Beau, died of cancer aged 46. Biden’s best moments in Hudson came as he listened to people talk of the pain they had endured. “Like most of you, I’ve lost a lot in my lifetime,” he said. “But I’ll be damned if I’m going to stand by and lose my country.” That ability to show basic human empathy could count in a country that is currently fearful, even bracing itself for disaster.Which brings us to the coronavirus. For four decades, the US right has had great success in persuading voters that government is the problem, not the solution. That’s found its most extreme form in Trump, elected on an implicit pledge to shake the whole thing up, if not burn it all down. He’s gutted government departments and run down federal agencies, left posts vacant or filled them with pals, cheered on by a base that for years has heard the fire-breathers of Fox News and talk radio cast “government bureaucrats” as the enemy.But how does such talk sound now, when people are trembling at the prospect of a pandemic? In a moment like this, people don’t turn against government, they turn to it. In good times, you might get applause railing against “federal officials” or “elite experts”. In a crisis, those are precisely the people with the authority to get a grip and offer reassurance.Suddenly, Biden’s 50 years as a Washington insider can be presented less as a liability than an asset, because that’s half a century of valuable experience. Better still, Biden is remembered as the number two in the most unflappably efficient administration most Americans have ever known, namely the one headed by Barack Obama. The fact that Obama chose Biden as his deputy has meant that, even without making an explicit endorsement, Obama has long served as Biden’s chief character witness. Now that line on the résumé counts for even more, with Biden’s presence in the team that presided over an economic recovery and governed with stability and calm – “No drama Obama” they called it – a prime credential.That will help Biden if he faces Trump, but it could also ensure he does. For Bernie Sanders’ brand is not one of steady calm so much as upheaval and “revolution”. That thrills his most devoted supporters but, Tuesday’s results suggest, it scares off those who yearn for stability. (At a crucial moment a fortnight ago, after he’d won in Nevada, Sanders could have moved to assuage those fears instead he reinforced them, defending his past praise for the record of Fidel Castro.) At any other time, Biden’s age, manner and CV could have doomed his candidacy. But with a plague looming, Americans might just view a flawed man of undoubted empathy and with an intimate knowledge of loss, a man who’s spent a lifetime inside the US government, as something like a remedy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b68d29678b33431d9e222c6bc863c69130fb625e/0_128_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=334d9359c9238af4413097b4716ab829","title":"climate activists demand budget plan for low carbon future","story":"Campaigners press chancellor for clear signal UK government is taking Cop26 seriouslyClimate campaigners are urging the government to set out a clear plan for a low-carbon future in next week’s budget, despite the chancellor’s decision to pull a major plank of climate policy at the last minute.The budget will determine much of the government’s work this year, and campaigners fear that a failure to send clear signals on meeting the 2050 net zero emissions target would play badly with other countries looking to the UK for leadership as host of the vital UN climate talks, called Cop26, later this year.Hopes were dealt a blow when it emerged on Friday that a major policy announcement on national infrastructure – including an overhaul of Britain’s energy, transport and water infrastructure to cut greenhouse gas emissions and help cope with the impacts of extreme weather – would be postponed.“This budget is a big opportunity for the government to set out their stall for Cop26 and lead by example, so it’s disappointing that we may not have a major announcement on low-carbon infrastructure as part of it,” said Doug Parr, the chief scientist at Greenpeace UK.Dave Timms, the head of politics at Friends of the Earth, said: “The government reconsidering support for expensive climate-wrecking infrastructure projects such as the £30bn road-building programme would be a welcome sign that international climate commitments are being taken more seriously. However, they need to urgently press ahead with funding a national programme of investment in the UK’s cold and leaky homes where there are clear benefits for the economy, households, and the planet.”Next Wednesday’s budget will be the first since Britain left the EU and the first since the UK adopted the net zero carbon target, enshrined in law by Theresa May last summer in one of her final acts as prime minister. It will also be scrutinised carefully by other nations for signals that the government is taking Cop26 seriously, after a troubled start to the UK’s presidency.The EU is setting out its European Green Deal, a massive overarching strategy encompassing all aspects of the European economy, hoped to lead to net zero emissions by mid-century. The EU will use its green deal in a bid to draw China, the world’s biggest emitter, into a pact to cut greenhouse gases drastically.Without a similar strategy, the UK may lack credibility in trying to form the “grand coalition” of countries that experts say is necessary to make Cop26 – the conference of the parties, to be held in Glasgow this November – a success.“We’ve been promised a green budget, and with only eight months to go till the UN climate talks, it’s essential we get one,” said Shaun Spiers, the executive director of Green Alliance. “The government is badly off target to deliver its legally binding climate commitments. This is the moment to get on track.”Campaigners want to see the government commit to a range of measures that would reduce carbon, beyond the piecemeal announcements made so far. Boris Johnson said last month at the launch of Cop26 that the moratorium on sales of new diesel and petroleum cars would be brought forward five years to 2035, and this week ministers agreed to make onshore wind farms eligible for public support, and to increase the content of biofuels in petrol.Green groups and experts say much more is needed, including strategies on fixing Britain’s heat-leaking homes, boosting renewables, halting the rapid rise in emissions from transport, restoring the natural environment and tackling waste.“As the first major opportunity for the Johnson government to show it is serious on delivering net zero, the budget is a huge moment ahead of Cop26,” said Jonathan Marshall, the head of analysis at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit. “The minimum expected is to lead by example and convince other nations to submit ambitious pledges, amplifying domestic action on to the global stage. The UK can show the world that hitting net zero is eminently possible, and is more than just a slogan.”Local government is also urging the chancellor to deliver a green budget for Cop26. A group of councils and local government organisations wrote to the chancellor on Friday to say that councils are “uniquely well placed to help the government meet its carbon emissions reduction targets”.“Massive investment in our abundant renewable power potential, public transport and a nationwide energy efficiency programme would put the UK at the forefront of the green industrial revolution – and show genuine leadership ahead of this year’s crucial climate summit in Glasgow,” said Mike Childs of Friends of the Earth.In a sign of the growing impact of the coronavirus on Cop26, the UN announced planned meetings in Bonn in March and April would be cancelled. However the main preparatory Cop26 meeting scheduled for Bonn in June is so far unaffected.Some also fear that the need for urgent measures on the coronavirus will distract attention from the green agenda.“The need to avoid recession as a result of coronavirus cannot be made an excuse for dodging vital decisions on de-carbonising the economy,” said Spiers. “Investing in warmer homes, infrastructure for electric vehicles, the renewable energy industry and natural flood defences will boost the economy, not least in poorer regions, as well as tackling the climate and wider environmental emergency.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7eb5d80cc986f3e553925920e7c4b725d231da54/323_375_2740_1644/master/2740.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83184fa2fda6eca264f639d736c9bc72","title":"return of the burbot great lost fish to be reintroduced to uk","story":"Freshwater predatory cod species to make comeback after 50-year absenceForget dreams of wolves, bears or lynx – the next animal to be restored to the British countryside could be a river bottom-dwelling fish that resembles a giant tadpole.The burbot, much-maligned for its unprepossessing appearance with a fleshy appendage dangling from its chin, was last sighted in British rivers in 1969.A reward for spotting it remains unclaimed and now a costed reintroduction plan is being drawn up for Natural England, the government’s conservation watchdog.“The chance to bring back burbot to our rivers is hugely exciting,” said Jonah Tosney, operations director of the Norfolk Rivers Trust, which is masterminding the reintroduction plan. “Unlike beavers, lynx and sea eagles, they haven’t been gone for long only about 50 years. Anglers still remember catching them. We’re hopeful that recent work to improve water quality and to restore habitat has brought our rivers back to a good enough state to support England’s great lost fish.”The burbot, also known as the eelpout and the lingcod, disappeared at the same time as the otter vanished from waterways. In both cases, agricultural and heavy metal pollution may have played a role.Tosney said the cause of the burbot’s disappearance remained “a bit of a mystery” but was a combination of pressures including the disappearance of natural “messy” edges to rivers, including pools, flooded areas and back channels.“People did used to eat them but it’s more likely to be water quality and habitat quality slowly degrading since the second world war that caused their disappearance,” he said.The burbot, the only freshwater species of cod, once thrived at the bottom of cool lowland rivers across eastern England but leaves its preferred habitat for ponds and pools to spawn and so requires pools and other freshwater close to the river.Burbot could also be a beneficiary of beaver reintroductions, as the beavers create burbot-friendly habitat.The fish has been successfully reintroduced into Belgium and Germany, and Tosney said there were several river valleys in the East Anglian Fens with good floodplains that could be ideal habitat.Before the fish is brought back there will be further feasibility studies and also an environmental DNA survey to check there are no traces of burbot DNA in rivers, which would prove that a few survivors have evaded detection since the 1960s.The Norfolk Rivers Trust hopes to raise £80,000 to fund a five-year reintroduction pilot. Because of the high mortality rate for young fish, hundreds of thousands of young burbot will be first reared in captivity from eggs brought from European hatcheries.Dave Ottewell, a fish specialist for Natural England, said: “Over recent years great efforts have been made to restore our freshwater environment, rectifying some of the historic damage inflicted on these valuable and complex systems.“This work has focused on rebuilding the natural processes that underpin high quality freshwater habitats. It is the successful restoration of these habitats that has led us to a position where we can now realistically look towards the reintroduction of this recently lost species back into its native range.”The reintroduction may worry trout fishermen in particular because the omnivorous burbot will eat trout.“They eat pretty much everything – invertebrates, other fish, and trout, no doubt about it, but trout will also eat burbot,” said Tosney. “Anglers do not like predators but I can’t see any other reason to object – it’s a native species, it should be here.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6a014780596d05029348eb7dc066c5edcb46653/0_0_1600_1067/master/1600.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=15b9e135b8dd496be36fe9411621392a 1400w","title":"cinema coronavirus projected 5bn loss","story":"Blockbuster releases remain largely on track, as do plans for the Cannes film festival but unease increases behind the scenesA spokesperson for Cineworld, which owns multiplexes throughout Europe as well as UK arthouse chain Picturehouse Cinemas, pointed to the fact that most releases remain on track, with studios apparently reluctant to change schedules unless it becomes absolutely necessary.“Admissions remain high,” Phil Clapp, chief executive of the UK cinema association told the . “In line with the advice given by the deputy chief medical officer this week, all sites will remain open,” he said.A similar defiance was demonstrated by the Cannes film festival, which said it remained committed to proceeding as planned in mid-May.On Thursday, the French government extended a ban on public gatherings of more than 5,000 people until the end of May.“It’s a confidence thing,” one industry source added. “You can’t start saying you’re worried. It has to be very on until it’s suddenly very off. In part, that’s just a legal and insurance thing.”More than 12,000 delegates attended Cannes last year, but the largest cinema at the Palais des Festivals seats only 2,300. Invitations to the Cannes lineup press conference in Paris on 16 April were sent out on Friday morning.Cannes regained credibility as a launchpad when three of its 2019 premieres – Parasite, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and Portrait of a Lady on Fire – performed well during awards season.This followed a couple of underpowered editions for the festival in which its programme was overshadowed by Cannes film festival director Thierry Frémaux’s row with Netflix, whose films he barred from awards eligibility.Pressure on festival directors not to skip a year would therefore be considerable, despite both unsettling government advice and increasing industry precedent.On 4 March, organisers of the Cannes MIPTV content market – which also takes place in the Palais – announced they were cancelling this year. Forty of France’s cinemas have been closed and the number of confirmed cases in the Cannes area has reached double figures.More than half of Italy’s cinemas are closed and regulations prohibit people from sitting less than a metre away from each other in public.Mario Lorini, president of ANEC, the national association of exhibitors, has unveiled a system he hopes would comply and enable cinemas to remain open: allowing the booking of every third seat in a row, with empty seats directly in front and behind.Lorini said his team had been “working round the clock” to try to make the plan viable.On Friday the International Indian Film Academy Awards were postponed because of “sensitivity” over the mounting health crisis. Originally due to take place on 27 March, the annual gala is Bollywood’s version of the Oscars.The inaugural Red Sea international film festival in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, was cancelled earlier in the week, and increasing numbers of attendants – including Amazon and Apple – have withdrawn from the South by Southwest (SXSW) festival in Austin, Texas. SXSW has a significant film sidebar, and is still scheduled to take place for 10 days from 13 March.But it is the mainstream end of the film industry which is likely to be hit hardest by the spread of coronavirus, while smaller films and streaming sites such as Netflix could be set for an unexpected boost.MGM’s decision to delay the release of the Bond film was applauded by many, despite a potential $50m bill to cover logistics – as well as costs and share falls for the many sponsors whose tie-in campaigns have already begun.In earmarking an alternative window quickly, the studio has bought dominance over a key date in the cinema-going calendar – No Time to Die opens in the US over Thanksgiving weekend – while the seven-month hiatus allows time to redraw plans.“That feels like a safe amount of breathing room,” said a source close to the production. “Tentpole movies live or die on large audiences going out of their houses and watching them in cinemas with hundreds of other people. Right now, nobody wants to do that.”“In China infections seem to have peaked but you can’t see them opening cinemas before June,” said another industry insider, “nor people being keen to go for a while after that. Add three months for the rest of the world and November starts looking very attractive.”Widespread cinema closures across China, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan and South Korea have already done drastic damage to the global box office, with one consulting firm suggesting that the loss during China’s new year holiday alone amounts to around $1bn.Among projected big-hitters yet to be released in China’s 70,000 screens are Dolittle, Sonic the Hedgehog and Oscar contenders such as 1917, Marriage Story, Jojo Rabbit and Little Women. When cinemas do reopen, the backlog will cause further delays and local titles will be prioritised.Bond’s distributors did not directly mention coronavirus in their Wednesday statement, instead saying that the decision had been taken after “careful consideration and thorough evaluation of the global theatrical marketplace”.Two-thirds of the money made by Bond movies comes from outside the US, with east Asia increasingly courted by Hollywood producers.Forthcoming blockbusters such as Mulan – whose $200m budget makes it Disney’s most expensive live-action remake yet – and the ninth Fast and Furious film are highly reliant on Asian markets for their profits.The Chinese premiere of Mulan was cancelled some weeks ago and updates are anticipated from Disney on any changes to the worldwide launch, which is currently still scheduled for 27 March.Early estimates suggest that Mulan’s US opening weekend may still manage a $90m take, with some crediting coronavirus’s reportedly less dramatic impact on children as one reason that family films may not suffer as much as their adult counterparts.How Mulan fares will have substantial implications for the strategy surrounding Disney’s first blockbuster of the year: Avengers spin-off Black Widow, which is meant to open worldwide at the start of May.Should these films flop, many forecast a domino effect as studios scramble to reschedule tentpole releases. F9, Scooby-Doo movie Scoob!, Wonder Woman 1984 and Netflix’s Eurovision movie are all early summer releases whose release dates look vulnerable.Production disruption is already considerable, with Paramount halting a planned shoot in Venice on Mission: Impossible VII last week citing “concerns of the crew”.“Who is going to underwrite a movie which goes into production next week?” queried one source. “If an actor is due on set in say, late March, their agent might well forbid them from working, saying it’s too dangerous.”Nervousness was demonstrated by talent agency CAA on Wednesday when it clamped down on anything other than virtual meetings. The same day, Sony Pictures’ offices in London, Paris and Poland were shut for the remainder of the week after a UK employee was feared to have been exposed to the virus while travelling abroad.Paramount is, however, pressing ahead with the release of the sequel A Quiet Place Part II on 20 March. Just a 10th of the original film’s $340m take came from China the curious parallels between the plot – a family self-isolates to try to survive – perhaps boosting its box office appeal among populations relatively unaffected by illness.Contingency plans for mid-range releases may involve fast-tracking them to streaming services, where there is likely to be a substantial appetite from a captive at-home audience.Water-cooler titles such as Promising Young Woman – in which Carey Mulligan feigns drunkenness on nights out before taking bloody revenge on men who attempt to take advantage of her – are thought to be prime candidates for films that could do well online, if a cinema release appears optimistic.However, legacy inertia could make such innovation challenging. “The ecosystem of release strategies would be really damaged by that kind of thing,” said one source. “Everything is booked and lined up already. I don’t know if that tactic has real financial merit.”The industry’s structural makeup may also prove problematic, with studios and exhibitors prizing competition over collaboration, meaning strategy communication is limited.“It’s uncharted territory,” said one source, “but that also means there are lots of opportunities out there if streamers can move quickly.”Representatives for Netflix and Amazon did not respond to the ’s requests for comment, but a boom in users and dwell time over the coming weeks appears likely.Even long-established studios are seeing silver linings online. Contagion, Steven Soderbergh’s unfortunately prescient 2011 thriller about the global outbreak of a deadly virus, has proved such a viral hit over recent weeks that it’s already Warner Bros’ second-best-performing film of 2020."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e335ebf4c2f867f5308d69c9186fb4c826543d98/0_293_7200_4320/master/7200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3c1e2dfbf0b386fe86ba2272503f247","title":"spenser confidential review mark wahlberg netflix","story":"The actor plays a justice-seeking ex-cop in a clumsy, unfunny adaptation of a much-loved literary crime seriesMark Wahlberg’s first film for Netflix, a charmless little shrug of a caper called Spenser Confidential, is the kind of film that evaporates as it’s being watched, destined never to be thought of again. It’s regrettable given those involved, from director Peter Berg, who has worked with Wahlberg four times before, including on 2016’s criminally underseen Deepwater Horizon, to writer Brian Helgeland, who won an Oscar for his LA Confidential script before getting nominated for Mystic River. It’s also a story based around a much-loved private eye created by Robert B Parker, one who provided inspiration to crime authors such as Dennis Lehane and Harlan Coben. But it would take a master sleuth to detect any of that pedigree in the finished product.Wahlberg, slumming it before later this year starring in both a summer sci-fi thriller and an Oscar-bait drama, is Spenser, a Boston cop getting out of prison after assaulting a colleague he claimed was crooked. His plan is to leave the city and the ghosts within it but when the cop he attacked is found murdered, he soon gets sucked into a murky underworld of drugs, violence and corruption.It’s an action-comedy-mystery-thriller that manages to spectacularly fail at all the above, an algorithmic abomination that’s as coldly constructed as it is clumsily made. It’s actually surprising just how flat the whole thing is, given that Berg has experience with bigger budgeted films with a more ambitious scope, but there’s a deadening lack of spark to his direction here which he tries to hide with lively and recognisable soundtrack choices. The character of Spenser appeared in the 80s in a network show called Spenser: For Hire and one can see this envisioned as a franchise-starter for Netflix, given the wealth of stories from Parker and later Ace Adkins, who took over writing duties. But Berg never once shows us why this should be the case. Spenser is identical to every other wisecracking, punch-throwing, gold-hearted tough guy that we have seen before and the plot he finds himself up against is similarly tired.It’s a dusty, connect-the-dots plot that offers nothing in the way of surprise even if Helgeland, and co-writer Sean O’Keefe, try to include some throwaway references to fake news, gentrification and the opioid crisis. Spenser is paired with wannabe MMA fighter Hawk, a partnership that’s built up to be fractious but in actuality is bizarrely easy, the two getting on almost instantaneously, denying us of any quippy conflict. Playing Hawk is rising star Winston Duke, who broke out in Black Panther and then Us, but he’s given nothing to do here other than throw the odd punch, a strangely thankless role given how the character played such an integral part in the original Spenser series of books. There’s also a sleepwalking Alan Arkin as Spenser’s mentor, an unfunny turn from comic Iliza Shlesinger as his ex and Bokeem Woodbine, saddled with a predictably structured turn as his old partner. As Spenser himself, Wahlberg is coasting, sticking to a dog-eared playbook, as bored as we are watching him. A snappier script could have and should have found smarter ways to utilise a talented troupe of actors such as this but instead, they’re wasted, unable to lift the pedestrianism of what they’re saddled with.It just sort of sits there, desperately needing an injection of something: humour, style, better action, energy, life. Spenser Confidential will find an audience on Netflix, given Wahlberg’s involvement, but this is soulless bargain basement stuff."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fbdec9df917f970429698a3bbadc468fdd74c36/69_0_1498_899/master/1498.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ccb925476d6cff847961dd2c03c4340","title":"streaming international womens day female directors ida lupino","story":"Mubi is the one site marking the occasion, streaming Deniz Gamze Ergüven’s elegant, empowering coming-of-age tale Mustang as their International Women’s Day pick – though their rotating menu, to be fair, is more conscientiously inclusive than most. Right now, for example, you can stream Little Joe director Jessica Hausner’s meticulously ambiguous spiritual fable Lourdes, Claire Denis’s untamed, sensualist sci-fi High Life or Belgian director Isabelle Tollenaere’s short The Remembered Film, an inventive soldier study blurring and overlapping multiple wars, from their selection.Over to Netflix, which last year took a significant step by adding Films Directed by Women to its range of searchable genre categories: hardly a genre in itself, admittedly, but a useful shortcut for those looking to break out of their predominantly patriarchal viewing diet. The films most prominently highlighted under this banner aren’t deep cuts – at the moment, Greta Gerwig’s universally beloved Lady Bird, the original To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before and the fine Taylor Swift documentary Miss Americana get the top spot. It’s also a handy reminder of just how many celebrated Netflix Originals have been female-directed, ranging from Mati Diop’s mesmerising postcolonial ghost story Atlantics to Tamara Jenkins’s acutely observed marital drama Private Life to Kitty Green’s ingenious, form-busting documentary Casting JonBenet.As you scroll down, less expected highlights show up, including Beach Rats, recent Berlinale winner Eliza Hittman’s rawly moving study of unarticulated male queerness, and Fast Color, a beautifully conceived fantasy from director Julia Hart that bypassed UK cinemas to show up very quietly online. Suitable for older kids and their parents, its story of a supernaturally abled young woman (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) turning to her estranged mother and daughter for shelter – as shadowy pursuers seek to exploit her powers – reshapes superhero lore for a more erse real world.Finding less contemporary essentials from female directors, however, entails a bit more hunting. Beyond its fascinating silent-film omnibus Pioneers: First Women Filmmakers, which I’ve singled out before, Netflix is unsurprisingly not the place. Last year, the BBC took a large global critics’ poll to determine the 100 best films by women. It’s a useful starter canon, but it’s surprising how many high-ranking titles on the list – including Chantal Akerman’s Jeanne Dielman, Larisa Shepitko’s The Ascent and Barbara Loden’s Wanda – are unavailable to stream in the UK.Sorry We Missed You (Universal, 15) Ken Loach’s furious snapshot of Britain’s zero-hours economy and its human casualties is politically pointed as ever, but dramatically he’s off form, with flat characters feeling subservient to the message.Doctor Sleep (Warner Bros, 15) It fizzled in cinemas, but Mike Flanagan’s stylish, shivery sequel to The Shining isn’t the misguided folly it sounds like on paper. It’s a tribute that gradually cultivates its own meditative mood.Midway (Lionsgate, 12) The kitsch hypermasculinity of Roland Emmerich’s cotton-brained second world war epic gives it a certain camp zest – whole passages of it look like Tom of Finland for kids – but it does go on a bit.

After Kenny Dalglish claimed an 18th title for the Merseyside club, a 30-year drought followed. Sir Alex Ferguson led United to a 20th crown and the wait for a 21st will stretch into an eighth season. Both plunges occurred after the manager stepped away – Ferguson in May 2013, Dalglish in February 1991.When Pep Guardiola one day departs as Manchester City manager, the history of their two fiercest rivals may resonate for those charged with replacing him.Guardiola’s contract expires in June 2021 and the club’s two-year Champions League ban has renewed attention on his future. The coach insisted he was open to renewing his contract but so far he has never stayed at a club longer than his four years at the Camp Nou. The ban may be retained, reduced or scrapped but whatever happens City’s Guardiola endgame may be played out sooner rather than later. The appointment of a successor will be the most important strategic call of Sheikh Mansour’s ownership since Guardiola was hired in the summer of 2016.Last Sunday Guardiola claimed his sixth major trophy with City by winning the Carabao Cup. He is comfortably the most successful manager in their history. And yet a high-ranking executive insists the Catalan is not the most important person at City. The declaration spoke to a long-term strategy overseen by Khaldoon al-Mubarak, the chairman, and executed by the sporting director, Txiki Begiristain, and chief executive, Ferran Soriano. Their task is to ensure that whether Guardiola or AN Other manager is in charge, City’s underlying philosophy is maintained: in broad terms this is to play stylish football while accumulating silverware.Liverpool’s Boot Room provided them with highly successful managerial solutions in the past, and Mubarak, Begiristain and Soriano have in place an equivalent of sorts: the eight-club City Football Group, of which Manchester City are the flagship. In addition to offering Mansour a global reach, the CFG is a finishing school for prospective managers to take charge of its various teams.Patrick Vieira moved from leading City’s reserve side to become New York City FC manager in 2016. Nick Cushing departed as City Women’s head coach to become NYCFC assistant manager this February, and Erick Mombaerts stepped down from Yokohama F Marinos in January 2019 and took over at another CFG club, Melbourne City FC later in the year.The profile of the job, though, plus the pressure of following Guardiola, means if a homegrown replacement is desired to take over then rather than searching within, Mubarak, Soriano and Begiristain may look to lure back Vieira, who has been in charge of Nice since 2018, or Mikel Arteta, who was Guardiola’s assistant until leaving to lead Arsenal in December.Among contenders with no links to the club are Mauricio Pochettino, who got the better of Guardiola as Tottenham manager in an epic Champions League quarter-final, and RB Leipzig’s Julian Nagelsmann. They appear to be similar spirits in footballing terms.“They’ve created a spirit where everybody wants to be part of that journey. When a club is not run well, when there are too many people talking about who should be brought in, too many people talking about maybe even team selection, what do you do then? You attract the wrong type. And as a player you get a feeling when you speak to people at a club. You think: ‘Either something is growing or I go here because I get an awful lot of money and if it doesn’t work out, I will be off after 12 months.’” Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:www.thefootballaudio2020mar05dier-straits-the-fa-cup-and-coronavirus-football-weekly-extra-podcast To find a successful heir to Guardiola, Mubarak and City would have to be pioneers. A dynasty in the Premier League era is yet to be achieved. Ferguson’s feat was a generational success at United in the 1990s and 2000s but there was no smooth transition of dominance to an heir, as first David Moyes, then Louis van Gaal and José Mourinho failed to seriously compete for the title.Ferguson’s departure occurred concurrently with that of the chief executive David Gill and was compounded by the removal of key coaching staff – Mike Phelan and Rene Meulensteen – by Moyes. The culture imbued by Ferguson across a 26-and-a-half-year reign vanished, and a vacuum of leadership and direction prevailed.When Dalglish left, Liverpool believed all of this remained intact. A proud lineage that began with Bill Shankly’s arrival as manager in 1959 and ran through Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Dalglish, appeared safe when Graeme Souness became a fifth permanent No 1 in 32 years. Souness, a former captain who played under Paisley and Fagan and with Dalglish, was steeped in the club. With Roy Evans and Ronnie Moran on the coaching staff there was firm representation of the club’s vaunted Boot Room.Evans, who took over from Souness, says: “Continuity was a big part of our success because you were not getting major changes. When you’re changing managers for someone who hasn’t been at the club, normally it takes a while for them to blend in, though not too much with Jürgen Klopp at Liverpool.Hamann cites another of his former clubs, Bayern Munich, as an example that might lend itself to the appointment by City of an outsider such as Pochettino. Hamann says Bayern’s approach is predicated on a variant of the “family and friends” model at City. Its version is to look outside for star coaches – as with Guardiola (2013-16), Carlo Ancelotti (2016‑17), and Van Gaal (2009-11) – who walk into an operation teeming with former players in on- and off-field roles.As at City, those who take strategic decisions adhere to club ethos. “Not understanding the culture of Bayern Munich is absolutely impossible,” Kern says. “Tradition plays a very important role, since the times of Beckenbauer and Müller.“Without Ferguson, Manchester United would not have been the same. Success depends always on big personalities, and we had fantastic personalities a Bayern, and we will have in the future.”Here Kern hints at the complexity of replacing Guardiola. A manager will be sought with the ability to continue Guardiola’s unparalleled success, the personality to allow deference to club philosophy and the courage to follow a genius.As at Liverpool when Dalglish left, Barnes states that even with structures in place an appointment can backfire."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da591d12e459aaa3900b1e071307dc87d8d1fb6a/0_51_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76548c097fbf2a5c631e6fe2f6bd71ab","title":"from sous chef to security guard how the nation uses its smart speakers","story":"While more than one in five households now own a smart speaker, not everyone is getting the most out of their device. We asked some Amazon Echo users to share their most-used commandsSmart speakers have become a fact of life in the UK in 2019, so much so that in March this year, they were added to the list of items the government uses to accurately measure the cost of living.For some, the Echo is the perfect device to keep children entertained on a regular basis. Laura Moross, a PR consultant from London, explains that her family’s Echo is placed in the kitchen, so that she can use it when playing with the children or helping her kids with their homework.“At breakfast we can shout out song requests – everything from Baby Shark to G-Love and Special Sauce,” she says.Last Christmas, she says, she used the Echo to amuse her children by asking Alexa to track Santa’s whereabouts around the world, as well as asking: “Alexa, how many sleeps until Christmas?” Meanwhile, her children are also amused to hear the Echo’s various fart noises on demand.Meanwhile, Govind Dhaliwal, 31, from Milton Keynes, uses the device while he cooks – to convert units of measurement, and also as a timer.“I can run multiple Alexa timers simultaneously – and I can identify each one by giving them names, that way I know when to check on the food,” he says.Dhaliwal also uses the BBC Good Food skill from time to time to get specific recipes read out to him. He says that the “hands-free” element helps him to focus on cooking without having to keep washing his hands to revert back to a screen to read the recipe again.“It’s especially helpful as you can ask Alexa to pause the recipe while you carry out each part of the method and then carry on from where you left off,” he says.Kate Smith, 35, from London, asks Alexa to turn on her downstairs lights when she walks into the room. This works using a smart plug, which she has connected to her lamps.“It’s quite nice to walk in and be able to turn on the lamps to provide mood lighting, as we don’t use the main lights as much,” she says.In addition, Smith asks Alexa to add items to her shopping list, which can also be viewed on the Alexa app on her phone, meaning she doesn’t have to worry about forgetting her shopping list anymore.For Paul Granger, 67, from Derbyshire, the main reason he uses the Echo is to listen to Audible in his living room.“Since retiring I have more leisure time, and I enjoy being able to sit down and listen to one of my favourite books, while taking in the view of my garden at the same time,” he says.In addition, Granger uses Alexa to remind him to take his medication and to ask for the latest news from the . To do this he asks Alexa to open the , and then asks for the latest cricket headlines and the latest news on Brexit.There are also those that rely on Alexa to control their smart homes.Kelly Morgan, 23, from Hull, has connected her smart speaker to her smart lights, doorbell, camera and lock. This means she can ask Alexa to lock her front door without the need for keys. It also gives her peace of mind when she’s on holiday.“We keep the Echo on when we’re away, as the doorbell triggers Alexa announcements, and we also have scheduled the lights to go on at certain times to give people the impression that we’re at home,” she says.As our world becomes more connected, smart speakers will only prove more useful – perhaps, one day, even vital. But even in 2019, a mere five years since Amazon Echo first hit the market and took smart speakers mainstream, the question is less “What can I use my Echo for?” and more “What can’t I use it for?”Learn more about what you can do with Alexa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24b22eeab50acc7b9dfd2966c05a8568c6abde54/0_317_5200_3120/master/5200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df671746e64d79ac6e90201c3a3e058f","title":"can a shaman cure my insomnia","story":"I always rejected my mother’s ideas of chakras and balance. But on holiday in Bali, I saw a sign: healing this way“At the end of the session, Sami will tell you all your problems,” reads the outline of my meeting with a traditional Balinese healer, the fifth generation of shamans in his family. All my problems? How long has he got?I did not expect that a holiday in Bali would lead me to a healer, in search of an insomnia cure. The idea of chakras has never really appealed. I grew up with these concepts, having been raised in a mostly Asian community, by a mother who evangelised about mind-and-body balance. To this day, the smell of incense conjures up my childhood. But that was all the stuff of my elders who, in my teenage eyes, seemed stuck in the past. Later, I’d smirk when people called this stuff “new age”. New for who, exactly?But in Bali I saw a sign on the street: Healing This Way. And, perhaps moved by the sight of exquisite temples and their devoted attendees, combined with a when-in-Rome attitude and worsening sleeplessness, I followed that sign.As I write, I don’t know if it worked (Sami said to wait three days). I know that the full-body procedure was painful: the fingers prodded deeply for pressure points. And I know that when he “cleansed my energy” and said I shouldn’t criticise myself too much, nor worry about things I might have done wrong in the past because I did everything right, that I felt tears rush to my eyes. (Although I had also been punched in the butt for an hour, so that might explain it.)In the taxi home, I read about the placebo effect – how it is no longer seen as a medical failure, but an effective treatment for conditions in which the brain controls symptoms such as insomnia. If you can trick the brain into thinking it’s healed, it is. But I don’t remember much of the journey after that, as I slipped into a very deep sleep."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03f8d764e219290815cd0ca8ae9f14ffc6df10c9/0_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=896c9bb8225a747a464d765fff4403ae","title":"blind date paris petya olaf","story":"What were you hoping for?A pleasant conversation, a good meal and a fun story.Who was the most European?If we ide it into “old” Europe and “new” Europe, I suppose he wins.

Despite misgivings, we went aheadWhen my elderly mother came to live with us, a granny flat was not an option. She needed more space than the typical one-room studio. Being frail and disabled, logic might have dictated that she take over the ground floor of our home and we build an upper floor extension for ourselves – the kind real estate agents promote as a “parents’ retreat”.But, as a longtime top-floor apartment dweller used to expansive views, living downstairs did not appeal to her. She wanted her own self-contained area, with more privacy, away from our guest room and frequent visitors.Friends thought we were mad and tried to dissuade us from what they thought of as a Faustian pact taking on too much responsibility – and proximity – in return for a bigger house. We were, they told us, setting ourselves up for nothing but trouble.Aware of the downsides, we canvassed all the alternatives, including buying a flat close by, or Mum moving in to a residential care facility, but she balked at both suggestions as too daunting, expensive, depressing and isolating.Despite our misgivings, we went ahead, hoping that the project would renovate our often fractious dynamic and that Mum’s oft-stated desire for her own space and the opportunity to cook her own meals would make explicit conversations about boundaries and expectations unnecessary. I always was an optimist.Her brief was for an inexpensive, spacious, well-insulated and light self-contained apartment with a kitchenette and sitting room, all reached via a stair chair.Once plans were drawn, we held the usual beauty pageant tendering process interviewing builders. Only one – the youngest, it turned out – understood, despite introductions, that Mum was the client and spoke directly to her. All the others assumed we were paying (wrong) and making the decisions (wrong).Despite making it very clear who the boss was, they pushed the plans across the table to us, in front of her, without acknowledging her in any way, their attitude demonstrating the lack of agency that is so common when it comes to care of elderly people: often unconsciously we decide for them, without asking them directly what they want. We give children endless opportunities to express preferences but deny our parents the same right. Understandably put out, she cast her vote accordingly, choosing manners over experience.As the project progressed, Mum visited showrooms and pored over brochures and samples to choose every fixture, fitting and finish. Always keen to try new things and realistic about her limitations, she had definite ideas, such as deciding that an induction cooktop would mean she would neither burn herself nor leave the gas or electricity on.Being French, she was used to a bidet as an essential item of personal hygiene, but having lost her balance, straddling one was no longer possible. Instead, she decided on the contemporary alternative: a premium-brand Japanese toilet with a washing function.She chose a hand-held shower to make washing herself easier and suggested raising power points to waist height to make them more accessible whether seated or standing. A fan of technology, she opted for a front-door cameraintercom system that meant she could hear the (extra loud) doorbell, see and speak to visitors via her iPad and let them in (or keep them out) without having to move more than a finger.The only modifications we made to her brief were to persuade her to add an undercover deck area for gentle exercise as recommended by her physio, and an overflow spare room that could, if necessary, be converted into a bedroom for a live-in carer, if illness required us to call on long-term additional support, giving her a total floor area of 84 sq m. Unwilling to consider future frailty and wary of strangers, she agreed reluctantly.The most frustrating setback related to her desire to have a non-slip vinyl floor in the bathroom, instead of ceramic tiles, dictated by her entirely reasonable fear of falling and knowledge of the stats: most falls occur in bathrooms where hard surfaces make them potentially more severe.It turns out that there are compliance standards for flooring installation. Maddeningly, these vary from state to state. Although it is used in hospitals, the non-slip vinyl my mother wanted could not be installed in her home. We moved out for the build. When we moved back in, she expressed surprise at how the plans translated into reality.“Oooh look, I’m cantilevered,” she exclaimed, amazed the the gravity defying engineering of the bathroom. “Won’t it collapse?” she asked, and avoided that end of the shower stall for days.As soon as she buckled herself in, it became clear that the stair chair was a triumph: safe, quiet, smooth and precision-engineered, it wrapped around the staircase with sinuous discretion, a far cheaper and less intrusive option than a lift. As she rises through the air on her mobile throne, Mum waves regally.After a few days mastering the many washing and drying functions on the remote, Mum pronounced the Japanese toilet “delightful”.Some things have not worked out as planned: the kitchenette is virtually unused, except for the microwave if we are away. We had lowered the benchtops to accommodate a wheelchair but, while unable to stand at the stove, Mum is not ready to accept the alternative. Her intention of cooking for herself has not become a reality she glides downstairs for every meal. We have regained some privacy, but not as much as we’d hoped: although she has her own TV upstairs, she prefers to watch in our company. The juliet balcony with sweeping ocean and escarpment views from her bedroom remains unused perhaps it’s a little too high for someone whose balance is precarious.Within months, Mum felt at home. We drew satisfaction from being within reach when needed, while reclaiming our spare room to welcome friends to stay. Even the sceptics are impressed. All of them want a ride on the stair chair."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/148a21a960722f1dc77b73479f6c2dcbebbc796a/1033_1502_3569_2141/master/3569.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0bad07e2eba5229294c6003f379633c","title":"im a human calculator whats it like to be a child genius or to raise one","story":"Jeeva could read at 15 months. Luca could do his times tables in reception. Nathan had a book deal by eight. Meet the child prodigiesJeeva was British Mensa’s youngest member when she joined just after her third birthday. (Muhammad Haryz Nadzim, three, from Durham, beat her record earlier this year.) But Jeeva began impressing her parents when she was still a baby. At seven months, she started sounding out words like “cat” and “grandma” at 11 months, she finished bedtime stories, sometimes from memory, sometimes by recognising words and by 15 months was reading independently. Now, with an IQ of 160+ (the same range as Einstein and Stephen Hawking), she devours books like the Isadora Moon series, aimed at five- to eight-year-olds, or Enid Blyton’s The Magic Faraway Tree, reading in her head for up to an hour at a time, when most children her age are learning phonics.Her mother Malveen, is a dentist, and her father Hardeep, is an actuary. Both 32, they are high-achievers: Malveen has always been academic, gaining 10 A*s at GCSE and now studying for a postgraduate degree in orthodontics Hardeep gained a postgraduate distinction in actuarial science and is now studying wealth management. Jeeva also has an older cousin in Mensa.“Malveen has often called her a little Matilda,” says Hardeep, of the book-loving bright spark imagined by Roald Dahl. Jeeva, who has the comprehension and mathematical ability of a child twice her age, says: “I like reading and learning about things in the world and how they work.”She is chatty and sociable despite the fact that, for most of her babyhood she was the only child in her year group who could talk. “I wished they could, because then I could have lots more friends,” she says.Teachers at her private preschool (including Mrs Smart and Mrs Brain, their real names “It’s like a Mr Men book,” Jeeva is quick to point out) invite her to read to classmates. “No one else can read the words that I’m saying,” she says. She goes to gymnastics, and is learning chess and coding. She also has high emotional intelligence and describes feelings in depth. A simple question about her day can trigger lengthy conversations about outer space or how blood pumps around the body. Her parents limit screen time to once a week, during which she has watched the animated film Cars 2 and set her sights on becoming a racing driver, she tells me.Malveen remembers how she used to turn toys upside down to look at the workings: “We decided early on to ignore the age range on games – these immediately put limits on a child.” But when we discuss her intelligence, her parents are quick to remind her that she is kind, too. “We don’t want her to only be in one box: clever,” Malveen says. “My main thing is that she feels happy and fulfilled, because that isn’t always the case when chasing perfection. We model failure for her, making mistakes in front of her. We ask each day what her successes were, and what she failed at, and celebrate both.”“Most of all she loves to talk to us,” Hardeep says. “She’s always trying to crack a joke and is very playful. She’s just a child who needs to enjoy being a child.”“When I was six years old, my mum asked me what I wanted for Christmas,” Nathan says. “I asked for a book about how to be your best self. We searched online, and on bookshop and library shelves, but it didn’t exist. So the opportunity to write it myself was born.” He finished the book two days before his eighth birthday, recruiting Paralympic archer Danielle Brown as co-author after hearing her speak at a Mensa event. “We went to the book fair together,” Nathan says. “I told publishers the backstory and they said yes right there and then. I was very proud.”Nathan is plucky, eloquent – and more painstakingly polite than any adult I have met. “I’ve always been interested in self-development,” he says. “I want to spread that message to all children. Everyone I meet says this is rare for a child, but it comes naturally to me. I’m full of confidence and gratitude for my opportunities.”The book was published in the UK last year and launches in the US this month Nathan hopes motivational speaking bookings will follow. “I hope I get to fly all over the world,” he says. “That’s my dream – to travel and learn about different cultures. I want to go to Disneyland, and I’d like to stay with indigenous tribes to learn about plants and medicines.”Nathan now plays the piano at grade five standard his favourite composers are Bach and Beethoven. He is in a swimming team and a European title-holder in Brazilian jiu-jitsu (“I love the discipline and ethos,” he says. “It’s quite tactical, like 3D chess”). He also practises yoga and meditation: “It’s all about harmony and balance, to ground yourself after a busy day.” He watches TV only occasionally, usually David Attenborough documentaries, and is a “huge bookworm”, preferring books on geology, world history or motivational titles.Two years ago, Nathan’s father moved out of the family home, leaving him, his mother and two younger siblings, Simeon, eight, who is also in Mensa, and Oriana, three. Nathan says: “I think having a high IQ made it harder when my dad left,” he says. “I felt I should be able to understand, but I just can’t. We all have a story.”All three children are home-schooled. Their mother, Anna, 40, a lawyer and psychotherapist, says she was known as “the brains of the family” as a child, but frequently felt misunderstood. She didn’t start Nathan in mainstream education, but he attended for a year aged six, when she was unwell. His unhappiness led the family to visit an educational psychologist, who revealed the extent of Nathan’s intellect. Soon after that, Anna took him out of school again.“One school teacher nicknamed him ‘glum Nathan’,” Anna claims. “He hated every moment. The minute you mention intelligence, there’s a stigma a perception of silver-spoon upper-class kids on their way to Oxbridge, and a bragging, pushy parent. Gifted children can have barriers to break through and come from every background and life circumstance.”Nathan says: “I tried school, but no one understood my jokes or really got me. Everyone’s different. I try not to sweat the small stuff. I’ve got better friends now that I follow my passions instead of the crowd. I can discuss physics or marine biology with them, and they don’t make me feel weird.” He reels off a huge list of academic interests: Latin and classical studies Mandarin and Chinese Spanish, nutrition, debating, Stem subjects and psychology. He is working on his second book, too. “But I’m keeping the details a bit hush-hush,” he says. He thinks clever children are often misunderstood. “We’re more than brains on legs. We have hearts and souls, dreams and feelings, too.”Abbey lists her interests as architecture, space exploration, inventing and home science experiments, and is hoping for a place at grammar school next year. Her IQ of 144 was not tested until a year ago, when teachers called her parents into school, expressing concerns that she was depressed. Five minutes into an appointment with a private psychologist, her parents, account manager Belinda, 43, and Duncan, 45, a director of an IT company, were told: “This child is not depressed, she’s a genius.”Abbey is creative and methodical. At 18 months, she cut perfect circles with scissors aged two, she described a seven-mile car journey to her parents using simple directions (“go there, turn here”) because she wanted to visit a cafe, but didn’t know its name. At six, she would craft intricate fishermen and animals from tinfoil.While Abbey enjoys playing with her younger sisters, Cameron and Erin, she has not celebrated a birthday with friends since she was six, and has already moved schools once since emigrating from South Africa to the UK last year. “I see that I’m a bit different, but in a good way,” Abbey says. “If someone tells me I’m really clever, it makes me happy and proud, but kids can be mean. At break time, I like to talk about science and things, but the others like to play. Once they agreed to talk about maths with me, then ran away. That made me feel really sad.”Abbey is dyslexic and more comfortable in the company of adults, but has found like-minded friends through Mensa. “It’s easier to be with clever kids, because you can talk about stuff you like doing,” she says. “I usually finish my schoolwork so quickly that I have to do extra worksheets, fetch stuff from the printer or help others with their work.“In year one, the maths was really easy. I told my mum and she spoke to the teachers to ask for something harder, which she still does,” Abbey says. “I’m in a higher maths class than my friends. They finish their work as quickly as they can, but I want to stay in class longer. It’s fun and challenging when you’ve not seen something before and you get it for the first time.“At home, I love baking and cooking. My dad lets me cook dinner with him. I like reading animal encyclopaedias and trying experiments. I know, for example, that octopuses have three hearts – but what do they do with them? I watch TV, but mostly enjoy art and teaching my puppy, Simba, tricks.”Abbey shows me her sketch book, containing silhouettes of a boat and a page of perfectly spherical doughnuts, shaded with coloured pencil. In South Africa, she was spotted as a “future talent” by a Johannesburg art dealer, and has won competitions here, too. “I sold some of my art to the psychologist who did my assessment and asked for a microscope instead of payment,” Abbey says. “I won a hotel talent competition when I was little with a one-minute drawing of a unicorn.” This facility with art and science is not unusual among children with high IQs. Educator and psychologist Lyn Kendall, Mensa’s gifted-child consultant, explains: “Research shows that the majority of exceptionally able children are good all-rounders due to their highly competitive and driven natures. When they are younger, art may not be a strong point for them, but once their coordination develops, it becomes something else to excel at.”Abbey hopes to study at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the US, but her ambitions do not end there. “I’d like to go into space or build a hover car that flies over water and mountains,” she says.By the time Zayan was two, he could count to 100. Today he is in year two, but is given year five work. “Maths is my best lesson because it’s really easy,” he says. “My favourite part is doing ides in my head. In maths, my best friend does easy sheets. I do fractions and multiplications.” He enjoys other lessons, too. Excitedly, he says: “We’re learning about dreams and goals right now. Mine is to become an engineer. I would make stuff, like a Lego drill that can drill for metal.” He runs to get his favourite Lego creation: a 1,167-piece, VW Beetle for ages 16+. He is learning the ukulele and recorder, and enjoys using music apps. “I’ve got something where I can make any beats I want.” His mother and father, Sameela and Adeel, both 29, run a footwear business and were young parents. They are graduates, but wouldn’t describe themselves as being above average intelligence, and have found Zayan’s ability overwhelming. By three, he could count in four languages – Arabic, Urdu, English and Spanish – and knew the English and Arabic alphabets. “He’d hear something in Arabic once or twice at his grandparents’ and pick it up,” Sameela says. “He brought home a picture book from kindergarten and asked, ‘What kind of book is this, there are no words?’ He had a huge interest in numbers, and little quirks, too. He didn’t like foods touching on his plate, and would never get muddy.”It was only when his brother Raafi, four, arrived that his parents realised Zayan was different. Raafi hit milestones in line with most children and long after his brother had they were able to compare the boys’ behaviour, too. As well as an inquisitive mind, Zayan had the heightened emotions common in gifted children. At nursery, he experienced separation anxiety and would cry until he was sick. When Zayan was five, a psychologist confirmed an IQ of 150, the mathematical comprehension of a nine-year-old and the reading age of a 10-year-old.“At first I didn’t think he was gifted,” Sameela says. “I just needed help. I struggled with how to occupy him or answer his questions.” She sometimes feels obliged to play down his intelligence: “People stare or listen once they hear him speak. They ask what I do to make him so smart. When I say I don’t do anything, I often get a shocked face, as though I’m lying. The only thing we push him to do is to work on his confidence.”Now Zayan attends private school – a choice the family might not have made if he wasn’t so bright – but still struggles emotionally. “He’s never just gone somewhere and started playing,” Sameela says. “He stands back and analyses. His best friends are girls because they’re less boisterous. He feels safe with them, but has huge meltdowns. If they don’t need a boy for their princess game, he gets really upset, really quickly. Emotions are extreme. I book lots of clubs for him at lunchtime so he doesn’t have to deal with playtime.”In Zayan’s bedroom, his shelf is stacked with Roald Dahl and Horrid Henry collections he’s read them all. He shows me his newest invention – a “rocking rover” vehicle – and his toy drone. “I love flying my drone or paper planes,” he says. Today is Tuesday, which is homework day. “I’m glad when that’s out of the way. The worst thing about school is comprehension, and going up the tiring stairs. But the best thing is having a long lunchtime. And maths.”Luca was found to have an IQ of 158 when his academy tested its brightest year eight pupils – a recent offer to schools that Mensa credits with bringing in more young members. “They’d give a complicated word and ask for a synonym,” he remembers. “I’m not saying it was easy, but I just worked through.” He describes himself as a “human calculator”, and is now doing GCSE-level maths.“I like studying variables and I’d love to use my maths inside Nasa,” he says. “People think of astronauts, but I want to understand how rockets are programmed and engineered.” Chatting at home after school, Luca is initially reserved, but talks with enthusiasm about studying. “I love having my mind challenged,” he says. “I knew my times tables in reception. By year two, I was doing year six multiplication and long ision. I was years ahead, so they would give me algebra. I knew I was bright. We had maths puzzles at home and mum would turn everything into a game. She filled our house with books.”Luca lives with his mother Patrizia, 42, an immigration officer, father Mark, 45, a transport worker, and younger brother Simone, seven. Patrizia was also a bright child, but did not have the opportunities or encouragement to pursue her love of learning. “I didn’t realise the importance of it,” she says. “As a mum, I try to support him practically and emotionally. I make sure there are books to feed his appetite for knowledge, and explain why children can be cruel, because they don’t understand the importance of certain things or have the right values. Our greatest wish is that our child fulfils his dreams. Being in Mensa is opening a lot of doors.”That doesn’t necessarily mean job opportunities – Mensa’s consultant Lyn Kendall says that some members don’t put Mensa on their CVs as it can make employers wary. But it is a place to network: the organisation hosts social events for youngsters, has junior newsletters and web forums. Kendall also runs a Facebook group for parents. She says many don’t realise how gifted their children are until they begin education and socialising while they fit in in their own, often intelligent, households, others notice their precociousness and impose identities on them. “The minute they go out into the world, they get people saying, ‘Aren’t you clever?’ at the time when they’re building an identity. They often don’t know how to fail or how to study. A lot of them refuse school or drop out of university because of their fear of failure. Unless you’re very careful, they can grow up to be very fragile people.”Still, Luca says his maturity has left him feeling lonely. “No one likes a know-it-all,” he says. “Mum and dad have told me that being intelligent has negatives now, but will have positives when I do jobs that bring me happiness.”Luca enjoys computer games and watching fantasy and action films, like Men In Black. “I’m always looking below the surface, wondering how creators came up with those characters.” At weekends, he hangs out with his younger brother and parents, or does extra maths papers. He has “a couple of friends”, but rarely goes on playdates and is happiest taking tests. “When I’ve done well, I’ve made myself and my family proud,” he says.1,991 Members of Mensa, the high IQ society, who are under 1710½ Age at which children can sit the adult intelligence test, comprising verbal and non-verbal reasoning papers£250+ Cost of Mensa assessment with a private psychologist for younger children, using puzzles and games• If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine’s letters page, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8058ee13be03a775b8ad0bd7fb63ad1b36c2d073/393_27_3420_2052/master/3420.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b2df5ebd1b7154089f814bf63b7d566","title":"tim dowling taking youngest to garden centre","story":"There’s a wall of CCTV stills of men. The youngest one looks at me, eyes wide. ‘What the hell did they do?’It’s haircut day, that quarterly standing appointment when the hairdressing twins Kelly and Hayley come to our kitchen to do my wife’s highlights, and as many additional haircuts as there are heads. My wife still has a long morning ahead of sitting around in a foil helmet talking to Kelly and Hayley about coronavirus, but my hair is already cut and I’ve got places to be.“When I successfully replaced that rotten trellis last week,” I begin.“Here we go,” my wife says.“You should be pleased,” Kelly says.“I discovered the next bit along was also rotten,” I say. “So I need to buy another section.”“Take him,” she says, pointing to the youngest one as he walks in, also freshly shorn.“Take me where?” he says.“On an errand,” I say.“With daddy,” my wife says.“Look at his little face,” Hayley says. “He doesn’t want to go.”“Get shoes,” I say.It takes 15 minutes for him to find shoes and a coat, and drag his feet out to the car. “Where are we going, anyway?” he says.“I’m taking you to a secret garden,” I say.“Really?” he says.“Well, a secret garden centre,” I say.“What’s secret about it?” he says.“I’m never quite sure where it is,” I say. “We’ll need the satnav.”Halfway there, I begin to narrate our journey, a circuitous crawl through a light industrial hinterland, in the most magical terms possible, in order to keep up his fast-fading interest in the errand. He is 20 years old.“And this,” I say, “is the traffic jam of mystery. It’s always here, in the middle of nowhere, and yet no one knows why.”We drive down a long residential road that narrows progressively, twists pointlessly and ends suddenly, at a huge garden centre. At that moment, a violent hailstorm erupts.“Whoa,” the youngest one says.“See?” I say. “It’s like Frozen.”Inside, I give him the worst job: carrying a 6ft section of trellis up and down the aisles while I browse. Then I remember the aquatic centre. “You like fish?” I say. “Everybody likes fish!”I can’t believe I forgot about this when I was trying to sell him on the errand: a dark and cavernous annexe to the garden centre, accessed through a door near the seed display, featuring thousands of brightly coloured tropical fish, plus a big tank with giant carp you can feed.“Leave the trellis here,” I say. “And we’ll go in.”He puts it down, but doesn’t follow me. He’s transfixed by something at the entrance. “Have you seen this?” he says.“What?” I say, following his eyes. “Oh my God.” Next to the sliding door is a wall of photographs, CCTV stills of men – grown men, more than a dozen of them – who, according to the printed notice above, are forbidden to enter the aquatic annexe under any circumstances. The youngest one looks at me, eyes wide.“What the hell did they do?” he says.We stare at the photographs for a while, then go in to see the fish. On the way out, we look at the photographs some more. It’s hard to imagine a more sinister collection of faces. Or hats.On the ride home, with the sun now shining, we can talk of nothing else. “I can see that if a big carp swam over to you, it would be quite tempting to pick it up,” I say.“Would that get you banned, though?” the youngest says. “You’d have to do something more terrible than that.”“But not too terrible,” I say, “because you’re still allowed into the rest of the garden centre.”“I just can’t think what that would be,” he says.“Something perverse,” I say, “but fish-specific. They still trust you with the rakes.” We sit in silence for a while, pondering unspeakable, aquarium-based misdeeds. The satnav tells me to take the next left. I turn to the youngest one.“That’s basically back the way we came,” I say. “But I figure if we go straight on here, we’ll eventually find another route home.”“I’m up for it,” he says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de73a78294eb3da92a6931c2aea32787400e66e5/0_0_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a57ef7dc331d0faae31f2b292e0c842","title":"tell us are money struggles making you lonely","story":"We want to find out how people are feeling isolated by their financial woesWe may be bad at talking about money but we are arguably even worse at talking about our difficulties managing it.Research by the Money Advice Service found that half of people in debt did not want to talk to friends and family about it because they didn’t want to worry them.Money struggles can lead to people feeling cut off from others for a range of reasons, but withdrawing into financial loneliness can make it even harder to solve your problems.We want to understand more about how people feel isolated as a result of their financial woes.How has your employment status affected your income?

She died a few years later, while still in her teens or early 20s.In 1885, workers renovating the parish church of St Mary and St Eanswythe close to Folkestone harbour found a lead container of human remains in an alcove – probably hidden to avoid the destruction of relics during the Reformation.The bones, which comprised about half of a skeleton, were assumed to belong to Eanswythe. But it was not until January this year, following a grant from the National Lottery Heritage Fund, that a team of experts set up a temporary laboratory in the church, which was closed for five days.Initial analysis suggested the bones were consistent with Eanswythe: they came from one person, probably female, probably aged between 17 and 20, and with no signs of malnutrition, so potentially a person with high status.A tooth and a foot bone were sent to Queen’s University Belfast for radiocarbon dating. The tests confirmed it was highly probable the person died in the mid-seventh century. Fears that the remains might be part of a medieval fad for fake relics were allayed.Andrew Richardson, of the Canterbury Archaeological Trust, said: “It was a brave move by the church. We could have come out and said: ‘Folks, it’s not her.’ I was 50-50 about it, and a lot of colleagues were sceptical. But everything is consistent with it being her.”He said the result of the analysis was of national significance. “It now looks probable that we have the only surviving remains of a member of the Kentish royal family, and one of the earliest Anglo-Saxon saints.“There is more work to be done to realise the full potential of this discovery. But certainly the project represents a wonderful conjunction not only of archaeology and history, but also of a continuous living faith tradition at Folkestone from the mid-seventh century to the present day.”Lesley Hardy, the director of the Finding Eanswythe Project at Canterbury Christ Church University, said: “Folkestone is an extremely ancient place but much of its heritage has been erased through development in the 19th and 20th centuries. Eanswythe was at the centre of the community – people would have seen her as a local hero. To bring her back into the light is something quite special.”The findings were revealed at an event at St Mary and St Eanswythe’s on Friday evening. Andrew Plested, a church warden, said: “Obviously it’s what we wanted to hear.” He said he expected the relics to lead to an increase in pilgrims to the church.Funds will now be sought for further scientific analysis of the bones – including establishing DNA – and to ensure they are securely housed and displayed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/403184e30843625d011703c3feb16b5e157fc3e8/0_332_3192_1915/master/3192.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc0b234c72e3ace12257e09096039fdc","title":"scotland womens six nations game off player tests positive coronavirus","story":"Scotland’s match against France in the Women’s Six Nations on Saturday has been postponed after a member of the Scotland team tested positive for coronavirus, Scottish Rugby has announced.The Scottish women’s team returned from northern Italy on 23 February, after their match there was postponed.

The Scottish government has also been briefed.“Scottish Rugby has taken advice from the Chief Medical Officer for Scotland and the Scottish Government, but ultimately this decision to postpone rests with the rugby authorities.”The governing body’s chief medical officer, Dr James Robson, said: “We are pleased that our player is doing well and that all the correct medical procedures have been followed and continue to be followed.”The statement added that the fixture at Scotstoun Stadium in Glasgow will be rescheduled, with tickets for the original date remaining valid.The under-20 international was played on Friday evening in Galashiels, and there are currently no plans to reschedule the men’s Six Nations match at Murrayfield on Sunday.Earlier on Friday, Scotland’s chief medical officer had sought to ease public fears over the coronavirus outbreak, stating that outdoor mass gatherings are unlikely to result in the virus being passed on.Italy women’s home game with England, and their trip to Dublin’s Donnybrook to play Ireland, have been postponed, as with the corresponding men’s fixtures.

Wolverhampton’s Wulfruna Stakes will now be the best race shown on ITV. At least it may fall to an ex-jump jockey in David O’Meara, trainer of Gulliver (2.45).This six-year-old wouldn’t be up to winning every Listed race but this does not look strong and he’s been in fine form of late, turning in a career best at Southwell and running to a high level in Qatar. He is preferred to Urban Icon, who is a short price for a horse that has never raced on the all-weather and hasn’t been seen since July.1.35 Wolverhampton Fox Power is no less than 9lb better off with Via Serendipity for the half-length that separated them here a month ago, so it’s very tempting to just pick the grey to turn it around. But he hasn’t been finishing his races strongly and is a risk in a big-field handicap at a short price. Via Serendipity, on the other hand, has an attractive run-style for such a race and won over 13 rivals the last time he ran in an all-weather handicap.1.55 Ayr Let’s get into the spirit of Cheltenham by siding with an interesting Irish raider. Drumconnor Lad, a social runner when falling in the Kim Muir last year, has no secrets from the handicapper but is a fair force at a modest level. He won at Leopardstown over Christmas and should be ready to run to form once more.2.10 Wolverhampton The risk with Treacherous is that his last four wins have come at Kempton, so this switch to a different surface and a different configuration may be a problem. But he also ran to a high level when scoring at Newcastle early last year and is clearly the progressive one in this field, making him hard to oppose.2.30 Ayr It was mission impossible for Jessiemac when she was asked to take on Teescomponentstrig last time but no other horse has beaten her since summer and she hasn’t been raised for that second place.3.05 Ayr The Dutchman is one to be wary of on this return from a long absence but The Con Man is the one with the current form. Donald McCain’s runner was in a stronger race when fifth at Ascot last time and can pick up this prize.

Given my mum played tennis to a reasonable standard and was also a coach, it was inevitable we would end up playing.My mum has great energy and has been a workaholic ever since we were young, often getting up at 4am to start her day. She’s a role model for me through her determination, work ethic, and drive to do what she wants to do. Even now she’s still travelling everywhere and teaching on the court, trying to bring tennis to the masses and give kids, girls and female coaches an opportunity.I was coached by my mum from a young age and have had good experiences with female coaches throughout my tennis career. But when I became professional I noticed that basically every male player had a male coach and, in most cases, a male support team.When I was choosing a new coach in 2014 I wanted to work with an ex-player – I feel they can help a lot with the psychological side and understand the pressures of playing in, and winning, big competitions. Like me, Amélie Mauresmo had struggled with nerves and had got over that hump of winning major events, and I felt she would understand me in that respect.The reaction to Amélie’s appointment as my coach, even from people close to me, was when I realised there was a problem. The reason they were questioning her was purely based on her sex it was not because of her ability or what she’d done in her career.I did well with Amélie and reached grand slam finals, but a lot of people saw the period when we worked together as a failure because I didn’t win a grand slam title. People blamed her for that, but that wasn’t the case with my other coaches – it was always me who was the problem, and I would get the criticism when I lost. With Amélie, the questions I would get asked a lot of the time after losing matches would be about our relationship. I’ve never had that at any other time in my career.Out of all the global sports, tennis is the best in terms of equal prize money and male and female players competing at the same events. But the thing I find interesting is, rather than being celebrated, this is often questioned within the sport. It’s attractive to people watching, sponsors, TV, everyone, so don’t waste your time arguing about it let’s celebrate it and actually use it to our advantage to grow the sport around the world.The Olympic Games also has an important role to play in promoting gender equality. People love watching the Olympics because they see the best male and female athletes. They are entertained by the mix of athletes and that’s one of the reasons why it’s the most successful sporting event. When I first competed at the Olympics in Beijing in 2008, I went along to watch the badminton mixed doubles and absolutely loved it. Similarly, people love watching mixed doubles in tennis more sports should look at these formats and think about what they can do and what fans may want.When I played mixed doubles with Serena Williams at Wimbledon last year it was a good example of how the format draws a slightly different crowd to the sport. Normally when I win or lose at Wimbledon, people will come up to me and say “well done” or “bad luck”. But, with Serena, so many people said: “We loved seeing you and Serena playing together. It was brilliant.” People enjoy seeing that, and we should promote it. How can you not see that it’s a good thing?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e24ea05872bfd8a3644a556868b0cd7c7afd226/0_0_2164_1298/master/2164.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a07b160cecf8e4a912f8cc73876da7a","title":"my europe 27 things we love european union","story":"To celebrate Europe, writers in all 27 EU countries share a favourite place that evokes the spirit of their nationI often dream of the journey over the Taygetos mountains from the western coast of the Peloponnese peninsula to the town of Sparta. It’s a trip I’ve done many times, most recently with my family. You start by the beaches of Kalamata, where my daughter was born, and a mere 10-minute drive up a small winding road takes you into the mountains, with the white houses and sea below. This is the route Telemachus (Odysseus’ son) took to visit Menelaus and Helen, newly returned from Troy.It’s Greece, so these are proper mountains. The road crests at 1,600 metres, taller than Ben Nevis, and there is a Swiss chalet-style cafe here that serves good hot chocolate. We tend to stop a bit before, at the village of Artemisia, where the Theotokos taverna has a balcony overlooking a valley on one side and a spring on the other.Locals sell herbs and honey down by the spring and the waiters (the owner’s kids) fill up your jug from it. Just before Sparta is Mystra, the ruins of a Byzantine city (pictured). The top of its battlements is my favourite spot on Earth – mountains on one side, the white splash of Sparta on the other. All of history in one spot.Andrew BostockIt started with a mug. That was when I knew I’d been accepted into the fold at Capitano del Popolo, a bar and restaurant in the Umbrian outpost of Orvieto. I’d sought temporary refuge in the hilltop town after losing my job in Rome in 2016, and was soon enraptured by its charms. Capitano del Popolo quickly became my stomping ground, a convivial place to drink caffè latte from my personal mug – a gift from the wonderful owner and chef, Valentina Santanicchio – or enjoy one of her dishes, such as handmade pappardelle with wild boar ragù, while sitting on the terrace under an often-piercing blue winter sky and marvelling at the 14th-century palace across the square.Italy is brimming with history and culture, places to visit and things to do. Venice, Rome and Florence are itinerary staples, Orvieto less so. The town, with its imposing cathedral, fresh air, sublime views of the Umbrian countryside and friendships made, is now my number one place to escape to from Rome. I often describe Orvieto as a comfort blanket, which wrapped me in its warmth at a time when it was needed most.Angela GiuffridaThe Ostend seafront is one of the places in the EU to which the UK is (geographically) closest. This two-mile strip of Belgian coastline also offers one of the loveliest strolls in Europe. A five-minute walk from the railway station, the promenade starts with stalls selling fresh seafood and chips.Continuing west, the route passes seafront cafes, museums, belle époque houses, a modernist casino, the splendid Thermae Palace Hotel, a spooky sculpture in memory of the Ostendais artist Léon Spilliaert, and children pleased to be at a favourite Belgian beach. But it’s the sea itself that will keep you staring. A hypnotic expanse of water, shifting through black and white, with blue, green and gold reflections of the sky. You can’t see Margate on the British coast but it’s only about 65 miles away.When Charlotte Brontë arrived in Belgium in 1843, she wrote of her “prosperous and speedy voyage” from London Bridge Wharf along the north Kent coast and on to Ostend. Following the suspension of passenger services from Ramsgate 170 years later, there are sadly now no ferries to this windswept haven for passengers leaving England today. Thank goodness for Eurostar.Emily WaterfieldWarsaw’s Old Powązki cemetery captures better than almost any other place the essence of a continent that so readily defines itself in terms of its history. A resting place for generations of poets, writers and composers, the cemetery is most famous for its thousands of iron, bronze and stone tombs and sepulchral sculptures, as well as the chestnut trees, oaks and lindens that shelter you from the heavens above. But what captivates me most is the beauty and variety of the names of the great and the good of 19th- and early 20th-century Warsaw that lie below them.Many have wonderful foreign names that provoke nostalgia for a long-gone Poland that was genuinely multicultural: names like Paweł Pellizzaro, Henryk Leon Malhomme, Kazimierz Wolff-Zdzienicki, Wacław Malcolm-Morris, Matylda de Castellaz-Abramowicz. While others are, to me at least, simply glorious names in their own right: Fidelis Matuszewski, Jan Habdank-Stpiczynski, Karolina Semelman Neugebauer, Hipolit Flock and my own personal favourite, Felicjan Szmakfefer.Poland’s cemeteries are known for All Saints Day commemorations (1 November), when millions of Poles gather to lay candles on the graves of loved ones and national heroes. But I find the living’s habit of making the day about themselves can be irritating, and Powązki is best visited on a winter’s weekday afternoon, when you have only the dead for company – a perfect place to reflect on the future of a country and continent that refuses to rest in peace.Christian DaviesA defunct church is potentially an eerie place, but the former church of Absalon in Copenhagen’s hip Vesterbro district is always buzzing with life and laughter. In 2014, Lennart Lajboschitz, founder of the Flying Tiger retail chain, bought the building for £1.2m and exchanged the pews and altar for long tables, comfy sofas and a bar. Now around 700 people visit this community space every day: some come to enjoy a coffee, a chat and a game of backgammon or chess, others to work on their laptops.Every evening at 6pm up to 200 people gather in the main hall for a communal meal. At around £5 a plate, it’s an affordable dining-out option that attracts people of all ages and nationalities.Others come to attend one of numerous activities: yoga, tango lessons, quizzes, drag queen bingo, table tennis, dodgeball tournaments, bridge, life drawing, a writers’ workshop and crafts such as pottery and bookbinding. Some of these may also involve drinking Baileys … because, well, why not?Andrea BakI could spend all day on the Wuppertal Schwebebahn, a unique suspension railway system in Wuppertal. Which makes me a Schwebebahnliebhaberin (floating rail aficionado), a word as slinky as the monorail system itself, an elegant, airy, 13km engineering wonder which snakes its way through the Wupper valley (between Düsseldorf and Cologne), humming along the track between Barmen and Elberfeld, and must be one of the nearest experiences to flying.“Why drive, when you can float to work?” was the thinking at the turn of the 20th century, when commuter numbers were growing and construction work on it began. Industrialisation had caused the western German region to develop so quickly that there was no room for broader streets to take the increase in traffic, and so the decision was made to go high. Steel girder construction was all the rage at the time – Paris got its Eiffel Tower, Wuppertal its floating railway, complete with the strident green limbs that give it its height and majesty.The Kaiser and his wife took a ride on it in 1900, hence the Kaiserwagen (carriage 5) with its velvet upholstery and gold trimmings, which has since been restored and can be ridden at weekends. An even more famous journey was undertaken by a circus elephant called Tuffi, who was put on it as a publicity stunt in 1950 but panicked in the overcrowded carriage and plunged into the river Wupper below. She survived with only minor injuries, as did her story, which has been retold to German children ever since.Not only is it a pleasure to ride – ideally kneeling on a seat at the back looking out of the window on to city and river life below – but also very efficient, with a train running every four minutes and reasonably priced (€2.90 for an adult single, €7.20 for 24 hours). It remains the transport of choice for Wuppertalers, moving around 25 million passengers a year.Wuppertal is also home to the dance company of the late choreographer Pina Bausch, and the Schwebebahn features in the 2011 film Pina, Wim Wenders’ tribute to Bausch.Kate ConnollyIt’s not the tallest structure in Bulgaria. It’s not even the tallest TV tower in the country (that accolade goes to Rousse). But Kopitoto, or the Vitosha Mountain TV Tower to give it its official name, has defined Sofia’s skyline since the mid-1980s.Most people are quick to laud Kopitoto (which means “the hoof”) for the spectacular views it offers over the city – it stands at 186 metres (about double the height of Big Ben) on an outcrop of the 2,290-metre Vitosha mountain, around 20km from the city centre.As a sucker for brutalist architecture, I’ve always loved the sheer scale of this concrete marvel of engineering, which is hexagonal in shape – but with three of the six sides extended, it appears almost triangular. From the 1960s until the beginning of the 90s, there was a cable car that took you up the mountain. Now the defunct graffiti-laden terminus station, right next to the TV tower, attracts urban explorers. My only regret is that it doesn’t do tours. • Svetoslav Petrov, editor-in-chief of Boyscout magazine in BulgariaThe lifeblood of the trendy Letná district, Bio Oko cinema is the perfect place to immerse yourself in Czech culture. When I arrived a decade ago, I was here all the time, devouring every Czech-produced movie I could, trying to get to grips with the country’s dark history and offbeat humour. But it’s far more than just a cinema, and the bar outside the deckchair-strewn auditorium is a great hangout. It’s ideal for a quiet espresso during the day, but in the evening it springs into life with hip locals spilling out from the tables all the way up the stairs, drinking craft lager and eating delicious homemade quiche.The walls are lined with old communist-era movie posters, and many of these original prints are available to buy at the Terry Gilliam-inspired shop, Terry Posters (in sister cinema Kino Svtozor), from as little as €6. Mark PickeringIt’s fair to say that a few years ago Douglas Street, in Cork’s south inner city, an area blighted by the ill effects of anti-social behaviour, did not have the best of reputations. Walk along it today, however, and the historic thoroughfare, just five minutes from the city centre, has significantly been transformed.At the western end is the oasis of Nano Nagle Place, a former convent that in 2017 was converted into a complex that celebrates the extraordinary life of the eponymous 18th-century pioneer of Catholic education. There is a museum, a garden and a “sustainable foods cafe”, the Good Day Deli, in an airy modern glass pavilion.At the eastern edge is the primary engine of the area’s positive change: Coughlan’s. An almost 200-year-old “backstreet old man’s bar” taken over by musician and creative force Edel Curtin in 2012, Coughlan’s – which with pure Cork perverseness is pronounced “CAW-lans” – has since become the award-winning best music venue in the country.The intimate listening room in the formerly unloved lounge bar has a total capacity of no more than 65 seated, and yet Coughlan’s has managed to attract star American singer-songwriters Anaïs Mitchell, Ryley Walker and Sarah Jarosz, and leading Irish musicians such as Lisa O’Neill, Glen Hansard, Lisa Hannigan and Mick Flannery.It’s like a major venue in a music-savvy friend’s sitting room, with the added bonus of – so Coughlan’s claims, and with some justification – the best pint of stout in Cork.Philip WatsonThe village of Pyrga lies between Nicosia and Larnaca in the east of Cyprus. It’s a pretty place, the sort that Peter Mayle might have settled in had Provence not got him first. As it is, Pyrga’s only claim to fame is that it is home to a remarkable stone building. It could be mistaken for an old storeroom, except the gothic detail above the door hints at something more special. This building is a medieval royal chapel.Inside, damaged but beautiful frescos look as if they have been transported from medieval France. They tell the story of the marriage of King Janus to Charlotte de Bourbon in 1411, and betray the fact that Cyprus was a medieval French kingdom. Its rulers were the Lusignans, cousins to the English Plantagenets and as the chapel’s garrulous caretaker will tell you, Queen Charlotte is an ancestor of the UK’s current queen.Cyprus has not always been comfortable with its medieval heritage. For some, celebrating this French period and subsequent Venetian rule undermines the claim that Cyprus is a Greek island. Yet the Lusignans and their heirs left some stunning monuments, which easily overshadow the Roman remains at sites like Kourion. Apart from Pyrga, Kolossi and Limassol have two of the most intact Crusader castles , and the capital, Nicosia, is encircled by massive Venetian walls.Most dramatic of all, in the middle of Nicosia, sits the huge 13th-century French gothic Cathedral of St Sophia, which was converted into the the Selimiye Mosque in 1570. For a lover of medieval culture like myself, these gothic churches – many of which have been converted into mosques or subsumed into Byzantine structures – make Cyprus an unexpected revelation.Michael Paraskos, novelist and lecturerTwo former railway sheds are now home to one of the most exciting cultural spaces in Luxembourg City, which is aimed at sharing ideas and fostering new talent. Built in 1877 to store steam locomotives, the Rotondes remained underutilised throughout the 20th century (one was a warehouse, the other a bus garage). A decade ago the ministry of culture started to renovate these national monuments to host cultural activities, reopening them five years ago.The Northern roundhouse now hosts exhibitions, lectures, dance, secondhand markets and other events. The Southern roundhouse is a dark, cosy bar that holds quiz nights, concerts and theatre performances. The building between them houses Radio ARA, where I work.Once winter is over, the outdoor courtyard is filled with pallet furniture and people drinking and eating – bankers, hipsters, mums, musicians – the place is a magnet for all types, like Luxembourg itself.Wendy Winn, radio presenterRiga is an architecturally eclectic place with an incredible variety of coexisting styles: you can see the finest examples of art deco, alongside brutalist Soviet architecture and neoclassical buildings. One of my favourite places to visit is Riga Central Market, a Unesco world heritage site on the banks of the Daugava a few hundred metres from the old town. It’s a wondrous blend of art deco and neoclassicism, and when it opened in 1930 it was recognised as not only the largest, but also one of the best marketplaces in Europe.The five pavilions are former zeppelin hangars, and beneath each cavernous ceiling is a specialist market selling vegetables, dairy, meat, fish and local specialities. Riga doesn’t have a historic cafe tradition like Paris or Vienna, but the place to meet artists and bump into writers or musicians is the Cafe Osiris restaurant, which has had a loyal clientele for 25 years. Owner Andrejs Žagars says: “It’s the only cafe that reflects part of Riga as it was at the beginning of the 1990s. This place ... is an authentic proof of the time when Riga was changing, when Latvia was changing.”With its simple yet refined menu, Cafe Osiris is one of my favourite places to eat in the city, and we’ve used it to host Riga Biennial dinners for visiting artists on many occasions.Agniya Mirgorodskaya, founding director of the Riga Biennial FoundationAs the Eurostar makes its way through northern France’s post-industrial heartland, passengers en route to Paris or Brussels just want to be on their way, which is a pity. In Roubaix, one of the grittier towns in a region once famous for its mines and factories, sits a jewel called La Piscine, an art deco swimming baths transformed into a museum. It doesn’t look much from the outside, but step into the pool hall, with its mosaic tiles and enamelled-brick showers, and the starburst stained-glass windows cast a magical glow over a collection of nude statues and sculptures from various artists and periods posed around the pool.When I visited for the first time, the museum was almost empty and the effect was breathtaking. The frozen figures look as if they’re about to take – or have just taken – a dip in the rippling water.There is more to La Piscine: its permanent collection, which has now been extended into a former factory next door, includes works by Giacometti, Rodin, Claudel and Picasso. But the pool hall alone is worth the visit. Get off the train at Lille and take the metro for 30 minutes to Roubaix. Paris and Brussels can wait.Kim WillsherUnlike most European capitals, Bratislava is not overcrowded. Even so, it’s hard to believe that, tucked just behind the Eurovea shopping mall, there’s such a relaxing, crowd-free spot. I discovered this Danube river walk when I was working in the city and would slip off at lunchtime to stroll beside the water and watch the ducks foraging for food. There are usually couples and colleagues picnicking along the bank, but it’s also dotted with great cafes and restaurants. My favourite is Primi, a chic, Mediterranean-style eatery that serves terrific sea bass and bowls of tasty gazpacho. I actually had my first date with my now husband here – it must have had a certain kind of magic.If you head over Starý most – a newly renovated pedestrian and tram bridge – the opposite bank offers an incredible view of Bratislava castle, especially dazzling at sunset. The “botel” and restaurant Dunajský Pivovar offers a good gawping spot, as well as some excellent Slovakian cuisine. For the complete Bratislava experience, order a plate of traditional halušky (potato dumplings with sheep’s cheese) and a summery pint of the homemade brew. Markéta HorváthováWay up north, surrounded by meadows and forests, the border between Sweden and Finland consists of lively rapids called Kukkolaforsen, part of the larger River Torne. The area has a long history of log-driving, war and smuggling, and four languages are spoken here: Swedish, Finnish, Sámi and Meänkieli – a minority language closely related to Finnish. Midsummer the sun is up all hours at midwinter it never rises.The tiny village of Kukkola is the unofficial sauna capital of Sweden. I warmly recommend a sweaty session in the village sauna, a large log cabin that can accommodate 65 fiery enthusiasts on three levels of long benches, heated by a large aggregate that holds 600kg of stone. Afterwards you can take a cooling dip in the stream, then head to the local inn for specialities like moose, gravadlax in a cup and coffee cheese with cloudberries.For a historic sauna experience, follow the river north a bit to the aromatic 300-year-old smoke sauna of Matkakoski – thought to be the oldest sauna in Sweden still in use. Nearby you can fish for whitefish and salmon and forage for berries and mushrooms. Jens Linder, chefVisitors are always impressed by Tallinn’s old town and fall in love with the local cuisine. But, when they venture out of the city they’re even more amazed by the open spaces, untouched nature, long empty beaches, and bus stops seemingly in the middle of nowhere.Estonia is small (about a fifth the size of the UK) and around half of the country is covered in forest, making it very easy to escape and not see another person. Approximately one-fifth is protected under its five national parks and nature reserves. A network of hiking trails crosses the country, quite literally off the beaten path. Lahemaa national park has a mix of forest, bog and seashore Kõrvemaa nature reserve is great for birdwatching and Soomaa national park is unique – it floods every year, so is only accessible by kayak.But my favourite national park is Matsalu, known for birdwatching – it is home to over 200 different species. In spring the trees come to life with the sound of thousands of birds chirping. The birdsong is indescribably beautiful it’s like a symphony and therapy for the soul. Like many Estonians, I have a country house that I escape to – mine is near Matsalu and has a hot tub and sauna for soaking in post-exploring.Kristina LuppBudapest has long been marked by grand cafes, pastry shops and, above all, by the Danube flowing between the steep hills of ancient Buda and the expensive villas of Pest on the other side, comprising a wild profusion of building styles.In the heart of Pest there is a small interior courtyard: 10 Magyar utca.You can cut through it by day, proceeding through the quiet Magyar utca gate, stepping over silent wooden cobbles, to the busy Múzeum körút. Built by Miklós Ybl in 1852, four years after the failure of the 1848 revolution and 15 years before the establishment of the Austro-Hungarian empire, the courtyard is an eclectic, beautifully proportioned, faintly Venetian blend of classic and romantic.Much of Budapest is empire grandeur under bombardment. This is not. There are spaces that hold you through colour, air, texture and proportion. The first time you see Giotto’s Pazzi Chapel in Florence, you feel it.If Budapest has a humane soul, it is something like this. You breathe differently here. You hope for more. George SzirtesOne of my favourite places in Bucharest is the National Museum of Contemporary Art (MNAC). It was here that I discovered avant-garde Romanian art, which has flourished ever since the 1970s, when dictator Nicolae Ceausescu stopped imposing the socialist-realist style.The museum is in the neoclassical Casa Poporului, or the Palace of the Parliament, the second-largest government building in the world after the Pentagon and the embodiment of Ceausescu’s ego and ambition: building it required an entire neighbourhood of about six square kilometres to be bulldozed and 57,000 families relocated.Getting to the museum is an adventure in itself, especially if you’re wearing high heels, as it’s a walk of a good seven minutes from the gates to the entrance.It’s not just the contrast with the totalitarian undertones of the Palace that sets MNAC apart. On the top-floor terrace of the museum, you can enjoy a glass of lemonade or an occasional gig, and take in the best view of Romania’s isive new People’s Salvation Cathedral, which cost the country about €400m. Paula ErizanuHook of Holland is an odd place to love. Go there and look south, and you’ll see one of the densest concentrations of industry in Europe: giant cranes, chimneys smoking like upturned cigars, and massive cargo ships rumbling their way from the Rhine into the North Sea. Yet head north and you’ll see something different: an arc of empty white sand stretching for miles. On a sunny day, you could almost be in Thailand.The appeal lies partly in the beach’s beauty, but also in the way it captures the spirit of the Netherlands: beautiful but industrious, peaceful but dynamic. It’s a crossroads where culture and history have always blended, like ingredients in a cocktail.I first came to the Hook a decade ago, soon after I moved to the Netherlands, when I lived just up the coast. Later, my wife and I were married in the sand dunes. Now, I come here often with our little daughter and watch her play in the waves. Sitting on the sand with a plate of fresh fish, we’re nearly as close to Essex as Maastricht. Britain feels tantalisingly close, yet also very far away.Ben Coates, author of The Rhine: Following Europe’s Greatest River from Amsterdam to the Alps (John Murray Press, £9.99)If you’re a wise enough traveller to know that Slovenia is well worth a visit, then you’ll be sure to see the delightful capital, Ljubljana, and will doubtless head off to fairytale Lake Bled, dolloped by a church-topped island and with a Grimm castle looming on a clifftop above it.The question, then, is: what else you should see, beyond the Big Two attractions? My favourite place in my adopted homeland is the medieval town of Kamnik. Once a far more important city than Ljubljana, it was the feudal stronghold of the Bavarian Andechs clan, who made it a stop on trade routes between Budapest in the east and Venice to the west.Today the town boasts three castles, hiking trails close to the centre, an important rare books library, rich industrial heritage (the KIK factory here once produced much of the gunpowder for the Austro-Hungarian army and the Stol factory exported Thonet rocking chairs to the US), and may have the most microbreweries per capita in the world (six for a population of around 10,000). At the foot of the Kamnik-Savinja mountain range, it is also an ideal gateway to the sunny side of the Alps, a 10-minute drive from the Velika Planina mountain plateau , the closest you’ll get to Middle Earth in Middle Europe. Noah Charney, author of Slovenology: Living and Traveling in the World’s Best CountryMy favourite place in Vienna – and indeed in Austria – is one that conjures up the most vivid image of the former multi-ethnic and multilingual western half of the Habsburg empire: the chamber of the former House of Commons (Sitzungssaal des Abgeordnetenhauses) in the old Imperial Parliament (Reichsrat). It’s largely unused since the collapse of Austria-Hungary in 1918 (except for the swearing-in of the president) miraculously, it also escaped wartime bombing.What is splendid and moving about it, aside from its size, beauty and sense of history, is the fact that representatives from almost all parts of the empire gathered there from 1883. German speakers from Austria itself and also from Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia, Carniola and Bukovina, as well as Czechs, Slovenes, Croats, Serbs, Poles, Ukrainians, Italians, Romanians and even one member of the Jewish National Party, all elected on the basis of universal male suffrage after 1907, met in this chamber. For all the linguistic chaos and political isions, the riotous and boisterous filibustering, the subterfuges and boycotts, it somehow functioned as the world’s first multinational parliament.In 1918 it became redundant and the inidual nations went their own way, leaving the leaders of the new Austrian Republic too few to fill the former Imperial Chamber. Subsequent decades saw conflict between many of the nations that had been part of Austria-Hungary, culminating in the Balkan wars of the 1990s this chamber is reminiscent of gentler times, when all nations of the monarchy – no matter their disagreements or even hatreds – were able to contain themselves in a usually civilised arena rather than resort to violence.The modern-day EU parliament, with its 705 MEPs representing 27 countries, is perhaps its heir, though it lacks its magic and gravitas.At the moment, the Imperial Parliament building is closed for rebuilding and refurbishment, and will remain so until 2021. The glorious former House of Commons chamber itself will undergo a mere clean-up and a few repairs, and will return to its full splendour.Christopher BrennanMO museum, which opened in October 2018, changed everything in Vilnius. Not only is it an incredible place for Lithuanian modern art, it’s also an example of new-wave Lithuanian philanthropy. The museum was funded by two Lithuanian scientists and designed by architects at Studio Libeskind. It’s a striking building, at the intersection of the old town and the city’s more recent westwards expansion.MO museum recently had a wildly successful exhibition called The Origin of Species: the 1990s DNA. I went four times, because it really was a way to relive our recent history – the wild 1990s, the starting point of capitalism in Lithuania, the foundation of our modern, democratic state.You could relive experiences such as trying on new jeans in winter while standing on a piece of cardboard in Gariūnai (the infamous open-air market 20 minutes outside Vilnius) buying one cigarette from a kiosk and watching movies on a VHS player.There are permanent exhibitions of Lithuanian modern art as well – my favourite painter is the postmodernist Šarūnas Sauka. The museum also has a boutique cinema, a cafe and a small shop full of great Lithuanian art, jewellery and books. At the moment, preparations are being made for a huge exhibition showcasing the works of cult British film director Peter Greenaway. Artificial rain is said to be part of the show’s experience. Neringa RekasiuteTwo or three times a week for the past 18 years, I have shopped in Barcelona’s Santa Caterina market. It’s a social event as much as a shopping expedition and not somewhere you can go in a hurry because there are always updates on children, illnesses, operations and deaths to be discussed. It has a very Mediterranean, familial vibe.I often have breakfast in the market bar, Bar Joan, a family affair run by Joan and his sons and daughters. They know their customers well and no sooner do I pull up a red vinyl stool than one of them is fixing me a café con leche and calling to the kitchen for a bikini (toasted ham and cheese). They also make a fine tortilla de patatas.One morning I sat next to a man who breakfasted on tripe and beer followed by a carajillo (coffee with a splash of cognac). Spanish men of a certain age often kick off the day with a hit of booze, frequently red wine. Even after living here for 20 years I can’t imagine drinking wine at 8am, which is probably just as well.Stephen BurgenIn Malta’s capital city there are more than 25 churches displaying incredible baroque paintings and architecture. In the oratory of the church of the Order of St John, which is a true gem of high baroque, there is a painting that I really admire and always moves me: Caravaggio’s Beheading of St John the Baptist.Included in the ’s list of the 10 greatest works of art ever, and once described as “the painting of the 17th century”, it is as alive now as it has ever been, and with a message that is still relevant: life and death, youth against old age, the contrast of colours, with light and dark captured by the astounding chiaroscuro technique of the eccentric genius. It reveals not only the story but the very self of the artist, and engulfs the observer in its theatrical action, sparking our emotions too.There are many historical sites to visit in Valletta – the Grand Master’s Palace, Casa Rocca Piccola (a “living” 16th-century palazzo), the Malta National Community Art Museum – but Caravaggio’s masterpiece is the one I always come back to. A visit to the cathedral and its oratory is by far the highlight of the Valletta experience.Fra Nikola Soukmandjiev, diplomat, priest and tour guideThe air is heavy with the scent of wild rosemary, sage and pine as I cycle along the path that skirts Lošinj’s north-western headlands.They call Lošinj “the island of vitality”, and this is more than mere marketing guff. Wild herbs blanket this long, spindly island that dangles into the Kvarner Gulf south of Rijeka, and the smell of them instantly gives me a lift during my meandering bike ride through the pines.Every now and then I park my bike and plunge into the impossibly clear water. I love the fact that the beaches that ring Lošinj are – like most of those in Croatia – pebbly rather than sandy. Some of them take a bit of effort to reach, usually involving a long hike down a rocky trail, if you don’t have your own boat.This all adds to the rough-and-ready ruggedness you get away from the big beach resorts. Simplicity is the key, and you can taste it in the grilled fish served at waterside restaurants and the giant rounds of bread baked under a cast-iron bell.It’s this gentle assault on all the senses that I appreciate every time I go to Croatia’s Adriatic coast – from the vivid blue-green of the sea to the heady fragrance of herbs and pine that have been baked in the heat. Total bliss.Mary NovakovichWhen democracy returned to Portugal in the spring of 1974, the Portuguese celebrated by throwing themselves into building a “modern” nation state (with the aid, later, of EU funding). While I love the bright lights and cosmopolitan vibe of Lisbon and Porto, it is the vestiges of “old” Portugal that really enchant me. To find them, just step into any neighbourhood pastelaria (cafe-bakery). You’ll find the day’s newspaper on a table, the footie on the TV and friends shooting the breeze over average-tasting but cheap (less than €1) café expressos.In Portugal, pastelarias double as repositories of local pride. Aside from the ubiquitous pastel de nata (the famous creamy custard tart, now available in M\u0026ampS), every self-respecting Portuguese town boasts its own speciality sweet. Cernache do Bonjardim has its almond cartuchos (shells) Castro Daire its bolo podre (literally, “rotten cake”) Chaves its meat-filled pastel. My favourite is the sugary, eggy palha (straw) sweet from the historic city of Abrantes in the centre of the country. For the real deal, head to Confeitaria Palha de Abrantes on the main square: Portugal, in a single bite. Oliver BalchThe Midnight Sun Film Festival, established in 1986, enjoys a stellar reputation among cinephiles and moviemakers. A true celebration of the craft, the five-day festival skips the red carpets and invites the audience and acclaimed international directors to the small village of Sodankylä, in Finnish Lapland, to enjoy the round-the-clock feature film screenings each June, when the sun blazes above the horizon day and night.The programme ranges from premieres and rarities to classics and oddities, from silent films to karaoke singalong shows in a former circus tent. The morning discussion sessions with directors are a much-loved tradition, but not everybody makes it to those – the price of wrecking one’s circadian rhythm with high doses of sunshine.The laid-back atmosphere and lack of hierarchy encapsulate something of the Finnish propensity for happiness (Finland has topped the world’s “happy league” for the past two years). At an intimate festival whose whole ethos is to celebrate a love of cinema, one feels comfortable sharing a drink, a story or even a sauna with a random film buff or a world-famous film director – former guests include Francis Ford Coppola, Mike Leigh and Terry Gilliam.

In the wake of the surprising setback, the US senator from Vermont is repurposing his insurgent pitch for the White House on several fronts.They include a renewed push for dominance in the midwest before a crucial primary in Michigan on Tuesday. Sanders is also discarding his  aversion to negative political campaigning and sharpening his attacks on Biden, running TV attack adds over the former vice president’s record of supporting social security cuts and free trade agreements, which could be particularly damaging in the Midwestern states.In addition, the campaign is scrambling to make fresh appeals to African American and older voters, electoral groups that both came out heavily for Biden on Super Tuesday, when he swept the south and won 10 of the 14 states at stake.The Sanders team signalled that it was shifting focus to the midwest when it canceled a planned rally in Mississippi. Instead, the candidate headed to Michigan for an event on Friday night.The move was a tacit acceptance that Biden now has a stranglehold on southern states, propelled by his popularity among black voters. It was also recognition of the high stakes of the primary in Michigan, with its rich pickings of 125 delegates out of the 1,991 needed to win the nomination.Sanders sees Michigan as a chance to regain his stride after the knocks of Super Tuesday, having beaten Hillary Clinton there in 2016. He hopes that his focus on policies appealing to working-class Americans, such as a federal $15 minimum wage, will play well not only in that state but across the rust belt in Illinois and Ohio, which hold their primaries on 17 March.“Michigan is an enormously important state,” Sanders said in a post-Super Tuesday press briefing in his home town of Burlington, Vermont. “The people of Michigan were devastated by trade agreements which I vigorously opposed and Joe Biden supported.”No matter how much of a bounce he enjoys in Michigan, Sanders faces threats as the race enters its next punishing phase. In particular, the Super Tuesday results exposed a fundamental failure to expand the Democratic base by bringing in millions of new voters.Sanders was in a reflective mood after the Super Tuesday result. “It is not easy trying to bring in people who have not been involved in the political process,” he said. “Have we been as successful as I would hope in bringing young people in? The answer is no.”John Della Volpe, director of polling at the Harvard Kennedy School’s institute of politics, whose researchers has been studying the youth vote since 2000, reviewed exit polls from 12 of the most competitive elections. While turnout overall was up in all of the 12 states compared with 2016, the pattern for young people aged 18 to 29 – the very core of the Sanders revolutionary army – told a different story.“For any candidate to be the nominee of the Democratic party they have to build a broad and erse coalition across gender, race, age and educational levels,” Della Volpe told the . “It’s terrific that Bernie Sanders is building such a great relationship with young voters, but he needs to maximise that support and then expand beyond it, and that’s not what we are seeing.”Sanders partially blamed his difficulties in mobilising a wider coalition of support on his enemies in the “corporate media” and “establishment politics”. As he told Rachel Maddow on MSNBC: “One of the problems we have is that people say, ‘Bernie is an extremist’. There is nothing we are fighting for which is extreme. It is what the American people want.”But there is danger for Sanders here too. By doubling down on his attacks on the media and the “Democratic establishment” he risks reinforcing the stereotype of himself as a grievance-ridden politician promoted by that same media and Democratic establishment.“That rhetoric, in my view, signals to voters that he’s a factional candidate,” said Mark Longabaugh, a Democratic strategist who advised Sanders in 2016 but is unaligned in 2020. He said such critiques distract from his core economic message, which remains popular with Democrats and independent voters alike.Behind the scenes, there are indications that the Sanders camp are attempting to address the candidate’s weakness in the two demographic groups that have flocked to Biden – older voters and African Americans. Sanders’ campaign co-chair, Ro Khanna, told Politico it would be emphasising healthcare issues for seniors as one way to focus in on the high-voting over 65s.With black voters, the latest Sanders advert to be broadcast in Florida raised eyebrows as it consists of a series of clips of Barack Obama praising him as a politician of “great authenticity, great passion”. For Sanders to look to Obama to rescue his fortunes has an air of desperation, given that Biden’s overwhelming popularity among African Americans is largely due to his role as Obama’s vice-president.But then, the figures do look desperate. Exit polls from Super Tuesday showed Biden trouncing Sanders with black voters by 41 percentage points. In Alabama that disparity rose to 63 points.Biden built his firewall with black voters in South Carolina based on the endorsement of the influential congressman Jim Clyburn. Sanders’ defeat there was compounded with the embarrassing disclosure that he hadn’t even asked Clyburn to back him.There is hope in inroads made with Latino voters, which helped Sanders clinch California, the biggest delegate prize of any state. In the coming weeks, he will rely on that support to remain competitive in states like Arizona, New York and New Jersey.Against such deeply worrying indicators for Sanders, progressives warn that the lessons of the past are once again being ignored. Rebecca Katz, a Democratic strategist who works with progressive candidates, dismissed the idea that Sanders is the risky option in the 2020 race.“Sometimes the safest choice is also the riskiest choice,” she said. “Remember that John Kerry, Hillary Clinton and Al Gore were all safe choices.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0423aab395e588566738a55caff1665d0c06d2a/0_0_2743_1646/master/2743.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=859c5cd1b667f5bf12ceb9a64db043e3","title":"tell us how is coronavirus affecting your day to day life","story":"We want to hear about how coronavirus has impacted your daily life.

The Covid-19 virus is a member of the coronavirus family that made the jump from animals to humans late last year. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city of Wuhan. Unusually for a virus that has made the jump from one species to another, it appears to transmit effectively in humans – current estimates show that without strong containment measures the average person who catches Covid-19 will pass it on to two others. The virus also appears to have a higher mortality rate than common illnesses such as seasonal flu. The combination of coronavirus’s ability to spread and cause serious illness has prompted many countries, including the UK, to introduce or plan extensive public health measures aimed at containing and limiting the impact of the epidemic.Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and do this often, including when you get home or into work. Use hand sanitiser gel if soap and water are not available. Avoid touching your face. Cough or sneeze into a tissue or the crook of your elbow (not your hand) and put used tissues straight in the bin. Avoid close contact with people who are showing possible symptoms. Follow NHS guidance on self-isolation and travel.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided it is used correctly.The coronavirus outbreak hit amid flu season in the northern hemisphere and even doctors can struggle to distinguish between the two – the overlap in symptoms probably contributed to slow detection of community infections in some countries, including Italy.If you have symptoms or think you might have been exposed to the virus when travelling or through other contacts, call the NHS 111 service or visit the online service, or contact the equivalent service in your country. Do not go to a GP, pharmacy or hospital.Most infections happen in families, where people live at close quarters. You need to be within one to two metres of somebody to be infected by viral-loaded water droplets from their coughs or when they are speaking. That is less likely on public transport. However, it would be possible to pick up the virus on your hands from a surface that somebody with the infection had touched. The virus can linger for 48 hours or even possibly 72 hours on a hard surface, such as the hand rail in the tube – though less time on a soft surface. That is why the advice is to wash your hands regularly and avoid touching your face, to prevent the virus getting into your nose, mouth or eyes.Not at the moment, but drugs that are known to work against some viruses are being trialled in China, where there are thousands of patients, and new trials are starting in the US and other countries. Large numbers are needed to find out whether they work in a few people or a lot of people or nobody at all. The most hopeful are Kaletra, which is a combination of two anti-HIV drugs, and remdesivir, which was tried but failed in Ebola patients in west Africa in 2013 and 2016. Some Chinese doctors are also trying chloroquine, an antimalarial drug, which is off-patent, therefore cheap and highly available, and would be very useful in low-income countries. The first results are expected in mid-March and should indicate if the drugs will at least help those who are most severely ill. A miracle cure is not expected.Efforts to develop an effective vaccine for Covid-19 have been quick compared with historical epidemics, such as Ebola. A number of teams are already testing vaccine candidates in animals and preparing to carry out small trials in people. The US company, Moderna Therapeutics, is already recruiting and hopes to enrol 45 volunteers between 18 and 55 and launch the trial by the end of April. Phase one trials like this look at whether the vaccine triggers an immune response and whether the given dose causes adverse effects and could be completed quite quickly. However, the subsequent phases, which will involve thousands of volunteers and will look more closely at efficacy, will take longer and obtaining a commercially available vaccine within a year would be extremely quick. The government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said he did not think a working vaccine to protect people from the coronavirus would be produced in time for the current outbreak, but that a timeframe of a year or 18 months “was not unreasonable to assume”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a8aaa203ddc0e9806cd07eaed10036ccf365801/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1020\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf527ccc25db1f3827f2afe8078a4fca 1020w","title":"this is surreal italian towns struggle under coronavirus lockdown","story":"Doctors unable to visit patients while some who have recovered say they are still stigmatisedQuarantined Italian towns are buckling under the strain, major cities are emptying out and some of those infected say they are being stigmatised as Europe’s worst outbreak of coronavirus takes hold.As of Friday night, 4,636 cases had been detected as Italy aggressively tests for the virus. Out of that number, 197 people have died.Eleven towns are under lockdown – 10 in Lombardy and one in Veneto – and schools have been closed across the country as the government tries to contain a virus about which there are still many unknowns.Its neighbour Austria announced it is introducing “spot” health checks at the border for two weeks as of next week.Stories that have emerged since the outbreak began reflect the contrasting nature of the virus’s impact, from the reassuring accounts of people cured to the suffering of those who have died or are in a critical condition. The heavily pregnant wife of “patient one”, the 38-year-old man who was Italy’s first confirmed locally transmitted case, was dismissed from hospital on Thursday her husband, a marathon runner and amateur footballer, remains in intensive care.The dead, mostly elderly and with underlying health problems, are buried quickly without ceremony to mitigate the risk of infection posed by their corpses.

In Castiglione d’Adda, a town of 4,600 in Lombardy, 18 people have died within the past two weeks and, as of Thursday, 121 inhabitants were infected. The youngest victim was a 55-year-old man it is unclear whether he had an underlying illness. With three of the town’s five doctors in quarantine and two hospitalised with the virus, there is nobody to tend to the sick at home.“We have many people with a fever who are at home and who are unable to be visited by a doctor,” Costantino Pesatori, the mayor of Castiglione d’Adda, told the . “A substitute doctor came but he wasn’t provided with protective clothing and so, justifiably, refused to see people at home.”Pesatori is yet to learn whether the 14-day quarantine period, due to end on Sunday, will be extended. “This is such a surreal situation as the virus is difficult to comprehend it’s like living in a film,” he said. “People are also getting fed up of staying at home and some are starting to break the quarantine rules.”Stefano Lovisetto, a 58-year-old from Vo’ Euganeo, the only quarantined town in Veneto, was dismissed from hospital on Monday after being given the all-clear.“I had no symptoms, not even a cough,” he said. “People are saying this is the plague, but it isn’t. At least for me, it was only slightly more aggressive than a normal flu. The hospital staff were so kind and reassuring, despite having to deal with so many cases.”Morena Colombi, 59, is also among the recovered, but said she was being treated by fellow inhabitants in Truccazzano, a town of almost 6,000 near Milan, as if she had the plague. Colombi is the only confirmed case in the town, which is not under lockdown.“They are speaking badly about me, it’s as if I did a robbery or something,” she said. “But all it is is a virus that just so happened to affect me. When people hear the words ‘virus’ or ‘quarantine’ and ‘there is no cure’ they get frightened. For me, I had hardly any symptoms. Others are suffering badly, but most of those have other pathologies.”With 2,008 confirmed cases as of Friday, Lombardy is the worst-affected region, followed by Emilia-Romagna (816) and Veneto (454). The number of those infected across Italy’s other 17 regions so far totals 638. Italy has so far tested 36,359 people.Beyond the outbreak zones, everyday life has also changed dramatically. Venice, usually overflowing with tourists, is empty. As are the normally busy shops, bars and restaurants in Milan and Rome. Holidaymakers have cancelled trips and several airlines suspended flights amid warnings the tourism sector could suffer €7.4bn of losses. All major sporting events, including Serie A football, will be played behind closed doors until 3 April.“There’s no tourism,” said Simona Susanu, who works in a bar close to the Trevi fountain. “You only have to see how empty it is around the fountain to understand what is happening.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecab4c1eedc808de960a5088d780bbb89dc657cf/13_153_2187_1313/master/2187.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b00ddca71735ecda6d7ed23be17a75c9","title":"coronavirus thousands stranded on grand princess cruise ship after 21 cases confirmed","story":"Crew and passengers from more than 50 countries stuck on ship moored off San Francisco, as global infections pass 100,000 markNearly half of the 46 people tested for coronavirus onboard the Grand Princess cruise ship moored off San Francisco have returned a positive result, vice president Mike Pence has said, and the fate of its more than 3,500 passengers and crew from more than 50 countries remains unclear.Pence said 21 positive results had been recorded – 19 crew members and two passengers – and that “those that will need to be quarantined will be quarantined. Those who will require medical help will receive it.” He urged elderly Americans to consider carefully taking future cruises during the crisis.There is little detail as to where quarantined and sick passengers will be taken. Previously, military sites have been used to quarantine holidaymakers from the Diamond Princess, moored off Yokohama. On the Grand Princess, some passengers have already complained about the handling of the situation, saying they learned of the coronavirus cases from media reports, and there are concerns for one passenger who has stage 4 cancer.There are 2,422 guests and 1,111 crew on the vessel, with more than 140 Britons and four Australians among them.Meanwhile, Florida reported two deaths, the first US fatalities outside the west coast. Health officials said two people in their 70s who had travelled overseas died, one in Santa Rosa County and the other near Fort Myers. The US death toll is now 16.Globally, the virus has now killed nearly 3,500 people and infected more than 100,000 across 92 nations and territories. Italy and Iran have become the latest hotspots with sharp rises in confirmed cases, recording 4,636 and 4,747 respectively. The US government plans to take the Grand Princess to a “non-commercial port” where all the passengers and crew would be tested, however, President Donald Trump said on Friday he would prefer not to allow the passengers onto American soil.“I like the numbers being where they are,” said Trump, who appeared to be explicitly acknowledging his political concerns about the outbreak: “I don’t need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn’t our fault.”Closer to the epicentre of the global outbreak, Hong Kong further sealed itself off from the outside world, with authorities advising Hongkongers against all non-essential travel abroad, and making all arrivals complete a health declaration form.Previously, the measure, which will come into force from Sunday, was required only for mainland Chinese passengers. The city has reported 106 cases and two deaths in the past six weeks, according to its health officials.In Australia, authorities are working to trace about 70 patients of a doctor who continued to see patients despite falling ill with coronavirus-like symptoms. He fell ill in the US during a flight from Denver to San Francisco on 27 February before flying back to Melbourne and working throughout the following week. He was later confirmed to have the virus and Toorak clinic, where he works, has since been closed.Victoria’s health minister, Jenny Mikakos, said: “I have to say I am flabbergasted that a doctor that has flu-like symptoms has presented to work,” Mikakos said.Equally astonished were police in Sydney, who appealed for calm after a brawl broke out between three women in a supermarket over toilet paper amid continued panic buying. “We just ask that people don’t panic like this when they go out shopping,” said acting inspector Andrew New from New South Wales police. “There is no need for it. It isn’t the Thunderdome, it isn’t Mad Max, we don’t need to do that.“There is no need for people to go out and panic buy at supermarkets, paracetamol and canned food or toilet paper.”In the meantime, passengers aboard the Grand Princess remained holed up in their rooms as they awaited word about the fate of the ship. Some said ship officials only informed them of the confirmed coronavirus cases after they first learned about it from news reports.Passenger Kari Kolstoe, a retiree from North Dakota has stage-4 cancer and is particularly concerned. Kolstoe, 60, said she and her husband, Paul, 61, had looked forward to the cruise to Hawaii as a brief, badly needed respite from the grind of medical intervention she has endured for the past 18 months.Now facing the prospect of a two-week quarantine far from home in Grand Forks, she worried their getaway cruise will end up causing a fateful delay in her next round of chemotherapy, scheduled to begin early next week.“It’s very unsettling,” she said in a telephpone interview from the ship on Friday. “It’s still a worry that I’m going to not get back.”Besides the implications for cancer treatment is the fear of falling ill from exposure to a respiratory virus especially dangerous to older people with chronic health conditions and suppressed immunity. “I’m very at risk for this,” said Kolstoe, whose rare form of neuroendocrine cancer has spread throughout her body. “Me staying on here for a lot of reasons isn’t good.”Steven Smith and his wife, Michele, of Paradise, California, went on the cruise to celebrate their wedding anniversary. They said they were a bit worried but felt safe in their room, which they had left just once since Thursday to video chat with their children. Crew members wearing masks and gloves delivered trays with their food in covered plates and left them outside their door.To pass the time they have been watching television, reading and looking out the window, they said. “Thank God, we have a window!” Steven said.An epidemiologist who studies the spread of virus particles said the recirculated air from a cruise ship’s ventilation system, plus the close quarters and communal settings, made passengers and crew vulnerable to infectious diseases. “They’re not designed as quarantine facilities, to put it mildly,” said Don Milton of the University of Maryland. “You’re going to amplify the infection by keeping people on the boat.”Another Princess ship, the Diamond Princess, was quarantined for two weeks in Yokohama, Japan, last month because of the virus. Ultimately, about 700 of the 3,700 people aboard became infected in what experts pronounced a public-health failure, with the vessel essentially becoming a floating germ factory.In the US, officials in Austin cancelled this year’s SXSW festival, a major tech and music conference, amid coronavirus concerns. SXSW, which draws 400,000 visitors, was scheduled for 13 to 22 March.Austin’s mayor, Steve Adler, said: “I’ve gone ahead and declared a local disaster in the city and associated with that, have issued an order that effectively cancels SXSW.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c64159171038b3bdd957d444ad8d36057fc633a/0_39_1860_1117/master/1860.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=324c877008364c559902c8e974156db0","title":"saudi arabia detains three royal family members in latest crackdown","story":"Royal relatives accused of plotting to oust King Salman and successor Crown Prince Mohammed bin SalmanSaudi authorities have detained three royal family members including two senior princes, according to US media reports, signalling the crown prince is further tightening his grip on power.Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz al-Saud, a brother of King Salman, and the monarch’s nephew Prince Mohammed bin Nayef were taken from their homes early on Friday by royal guards after being accused of treason, the Wall Street Journal reported citing unnamed sources. The pair were allegedly plotting to oust King Salman and the son he has designated to succeed him, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, it reported.The New York Times also reported the detentions, adding that Prince Nayef’s younger brother Prince Nawaf bin Nayef had also been detained.Saudi authorities did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The detentions mark the latest crackdown by the de facto ruler crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has consolidated his reign with the imprisonment of prominent clerics and activists as well as princes and business elites.The crown prince, the king’s son, has also faced a torrent of international condemnation over the murder of critic Jamal Khashoggi inside the kingdom’s Istanbul consulate in October 2018.Prince Ahmed, said to be in his 70s, had returned to the kingdom from his base in London in the aftermath of the Khashoggi scandal, in what some saw as an effort to shore up support for the monarchy.In June 2017, the crown prince had edged out Prince Nayef, the former crown prince and interior minister, to become heir to the Arab world’s most powerful throne.At the time, Saudi television channels showed the crown prince kissing the hand of the older prince and kneeling before him in a show of reverence.Western media reports later said that the deposed prince had been placed under house arrest, a claim strongly denied by Saudi authorities.“Prince Mohammed is emboldened – he has already ousted any threats to his rise and jailed or murdered critics of his regime without any repercussion,” Becca Wasser, a policy analyst at the US-based Rand Corporation, said of the latest crackdown.“This is a further step to shore up his power and a message to anyone – including royals – not to cross him.”The detentions come at a sensitive time as Saudi Arabia bars Muslim pilgrims from Islam’s holiest sites to contain the coronavirus outbreak.The kingdom has suspended the “umrah” year-round pilgrimage over fears of the disease spreading to Mecca and Medina, raising uncertainty over the upcoming hajj – a key pillar of Islam.The oil-rich kingdom is also grappling with plunging price of crude, its major source of revenue."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26cba6646f093e2193b239694358fd55d15bb29f/0_425_6378_3827/master/6378.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83aee862ba068fa2f301b85dcde05d28","title":"coronavirus update latest live news symptoms cases global infection rate uk usa australia italy china updates","story":"Doctor likely fell ill in the US before flying back to Melbourne and treating 70 patients, says Victoria’s health ministerHelen Sullivan here, head over at our new blog below, where I’ll be liveblogging the very latest coronavirus news for the next while.In Australia, here is the latest on the story of a Victoria doctor who treated 70 patients despite having flu-like symptoms, and who has now be confirmed as the latest case of coronavirus in the state. Victorian health authorities are trying to contact about 70 patients of a Melbourne doctor who has developed coronavirus after returning from the USThe doctor is the state’s 11th case of the novel coronavirus and the state health minister, Jenny Mikakos, says he attended work and treated patients after her was symptomatic.“I have to say I am flabbergasted that a doctor that has flulike symptoms has presented to work,” Mikakos said.The doctor returned from the US on 29 February and saw approximately 70 patients last week between Monday 2 March and Friday 6 March at the Toorak Clinic on Malvern Road. The clinic has been since closed.Patients have been contacted by text message, phone or email and two patients the doctor treated in a Malvern nursing home have been isolated.All patients the doctor saw and all clinic staff have been asked to self-isolate for 14 days. The clinic’s other patients have been asked to monitor their symptoms.Passengers on the flight with the doctor would be contacted, Mikakos said.We have the latest figures for China now.Mainland China had 99 new confirmed cases of coronavirus infections on Friday, the country’s National Health Commission said on Saturday, down from 143 cases a day earlier. That brings the total accumulated number of confirmed cases in mainland China so far to 80,651. The death toll from the outbreak in mainland China was 3,070 as of the end of Friday, up by 28 from the previous day. The central province of Hubei, the epicentre of the outbreak, reported 28 new deaths. In the provincial capital of Wuhan, 21 people died.Regarding the confirmed coronavirus case who attended a Tool concert in New Zealand, all attendees who were in general admission at the concert have now been contacted by the event organisers. Only those who have any symptoms should call the country’s health line says New Zealand Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield. Soon, he adds, the public will see notices up in bus shelters and other public places regarding advice for preventing the transmission of the virus. New Zealand Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield says that of the eight New Zealanders who were on board the Grand Princess, the cruise ship quarantined off the coast of San Fransisco, five are well following the two-week period during which people should display symptoms. One is a seventy-year-old woman, who has recovered from a respiratory illness. Her Covid-18 test result has since come back negative, although the had been thought to be a probable case.New Zealand Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield says most human-to-human transmission there is happening within families. In New Zealand, the fifth positive case is a woman in her 40s, the partner of the third case confirmed earlier this week. Regarding the latest case in Victoria, Australia, a doctor who treated 70 patients after showing flu-like symptoms – he is now a confirmed case of Covid-19, Dr Sutton, the state’s chief health officer is asked: How worried are you that given that the doctor was treating this patient in close proximity, that we will have more cases of coronavirus?We need to be alert to the possibility, that is why would be monitoring them on a daily basis. All of them have been contacted en masse this morning, they will be called again through the course of today. They will be isolated and with respect to the ongoing risk from them in developing illness, we can manage that, but yes, we have to be alert to the possibility of developing illness.Still in Australia: asked whether he would extend that travel advice to the general public, state chief health officer Dr. Sutton says: I think everyone needs to give consideration to information that is important to them. People have family around the world, people have different risk tolerance. But people should look at the WHO website...It does depend on if you are in a vulnerable and high-risk age group, it does depend on who you are travelling with, how long you will be there for, and the extent to which you can protect yourself in terms of from others.There are lots of complex things at play. For the Department of education they needed a definitive statement, but for everyone else, you need to look at all the information and make a judgement for yourself. In Victoria, Australia: state chief health officer Dr. Sutton says, regarding students, “there may come a point where we say no international travel at all...at the moment my recommendation is to restrict travel to New Zealand and Canada.” In Australia, Victorian health minister Jenny Mikakos says the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity is working on a more efficient test for Covid-19.They are working on a far more quick test. So at the moment it takes about three hours from the time that the swab sample arrives to get a result, and the travel time getting it there does add to the turnaround. They are looking at potentially a pin blood test that could mean that we could get a test result within 20 minutes.In Australia, Victorian health minister Jenny Mikakos is addressing the media regarding the latest coronavirus case in the state, its eleventh, which is a medical doctor who treated seventy patients despite experiencing flu-like symptoms. Still in Victoria, Australia, just a bit more on this doctor. He is the latest confirmed case: The latest case is a doctor from Toorak in his 70s, who displayed mild symptoms on a flight from the United States. He is now recovering in home isolation. It was confirmed positive last night following a series of tests. The doctor recently travelled to Denver and Bali Colorado, via LosAngeles, and was there for several days before onset. He most likely acquired his infection in the UnitedStates. He became unwell with a runny nose on an internal flight from Denver to San Francisco onFebruary 27, US time, then flew from San Francisco to Melbourne on a United Airlines flight, arriving at approximately 9:30am Saturday the 29 February. The doctor, from the Toorak clinic in Malvern Road consulted approximately 70 patients for five days, between Monday the 2 March and Friday the 6 March.In Victoria, Australia, state chief health officer Dr. Sutton says at this stage people “can and should go ahead” attending mass gatherings, so long as they don’t have symptoms. Victoria’s chief health officer Dr. Brett Sutton speaking now. Health workers “have a particular obligation to exclude yourself from work if you are unwell”. In Australia, Victorian health minister Jenny Mikakos says she is “flabbergasted” that a doctor who had flulike symptoms presented to work in the state this week. She sats the ministry will be reminding doctors across the state not to present to work should they display any symptoms. The doctor in question came into contact with around 70 patients.

Herat borders neighbouring Iran, which is one of the countries worst affected by the coronavirus outside of China, with more than 4,000 cases and dozens of deaths. Mayar expressed concern about the vulnerability of Afghanistan’s border with Iran. Millions of Afghans live and work in the neighbouring country and many are facing increasing political and economic pressure to return. Mayar said the cost of testing would be a strain on Afghanistan’s resource-strapped health system in an economy damaged by years of conflict. Each test kit - which would test around 50 cases - cost around $1600 (or $32 per test), he said. One of 2,400 passengers on board the Grand Princess cruise ship stranded off the Californian coast is a retiree with stage-4 cancer. Kari Kolstoe, 60, from North Dakota told Reuters she and her husband, Paul, 61, had looked forward to the Grand Princess cruise to Hawaii as a brief, badly needed respite from the grind of medical intervention she has endured for the past 18 months. Now facing the prospect of a two-week quarantine far from their home in Grand Forks, she worries their getaway cruise will end up causing a fateful delay in her next round of chemotherapy, scheduled to begin early next week. “It’s very unsettling,” she said in a cellphone interview from the ship on Friday. “It’s still a worry that I’m going to not get back.” Reuters report the death toll also rose to 46 from 44, Kwon Jun-wook, the Korea Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention’s (KCDC) deputy director told a briefing on Saturday. South Korea’s cases rose to 6,767 on Saturday, up by 174 from late Friday. The number of infections in Europe has more than doubled in just three days, the New York Times reports, as confirmed cases reached over 7,300 on Friday. According to Johns Hopkins, here are the ten countries in Europe with the highest number of infections. Just an update on the global coronavirus numbers today, from Johns Hopkins. Total cases are now at 102,188. Of those, 80,651 are in mainland China.Total deaths: 3,491. Of those, 2,959 were in Hubei province, Mainland China. The countries with the next highest numbers of confirmed cases are: Germany has the next highest number of confirmed cases, but there is a fair gap between its numbers and those in Italy: We learned four valuable lessons from Ebola. They can help us fight the coronavirus, writes Chris Withington, who works in the humanitarian and emergency response unit of Care Australia. “Coronavirus is a global crisis that is going to require a global solution. The lessons from Ebola are there for us to use – but will we?”The United Arab Emirates reported 15 additional cases on Saturday of a new and fast-spreading virus, bringing the total number of infections in the country to 45.The Health Ministry said 13 of the new cases had recently arrived from abroad, and they include three Emirati citizens, two Saudis, two Ethiopians and two Iranians, as well as a person each from Thailand, China, Morocco and India. The statement gave no further details on where the travellers had come, when they had arrived to the UAE and which ports of entry they had come in from. The other two cases, an Emirati and an Egyptian, were diagnosed after being monitored in connection with a cycling tour in the country that was halted a week ago after two Italians were first confirmed as having the virus. The emirate of Dubai is home to the world’s busiest airport for international travel.American jails are on high alert for coronavirus. Below are sone of the measures that are being taken, and some of the particular challenges faced by prisoners as they seek to protect themselves. There have been no reports of Covid-19 inside US jails or prisons. But more people are incarcerated per capita here than in any other country in the world and prisons have become hot spots in other nations touched by the outbreak, AP reports. Inmates share small cells with total strangers, use toilets just a few feet from their beds, and are herded into day rooms where they spend hours at a time together. Practicing even the most simple hygiene, such as washing hands, is not a given in such environments. Hand sanitizer is often treated as contraband because it contains alcohol. Inmates go in groups to court, where they wait together in cramped holding areas. Many are poor, meaning that when they’re released they often must get on public buses or trains to get home.Despite the lack of much good coronavirus news in our liveblog today, here are precisely nine reasons to be reassured when it comes to the status of the outbreak so far. As we are hit with minute-by-minute updates from around the world, experiencing the advance of Covid-19 in real time – news alerts, huge headlines, social media hysteria – there’s a risk that we might lose some essential context.Yes, this virus is obviously a massive challenge: medical, political and – perhaps most strikingly at present – social and economic. But it is worth remembering the world has never had better tools to fight it, and that if we are infected, we are unlikely to die from it.Here, courtesy of a number of scientists but mainly Ignacio López-Goñi, a professor of microbiology and virology at the University of Navarra in Spain, are what might hopefully prove a few reassuring facts about the new coronavirus:"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4181069.1582312165!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"waste materials to be airlifted from mv alta wreck","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe MV Alta, a 77m Tanzanian registered cargo ship which had been abandoned and drifting in the Atlantic Ocean for 17 months, washed up on rocks near Ballycotton in east Cork last weekend.

Particularly, she said, to what extent cost and environmental concerns were informing decisions.She said of particular concern was the need for an ecologist to examine local sea life for signs of pollutants.“It’s a simple thing. Maybe they have done all of this but there isn’t enough information available, and if they haven’t done it, why not?”Keep awayMs Dubsky said despite local restrictions, efforts would be made by environmentalists to examine limpets, a marine mollusc, on rocks in the area to see if they are falling off.Members of the public have again been urged to stay away from the wreck which is on a dangerous and inaccessible stretch of coastline and in an unstable condition.As part of the operation, access to a local cul-de-sac road has been restricted to residents. The council has also said that lands along the shoreline are private.Under law, it is an offence for anyone to interfere with a wreck or to attempt to board it.A Revenue official has been appointed Receiver of Wrecks by the Department of Transport, a function necessary to manage the possession and disposal of vessels which wash ashore."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4195177.1583526499!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus timeline the cases confirmed in ireland so far","story":"The number of coronavirus cases is due to increase in Ireland.

It followed another case confirmed in Northern Ireland earlier in the week.The teenager had become ill after returning from Italy and was placed in isolation in a Dublin hospital.Sunday, March 1stA north Dublin school with 400 pupils announced on Sunday it would close for two weeks after one of its students was confirmed as having the coronavirus. Public health officials order the closure as a precautionary measure and to minimise the risk of person-to-person transmission of the disease.Tuesday, March 3rdThe second case of the coronavirus in the Republic was confirmed on Tuesday evening after a woman who had recently travelled from Italy tested positive.Wednesday, March 4thOn Wednesday, it was confirmed that a family of four in Co Clare had tested positive for the virus after returning from a skiing holiday in northern Italy.One of the family members, a healthcare professional, had worked in University Hospital Limerick’s emergency department before being diagnosed nine days after returning from the holiday. Efforts to trace people who came into contact with the four people are ongoing.These include patients who attended the minor injuries zone of the hospital’s emergency department between 10am and 2pm on Wednesday, February 26th.The hospital closed for three hours on Wednesday for a deep clean and patients were directed to other hospitals.These cases, the first cluster of positive tests in the Republic, forced the closure of three schools in Co Clare as a precautionary measure.Northern Ireland also reported two new cases on Wednesday, one of them a student from Queen’s University, bringing to three the total number of cases in the North. Neither of the two new cases in the North involved travel through the Republic.One of those who tested positive had travelled from northern Italy while the other had recent contact with a person elsewhere in the UK who had subsequently tested positive for Covid-19, said the North’s health minister Robin Swann.Thursday, March 5thOn Thursday evening, the Provost of Trinity College Dublin sent an email to its 17,000 undergraduate and postgraduate students and about 2,600 staff members informing them that a positive case of Covid-19 had been confirmed “within” the university.Another three new cases of the virus were confirmed among men from the east of the country who had recently travelled from Italy.Two women who were connected to the cases reported in Co Clare earlier in the week also tested positive.A man who had been in Cork University Hospital (CUH) for up to a week was also diagnosed. It is understood the man, who received treatment in the hospital last week and was discharged, may have had contact with a large number of staff and sick patients before he was tested. However, it is not clear how he came into contact with the virus.CUH has cancelled elective surgeries and imposed visitor restrictions along with the clearance of further space for isolating patients. The patient is receiving intensive care in an isolation unit at the hospital.Just prior to this announcement in the Republic, a fourth case was confirmed in the North by the UK Department of Health.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4195611.1583533076!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus testing to rise sharply in ireland as treatment streamlined","story":"The number of coronavirus cases is due to increase in Ireland.

Photograph: Michael CooperPA WireThe testing of people for coronavirus and the treatment of confirmed cases is to be streamlined as the number of Covid-19 diagnoses continues to rise here.Another five positive tests for the disease – three women and two men – were announced last night, with Northern Ireland also recording another case.This brings to 18 the number of confirmed cases of the virus in the Republic and four in the North.It is planned that patients with mild symptoms will recover in isolation in the community, rather than in hospital, where all cases are being treated at present.International data shows four out of every five people who get the disease suffer mild symptoms. The number of people infected with coronavirus is nearing 100,000 across the globe, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Friday.Staff at some Irish hospitals will be be trained to provide testing facilities regionally, it is expected. The National Virus Reference Laboratory in University College Dublin currently processes all tests. Up to last week, almost 400 people had been tested, but this number is expected to have risen sharply when new figures are published early next week.Other health service staff are to be drafted in to assist the 60 or so public health professionals who specialise in tracing contacts of people with infectious diseases. The requirement for contact tracing has escalated hugely since the number of cases grew in recent days.Three of the new cases in the Republic are in the south of the country, one is in the east and one in the west.One case is associated with travel from northern Italy, and one with close contact with a confirmed case. A third case involves a healthcare worker who was in close contact with a confirmed case.The last two new cases involve a male who travelled from abroad and a female who travelled from northern Italy. The country the man travelled to Ireland from is not one of the high-risk areas and the case remains under investigation.Containment phaseThe State’s chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan described 18 as “a small number of cases” and pointed out that the origins of all but one could be explained.“We are still in a containment phase and the chance of picking up this disease remains very low.”Hospitals in Cork and the midwest, and Dublin’s Mater hospital, where cases are being treated, have introduced visitor restrictions and many elective surgeries have been cancelled. Private nursing homes across the State have also restricted visiting to minimise risk to “vulnerable” older residents.Trinity College Dublin, which has one confirmed case among its student body, has introduced a ban on entering the college for 14 days for staff and students returning from northern Italy or other high-risk areas.Ireland’s fifth round Six Nations clash away to France on March 14th will go ahead, the French Rugby Federation confirmed. Organisers of the St Patrick’s Day parade in Youghal, Co Cork announced their decision to cancel this year’s event.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar urged people “not to act unilaterally, whether that is crèche owners or business owners or event organisers”. “We need to act in concert, and if the response needs to be escalated we should escalate it altogether.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4195594.1583529591!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord seanad candidates get their campaigns in full swing","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Seanad candidate Ruth Coppinger: the former  Solidarity TD took Senator Michael McDowell to task over his praise of ‘billionaire misogynist’ Mike Bloomberg. Photograph: Tom Honan for The Let us not forget that there are more important things going on than the formation of a new government, the search for a saviour for the Labour Party or the arrival of a viral pandemic. Well, one more important thing, to be precise: the Seanad election.This is the weirdest election, with its complicated nomination system of inside and outside panels, nominating bodies, exclusive electorate and bizarre count process. It’s in full swing now, not that many people have noticed. The votes will be counted on March 30th. Counting will take forever.There are 29 candidates in the mix for three seats on the NUI panel, with the outgoing trio hoping to make a return to the Upper House next month. Michael McDowell, Rónán Mullen and Alice Mary Higgins will face a number of candidates who ran unsuccessfully last time out, among them Laura Harmon of the National Women’s Council, who bowed out on the 28th count in 2016.The entry of former TD Ruth Coppinger into the race will be interesting. It is unlikely that Coppinger, who was to the forefront of the Repeal the Eighth campaign, will trouble socially conservative Rónán Mullen’s loyal consitituency. However, it remains to be seen what effect her presence will have on the rest of the voting graduates.On Friday, the former Solidarity TD for Dublin West lined up former tánaiste McDowell in her sights, accusing him of having “an unacceptable blindspot about sexism and sexual harassment” after he made complimentary remarks about billionaire Mike Bloomberg, who dropped out of the US presidential race last week. In a press release, she took the former Progressive Democrats leader to task for calling Bloomberg “an urbane, sophisticated gentleman” in his  column.“This is a billionaire who has subjected female employees to disgusting comments and harassment – calling women ‘fat broads’, ‘horse-faced lesbians’, commenting that they have ‘nice tits’ and that he’d ‘do that piece of meat’. Does Senator McDowell have any problem with these comments which display a bare-faced misogyny?”And so to the election. Having Michael McDowell and Rónán Mullen as two of the three current NUI senators “points up the value of having a socialist feminist voice in the Seanad –an institution which seems to harbour backward ideas and privilege”, said Coppinger. She didn’t mention Alice Mary Higgins, the third Senator in the bunch. Alice Mary is no slouch when it comes to standing up for women’s rights.We thought it only right to ring up leading senior counsel McDowell and ask him about his apparent “unacceptable blindspot”. He was somewhat taken aback by the contents of Coppinger’s press release. “Her remarks and her literature try to conceal the fact that I have spoken and written strongly in support of the Marriage Equality referendum and the Repeal the Eighth referendum. I think I’ll leave the rest of the tirade without comment.”SF’s Fintan Warfield lets his music do the talkingIt’s all go in Sinn Féin these days. We see outgoing Senator Fintan Warfield, who is back in the hunt for a seat on the Cultural and Educational panel, launched an album a couple of weeks ago. Fintan is a talented musician and his most recent appearances have been at Sinn Féin rallies around the country where he led the singing of the National Anthem at the end of proceedings. Fintan, one of the Wolfe Tones Warfields, performs regularly with The Young Wolfe Tones. This is his first solo effort. It’s called Step It Out Mary Lou. No, sorry. It’s called Step It Out Mary and tracks include The Rocky Road to Dublin, Meet Me at the Pillar, The Boys of Fair Hill and The Dying Rebel. It’s available at Connolly Books, Claddagh Records and the Sinn Féin bookshop.Short-serving TD Malcolm Byrne in it for the long haul“I’m kind of a professional canvasser at this stage,” says Fianna Fáil’s Malcolm Byrne, who has fought five election campaigns in the last 10 months, losing two and winning two, and now slap bang in the middle of his fifth.Byrne, a long-standing councillor in Wexford, contested the local and European elections last May. He was re-elected to the council but was pipped at the post for the final seat in Ireland South. In November, he won the byelection caused by Mick Wallace’s departure to Europe and took his seat in the Dáil on December 3rd. The House sat for eight days before the Christmas recess and never reconvened.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar called a general election and Malcolm was on the road again. Two of the candidates he defeated two months earlier won Dáil seats – Independent Verona Murphy and Sinn Féin’s Johnny Mythen, who pulled in just under 25 per cent of the votes.Now Malcolm is running for a seat on the very competitive Cultural and Educational panel, where five Seanad berths are up for grabs. The 20-strong field is top-heavy with former TDs and senators looking to stay in politics at a national level. Given his travails of the past year, it seems appropriate that he has been nominated for the panel by the Drama League of Ireland.This election is also taking a financial toll on the short-serving, if not the shortest-serving TD. Byrne is on a career break from his job as head of communications with the Higher Education Authority. As he didn’t clock up the required six months’ service he didn’t qualify for any severance payment, and is now dipping into his savings as the long Seanad campaign grinds on.Richard Mulcahy follows in his grandparents’ historic footstepsA communication arrives on behalf of a candidate for the Agricultural Panel. “Businessman Richard Mulcahy, grandson of Gen Richard Mulcahy, has secured a nomination from the Royal Dublin Society. He will now tour the country in an effort to secure support from local county councillors, deputies and Senators ahead of Seanad voting at the end of March.”Torchlight processions, we hope. Mulcahy is running as an Independent, focusing on two key pillars: sustainable local agri-business and inclusive communities for the ageing population. Having spent most of his life as a very successful entrepreneur and chief executive of start-up companies in areas including retail pharmacy, electronics, software, catering, construction and forestry, he sold up a number of years ago and is now involved in business at a local community level, working in an advisory capacity with Wexford County Council to help attract new businesses to the county.“Now, like my grandfather, I’d like to influence and shape policy and debate at a national level,” he says in a press release issued by a Stillwater Communications. “Following his family’s philanthropic tradition, Richard has led and donated to the opening of a new park in Wexford in collaboration with Wexford County Council. The 18-acre park, named the Min Ryan public park after his grandmother who was romantically involved with Seán Mac Diarmada at the time of his execution in the aftermath of the 1916 Rising, is due to open this April and will be the first park in Ireland to be named after a woman.”You know what you can do with that Swiss rollThe days of Seanad candidates arriving at councillors’ homes bearing gifts in an attempt to butter them up for a vote are largely a thing of the past. No reports doing the rounds this time of silk ties and scarves, music CDs and bottles of hard liquor being pressed upon potential supporters.However, one councillor in the southern end of the country who is hoping to make the step up to the Upper House tried to get on the good side of a fellow local representative by presenting him with a Swiss roll when he arrived for the canvass and a cup of tea. The recipient of the cake subsequently met a council colleague who was also soft-soaped by the same candidate. Only this time, the sweet inducement was a much larger apple tart. This didn’t go down well.So will you give him your vote, the first councillor was asked.“I will in me Swiss,” came the Cockney-rhyming reply beloved of hard-chaws everywhere.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4195320.1583511822!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"campaigning rules of thumb rewritten by democratic nominees","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDemocratic presidential candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders: With the primary field effectively down to two, focus now turns to the battle ahead. Photographs: Mark Felix and Mark Ralston After more than a year of uneven debate performances, inconsistent polling and a historically large field of candidates, America finally got some clarity this week as to who will be the Democratic nominee to face Donald Trump in November.The remarkable political comeback of Joe Biden saw the former vice-president catch the only other remaining contender, Bernie Sanders, who had clocked up victories in most of February’s primaries. Biden’s revival began a week ago in South Carolina. Having channelled his dwindling resources and time into the first southern state to vote, Biden won big, securing almost half the vote. Within 48 hours a cascade of endorsements followed as rivals like Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg fell by the wayside and lined up behind Biden. He then secured a better-than-expected victory on Super Tuesday, winning 10 of the 14 states. Sanders is still a formidable opponent, and is expected to sweep up most of California’s delegates when counting in the largest state finally ends.The dramatic events of the last week have renewed focus on the process of choosing an American presidential nominee. They have also turned a number of political truisms on their head. Is a good ground campaign necessary at state level? Not necessarily. Biden notched up surprise victories on Tuesday in states he did not even visit and where he had virtually no campaign infrastructure, such as Massachusetts and Minnesota. So much for the oft-cited argument that Hillary Clinton lost Wisconsin to Trump in 2016 in part because she never visited the midwestern state.\u0026nbspIowa’s prominenceDoes money talk in US politics? Not every time. Bloomberg found out the hard way that $500 million in advertising spending could only really buy him the pacific island of American Samoa, the only territory to vote for him, though he picked up some delegates in other states.But as analysts ponder the reasons for Biden’s resurrection, there are also questions for the Democratic National Committee. Serious consideration should be given to the continued prominence of Iowa and the other early voting states in the primary system.\u0026nbsp There has long been an argument that Iowa and New Hampshire, which hold their contests first, play too much of a role in the selection process. As overwhelmingly white and rural states, they do not represent the demographics of America, and more specifically the make-up of the Democratic electorate. The fiasco over the Iowa caucus, which saw results delayed for several days, also furthered calls to reassess the system – while also arguably depriving the winner, Pete Buttigieg, of the media coverage boost that typically accompanies an Iowa victory, given the focus on the voting debacle.The fact that Biden finished fourth in Iowa and fifth in New Hampshire also undermined the conventional political thinking that a strong showing in these early voting states is essential to secure the momentum needed for the rest of the contest. The Biden argument that he would do better in more racially erse states played out.Gaining groundThe Democratic Party needs to also examine how two white men in their late 70s have emerged as the frontrunners, given the ersity of the Democratic electorate.With the primary field effectively down to two, focus now turns to the battle ahead. Sanders faces a crucial few weeks as he takes on Biden and the bulk of the Democratic establishment who have backed him. The next states to hold primaries are naturally less friendly territory for Sanders, while the youth vote on which he was banking has failed to turn out in big numbers so far. A key state to watch will be Michigan, one of four states voting next Tuesday. Sanders had been leading there in recent weeks, but polls suggest that Biden is gaining ground.Biden too faces a myriad of challenges. His shortcomings have not gone away, and it will be interesting to see how he performs in the next TV debate in just over a week’s time. His campaign is also way behind Sanders in terms of ground organisation and digital advertising, so he will be hoping to inherit not only some of Bloomberg’s campaign money, but also his impressive campaign infrastructure, including in the field of internet advertising.With the candidates neck-and-neck in terms of delegates, the race is too close to call. But the packed primary calendar suggests we could have a good sense of who will be the nominee by the end of this month.Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"air conditioning systems could spread coronavirus research shows","story":"Coronavirus could spread around buildings via air conditioning systems or even on a draught, new analysis has suggested after scientists found traces of the virus in a hospital air duct.The results from swab analysis of the rooms used by three coronavirus patients indicate that the disease may be more contagious than previously thought.Even though the patient though to be responsible was suffering only mild symptoms, scientists from the National Centre for Infectious Diseases in Singapore found evidence of the virus in the hospital\u0027s air exhaust. This suggests that small, virus-laden droplets may be displaced by airflows and deposited on equipment such as vents, they said.It comes as the Government\u0027s chief scientific advisor, Sir Patrick Vallance, said officials were considering isolating entire households in a bid to control the outbreak after the second Covid-19 death in Britain. Currently, officials are warning the cohabitees of people with symptoms to minimise contact as much as possible, but are not advising that they stay at home as well.Professor Jonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, criticised the idea of isolating whole families, saying: There is no need to isolate an entire family because an uninfected person poses no risk. If someone else within the family then develops symptoms, they too should immediately isolate.Those in self-isolation should try to minimise interactions with household members during the isolation period and follow the self-isolation advice on the government website.The research from Singapore, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, has implications for the safety of people using buildings that recycle internal air. The same applies to cruise ships, which typically use a mix of recycled air already inside the vessel and fresh air from outside to save on costs. The findings come after more than 700 people came down with coronavirus and at least five died after catching it on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Experts said the policy of quarantining the entire ship in Japan had turned it into a breeding ground for Covid-19.Another cruise liner, the Grand Princess, is waiting off the coast of California while tests are carried out on dozens of passengers.Meanwhile, doctors in Malta have threatened to go on strike if authorities allow in the MSC Opera, carrying 2,302 passengers.Towards the start of the global outbreak, which has now seen 3,412 deaths, virologists suspected that Covid-19 required larger, heavier droplets to survive outside the body. However, the fact that it appears to survive on smaller, lighter droplets – similar to seasonal influenza – makes it more contagious.Professor James G. Dwyer, from Purdue University in Indiana, said: It\u0027s standard practice for the air conditioning systems of cruise ships to mix outside air with inside air to save energy.The problem is that these systems can\u0027t filter out particles smaller than 5,000 nanometers. If the coronavirus is about the same size as Sars, which is 120 nanometers in diameter, then the air conditioning system would be carrying the virus to every cabin. Cruise ships could minimise this problem by just using outside air and not recirculating it.The Singaporian study came as airlines sought to reassure passengers that their aircraft ventilation systems do not recirculate coronavirus. Etihad put out a statement saying that its fleet is equipped with cabin air filtration systems of similar quality to those used in hospital operating theatres.In any confined area, there is a risk of contracting illnesses from other people, the statement said. However, the risk is considered lower on aircraft because of the use of high efficiency particulate air filters, which are effective in capturing more than 99 per cent of airborne microbes in filtered air.As well, cabin air flow is continuous, and delivered at a rate equivalent to up to 30 changes per hour.Because of the hazards faced by the Singapore researchers, they were not able to demonstrate that the viral cultures they identified were viable.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2020/03/04/TELEMMGLPICT000226772987_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqrpfQw2hJyG_yckwxPAr0go9KzD8cVu9iguqnaKUswZA.jpeg?imwidth","title":"bbc blind london bias","story":"How out of touch is the BBC? It’s difficult to know where to startThe Culture Secretary, Oliver Dowden, didn’t beat around the bush in his first major speech yesterday. He said the BBC must do more to reflect the country and avoid providing a “narrow urban outlook”. There must be genuine ersity of thought, he added. In other words, the BBC is a London-centric, liberal-minded broadcaster that is no longer in touch with the public.Many people would consider that to be stating the obvious. The BBC is in serious trouble. It is losing viewers and listeners in their thousands to online streaming services and to commercial rivals. It is feeling “got at” by the Government. In his role as lightning rod for the Prime Minister, Dominic Cummings has seen fit to ban ministers from going on various BBC programmes, including Radio 4’s flagship Today, because of anti-Tory bias. It is a bias that hasn’t escaped the notice of some viewers and listeners, either.And yet the BBC’s response has not been to reflect, but largely to double-down, repeating its usual mantras about the good value offered by the license fee. If the broadcaster was in a healthy state, it wouldn’t need to be told by a politician to think outside the metropolitan, liberal box.So how out of touch is the BBC? It’s difficult to know where to start. Most obviously, it failed to gauge the public mood on Brexit, constantly obsessing about a second referendum and only paying lip-service to those who gently pointed out that the demand for one didn’t really exist outside Remain-supporting London – coincidentally where most BBC producers and editors live. It even sought to “correct” the views of Brexiteers, with its “Reality Check” journalists, a service that was rarely performed on claims made by Remainers.The election result, therefore, came as an almost total surprise. To be fair, the BBC wasn’t alone in not seeing the Boris majority coming a mile off, but its reaction showed little understanding of what brought it about. Indeed, it was partly the BBC which brought it about. It has consistently struggled to reflect the public’s views on touchstone issues like crime and immigration, which it views as deeply reactionary.Its London-centricity is best illustrated by the Today programme. It regards getting out of London once a month to broadcast from a top tier university as somehow being enough to reflect the mood of the country. Why does it never broadcast from a factory or a call centre?Then consider the BBC’s obsession with going on about what we now are obliged to refer to as the “climate emergency”. Preaching to us all about how terrible we are for the lifestyles we lead does little to endear the broadcaster to its non-Islington audience. Radio 4’s token doff of its cap to its audience is to provide a whole half an hour, yes, 30 minutes, to hearing the views of listeners on Any Answers. Perhaps if it became more like LBC and had a daily phone-in show, it might realise where it’s going wrong.Future of the BBC | The best comment and analysisThe BBC, however, does not seem very interested in local opinion. It is set, for example, on turning its so-called “local” radio stations into carbon copies of each other. In the last few months they’ve all been given identical jingles with the universal strapline of “All the music you love…”.It is also panicking about losing young viewers and listeners, while failing to see that other demographics will not remain loyal forever. To take one example, BBC Radio London is turning its 10pm-1am phone-in into a youth-oriented music show. BBC Radio London has long been a basket case of a station, yet its controller has mysteriously clung onto his job for more than 20 years. Maybe it’s the unique way the BBC is funded. For now, anyway.I want the BBC to succeed. I admire a lot of what it does. But it is threatening to turn in on itself. It’s being held back by an institutionalised management more interested in covering their own backs than promoting innovation and giving viewers and listeners what they want.The battle for eyeballs and ears has never been more cutthroat, and if the BBC fails to acknowledge that it has no ine right to exist in its current form, there will be further trouble ahead.Iain Dale is an LBC presenter.

However, it is only now - more than 1,300 years after her death and after carbon dating her teeth and bones - that historians believe they have finally identified England’s first abbess and one of the country’s earliest saints.The remarkable discovery was made by Kent archaeologists and historians, working with Queen\u0027s University in Belfast, who confirmed that human remains kept at the Church of St Mary and St Eanswythe Folkestone are almost certainly those of the saint.The discovery has been hailed as “a stunning result of national importance and has drawn comparisons with the exhumation of King Richard III after DNA confirmed that bones found beneath a Leicester car park in 2012 were those of the former king of England.The findings revealed at a special event at the church on Friday evening to mark the start of British Science Week 2020.Dr Andrew Richardson, FSA, from the Canterbury Archaeological Trust, said: This locally-based community partnership has produced a stunning result of national importance.It now looks highly probable that we have the only surviving remains of a member of the Kentish royal house, and of one of the earliest Anglo-Saxon saints.Tooth and bone samples were carbon dated and the results pointed to a high probability of a mid-seventh century death date.The relics mark a period that saw the very beginning of Christianity in England - and signify a continuous Christian witness in Folkestone that stretches from her life to the present day.St Eanswythe’s grandfather King Ethelbert was the first English king to convert to Christianity under Augustine. St Eanswythe is believed to have founded one of the earliest monastic communities in England, most likely around AD 660 on the Bayle - the overlooked historic centre of Folkestone. As well as founding the earliest institution for nuns in England, she was also almost certainly its abbess. In 1535, the church was a priory church which had monks. However following the Dissolution of the Monasteries, relics were destroyed across England. It is thought that St Eanswythe\u0027s skull was handed over by the monks. However the rest of her remains might well have been destroyed in the Reformation - along with those of her contemporaries - had they not been concealed in the north wall of the Folkestone church by the monks.St Eanswythe is the patron saint of Folkestone, and is believed to have founded one of the earliest monastic communities in England, most likely around AD 660 on the Bayle - the overlooked historic centre of the town.St Eanswythe is believed to have died between the ages of 17 to 22, however her cause of death is currently unknown. The discovery represents the conjunction of two projects: The Finding Eanswythe Project and Folkestone Museum.The project has been locally led and run, with many of the specialists and team involved originating from Folkestone or East Kent. The team has been supported by a large number of local colleagues and volunteers and  was funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund.The project now needs to raise funds for the next stage of work, which will reveal more about St Eanswythe and to ensure that her remains are housed properly for the future and can be securely displayed for research and tourism purposes.The next analytical steps will include stable isotope analysis and DNA analysis.The Revd Dr Lesley Hardy, director of the Finding Eanswythe project, said: As you walk through the streets of Folkestone, you are walking, layer upon layer, over ancient history that is now largely hidden from view.Finding Eanswythe was about bringing that forgotten history back to the surface.Dr Richardson added: There is more work to be done to realise the full potential of this discovery.But certainly the project represents a wonderful conjunction not only of archaeology and history, but also of a continuous living faith tradition at Folkestone from the mid-seventh century down to the present day.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus uk map where cases","story":"Coronavirus reached Britain in late January, cases have been on the rise since late February and the first death was recorded on March 5.Thousands of people in the UK have been tested for Covid-19, and the government released an emergency action plan to deal with the potential pandemic.It warned up to one in five workers in the UK could be off sick during a coronavirus peak, while the police may switch to only dealing with serious crime. The 27-page document sets out the UK-wide response, with possible measures including the cancellation of non-urgent operations and retired NHS staff being called back to duty.The \u0027s map below plots where cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in the UK. It is sourced from Public Health England announcements and will be updated regularly based on trustworthy data.On Wednesday, Public Health England confirmed 36 new cases of coronavirus had been detected in the UK.And on Friday the Department for Heath and Social Care said an additional 47 patients had been infected - the largest single day rise to date - bringing the total across the UK to 163.Of those located in England, the largest number has been detected in London, with 29 cases recorded in the capital.Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty said 29 of the new cases this week had travelled from recognised countries or clusters under investigation.He said three contracted the virus in the UK, but it was not yet clear if they contracted it directly or indirectly from someone returning from abroad. An elderly patient with underlying health conditions was the first person to die in the UK having been diagnosed with coronavirus, according to the Royal Berkshire NHS Trust.A second death was confirmed on Friday.The unnamed patient in his 80s is thought to have succumbed to COVID-19 on Thursday night while being treated at Milton Keynes, Hospital, Bucks.Prof Whitty said all UK cases were being investigated and contact tracing has begun.He told BBC Breakfast there could be a need to do extreme things to protect the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions in the event of a UK epidemic.He said the NHS would cope with a major spread of cases but could come under very high pressure in a large epidemic.He said: For the great majority of people this will be a mild or moderate disease, anything from a sniffle to having to go to bed for a few days rather like with mild flu.And there are some people who will get it with no symptoms at all, but for a minority of people - and this is particular in people who are older people or people with pre-existing health conditions - the risk is higher.The NHS will always cope because the NHS is an emergency service which is very good at adapting to what it finds itself with.But he said if the UK sees a very large epidemic, then it will put very high pressure on the NHS and there could be several weeks which could be very difficult for the health service and wider society.Prof Whitty said he believes there is now onward transmission between people in the UK - which could lead to spiralling numbers - although only two cases of this nature have been identified so far. Mitigation efforts in the UK will be driven by the UK Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Strategy 2011 and fall into four main areas:At the end of December, the Chinese authorities sent out a public alert warning that a pneumonia of unknown cause had been identified in Wuhan, central China.Some 10 days later, on Jan 7, scientists announced that a new coronavirus was the source of the outbreak – quickly adding that it did not appear to be spreading between humans. At that point, fewer than 60 cases had been found. But now the virus, which has since been named Covid-19, has spread to well over 70 countries, infecting more than 93,000 people and killing nearly 3,200. Scientists believe that the virus has mutated into two strains: the older ‘S-type’ appears to be milder and less infectious, while the ‘L-type’ which emerged later, spreads quickly and currently accounts for around 70 per cent of cases. This map, which updates automatically, shows where the disease is now, how many cases there have been and how many people have died: More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/03/05/TELEMMGLPICT000227008933_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"covid 19 isnt just flu itis time take virus seriously","story":"Italy is shutting its schools and restaurants are desertedPublic libraries are putting away children’s toys. Supermarkets are running low on loo paper. Everywhere, you see the furtive rubbing of hands that indicates the breaking out of sanitising gel (while stocks last). In a somewhat unexpected development, sales of Corona beer have fallen through the floor.Yet still, for the most part, we remain nonchalant. Two American friends visiting recently were astonished to find Londoners going about their business largely as normal. There is even a faint air of contempt here for the drastic measures being taken in some parts of the world. China is welding people into apartment buildings, Italy is shutting its schools and Switzerland is cancelling luxury watch conferences, but we Brits know how to take on a little dose of the flu without so much hoo-ha! This air of confidence is misplaced.There is still a huge amount we don’t know about this new virus. Even the death rate is just an estimate. Taking only confirmed cases – recoveries versus deaths – results in a death rate close to 6 per cent. But scientists are pretty sure that there must be hundreds of thousands of “invisible” cases with symptoms so mild that the carrier hasn’t been tested. That is how they get to their best guess death rate of 1 per cent.The chances are that the real rate could be lower still. The NHS is better prepared than China’s health system was when this started, not least because it is better funded and we have had time to get ready. But the risk for the elderly is still uncomfortably high. Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, did not manage to sound entirely reassuring when asked to calm fears amongst old people and he replied: “The great majority of people will survive this.” By which he means around 85 per cent, from the data so far.There is also a question-mark around smokers. One theory is that the higher death rate for men and the deaths among young, seemingly fit health workers in China is due to smoking, but there is no data either way. Brits, fortunately, smoke less than the Chinese.Unfortunately, efforts at containment are hitting an intractable problem. Of the 163 cases identified at the time of writing (of about 20,000 tested) in the UK, at least a dozen simply cannot be traced back to any other known case or foreign travel. In other words, the illness is already spreading undetected. One possibility is that children, who mercifully seem to be less vulnerable to the disease, are nonetheless getting it and displaying no symptoms, thereby acting as silent spreaders. This is one reason why schools for nearly 300 million children worldwide are now closed.These other countries who are shutting schools and cancelling conferences are doing so not because they are a bunch of overreacting wimps, but because it may be one of the most effective ways to slow the spread of the disease. Over here, UK policymakers are watching attentively to see whether it works and if we ought to do likewise. Whether this hesitation is sensible and proportionate or a historic mistake is not yet clear.The unspoken truth is that these decisions are ultimately about risk appetite. Scientists can offer advice, but the uncertainties are so great that politicians ultimately have to take decisions about how far to go. The government appears, so far, to be taking the risk that it is not worth implementing measures that cause enormous disruption China, because widespread contagion is ultimately inevitable.There are good reasons for this approach. We know that the epidemic has slowed down in China, but we have no idea if this is due to its drastic quarantine measures, which have plunged its economy into deep freeze. It seems more likely that China’s supreme effort at contact-tracing, which involves finding and testing everyone who has had intimate contact with virus sufferers, was the key factor in dampening down the virus’ spread. The UK has traced the contacts of confirmed patients as much as it can so far.Disruption also has other costs. There have been Chinese cases reported of people in need of urgent medical care for other illnesses but finding themselves trapped in their houses because of the shutdown. And you cannot keep an economy in lockdown forever. When workers return to factories and children go back to school, contagion may well flare up again. Even if we were to shut down schools now, who is to say the virus would not just come back when they reopened?The UK’s approach carries its own risks, however. It may turn out that a short, sharp period of disruption now would stop the virus in its tracks and that we are missing a vital chance. It is hard to imagine that this would not be the undisputed policy choice if those at most risk were young children, rather than the elderly.The virus planning paper released this week estimated that, in a worst-case scenario, 80 per cent of people could ultimately get infected. Such an enormous epidemic is unlikely, but if the virus grows on anything like that scale, the disruption to daily life and the health system will make a few conference cancellations look like a mere prelude. In Hubei province, for example, where the virus first emerged, there are just over 67,000 confirmed cases. That is equivalent to just 0.1 per cent of the population. Even accounting for the many “invisible” cases that have not been identified, the gap between 0.1 and 80 per cent suggests that scientists think there is a long, long way to go before this thing dies down.Boris Johnson is keen to put the country at ease. This week, he claimed to have visited a hospital of coronavirus patients and, “I shook hands with everybody!” But we should be under no illusions. This isn’t just a bad flu season and we don’t yet know what it will take to get it even vaguely under control.

They could be told to self-isolate if they’ve got symptoms, to call NHS 111, or simply be reminded to wash their hands.The plan is understood to have been devised by Public Health England, which then approached the telecoms firms through the DCMS. Companies will be asked about the cost and feasibility of adopting the system before the outbreak reaches its expected peak in the coming weeks. There are already more than 160 cases in the UK (see map below).Last night, Lord Harris of Haringey, who sits on the National Security Strategy Committee, urged the government to deliver the alerting system as soon as possible.This would appear to be a good idea, he said.Any way to get information out there quickly and easily must be welcomed. My only worry is that these messages will have to be quite long, so I do wonder whether people would actually read them.We can\u0027t be bombarding people, otherwise they\u0027ll just switch off.Under EU law, every citizen using their mobile phone when travelling to another member state must automatically receive a text message with emergency information on arrival.In the UK, the welcome messages are sent only to mobile phones registered in foreign countries. The coronavirus plan would see SMS texts sent to every phone, including returning British citizens.Officials from the Cabinet Office have also contacted telecoms firms to discuss a more ambitious cell broadcasting system, it is understood.Unlike the welcome message technology, the system would allow alerts to be sent to specific geographic areas deemed to be at risk. The technology is already used in other countries including the US to warn against nuclear attack or natural disaster.Supporters claim the message alerts could have saved lives during major incidents including the London Bridge terrorist attack and Grenfell Tower fire.Senior figures have raised concerns, however, that the messages could be hijacked by hackers or malicious foreign powers to induce mass panic.The project is being overseen by Dr Nigel P. Brown from the Civil Contingencies Secretariat, the government body responsible for emergency planning, and officials from Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Fujitsu, the Japanese telecommunications giant, was commissioned last year to examine how the system could be developed in the UK.The idea of a public alert system was also heavily backed by police and fire chiefs in the wake of the London Bridge terror attack, The  disclosed.During a secret summit on Dec 5, a week after the attack, senior fire and police officers asked why it was taking so long for the technology to be introduced in Britain.Held at the BT Tower in central London, the summit was attended by officials from the Civil Contingencies Secretariat, the government body responsible for emergency planning, and senior leaders from the NHS, National Police Chiefs\u0027 Council, politan Police and National Fire Chiefs Council. Multiple sources told The  of their frustration at the Government\u0027s slow progress in adopting a public alert system. One senior officer is said to have asked why emergency workers are expected to tackle major disasters with older technology than the public we are trying to help. A mass warning system using SMS technology was trialled in 2013 but returned “disappointing” results, according to government documents.The new cell broadcasting system would automatically send alerts to every smartphone regardless of whether the user had opted in. Major mobile phone operators have helped develop the technology for use in the UK while the Australian government, which uses the system during wildfires, has also been asked for advice.The approach is already used widely in other countries including the United States and India. In January 2018, an incoming missile alert plunged residents of Hawaii into panic before it was declared a false alarm. Later it emerged that a junior worker had accidentally pressed the wrong button.A spokesman for the Department for Digital, Culture Media and Sport refused to comment last night.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"stocking loo roll may not bum idea","story":"Of all the household products that most people would fear running short of it is surely lavatory paper that tops the listAside from prescription medicines, of all the household products that most people would fear running short of it is surely lavatory paper that tops the list. And the panic-buying of is not as irrational as it might appear.In short, we don’t make much of it. This country is one of Europe’s biggest importers of lavatory paper and disposable nappies (which use pulp paper). Around 85 per cent – or 1.1 million out of 1.3 million tonnes – of all the toilet tissue used in the UK annually is imported, according to The Confederation of Paper Industries.The real question, as the urge to prep for the coming coronavirus outbreak takes hold, is how likely is the UK to run out? Australia, which is highly reliant on Chinese supply chains that have been crunched by draconian factory closures, has already seen panic-buying to the point where the government has introduced controls. Shopkeepers have had to call the police in to break up fights over the last few rolls available, such are the indignities of rushing to preserve one’s dignity in a crisis.For now, no-one expects European countries to face that kind of crunch since the levels of factory closures possible in Xi Jinping’s China are much less acceptable over here. The odds are still that the paper mills of Scandinavia will keep on turning, and the UK will still be adequately catered for – so long as nobody panics.Which is, of course, the problem. Back during last year’s no-deal Brexit preparations, Government advisers told me quietly that “the one thing I’d stockpile, if I was you” was loo paper, given the UK’s vulnerability to supply chain disruption. This, of course, I rapidly shared with  readers.Loo paper is bulky, so if everyone buys two or three extra packets, very quickly you start to see wide empty spaces opening up on supermarket shelves, which only redoubles the panic. If there’s no loo paper, even the most sanguine shopper will ask, then what next? Simultaneously, this shakes confidence in government assurances that there is enough of everything to go round – meaning that promises of plenty made in good faith in the morning media round can be rendered worthless by the afternoon.Which brings us back to Brexit. As things stand, the Government under Boris Johnson is charging much harder towards the Brexit finish line than that of his predecessor Theresa May, overtly threatening a no-deal Australian-style if the EU does not come to heel. The transport industry is very clear that this risks bringing back the spectre of long delays at the ports, clogging up the Channel Tunnel as hauliers battle with mountains of new paperwork and customs and safety declarations.If that happens, there remains a serious risk that the Australian-style Brexit might include some Australian-style loo-paper shortages.

How do I self-isolate? Is it the same as social distancing? Why are things different in France and Italy? And what about my gran?Confusion is growing over the Government’s “contain, delay, research and mitigate strategy”. For some, it is provoking anxiety and in others complacency is setting in. The problem is fueled by its title. It mixes goals with actions and encourages the idea that its components must follow one another in strict sequence: contain - delay - research - mitigate. The Number 10 press team may have thought the sound-bitey title would appeal to a British sense of orderliness, but it’s a poor shorthand for the real deal. Even Professor Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer and a man who knows an objective from an action, is struggling: We are now basically, mainly in delay, but we are maintaining some elements of contain, we are mainly in the second stage at this point”, he told MPs on Friday. The actual strategy we are following comes from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the EU’s main public health body. Its timeline is defined, not by objectives, but the likely progress of an outbreak in five scenarios (zero to four) as it moves across Europe. At one end of the continuum is “scenario 0”, a country like Bulgaria with no recorded cases. At the other end is “scenario 4”, a country like Italy with widespread infection.At each stage in the timeline, the principle objective a government should be pursuing is given - containment, delay and mitigation, etc. Below that are all the practical measures and actions it should be taking to achieve the objective - contact tracing, hand washing messages, school closures etc.  Laying out the strategy like this has benefits. It drives home that a disease outbreak is not a static thing but one which develops over time. Questions about differing national responses start to fade, because it becomes apparent they are at different points on the same epidemic curve but following common guidelines.Crucially for the designated “public face” of the response - Prof Whitty in England - it becomes obvious that things like containment, delay and research will be happening simultaneously much of the time. The UK sits at or about scenario 2 on the ECDC document, with cases that have been imported and some local human-to human transmission. The main goal for the moment is contain and delay and all the counter measures recommended for this phase have been implemented.Next stop will be scenario 3, roughly where France, Spain and Germany sit now. This is when localised outbreaks start to merge and sustained human-to-human transmission takes grip, putting pressure on the health service. A range of “mitigation” measures including the possible cancellation of mass gatherings, such as sports events and concerts, will then be considered. France has placed a ban on gatherings of over 5,000 people, for example.It is still not certain that we will move to the next phase, although it is probable. The UK response has so far been strong and it may yet prove possible to contain the virus. Prof Ian Jones, a virologist at the University of Reading, said: I think we\u0027re doing relatively well, I think those that have been diagnosed positive seem to have been diagnosed quickly, which minimises their chances of spreading it and also maximises treatment possibility.  Prof Jones said there was also a degree of luck involved: It depends on the density of the population and frequency of travel within that population. If someone is in the middle of Cornwall in a farmhouse not going anywhere, they won\u0027t catch it or spread it. That\u0027s obviously a very different scenario compared to someone in central Manchester”. Others said the key to understanding the Government’s strategy was to regard it as “flexible”. In different phases, the Government\u0027s actions may remain the same but be re-emphasised. If a pocket of the country remained virus free it would be perfectly sensible to put in place containment measures there, even if the disease was widespread elsewhere and mitigation measures were dominant. The need for research will be a constant throughout.I think it\u0027s a strategy based on the evidence here in the UK and in my view it\u0027s one that should be as modified as risk assessments tell, said David Heymann, an epidemiologist and former assistant director general of the WHO. It\u0027s flexible and if there is new evidence it can rapidly change. Interventions can be singular or blended.There is also some confusion about what has become known as self isolation or voluntary quarantine, with many unsure what it entails and others interpreting it overly literally.  Do you lock yourself in the loo and avoid all people, or do you remain in the house but don’t go out? To what extent are you isolated alone or with other people? This is something that has to be judged on a case by case basis, said Prof Jones, who suggested a common sense approach - don’t self isolate with elderly relatives, for instance. If the outbreak progresses to scenario three or four in the UK on the ECDC scale, the major pinch point will be a squeeze on NHS services. Although the UK ranks number two in the world for pandemic preparedness, our underfunded health system is a weak point. Other issues include high levels of urbanisation, age profile of the population and the fact that some elements of our preparedness are not made available for external review.Jonathan Ball, professor of virology at the University of Nottingham, said that self isolation as a means to take pressure off the NHS was a necessary risk: There\u0027s just not the capacity in hospitals and there\u0027s no medical or clinical reason to keep someone with something that is essentially a cold in hospital.The only benefit of the hospital policy previously was containment - that\u0027s the risk, you\u0027re reliant on goodwill. In terms of care and health of the patient there\u0027s no problem, but the patients really do need to adhere to not wandering around the community if we\u0027re going to continue to slow this virus down.  Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/03/05/19/container.jpg","title":"coronavirus business impact britain no deal brexit","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.While large multinationals may be able to ride out the economic turmoil on the horizon, some smaller firms have more to worry about.\u0026nbspBen Chapman reportsBritish manufacturers say they are summoning up the “wartime spirit” to deal with anticipated staff shortages and supply disruption caused by the coronavirus.But for some, the major concern is a short, deep shock from the outbreak followed by the longer, more drawn-out pain of a hard Brexit.While large multinationals may be able to ride out those twin problems, some smaller firms have more to worry about.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe government warned this week that up to a fifth of the workforce could be off sick at the height of the Covid-19 epidemic, a scenario that would present serious problems for manufacturers.“We may have a few people off or we may be decimated,” says Donald Pow, a manager at Allied Vehicles Group in Glasgow.\u0026nbspBoris Johnson spokesman insists coronavirus will not delay BrexitAround 250 of Allied’s 670 staff work in manufacturing, mostly in Glasgow. They operate 15 stages of a production line which transforms ordinary vehicles to make them accessible for people with disabilitiesWorkers at each stage have specialised expertise which can’t necessarily be replaced if significant numbers are off work. Clearly working from home is not an option.“It’s very difficult. We can move people from other parts of the business but at some point we would not be running efficiently,” says Pow. “We’re not just going to shut our doors and say, ‘Things are a bit difficult, let’s stop working.’\u0026nbspThere’s a bit of that wartime spirit.”For Allied, Brexit, and the\u0026nbspuncertainty over what it will entail, represent bigger concerns than the virus, says Pow –\u0026nbspat least for now.The company exports vehicles to countries across western Europe. It is already concerned about tariffs and the effect of a highly uncertain future. “Brexit is affecting both the reality of our business and our customers’ confidence,” says Pow, who is concerned the company will be less competitive in future with rivals based inside the EU.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The same cannot be said for many British companies who may need to call on emergency funding to ride any turbulence caused by the outbreak.The Bank of England’s governor, Andrew Bailey\u0026nbsp(who starts the job in 10\u0026nbspdays), told MPs this week he may take action imminently to support lending to struggling small businesses. That might include relaxing banks’ capital requirements to allow them to hand out more loans – but there’s no guarantee that the banks will actually do it.Live: EU reveals ‘very difficult differences’ with UK over BrexitBoris Johnson spokesman insists coronavirus will not delay BrexitCoronavirus and no-deal Brexit: Spot the differenceBoost from US trade deal could be as small as 0.02 per cent of GDPFor some British firms, the impact is already being felt.Tudor Rose International, a Gloucestershire-based logistics company, exports well-known food and drinks brands around the world.\u0026nbspIt is close to the sharp end of the outbreak. Costs have shot up around 15 per cent so far as the company struggles to find enough ships to transport its products, says commercial manager\u0026nbspJohn Stephenson.\u0026nbspTudor Rose is losing sales as ships stay stuck in Chinese ports, causing a major backlog in the key arteries of world trade.\u0026nbspWith many Chinese factories shut down to contain the virus’s spread, there is much less to ship and so freight companies have cancelled sailings. That leaves British firms facing a shortage of containers to put their goods into, pushing up prices.“It has an effect all along those routes via places like Mumbai and the Middle East,” says\u0026nbspStephenson.Shipping is often seen as a canary in the coal mine for economic shocks to come. With a vessel taking about a month to make its way from China to Europe, the sharp drop in activity in China is still working its way through.Stephenson estimates that there are about 100 fewer vessels on the global routes along which Tudor Rose ships its food and drink. That may not sound like a lot but each one is vast, carrying an average 20,000 containers.Two million fewer containers has a real impact, says Stephenson. “It’s already been quite pronounced. We’ve had a customer already waiting for a large order that we haven’t been able to fill.”Created with Sketch.Airports empty as Coronavirus affects aviation industry Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.711 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China1011 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China711 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China1011 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, ChinaThe effect coronavirus is having on shipping is unprecedented, he says. “We do see some seasonality of demand but we’ve not seen an event like this that’s had this much impact.”Tudor Rose has been looking to boost sales in North America where disruption has been less severe than Asia but there is a limit to this strategy.“We sell fast-moving consumer goods so we need a consistent, regular supply to our customers,” says Stephenson. The company anticipates some rebound in demand when the outbreak calms down but for the most part, sales lost now are likely to be lost for good.If Chinese ports open up fully again things will improve, but Tudor Rose fears there may be further shutdowns at other key points along the route as governments seek to contain the virus.“We are at the early stages of this. It’s only in the last 10\u0026nbspdays that it’s come to light how significant this could be,”\u0026nbspsays StephensonBack in Glasgow, Donald Pow is remaining vigilant but relatively relaxed, given the situation. “We don’t know what’s going to happen many of the experts don’t seem to know what’s going to happen.”“It’s like that old football manager cliche: we just take each game as it comes.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Or are companies in for disappointment?Hundreds of flights have been cancelled, major sporting events called off.Business has dried up entirely for some unfortunate firms.The economic damage from the coronavirus outbreak has already been significant.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAnd it’s likely to get worse.There’s speculation the Tokyo Olympics this summer might need to be postponed – a festival on which the Japanese government has already spent some $25bn (£19bn).But that’s why businesses and iniduals take out insurance isn’t it? To cover themselves for when unexpected and hugely damaging shocks like disease outbreaks hit?What are symptoms of coronavirus – and where has it spread?Latest travel updates as coronavirus continues to spreadCan face masks really protect you against coronavirus or flu?The dirty truth about washing your handsThe UK government this week, under pressure from industry lobby groups, designated\u0026nbspCovid-19 a “notifiable disease”, in order to make it easier for affected companies to claim insurance.So can we expect an avalanche of claims and big losses for insurance companies as a result of this outbreak?Or are companies in for disappointment if they expect to be compensated for the economic damage wreaked by Covid-19?It’s worth drawing a distinction between two broad categories of business insurance, say experts.First, there’s event cancellation insurance, which is a type generally offered by sophisticated insurance markets like Lloyd’s of London or major insurance conglomerates.Torsten Jeworrek of the German insurer Munich Re\u0026nbsptold\u0026nbspReuters\u0026nbsplast month that his firm had provided cancellation insurance for the Tokyo games “in the hundreds of millions of euros”.Second, there’s the more general cover for “business interruption” offered to companies by smaller insurance firms.But if a firm is covered it’s covered, isn’t it?Not necessarily. It all depends on the wording of the inidual insurance contract.But it’s important to bear a broad principle in mind, namely that there’s a difference from the perspective of the insurance company between “definable” and “undefinable” risk.And insurance firms are unlikely to have written an insurance policy that covers a firm from the impact of an undefinable risk.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Think of a hotel that sees its bookings slump because people change their travel plans. Or a company that suffers because it’s staff don’t turn up to work because of illness.Would cutting rates really help the economy deal with coronavirus?In any case, industry experts caution that “notifiable disease” clauses (the classification the UK government updated this week) are not standard in insurance contracts.“Standard business insurance policies are designed and priced to cover standard risks, not those that are very unlikely, such as the effects of Covid-19,” said a spokesperson for the Association of British Insurers.So what’s the bottom line: are insurers going to be hit hard or not?Crawford Forensic Accounting Services produced a report last month on the likely impact of coronavirus on the insurance sector.It concluded that “successful claims under business interruption coverage for infection are not common”.Crawford director Frederique Hardy also told The Independent that event cancellation insurance contracts tend to be very bespoke, making it difficult to generalise about the ability of event organisers to make claim.Yet the general view of the industry – at the moment – is that coronavirus is unlikely to result in an explosion of costly payouts.If that’s correct it points to a lot of disappointed firms.And, as a by product, it’s likely to increase further the pressure on governments to give stressed companies economic relief in the form of more time to pay tax and perhaps forbearance on debt repayments to banks.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The Bank of Canada and the Reserve Bank of Australia also cut rates, with investors expecting other major central banks to soon follow suit.Officials and companies in Britain, France, Italy and the United States are struggling to deal with a steady rise in virus infections that have in some cases triggered corporate defaults, office evacuations, and panic buying of daily necessities.The outbreak spread across the United States on Thursday, surfacing in at least four new states.“The interplay of virus containment fears and stimulus measures means that in the near term we expect market volatility to persist,” said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management.Yields on US Treasuries fell to a record low and Treasury futures jumped as investors increased bets that the Fed will follow this week’s surprise rate cut with further easing.The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes fell to a record low of 0.7650 per cent on Friday.Minneapolis Federal Reserve president Neel Kashkari said late on Thursday the Fed could cut rates further if needed.Money markets are pricing in another 25 basis-point-cut from the current 1 per cent to 1.25 per cent range at the next Fed meeting on March 18-19 and a 50-basis-point cut by April.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In life, her dentition appears to have been pristine – with virtually no pre-death wear and tear.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But as coastal erosion undercut the cliffs, the abbesses who succeeded her\u0026nbspincreasingly realised that the building would eventually end up crashing into the sea below.Some time in the eighth century\u0026nbspher remains were removed from the stricken chapel and put into a specially built shrine in the nunnery’s main church.\u0026nbspBy the late 11 century, the nunnery had become a monastery.However, following the Norman conquest, a\u0026nbspcastle was built around it – so, in the 12\u0026nbspcentury, the monks demanded that they be allowed to move to a new, less secular, site.The princess’s bones were therefore disinterred again\u0026nbspand moved, in 1138, a few hundred metres away to a brand new church, a later version of which still stands today as Folkestone’s Parish Church. There she became the centre of a local cult and was believed to be able to help cure disease. Her official saint’s day\u0026nbspis 12 September.But, after the mediaeval period had drawn to a close, Eanswythe’s story took a new and unexpected turn.When Henry VIII broke away from the Roman Catholic Church and established the Church of England, the government became increasingly hostile to the veneration of saints. In 1535, the prior of Folkestone seems to have realised that, unless he took drastic action, government officials would seize and destroy Eanswythe’s bones. So he (or some of his monks) appear to have hurriedly forced the lead box containing them\u0026nbspinto a secret hole in the church wall and blocked it off.The prior, or a senior church member, then showed the officials a probably gold or gem-studded reliquary, almost certainly containing just a few parts of the saint’s skull.Discoveries offer detailed glimpse of life in prehistoric BritainThat box, with its diminished contents, was subsequently seized by the government and was then acquired by a member of Henry VIII’s household, a Folkestone politician and businessman called Anthony Aucher, who no doubt profited substantially by selling any gems which had adorned the reliquary.Meanwhile, Eanswythe rested safe and secure in her dark hiding place inside the church’s north wall, just beside the altar.Gradually her hiding place was forgotten – until, in 1885, workmen engaged in modernising the church\u0026nbspstumbled across her remains. There was immediate speculation about the possibility that they could be the bones of St Eanswythe and the discovery was reported in newspapers worldwide.But in the 19th century, there was no way of confirming her identity.So for 132 years, the bones were stashed away in a specially constructed wall niche and once again began to fade from memory, until just three years ago a group of local historians and archaeologists decided to try to solve the mystery.They did so by asking scientists to examine the bones in order to discover the long-dead inidual’s age at death and sex – and by carrying out radiocarbon dating tests to ascertain whether the bones did indeed date from the seventh century.The answers virtually proved that the fragmentary skeleton was indeed that of St Eanswythe.The scientists were able to demonstrate that the inidual was almost certainly female.Medieval sources had said that she had died very young – and the scientific examination of her bones and teeth revealed that the inidual had been between 17 and 21 years old when she had passed away.The radiocarbon tests then revealed that she had died in the mid-seventh century – the exact period when Eanswythe‘s life ended.What’s more, examination of her teeth showed virtually no pre-death scratches on her tooth enamel, a fact that suggests that she had consumed relatively little coarse food.Throughout the medieval period, a large number of stories attached themselves to her. She was credited with at least five miracles\u0026nbspand was venerated by people in the Folkestone area.She was believed, for instance, to have miraculously made water run uphill (a story probably developed in order to explain an optical illusion which seemed to show a local aqueduct channelling water up a gradient). She was also credited for resurrecting a dead goose that had been stolen and eaten.Eanswythe was also said to have miraculously lengthened a wooden beam to construct a church by calling on Christ to help when a pagan king and his gods had failed to lengthen it.And after her death, her ghost was said to have cured a man suffering from leprosy or some other skin disease.Remains of ‘man who named Australia’ found during HS2 excavationWho was Suzy Lamplugh? New excavations aim to solve 1986 murderExcavations of medieval chapel at site linked to King ArthurBut, beyond those legends, what was her real significance?In a sense, she symbolises the huge contribution to early English history made by high-status women.\u0026nbspPrior to the coming of Christianity, it is not known whether Anglo-Saxon women played any major political roles.But the coming of Christianity certainly provided one. Princesses played a major part in the conversion of England from paganism to the new faith. When Anglo-Saxon and other Christian princesses married pagan Anglo-Saxon kings, their presence often allowed Christianity to gain the upper hand and flourish.What’s more, those royal daughters who did not marry kings and princes were established by their royal fathers or brothers as abbesses of a new type of institution – nunneries, which in turn, alongside the monasteries, began to wield substantial social and cultural influence. Many of the new abbesses (like Eanswythe) became popular saints and were revered for centuries.St Eanswythe died some 1,360 years ago\u0026nbspbut her newly rediscovered life and times are about to captivate a new audience.“Our identification of St Eanswythe’s skeletal remains open up the possibility of using DNA to investigate the ancestry of the Kentish and Frankish royal dynasties,” said the senior archaeologist involved in the project, Dr Andrew Richardson of the Canterbury Archaeological Trust.“St Eanswythe was a local heroine of great relevance to local people. In mediaeval times, they saw her as their protector from disease and suffering. Researching her today will bring the people of Folkestone nearer to that history,” said the head of the Finding Eanswythe project, Dr Lesley Hardy, a historian at Canterbury Christ Church University.The project is being largely financed by the National Lottery Heritage Fund.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Some members of staff working on the scheme may have left their posts for more secure positions.”Ms Lant called on the Home Office to avoid a “cliff-edge” scenario where people suddenly become undocumented for missing the deadline, and demanded clarity around the circumstances under which applications would still be accepted following the cut-off date.\u0026nbspCaitlin Boswell Jones, project officer at the Join Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said the £8m investment was welcome but that it “barely touched” what was needed to support all vulnerable people – and called on ministers to grant automatic settled status to all EU citizens.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The likelihood is that tens of thousands of EU citizens will be unable to apply, will then fall out of status and become vulnerable to the hostile environment.”Marianne Lagrue, policy manager at Coram’s migrant children’s project, said the charity welcomed the Home Office’s announcement, but warned that a finite pot of money\u0026nbspthe lasts for one year was “not going to cut it” for a scheme for which applications are going to get increasingly complex.“The concentration of complex case within the number of cases that remain is getting bigger and bigger as we get closer to the deadline. We expect that there will be a flurry towards the deadline, and there will be people who miss it. Whether or not there will continue to be public money available to assist these people remains an unanswered question,” she said.“The funding needs to be guaranteed in perpetuity and to adequately meet the need and complexity of the cases.”Charity helping children in care stay in UK has to stop taking casesMs Lagrue said that vulnerable applicants would increasingly require legal professionals, rather than NGOs, to help them apply – and called on the government to consider introducing legal aid for these cases.“Rather than creating something new specifically to meet the needs of this cohort, the Home Office needs to fund the basic tenets of the welfare state that are there to capture these people with their legal problems,” she said.“The government needs to take a holistic view of the long-term needs of people. Anyone with a complex case and anyone who has an appeal should be eligible for legal aid.”It comes after it emerged\u0026nbspthe EU settlement scheme was responsible for breaching\u0026nbspGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) law 100 times between April and August last year.A report by the Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration (ICIBI) also raised concerns about a lack of support for vulnerable applicants, hidden costs of applying and a lack of transparency and detail in the Home Office data.In total, 3.2 million people have so far registered for EU settled status, which they must obtain in order to continue living legally in the UK after June 2021. Of these, 2.7 million have been granted the status – meaning around 500,000 applications are currently going through the system.Announcing the new funding on Friday, Mr Foster said: “EU citizens are an integral part of our society, culture and community, and this is their home. Supporting vulnerable EU citizens and their families is at the forefront of our approach to the EU Settlement Scheme.The Home Office has been contacted for comment.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Within an hour, I was heading up Interstate 5 to Everett, to talk to health officials and get reactions from residents. (Summation of interviews: Not concerned. Trying to stay calm.)Six weeks later, the nation’s first fatality was reported in the suburb of Kirkland. This time it was a dash northwest on Interstate 405 to talk to people stocking in a supermarket close to the hospital where the person had died and where the LifeCare Centre nursing home was located. (Summation of interviews: Increasingly concerned. Trying to calm, but anxious.)Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesNow the death toll has reached 11. More than 100,000 employees of companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Facebook, among them my wife, have been told to work from home to reduce the spread of the virus. \u0026nbspResidents over the age of 60, or people with underlying health conditions, have also been advised to stay at home. Officials have ordered school districts to close. They have also suggested community groups cancel events involving more than ten people.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Airports empty as Coronavirus affects aviation industry Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.711 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China1011 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China711 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China1011 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, ChinaImages from stores such a Costco show massive lines.

Mike Pence is visiting the state capital.And yet people in the neighhourhood coffee shop this morning appeared to display little concern. One customer, Lindsay Berger, who was chatting to two other women, said she was stunned by how people were “overreacting”.“It makes me worry what we’d do if there was a real crisis,” she said. She said friends in New York had sent her images of the Union Square branch of Whole Foods Market with the shelves bare.\u0026nbsp“This is contagious, but mild. What if it was something that was contagious but acute?”With most crises or declared states of emergency, be it the Fukishima earthquake of 2011, or Typhoon Haiyan that tore through the Philippines in 2013, the challenge for reporters is largely one of logistics.\u0026nbspCan you get to the place, can you find a translator.

It feels an exercise in indulgence and privilege to report people’s concerns about whether to take a flight on their vacation. It hardly feels like a crisis if people can click a button to restock their food cupboard.\u0026nbspAs with so much of today’s world, privilege will likely emerge as a defining faultline as the coronavirus crisis plays out.If you have health insurance you know you can be treated if you fall ill. If you have a place to live, you can work from home, assuming you have a job. Unless, that is, you work in one of the warehouses filled with canned food, or are a delivery driver, or work in a coffee shop or fast-food restaurant.But what about the estimated 5,0000 of Seattle’s homeless, their plight worsened by the shortage in affordable housing those thousands of well-rewarded tech employees\u0026nbsphave helped to create?How do you get treatment for coronavirus if your home is a tent under the interstate, or next to a new construction?

Is it that person sneezing on the bus? What about that person walking their dogs?For reporters, the challenge is identifying the locus. What is the essence of the story we’re trying to cover?As health officials step up their testing, many cases will be reported. We are almost certainly likely to see more deaths. At some point, those numbers will start to reduce, but that may be some time away.A heartening comment came from a member of staff in that coffee shop this morning when I expressed some surprise to find it open. She said it had been “business as usual” but that “everybody is making an effort to be super friendly”.Was that the employees or the customers, I asked.

Hook, line, and sinker, I guess. He did it.”Mr Adigrati said the thief probably did not know the value of the necklace.“This particular necklace looks a lot more expensive than what it is, so obviously the temptation was there: gold, bright, iconic Medusa head, so that would have been the temptation,” he told ABC News.Police are appealing for more information on the man, who has yet to be identified. He is described as white, aged between 40 to 50 years old and about 5ft 9in.The thief left just one clue behind – the hook from his fishing line.Senior constable Bede Whitty said he had never seen a crime quite like it before.“It’s fairly blatant and it’s quite bold as well, to have someone attend with a fishing rod in the middle of the night,” he said.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In extreme poverty, there is just not the ability to wash and sanitise hands regularly, for example.But this is the UK – one of the richest countries in the western world. We have the ability to collectively try and shut this disease down from spreading here.I’ve been fascinated and horried in equal measure over the past week on my talkRADIO show as listeners have shared true gross out stories of folk not washing their hands after going to the public loos or coughing all over communal food in the workplace or sneezing without a tissue on public transport.We can do better. And now we must – our very way of le could be dependent on it.In Japan where the tradition of wearing masks began, it was because people who had colds wanted to try and protect others from their germs.And perhaps Kim Woodburn – the undisputed queen of clean – had a point last week when she told me we are acting like “dirty devils” in this country and in this case it could actually kill us.The time has come for a dialogue about how we can call out people publicly but politelythey fail to reach basic standards of cleanliness.Looking after ourselves and being kind to each other is not simply limited to the words we use in the public domain.If you are running a business how about encouraging staff who are sick and clearly putting others at risk of infection to have the opportunity to work for a couple of days from home without feeling they are letting the side down in some way.If you are not in a good way healthwise yourself then take a couple of days off, avoid public transport and enclosed spaces with others, and realise that the world won’t come to an end while you’re recovering.If you are a parent or teacher start enforcing standards on our kids when it comes to going to the toilet and washing hands and eating.Andyou run a restaurant make sure hand sanitisers and soap are always available for customers and staff.And Nandos, I’m going to call you out here. As a very wealthy company you can afford to pay staff to make sure your restaurants are clean rather than expecting staff to do it as a favour after their shts, as a recent BBC investigation found.Your company can also most certainly afford to buy dferent mops and cleaning equipment to be used in the toilets and the kitchen, which staff have said is currently not provided.These very basic standards will help us all as a society and not just in the very urgent fight against a coronavirus pandemic.It’s about having a basic respect for each other. We all want to be healthy and so much of that starts from being clean.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Sue, pictured with Harry, says she didn’t realise he was overweight until his hip collapsed. And he had to be taken to hospital for horrible, complex, surgery.Didn’t realise  Gordon Bennett, talk about the elephant in the room. I mean, literally. The kid was half the size of their house. She didn’t notice the lack of exercise and the food Harry was putting away  And the fact that he took up the entire sofa and then some Whose fault is it that Harry needed an op We have an obesity epidemic. It is almost certainly this which has caused a drop in le expectancy in our poorest areas. The first such drop for a century.But now the obesity lobby and the health professionals have decided that obesity shouldn’t be “stigmatised”. Asit were an illness just like any other.Something which happens, without the victim knowing it is happening. This is b******s, and it’s dangerous.And stigma is a useful tool in the fight against obesity.It was only when my own son, during an argument a few years back, told me I was a fat, lardy t***er that I decided to sort my weight out. I’ve put most of it back on now so I need another bout of name-calling to provoke me to more action.My point is that fat-shaming can be very useful.Because being fat isn’t good for us and nor is it good for society. It costs the NHS millions each year. It makes people’s lives a misery. It is right that it should carry a stigma. Remove the stigma and you make being fat the natural state of being, no blame attached.Oh, you’re fat. How did that happen  What terrible bad luck, but never mind. But that is very far from the truth. With the exception of that tiny minority of people who are fat as a consequence of their genes, obesity is eminently and quite easily avoidable.Its main cause, these days, is a lack of exercise. If you’re a mum or dad and your kid is looking a bit porky, get them out for a walk every day, or do some sport with them. And keep an eye on what they are eating.Maybe ration the amount of time they spend online, tapping and swiping away on their fat a***s, pausing only to swallow a bowl of Doritos.This is surely basic parenting. Looking after your kids. Becauseyou don’t do that, they will die very young indeed.And it isn’t the Government that’s to blame. Or blind chance, or bad luck. It is because of lestyle choices. That’s the important word — choices.If you take exercise and keep an eye on what you eat, you won’t get fat and your hip won’t suddenly give up the ghost and collapse.The more we insist, out of kindness, that being fat is no fault of the inidual, the bigger the problem will grow.And now,you’ll excuse me, I have to take the dog for a walk. Four miles.That will lose me about  calories, tops. So still some way to go.INCIDENTALLY, on the subject of these face masks. Me and the family are going away for a few days in April. This will require going to an AIRPORT.Awful places, airports. Full of whacko foreigners who’ve just eaten a stewed bat and wonder why they are feeling a bit under the weather.So I had the following discussion with the missus about whether we should invest in face masks . . .Her: “Trouble is, they don’t work.”Me: “The really expensive ones do, the ones with filters. So they say.”Her: “Oh, right. But we’d look like twats, wouldn’t we ”Me: “Yes, we’d look like twats. No face masks.”That’s the British way. Rather die of pneumonia than look a bit of a twat.We’ve been told that in a worst-case scenario, , British people will die. Almost all of these, according to the experts, are elderly people with serious underlying medical conditions.Just to get this risk thing into perspective – how many of those people would have died anyway, as a consequence of those medical conditions, over the next six months THE “You Can’t Say That!” brigade are at it again.This time they have banned a woman called Selina Todd, pictured, from speaking at the Oxford University International Women’s Festival.Ironically, it was a festive which SHE helped to organise.Todd is an academic and a feminist. She has been barred from speaking because transgender activists don’t like her.They accuse her of being “transphobic”, which she denies. She probably just thinks – like a lot of the population and scientic community – that men who transition to being women are still basically men.We have to fight back against this hysterical tyranny imposed on us all by a tiny, minuscule, rump of deranged activists.It is time institutions such as Oxford University stood up for the principles of freedom of speech.That they fail to do so is a national disgrace.DANNY Baker’s been talking about how the BBC “threw him under a bus.”Baker was sacked for having tweeted a joke about Harry and Meghan and their son, Archie. He was accused of racism. But I doubt there’s a less racist bloke in the country.The BBC should admit it made a big mistake.Not only was it unjust, but I really miss listening to Danny on the radio – he’s a brilliant broadcaster.So here’s a suggestion. Give him Rylan Clark-Neal’s slot on Radio . I can’t be the only person in the country who turns off as soon as I hear him speak.Baker would bring a bit of wit to a network currently lacking it.So whether I like it or not she is now part of my world. Very grateful, thank you. My le is enriched.It seems that Stace is getting tired of “trolls” telling her she’s not bringing up her kids right. Not dressing them in appropriate clothing and stuff.Can’t say I give a monkey’s one way or the other. But I’m not absolutely certain that the best way to convince people you’re an elegant and well-mannered young lady is to take a selfie while you’re laying a cable, you know And then there’s this. She’s annoyed with the trolls right now. But what about when they’ve all gone and started to annoy someone  Who will be left to look at those selfies  Apart from Stacey THERE’S outrage in Darlington over the plight of a bunch of hamsters found in a hedge. Locals are more disgusted than at any time since my band, Dangerbird, played there in .These hamsters were in plastic boxes. And one can only assume they were bred to feed snakes. They have now been liberated. So what are they going to feed the snakes Kale and mung bean risotto  I’m telling you, they won’t like that. The likely answer is mice.So why is that any better than feeding them their cousins, hamsters A spokesmouse for the British Association of Small Rodentstold me yesterday: “It’s ludicrous. Totally inconsistent.Hamsters get away with murder. Because they’ve got chubby little cheeks and are refugees from Syria.“But nobody cares about us mice. And at least we don’t spend half the bloody night running around on a wheel like a moron. Can’t stand hamsters, me.”Anyway, Bob’s half the size of Mount Everest and rushing towards us at nearly ,mph. The experts reckon it will just miss us. But they can’t be exactly sure. Bob could swing by to say hello. In which case you can wear as many face masks as you like but it won’t help you one bit.You can even follow the BBC’s excellent advice on “how to wash your hands”. .Bob won’t care. You’ll be locked away in your self-isolating chamber under the stairs. Hands smothered in Dettol. Poncey face mask bought off Amazon.

Let’s take him seriously.True, only  Brits are confirmed to have it so far and few caught it in Britain. But that looks certain to soar until the global race for a vaccine bears fruit.It is true too that the vast majority will suffer mild symptoms. But the WHO says the percentage killed may be substantially higher than first thought. How long will the sage advice to wash our hands and stop touching our faces suffice Other nations are scrapping events and closing schools. So far our Queen has put on gloves and the Bond movie has been delayed. We may need more draconian steps sooner rather than later. And one thing is more certain:Covid- is already a monumental global economic shock and likely to worsen.CHANCELLOR Rishi Sunak must listen on fuel duty . . . to Tory backbenchers, small firms and the Sun ­readers.Hiking petrol and diesel taxes, frozen for a decade thanks to our campaign, may seem trivial to Londoners with the Tube and decent buses to rely on.It may even seem logical to increase electric car take-up.The reality outside the capital, and in the former “Red Wall” regions, is it will make working people worse off, will come as a painful blow to van drivers and a bombshell for truckers.And they won’t respond by spending £, on a battery-powered runabout they’ll need to charge every few miles.They will suffer it grimly, pass on the cost to customersthey can and resent that their new Tory Chancellor, as his first act, made their lives tougher.IT’S time for some perspective on Britain’s role in mitigating climate change.From all the Extinction Rebellion protests you might imagine we were among the world’s worst polluters. In fact our carbon footprint is its smallest since .Far from “doing nothing”, as Greta Thunberg claims, our emissions are down  per cent in a decade.Two per cent of our power comes from coal. In Germany it’s  — and China and India are building scores of new coal-burning plants.Heathrow’s expansion has been halted while they build HUNDREDS of new airports.And while we introduce bans and taxes that make Britain cleaner but threaten our prosperity, the world’s mega-polluters carry on regardless.Green campaigners should target those with the worst record, not one of the best.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently, or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments.

But the Queen is nothingnot practical.She has learned the lessons of the unedying exits of Princess Diana and the Duchess of York from The Firm and won’t make the same mistake this time.That’s why she quite beautully told Harry:  “You are much loved and will always be welcomed back” — a line that brings tears to the eyes of a  soppy old monarchist like me.The Queen has not accepted that Megxit is permanent and probably never will. Harry needs some time away to explore and live a le where he isn’t playing second fiddle to his father and brother.Duty and the love of his country might just pull him back soon, she hopes.But perhaps the Queen hasn’t factored in the persuasiveness and passion of Meghan — a truly modern woman with very dferent plans for her husband and their “brand”.SOMETHING Kinda Woohoo as Girls Aloud fans like me got fresh hope this week.One of the main obstacles preventing the chart-topping band reuniting has been the feud between the lovely Nadine Coyle and some of the other members.But Kimberley Walsh met Nadine this week and they seemed to be getting along just fine. Of course, the real battle will be getting Cheryl Tweedy on board.Although with her last single peaking at No, I think she might be willing to kiss and make up with Nads too. As the Pussycat Dolls have proven, there’s nothing like an enormous cheque to help smooth over bitter relations.After all, a high-profile pregnancy and cute baby being born at No always lts our collective spirits, right Similar sentiments were expressed when Tony Blair and David Cameron said  their wives were expecting while PM.  The pregnancies of Kate and Meghan were widely celebrated, too.But we are  gripped by a nasty culture war driven by social media.So after the happy announcement, Twitter once again became a hateful cesspit where apparently respectable professionals found despicable ways to slag off a young woman expecting her first baby, to a man she loves, and spout pathetic conspiracy theories.Ironically, many  were  the same crew who have been banging on for  weeks about the need to be kind to those in the public eye.But those rules instituted by the London liberal keyboard warriors only applyyou have the same political views as they do.If you are a Tory or a Brexiteer, or on the right or work for a popular newspaper, you are such an abhorrent human being in the eyes of the likes of Alastair Campbell and Jameela Jamil that you can be torn to shreds without a hint of irony from the perpetrators who are no better than abusive trolls.THE idea that over-weight people need reminding that they’re the  F-wordis nonsensical.If you have been obese and still battle the bulge every day, you’ll know that being the F-word is inside your head every minute.That’s why I embrace the idea put forward in the Pledge To Eradicate Weight Stigma, by Professor Francesco Rubino, from King’s College London, that describing people as fat, overweight and obese is just as debilitating as a racial slur in .Skinny folk convincing themselves that overweight people are McDonald’s-obsessed lazy slobs is offensive and wrong.And that type of outdated approach will do nothing to solve our obesity epidemic.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The level of uncertainty means it is unwise for it to attempt to settle the big questions on tax, spending and borrowing.One influential Tory source tells me that: “You can’t do spectacular, interesting stuff during corona. But you can do boring and dficult things.”The Budget will concentrate on delivering the Tories’ election promises. Inside the Treasury it has been dubbed the “Manesto Budget”.It will contain changes to ensure that more infrastructure projects are built outside London and the South East, there will be a “Union connectivity” project launched to better link up England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland — expect Boris’s bridge to get a mention — it will green-light a slew of road projects, provide money for fast broadband and increase funding for research.It will also curb the entrepreneurs’ tax relief that has turned from being an encouragement to take a risk on a new business to a general form of tax relief for wealthy investors.The Budget will also seek to emphasise that, despite the undoubted, short-term disruption the coronavirus will cause, the medium-term future for the economy is pretty rosy.Unlike with the  financial crash, the economy will rebound strongly once the virus has passed.There is, though, a big debate going on in government about how much the Government should do to help iniduals and businesses through the corona downturn.The rise in the number of people in the UK who are their own boss means there are more than four million workers not entitled to sick pay.The Government will, almost certainly, offer these people more time to pay their taxes. But what more it should do is the subject of growing debate in Whitehall.One of those involved in these discussions points out: “We can’t pay for the whole gig economy for the next six months.”A minister argues that people can get an advance from universal credit within two days in urgent cases. They fear thatthe Government starts paying the wages of the self-employed, then it will be hard to see where it should stop.They point out that a plumber who earns £, a week now, will almost certainly lose money as the virus spreads. Should the State make that up Coronavirus will change the way we live over the next few months, at the very least.But the challenge for the Government is to ensure that work on everything  doesn’t cease while the country tries to fight this crisis.It still has a job of work to do to get the country ready for le outside the EU and to prepare the economy for the great changes that technology is about to bring.BORIS JOHNSON is determined to defend Priti Patel, his Home Secretary, who is facing ious allegations of bullying from civil servants.Internally, he has given short shrt to those who have suggested he distance himself from her.There is a view in Downing Street that several of the most dramatic charges against her don’t stack up.They also claim that these concerns about Patel’s behaviour were not expressed as official complaints at the time.They, “didn’t reach up at a formal level”, I’m told.No knows, though, that it has a fight on its hands to save Patel.One source tells me: “Yes, she can survive. But there’s no smoke without fire. It is shaping up to be quite a big struggle.”Part of the issue is that there is a view among senior civil servants that, given that the top civil servant at the Home Office has quit because of this row, Patel should go too.But Downing Street know thatPatel goes, it would become harder to push reform through the system.One of those at the heart of government tells me: “You can’t have a situation where civil servants get to determine who their Secretary of State is.”The next hurdle for Patel to clear is Sir Alex Allan’s inquiry into whether her behaviour breached the ministerial code.There is a quiet confidence among her allies that while she will receive some criticism from his report, she won’t be found guilty of breaching the code.Buther former Permanent Secretary Sir Philip Rutnam really is determined to take his case to an employment tribunal, then the situation will become far more dficult for the Home Secretary.THERE’S a new political ide: Do you still shake hands or have you started bumping elbows to try to reduce your risk of contacting coronavirus Boris Johnson is still very much a hand-shaker, as is the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock.But some other Cabinet ministers have taken to either nodding politely or bumping elbows.As one of those close to the talks put it: “We’ve told them what we think. Their illusions are disappearing rapidly.”The question now is whether when the EU negotiators turn up in London in less than two weeks’ time, they come with a dferent approach or carry on pushing these ideas.THE local elections in May might have to be postponed because of coronavirus.If the UK’s response to the outbreak is still in the delay phase, continuing with the contests would go against that advice, as it would bring large numbers of people into contact with each other.I understand this option is being discussed in Whitehall, but no decision has been taken.But as one figure in government points out: “We postponed a General Election once because of an epidemic.”The  General Election was pushed back to June from May because of foot-and-mouth disease.Delaying the elections – which will see mayors elected in London, the West Midlands and Manchester among other races – would be a big step, and one the Government would only take with the utmost reluctance.The next few weeks will tell us whether it is necessary or not.- James Forsyth is political editor of The Spectator.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Neil Parish, Chair of the committee said: Whilst DEFRA clearly support the Committeeaposs views on this horrible practice, it needs to put its money where its mouth is. “If we really want puppies to be protected, there need to be sensible pet travel regulations, and authorities need to be given appropriate funding and powers to stop smugglers.

Leanne Fernandez, , whose son Harrison also lives with aspergeraposs syndrome, says he was beaten by a group of classmates at Colchester Academy every day for nearly three months.It meant he regularly came home in tears and unable to understand why he was being picked on, also led to him self-harming, Essex Live reports.Four of the incidents were so horric that they had to be reported to police, eventually leaving Leanne feeling it was no longer safe for her son to attend school. As a result, Harrison has not attended classes since November. The bullying - initially verbal - started within hour of Harrisonaposs first day at secondary school on September  last year, Leanne says. Obviously it all started off verbally with them saying he was gay, he walked gay, he looked gay, he talked gay, she explains. But on the second day, it escalated to physical. They tried apospeanut-ingapos the tie and it came off and they started pushing him and it continued out of school. He has had orange juice poured down the back of his neck, food taken away from him, had three of them pushing him at one time. Over the next following weeks, the violence escalated, leaving Harrison - who had started secondary school keen to make friends and learn - with a bruised and swollen face, ripped clothes and bloodied knees.  A group of boys regularly targeted her son on a daily basis, Leanne claims, including waiting to catch him in between classes and punch him in the groin. They would also make threats. One child threatened him when he saw him and said aposwe are looking for you and said aposwe are going to stamp on your skullapos. Thataposs not a normal thing for a -year-old to say, she continued. It is really upsetting for him. He had just started school and he is asking aposwhy they have they got a problem with me apos When you go in to school every single day and a number of them are going up to him between classes punching him in the groin. Itaposs awful.  Leanne first contacted police on September , telling them that on the third day of year seven Harrison had been physically hurt. She called officers again on September , and told them he was beaten by another child. They were called again for a third incident on September  when Leanne had picked him up from school. She was a little late and asked him to meet her in the car park, just outside the school. She said: I pulled up in the car park and I said come out of reception to the car and he said yes. While I was waiting for him, they beat him up. They had waited outside reception for him.  Iaposm sat thinking heaposs waiting in reception but actually heaposs getting beaten up. Leanne said the school had given Harrison early passes so he could leave class and school early. The aim, she said, was that he could try and avoid bullies travelling to other classes, or them catching him at the end of the day. He would also be sent to the sensory room or the library at break times or lunch times, in the hope to keep him away from the bullies. He was even being told to go there break and lunch times so they didnapost hurt him, she said. He had to go classes five minutes earlier than the others so that he could get there before them or they would punch him in the groin. He would come home and cry and say itaposs too much to handle. He just wants to go to school. Heaposs been beaten to a pulp. Harrison retaliated to the bullies and punched back after everything became too much. Harrison punched back once because he had had enough. But he never stuck up for himself again because he didnapost want to get in trouble and then it was worse because he was just getting pure beaten, Leanne said. But the final straw was on November , when she called police for a final time. He was going to the library or sensory room to eat his lunch and as he went down the stairwell and there were five of them waiting for him, she stated. One boy rushed up to him put him in a head lock so he was facing down and kept punching him. He then went crying and rushed to the toilet. They kept him in the toilet and he said a teacher was standing guard of it. They didnapost get the boys and take them to a room. Why didnapost they take him to the medical bay  Even though pupils arenapost allowed phones at school, Leanne had given Harrison one in case he got hurt again. She says that he texted her a picture from inside the toilet, with a picture of his face already swollen. He messaged her, aposMum theyaposve really hurt me, Iaposm scared.apos Leanne, who works as a child minder, says she had to pack up her and the kids as quickly as possible and contact their parents to tell them she was going to get her son. The effect everything has had on Harrison has been huge. Thereaposs been so many failings, itaposs ridiculous. I said no more, he couldnapost be there without harm, the mum claimed.He has a doctoraposs note to say itaposs detrimental effect to be in school. Because of his needs, like his  OCD , which is not flicking light switches itaposs his thoughts, he is a perfectionist and has severe anxiety so he takes it all out on himself.He self harms for not being perfect. He struggles with himself anyway, so with this he is coming home thinking heaposs in trouble, no one likes him and heaposs not good enough. He just wants some friends. Children with autism struggle with social things anyway and feel isolated so to not go to school and be at home with me alone all day is not good. He only gets two hours of learning. His mother has fought for him to attend another school - and Harrison is now due to start at the Phillip Morant School, also in Colchester, next week. Colchester Academy says that keeping its student safe is its highest priority. Principal Jenny Betts said: I cannot comment on inidual cases. However, keeping our students safe is our highest priority, which includes dealing swtly with any incidents of alleged bullying.  We follow clear behavioural procedures and use any appropriate sanctions we have available.

Rob Ayton, , a graphic designer, got his first mullet cut three years ago while on holiday in Australia and at first he wasn’t keen. He only had it cut for a joke, but over the years the style began to grown on him and he kept it long at the back - going past his shoulders. Now, on atrip to Australia, Rob, from Bideford, Devon, has won best international mullet at the annual Mulletfest, held in Kurri Kurri, New South Wales. Rob said: “I was coming out here for a skateboarding competition and it just happened to time with me being out here for that so I could go out to Kurri Kurri and see the mullet fest itself. “There was eight of us from all over the globe, it was good fun. A good laugh. “Three years ago I came over to Australia got a mullet haircut, chopped it up in irony really. “I’ve never been a fan of the mullet or the rats tail, but I have to say I do like the mullet now so my point of view has changed dramatically. “It genuinely feels like it’s been a religious ceremony for me, Australia - you’ve been amazing.” Rob said that his hair is currently down to his shoulder blades, and growing a good mullet takes: “Time and patience, and being able to handle a s**t ton of negative feedback.” Mulletfest is an annual event that honours the best mullet cuts in ious styles and categories, including everyday, grubby, vintage, and extreme, among others. Their website states: “All competition entrants are judged on their haircut, overall presentation and stage presence.”The winner of the illustrious ‘Best Mullet of them All’ category is crowned on the day. Rob added: “It was actually amazing, I was so stoked. There were  entries, eight of which actually turned up. “The standard was way higher than I had first envisioned. “I won the ‘international’ category, so I have the best ‘international’ mullet. “You couldn’t print a lot of the comments I get.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA coronavirus expert has said the fight against a global pandemic is like being aposat warapos with the virus. CEO of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations Dr Richard Hatchett said the virus had the potential to spread to % of the population worldwide. He said: I think the threat is very signicant. The potential of the virus is demonstrated in china and demonstrated in Italy and Iran. There were three cases in Italy two weeks ago - yesterday there were over ,. Speaking about how China has responded to the outbreak, he said: It is like they are at war with the virus - all of society is mobilised in the fight against the virus. On the UKaposs fight to halt the spread, he added: We have to recognise the virus is here and it has tremendous potential to be disruptive and to cause high rates of illness or even death - but that is not a future that is locked in. Contact tracing is very imp - voluntary quarantine of contacts and isolation of cases is very imp - there may be a time to close schools. We know that schools are amplication points in society - attack rates are much higher in children and the elderly. Children have been minimally affected by COVID- whats unclear is whether they have been infected and handled the infections well or maybe they are not being affected. Dr Hatchett suggested the virus may have been in the UK for weeks before it was detected. He added: If you look at places where death has occurred - England now falls into that category - a death signies circulation of the virus that has been going on for at least weeks.  It takes time for people to get sick, go to the hospital and expire - the virus has been circulating here for some time. I think the most concerning thing is the combination of infectiousness and the ability to cause disease and death. Not since , the Spanish flu - have we seen a virus combining these qualities in this way. What happens with this virus is up to us - I do think this has the potential to cause a global pandemic. To tackle the spread, Dr Hatchett said we need to work collectively as a society in our prevention and not think of our own, personal risk only. He added: We need to start thinking of the social risk- we need to all think about our responsibility to each other. We cant view the epidemic in terms of our person risk- we need to act collectively.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA couple from Cardf have described le in quarantine in South Korea in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak. Mira Amin, , and her partner Lloyd Price, , now wipe down everything that comes into their home with antibacterial wipes, use boiled water to do their washing up and only venture outside to go to grocery shopping. The pair have spent nearly two weeks confined to their flat in Changwon, where they moved in December to start a new le teaching English abroad. They had only been in the country a matter of weeks when the outbreak of the potentially deadly COVID- struck - forcing them to disinfect their home, sterilise their clothes, and go into self-quarantine. The number of coronavirus cases in South Korea exceeded , this week.  Speaking to Wales Online , Mia said: I first heard about the novel coronavirus during the middle of January.The Korean news began to report on the break out in Wuhan. Initially I was unsure of how to react. Korea is clearly very close to China but information about the effects of the virus were very mixed. Gradually children and staff at the school started wearing masks more frequently than usual then we were told to start wearing masks around mid-February. At this point the school put hand sanitiser at the entrance door and more and more concerned conversations about the virus could be heard around Changwon city.  In truth I downplayed the seriousness of the issue as I wanted to enjoy my le in a new country and also I felt sceptical of how western media reports on China as it is often prone to be sensationalist. I passed it off as something you just watch happening from a screen. Then it happened here, right on our street. Mira and Lloyd decided to work abroad on New Year’s Day in  and applied to teach in South Korea after a recommendation from a friend who lived there. They were later hired by a company who were seeking a couple to teach at its school. When they moved to Changwon in December, they were given an apartment and settled into le and work as English as a second languageteachers fairly quickly.  But within weeks le changed. A few weeks ago, Mira says she saw a quarantine container being delivered to a hospital located opposite their apartment. They noticed the evening was quieter than usual and due to them being limited with their understanding of the local language they didnapost really know what was going on. This was when we realised something was very wrong, she said. We were told to self-quarantine as the virus had reached our city. Our lestyle changed overnight – we were told to only drink bottled or boiled water.  With very little information about the virus we both disinfected our home immediately, sterilised our clothes, and set up a quarantine. By Friday Mira and Lloyd were on day  of self-quarantine. At first it was a shock to our system, she said. Essentially you are confined but at the same time you have the freedom to do what you want within four walls. As a wellbeing advocate I knew I had to keep my mind and body busy so I started a blog to turn my boredom into creativity and also to reach out to others in the same situation.I had no idea I would make virtual friends from this who I hope to meet when this thing blows over. I try to limit my time watching Netflix . I plan each day out – YouTube yoga sessions, blogging, call friends and family, and we’ve even started doing jigsaw puzzles.I’m a very outgoing person so some days I look outside and wonder when things are going to go back to normal. Of course I really want to get back out in the city exploring and discovering new things like we were but I know this will take time. Iaposm grateful to have my partner with me to annoy and talk to – hence why I created the term Quaranteam on my blog hoping to create an online community for others in the same boat. It’s a surreal situation. There are so many ex-pats and other ESL teachers here confined and living alone. Mira said peopleaposs lives have been impacted heavily as they are unable to work, children are missing out on their education, and people are longing for things to get back to normal. She said even though itaposs been surreal the experience has made the pair appreciate being out more and they are planning lots of exciting things when they can finally leave the apartment. Like many places around around the world South Korea is now covered with posters offering information about the virus and there is hand sanitiser in most places for the public. People wearing masks is also a common sight. Mira said: We are without a car here. Our school director kindly delivered us groceries to see us through the week when this first happened and another colleague recently delivered us masks as my partner couldn’t find any locally. Anything we receive is wiped down with an anti-bacterial wipe. In our home we have our own procedure happening that we quickly had to adapt to. When we have to make a quick trip to the local store to top up supplies and groceries we have to wear masks. We make the trip to the nearest store and we make it as quick as possible. We take antibacterial hand wipes to open doors and to make payments. We remove our shoes before entering the home. That is a common thing in Asia but now we actually disinfect the soles of our shoes. We then wipe down our clothes with antibacterial wipes and sanitise our hands before entering the living area. One of us stays by the door and disinfects grocery packaging whilst the other puts them in storage. When we wake up every morning we have a routine of filling a large bowl with boiled water from the kettle. We use this water for everything from washing vegetables to washing our mouths and faces. We top the bowl up throughout the day. When we wash our dishes and cutlery we sterilise them in boiled, hot water. Itaposs a nuisance but it has to be done. People are worried here. Mira explained the concern in the country was more for the elderly and children. Like many Asian cultures the elderly play a vital role in family dynamics and their protection is important. Mira said the government was doing everything in its power to get things back to normal and to help people and was on -hour alert. It has set up drive-through clinics and there are free tests and treatment for everyone regardless of residential status. The teacher said small business have been affected, education establishments have closed, and events have been cancelled but the people are very resilient. She said: The government makes a serious effort in keeping the public aware of all case details and preventative measures taking place. They are very open with their communication and there has been an absolute community effort to help each other stay safe here. Our teaching contract ends in December . Many ESL teachers have made the choice to leave but we couldn’t think of anything worse than being stuck at an airport right now – let alone travelling  hours in a plane.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailScientists around the world are working together in the race to find a coronavirus vaccine although it is feared it could take at least a year. Researchers at Imperial College London and Oxford and Cam­­bridge universities are among the experts toiling around the clock. Imperial have prototypes in early trials and will move to human trials as early as next month. The college’s Prof Robin Shattock said: “We have the technology to generate a vaccine with a speed that’s never been realised before. “Most vaccines take five years in the discovery phase and at least one to two years to manufacture and get into clinical trials. “We are trying to short-track that and we may not be the first – it requires only one group to get there.”  In America, Seattle biotech firm Moderna is recruiting  volunteers to test its experimental vaccine and in Pennsylvania Inovio is developing a DNA-based vac­­cine, producing , doses for trials next month. In India, Zydus Cadila aims to manipulate a measles virus to produce antibodies against corona while in China four teams are using immune-activating technology from a Florida firm. Denmark’s Expresion is using insect cells to tackle the problem while researchers in Queensland, Aus­­tralia, are using a “molecular clamp”.  PM Boris John­­son yesterday pled­ged a fur­­ther £mil­­lion for research to fight the virus. He announ­­­ced the fund­ing during a tour of the Mol­­ogic lab in Bed­­fordshire which is working on a quick and cheap way to diagnose patients. In a statement he said: “Keeping people safe is my number one priority and that’s why I’ve set out our four-part plan to contain, delay, mitigate and research coronavirus.  “We are ensuring the country is prepared for the current outbreak, guided by the science at every stage. But we also need to invest in researching the vaccines that could prevent future outbreaks. “I’m very proud that UK experts – backed by Government funding – are on the front line of global efforts to do just that.” Speaking to reporters, Mr Johnson added: “What we are announcing today is a £million package of investment which will in time deliver a vaccine – some say in about a year – but also help us to have rapid test kits that anyone can use quickly to tell whether they have coronavirus.”  The PM warned of a “substantial period of disruption”. Asked what help would be given to struggling firms, he said next week’s budget presented “a big opportunity”. Scientists have learned lessons from previous virus outbreaks – such as the  Sars crisis – and already had a game plan when the full gravity of corona emerged. Within days of the outbreak in China a genetic blueprint of the virus was put online using samples from early patients. It provided a road map for scientists around the world to create a vaccine.  This kind of research is usually highly competitive and secretive. In the past, medical journals would only publish research which was exclusive. But with this outbreak they have promised that sharing data online will not hinder later publication.  As a consequence dozens of teams around the world are collaborating in a way never before seen. For decades, the main way of creating a vaccine has been by using the original virus. The measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, for example, uses weakened versions of those bugs.  But work on coronavirus uses newer, faster approaches including lting small sections of the virus’s genetic code and putting them into other, harmless, infections. Oxford University is using a technique it was already working on to combat Mers. Other experts are pinning their hopes on repurposing drugs used to fight HIV and malaria which have already gone through safety checks.  Remdesivir, used against Ebola, is also being tested. Moderna’s Seattle project is being work­­ed on by  people. Boss Richard Hatchett said: “After our call for proposals in February we had  applications from all over the world. “There is a real urgency because the threat is unprecedented in  years.” Even so, creating a vaccine remains a y process due to the cost and labour, plus the need for testing. It took years to develop a vaccine for Ebola, which killed more than , in West Africa just over a decade ago. Experts believe a viable coronavirus vaccine is a year to  months away, which may sound a long time but would in fact be a new record.

Here in an exclusive extract from his new book, Long Way Home, he recalls some moments that helped shape him... I wouldn’t necessarily recommend the coping box as a strategy for others but it somehow saw me through the toughest of times. It was a Colour Sergeant who ­introduced us to the concept. He said: “The way I’ve always got myself through is by putting all my worries in a box – what I call a coping box. “When you’re in the heat of an ­operation, when your mates are being killed and maimed, you don’t have time to grieve, don’t have time to think too deeply about what’s happening. “You just have to get on with it. Better to store it all away in that box and deal with it later. “When you get back, maybe then you can open it up and deal with it.” I first used it in the war in Kosovo. We were dropped by helicopter into an area that had been occupied by Serbian forces. There was something about the place that immediately struck me as not being right. I just got a sense that we had arrived at somewhere that had witnessed horrors. As we neared the village we saw a young woman walking towards us. There was a terrible sadness in her dark eyes and a haunted expression on her face. I couldn’t tellshe was afraid of us or of who had been there before. Or both. As I was considering whether to call to her, there was a message from the lead section that they had found something. I watched the woman disappear like a ghost into the trees. Called forward to ­examine the find, I ­discovered it was a pit about the size of a single-decker bus on its side. It had been covered with a mound of earth. It looked like it might be a mass grave. I walked cautiously up to it, wonderingit might be booby-trapped, and knelt beside it. Something smelt very bad. Then something caught my eye – protruding out of the mound a couple of metres on from where I was. I could feel my heart pumping. I looked more closely. There could be no mistake – it was a human hand sticking out of the dirt. I edged closer, my eyes fixed upon it.  On the wrist of the hand was a watch. It was still ticking. I wondered about the woman I passed earlier. What horrors might she have witnessed or suffered  I tried not to think about the watch, or the hand, or what was attached to it, and what  was hidden in the mound. I tried to put out of my mind the very distinctive stench of death and the haunted young woman’s face. Into the coping box it all went and I got on with what we were doing. After the war, le carried on and deployments around the world followed. Then, in , I met Caroline. I fell in love very quickly and it wasn’t long before I asked her to marry me. Over the next few years we had a son and daughter and while le in the Army with two small kids was rarely quiet, we were happy and hope­ful. But in April  the unimaginable happened: Caroline was diagnosed with bowel cancer. Although we had come to understand there was some minor problem, the thought it might be cancer just hadn’t crossed our minds. And now, from nowhere, completely unexpectedly, the C-word was being used. Caroline was very upset but quickly regained her composure. I had decided to be as ruthlessly positive as I could possibly be. I didn’t want to unmask the terrible fear I felt be­­­cause I knew I had to be strong for her.  We agreed both to stay as positive as possible. I tried to cope by being useful and keeping busy. But I was angry. Angry that Caroline, of all people, was having to go through this ordeal. I was desperately frustrated that there wasn’t anything I could really do to make it go away. There was an all-consuming feeling of powerlessness and it proved very dficult to manage. For once I didn’t feel I could just put it in my coping box. Surgeons thought an operation had got all the cancer but in  it ­­re­­­­- turned. Chemotherapy was prescribed and Caroline began a punishing routine which continued until early . Her health continued to deteriorate. I never ever gave up but there came a moment when I had to acknowledge where this was leading. I had to start accepting that the cancer was probably going to win. That it would take her from me. That I would lose her. That I would be left on my own with the kids. I had always looked around the cor­­­ner to think about what was coming next and to try and get ready for it. But, for the first time, I couldn’t bear to look round that next corner, nor was I able to shove it in my coping box. Maybe the box was full or maybe this didn’t belong in the box. I don’t know which – I just knew I couldn’t discard the worry in the way I always had. I steeled myself. The final few weeks were awful. I was caring for Caroline at home with support from a nurse who came in every day.  We strove to maintain the normal routine with me getting the kids ready for school and then bringing Caroline downstairs, where I would make her as comfortable as possible. On a beautully fresh summer’s morning at the end of June we made it out into the garden and sat in deckchairs with a coffee. Caroline had her sunglasses on and, despite everything she had endured, was still beautul, graceful and delightful company. We enjoyed the sunshine and each other’s company and I took the opportunity to tell her how much I loved her. Caroline noticed a stirring in the little rose bed by the side of the house. It was a mole. Gradually it worked its way to the surface and popped its sleepy head out. It paused, asto enjoy the lovely sunshine, before deciding that it was perhaps better off underground. ­ Caroline recounted the tale to the children when they ed from school and was as excited to tell them about it as they were to hear it. It was the last time I saw her smile. In the weeks that followed she declined with terrying speed.  On a Friday morning in July Caroline became very short of breath. An ambulance came and took her away. I sat by her hospital bedside for several hours. All day I could see and feel Caroline sliding away. I sat holding her hand all night and for most of the following day. That afternoon I could feel her going and at .pm she died. I had no idea what to do. I sat with her for a while. Despite all the time I had spent thinking about it, trying to prepare myself for this moment, I wasn’t ready. Eventually, I thanked the staff for their care and walked slowly out. I was holding a small plastic bag containing Caroline’s belongings – her dressing gown and a washbag I’d made up with a few toiletries. I’d arrived at the hospital with my we. I was leaving with a plastic bag. I drove back to our house, opened the front door and walked in.

Locals complain that the road, built  years ago, is now full of vehicle parts, industrial waste and domestic trash. Brian Miles said: “It’s horrendous. There is thousands upon thousands of tonnes of waste and it just grows. Nothing ever gets taken away. “Everything you can imagine is down there… remnants of a beauty salon, advertising hoardings, domestic waste, building waste and tyres.” The only thing he has seen the road used for, apart from dumping trash, was to film sequences for BBC’s Doctor Who. The road off the A in Coedkernew, South Wales, was built during the development of the Imperial Park estate when electronics firm LG set up its factory in Newport with a promise of more than , jobs. The plant has since closed. Mr Miles, chairman of Wentlooge Community Council, says he has repeatedly raised the dumping with authorities but it is unclear who is ultimately responsible for the land. He added: “There’s rats everywhere. People are up in arms about it.” Newport city council is listed as sole owner of the land at HM Land Registry. The council declined to confirm this.

It is not the le this bright -year-old envisaged, or chose, for herself. Bodhi wasn’t planned and, although Hannah is still in a relationship with his father she does not live with him and he can only offer piecemeal financial support as he volunteers at a not-for-profit art gallery and does not claim benefits. Hannah, who lives in Middlesbrough, used to work full-time at a bank but says because of childcare costs she cannotto work until Bodhi is three, and eligible for a free nursery place. Hannah’s benefits do not cover her outgoings and she only scrapes by thanks to family and friends. Hannah spoke to the Mirror as we launch our Give Me Five campaign . We are calling on Boris Johnson to increase child benefit by £ a week to end the scourge of child poverty. Are you a parent struggling with poverty  Email webnews@mirror Figures from the End Child Poverty coalition show around % of children are growing up poor in the North East. In Middlesbrough alone there are an estimated ,. We spent Tuesday, March , with Hannah and Bodhi... .am Cuddled up to his mummy, Bodhi’s sleep-encrusted eyes flicker open to the familiar sight of a bare bedroom wall speckled with a grey shadow of mould. The wall is bare because Hannah fears drilling into the damp plaster to hang cheerful pictures or put up shelves. Bodhi’s streaming nose is cold. Outside, it is around C and in here little more. He has woken early because he is poorly with a cold which has lingered for two weeks. The waiting list for social housing is so long, Hannah rents her home from a private landlord, the cost covered partly by housing benefit. The property is not in good repair. Plastic bags are stuffed in holes for “insulation”, the radiator in the bedroom only heats halfway, a saucepan sits on the landing to catch drips from the attic. Setting her heating to come on before she and Bodhi wake up is unthinkable. Read more about our Give Me Five campaign  Hannah says: “People even set the thermostat to come on during the night. Can you imagine ” Her solution is to bring Bodhi into bed with her. She can, at least, provide body heat for her little boy. Today, there is another problem. They must try to do without heating because Hannah has just p in her account and her gas meter, which is perched on the top of her fridge, reads just £.. That will only buy a couple of hours at most and in this drafty Victorian semi it takes at least an hour for the heating to be felt. To sign our petition calling on Boris Johnson to increase child benefit click here Her weekly child tax credits of £ will not land until half-past midnight, so she must save her precious gas until the evening, when the darkness makes the house even colder. Hannah tries to keep Bodhi snuggling beneath the covers but he is restless, so she wraps him in a fluffy dressing gown with a bear face on the hood and braves downstairs. Sadly, her own dressing gown is stained and can’t be washed because her machine has packed up. am  Bodhi clambers on a cushion that reads Dream Big Little One. He has had a sweet waffle for breakfast – Hannah can buy a five-pack for just p so they have become a staple. Hannah hasn’t eaten. “I’m used to not eating during the day,” she says. She has even gone two days without. It helps the food stretch. Bodhi gurgles happily, making joyful sounds, but he doesn’t talk. Hannah blames herself. “I haven’t been able to socialise him enough.” She can’t afford playgroups very often and says: “The cheapest group is £ but some days that’s the dference between a loaf of bread or not.” There’s another reason she finds herself avoiding them, too. Embarrassment. She can’t afford a coffee with the other mums, hasn’t bought new clothes since Bodhi was born and only owns one pair of shoes. She admits she has been a week without using deodorant. Now she has started to feel anxiety rise when she’s outside the home. Her faded canvas bag reads Yummy Mummy but she feels far from it. .am Hannah is crying. Her local councillor, who has also become a friend because of the volunteering Hannah does, has called round with an envelope. Inside is £, collected by a group of mums so that Hannah can buy a second-hand washing machine. A wave of relief and gratitude trumps embarrassment. Hannah is hardened to asking for help. Frantic WhatsApp messages to her mum asking for £ top-ups to her account, accepting her sister’s offer to pay for Bodhi’s birthday party. But this time, she didn’t ask. Hannah says: “I only survive because of my friends and my family. Because I have them, I’ll never regard myself as poor.” pm Spring sunshine dapples the lounge’s uneven carpet tiles but Bodhi and Hannah remain inside. Bodhi is mesmerised by cartoons. They spend a lot of time indoors, TV on. There aren’t many free options for going out, especially in winter.  And with no car, and buses costing £., Hannah can’t go far. She says: “Some days he doesn’t go out the front door, I feel sad and guilty.” Today though, there is another reason to stay in. Hannah is waiting for the landlord. She has been asking for repairs since she moved in and is desperate for the bedroom radiator to be fixed, and a radiator to be fitted in the bathroom. She says: “When I bath Bodhi it gets so cold I have to keep the shower running, for steam.” But what she loathes most is the “garden”. A pipe which carries waste water from the toilet and household appliances is leaking in one corner. A film of white scum covers the mud. There is no way Bodhi can play here. The Home Sweet Home sign on the lounge wall rings hollow. .pm Bodhi flashes a cheeky grin as he clambers on top of a gravestone. We are in a nearby cemetery. Hannah comes here most days. This is Bodhi’s garden. Hannah explains that the nearest park,  minutes away, is frequented by drug-users. The cemetery is beautul but there isn’t another child in sight. Bodhi is having a ball but a two-year-old should not have to make a graveyard his playground. .pm Bodhi is having omelette for tea, again. Hannah contemplates spending some of the washing machine money on something dferent but she stops herself. She has a couple of eggs, a tin of tuna, and cheese – “a luxury”.  pm Every corner of the house is icy cold. Hannah stares bleakly at bread, cheese, days-old lettuce and grapes – the only fresh ingredients she has. She snaps. She takes a note from the washing machine fund and pops to the shop to top up her gas by a couple more quid. She finds it “mortying” doing this in person and usually uses a phone app to save face.

The couple put on a confident display as they arrived in pouring rain at the annual Endeavour Fund Awards at London’s Mansion House, smiling broadly as they stepped out of their official car. Amid the cheers there was one loud boo from an onlooker, however it did not spoil the mood, with Meghan telling the audience at the awards that it was aposnice to be backapos. They were there to honour the achievements of wounded, injured and sick servicemen and women who have taken part in remarkable sporting and adventure challenges over the last year. But all eyes were on Meghan, , who has not been seen in this country since she and Harry made the dramatic announcement that they were quitting public le in early January, much to the distress of the Queen. She upped the glamour stakes in heavy make up and a form fitting turquoise dress by British designer Victoria Beckham, with blue suede heels and gold earring. Her hair was tied back in a pony tail.Harry, who has been made to give up his official patronages after deciding to move to Canada, is being allowed to retain his private links with organisations such as The Endeavour Fund, of which he is patron.The charity supports service personnel keen to use challenges to help with their physical, psychological and social recovery and rehabilitation. Speaking at the event, Harry said: Some of you tonight have told me you have my back, well Iaposm also here to tell you Iaposve always got yours.  Meghan told the audience: Itaposs very nice to be back. Itaposs the third year Iaposve had the incredible fortune of joining my husband here. Itaposs just the most inspiring space. When we were watching the videosall the way in Canada we had the same moment of aposhow are you going to choose apos  Well, weaposve done our best. She presented the aposcelebrating excellenceapos award to Lee Spencer, a rower who serves with the Royal Marines for  years and lost his leg helping with a traffic accident. The annual awards, now in their fourth year, brings together hundreds of wounded, injured and sick serving personnel and veterans as well as their families, friends and supporters of the military community. At a reception with backers, nominees and their families, Harry and Meghan chatted to Lee Spenceraposs we Claire Spencer. The -year-old complimented Meghan on how amazing she looked given that she had just had a baby.  She said afterward: She said ‘oh yes, well he is ten months now and is into everythingapos. Asked what she thought of Harry’s decision to step back as a working royal, she said: I think he does an amazing job, as does she, and we should just let them live the le they want to live. I know what a dference Endeavour has made to my husband’s le since he lost a leg and I hold Harry personally responsible for that. Le is too short. The awards ceremony was hosted by former Invictus Games medallist JJ Chalmers and will see four prizes awarded on the night: Recognising Achievement Award, Celebrating Excellence Award, Henry Worsley Award and The Community Impact Award, a new award for this year. Meghan presented the Celebrating Excellence Award and Harry the Henry Worsley Award, to the inidual who has best inspired others through the demonstration of determination in the face of adversity. It is named in honour of career soldier and adventurer Henry Worsley, who tragically lost his le in January  whilst attempting to cross the Antarctic landmass, solo and unsupported, in order to raise money for the Endeavour Fund. Before the ceremony the couple attended a reception where they met the inspiring nominees, as well as endeavour participants and key supporters of the Endeavour Fund.

A landmark study published by the University of Michigan found that colds cost the US economy about  billion annually. This is due to the costs associated with visits to the doctor and lost productivity. The same  study also found that colds account for nearly  million missed school days. However, finding a cure is dficult for a number of reasons. There are  dferent strains of rhinovirus - a type of virus which accounts for about  per cent of colds - which makes it hard to find an effective treatment which would cover them all. Rhinoviruses are also highly prone to mutation. This means that evena treatment were effective to begin with, its shelf le could be limited by the virus developing resistance. And finally, it is believed that evena drug that works were found, unless it has zero side effects, it wonapost be profitable. Experts say that as most people will recover fully from a cold within a week or two, they are unlikely to use a drug which comes with side effects which could potentially be more unpleasant. aposProject Gesundheitapos is believed to sit under Amazonaposs elusive research and development group known as Grand Challenge.

Picking up on the left of the penalty area, he squared up Paul Watson but could only swerve his effort wide four minutes before the interval.Just a minute later, United looked in as Shankland stood up a ball for McMullan to attack in the six-yard box but Daniel Harvie was able to get back in and clear off the line with Doohan stranded.Harkes was at the centre of what United did well in the opening moments of the second period, forcing a corner with his deep cross and making a late run into the box in an attempt to race onto Bingham#s through ball.On  minutes, Dillon Powers, useful at set-plays all night, found Mark Connolly at the back post with a deep free-kick but the Irishman#s header across the box had no takers.Just after the hour-mark, Kelly fired a dipping free-kick over the bar for the hosts # their first chance of the half.On  minutes, Sam Roscoe acrobatically hooked a half volley over the bar as Ayr grew into proceedings once more.Harkes was again clear for United as the goal opened up for him moments later. Played in by McMullan on the left of the box, the American could only slash wide with just Doohan to beat.Entering the final quarter of the game, United were still struggling to break down a rigid Ayr defence.Haring through surrounded by a glut of white shirts, Shankland perhaps should have slipped in a freer Peter Pawlett, only just off the bench, but elected to go it alone and was crowded out.Boss Robbie Neilson erred on the side off caution by replacing McMullan with Robson on  minutes after the winger went down with cramp.Drinan smashed an effort wide for the home side two minutes later, before Jordan Houston tested Siegrist with a header.Drinan again powered a drive just over the United crossbar with nine minutes remaining before Harvie fizzed an effort wide.In the final minute, Drinan could only drag a shot across the ground and straight into the grateful arms of Siegrist as third-placed Ayr went for the kill.The Tangerines, too, pushed for a late winner late on but it never came as they enter the final round of fixtures still out in front.Ayr United XI : DoohanHouston, Bell , Roscoe, Harvie Kerr , Muirhead McCowan , Kelly, ForrestDrinan.Subs not used: Hare-Reid , Smith, Gillespie and Murphy.Dundee United XI : SiegristSmith, Watson, Connolly, ReynoldsMcMullan , Powers, Harkes, Appere Bingham , Shankland.Subs not used: Deniz , Sporle, Glass, Freeman and Neilson.Referee: David Munro.Att: , ."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/Person-wearing-Medical-Face-Mask-to-protect-against-Coronavirus-Covid-19_34708990-907x564.jpg ","title":"dundees most vulnerable residents worried by coronavirus spread","story":"The most vulnerable of Dundee#s population have been left worried by infection as coronavirus spreads across the country.Members of the city#s homeless community have expressed concerns that they may be unable to keep clean or self-isolate following the confirmation of three cases of the virus in Scotland.The disease, which has infected more than , people and claimed more than , lives, struck Scotland on Sunday after a case was confirmed in Tayside.Clayre Stewart, a homeless woman who sleeps rough in Dundee, is worried that the virus will be able to spread to her easily.She said: #It didn#t worry me until I saw people out wearing masks yesterday afternoon.#People like me have got nowhere that we can feel safe. I don#t have an environment to go to where I know it#s clean.#Nobody seems to be thinking about us beggars.

He was ill at Queen of the South and, maybe stupidly, I played him when he wasn’t right.“But he’s now almost recovered and we’ll have him back for Saturday.”Dundee may have drawn a blank against the Wasps, but McPake was as delighted with his side’s performance as he was annoyed by the result.The Dark Blues fired  shots at the Alloa goal to no avail.Yet McPake took heart from the creative nature of his side’s showing ahead of a potentially pivotal double-header with play-off rivals Ayr.“We’ll take the positives for Saturday, we’re going down to Ayr then they’re coming here,” said McPake. vw, px\"  “It’s two massive games for our football club and,we perform like that, then we’ll give ourselves a right good chance.“At the minute, it’s sore but, though it was only one point, it’s another clean sheet. That’s one positive.“Another is, you could pick probably four or five games from earlier in the season and add our chances up – and we created more chances last night.“And the fans – for me that’s a positive because people keep saying they get on the players’ backs.“That’s rightly so because we haven’t been creating chances and giving them something to cheer, but you certainly heard them last night.“They were egging us on and really pushing.“I turned round during the game and said, ‘The atmosphere’s back’, and we need that.“It’s not a cry for help, but we need to keep producing performances like that to keep the atmosphere up, to keep the fans onside.“To keep them helping us we need performances like last night – with the goals added.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/03/5e62125da4da53.74996896.jpg ","title":"massive ayr clashes wont overawe christie elliott","story":"Christie Elliott hasn’t lost in a Dundee shirt.Andthe Dark Blues keep playing the way they have been, he doesn’t see why that should change.Former Partick Thistle man Elliott’s arrival at Dens has coincided with a four-game unbeaten run.The timing could hardly be better ahead of back-to-back clashes with play-off rivals Ayr United.For Elliott, it has been a dream start.But there has been one shock to deal with – the fact that the Dee haven’t already secured a top-four place.“Four games without losing is a good way to start with a new club – especially one as massive as Dundee,” said Elliott.“From this point, it’s all about consistency. We’ve not been beaten in the last few games but it’s important to turn the draws into wins.“We created a number of chances against Alloa on Tuesday night. We just need to put those away going forward.“Alloa was a crazy game. When you look back at how many chances we created – good chances too. In a normal game they go in and it’s -.“It’s one of those things. We’ve taken a lot of positives from it and we’ll take them into the Ayr game.“I’m surprised, from the way I’ve seen us play, that we’re not further up the league.“The squad is a really good one. I thought: ‘It’s going to be really hard to get in the team in the first place,’ but, luckily enough, I was there within a game.“It’s important as a team that we stick together now and try to get as many points on the board as we can between now and the end of the season.”The consistency of James McPake’s recent team selections has translated into improved – and further improving – performances.The -- system employed by the Dee boss since the - draw away to Greenock Morton in early February seems to suit his players.For Elliott, that tactical comfort is a huge positive.“Everyone on the pitch knows their role,” he said.“Defensively, everybody knows what they need to be doing. We defend as a team. But we’ve also created a number of chances in each and every game I’ve played.“It’s important now that we keep going and keep building on the positives we’re taking from each game.“If you get a few wins together you never know how far you can push your way up.”A pair of wins in the next four days against Ayr would be a big ask but it would do the Dee cause the world of good.They would probably settle for four points.But you won’t catch anyone at Dens admitting it.“These games are massive,” said Elliott.“You look at other teams within the league, below you, and they still have an opportunity to finish in the play-offs, so it’s vital we keep picking up wins. But there’s confidence in the dressing-room. In all the games I’ve played, we’ve created loads of chances.“It’s important we keep doing that, keep doing the other things we’re good at, and get three points on the board whenever we can.”Come the end of the campaign, Dundee will have the option to extend Elliott’s stay at Dens.Whatever happens between now and the end of the season, that’s something the -year-old hopes they take up.“I just want to play games and do well for the club. If they like me, the ball’s in their court,” he said.“But as I said, I’ve enjoyed my time since I’ve been here. Everyone in and around the club is great and I would love to stay herethe club want me.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/DNic_Taw_Teams_Podcast-7-846x564.jpg ","title":"podcast twa teams one street dundee finding form as united stutter on title march","story":"This week Tele sports reporters Calum Woodger, Sean Hamilton and Graeme Finnan dissect Dundee’s recent upturn in fortunes, discuss what United need to do to get their title march back on course and Billy Gilmour – is he good enough to be capped Call the #Twa Teams, One Street# fan line on   to leave a message for the boys about anything Dundee, United or from the wider world of football.For iTunes: click hereFor Spoty: click hereOr search #Tele Twa Teams, One Street# in the podcast app of your choice."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/03/5e621255e805a3.39290847-scaled.jpg ","title":"reynolds fresh united need not worry about ict in title approach","story":"Captain Mark Reynolds believes a re-invigorated Dundee United side should have no concerns about Inverness as they aim to sew up the Championship title.Reynolds insists United are not worrying about an ICT side who have closed the gap at the top to  points and have two games in hand as they enter the final round of fixtures against Partick Thistle at Tannadice tomorrow.What was otherwise a good point as the Terrors played out a goalless draw at Ayr United on Tuesday night was soured slightly by the Caley Jags’ late - win over Morton.However, defender Reynolds feels, with no more midweek games between now and the end of the season, the Tangerines have an advantage over their opponents with more hectic schedules.Askedhe was disappointed to discover Inverness had won, the -year-old said: “Not really. It is what it is with them, they’re going to pick up results.“We’re not at the stage where we’re worrying about Inverness yet. We just need to focus on our own business.“We need to find those performances and results again.“Every game is going to be tough and Inverness are going to push it all the way.“They need to keep winning and hope we keep slipping up, but there’s nine games to go and we just need to look after our own business.“We’re still only a few wins away from it so we just keep taking it one game at a time as our focus turns to Partick tomorrow.“This league is tough. It’s dficult just now but the run we were on was unbelievable.“To go those  games unbeaten was incredible and that’s what got us that cushion.“Everybody is capable of beating each other and it’s never an easy night.“We went down to Ayr and they’re a good side, pushing for second place. They’re having a good season, have good players and are playing some nice football.“We knew it was going to be tough with Inverness winning but they’ll need to keep plugging away.” vw, px\"  Of their own dip in form since the turn of the year, Reynolds added: “It is frustrating but it’s a long season with injuries, change of personnel and teams are fighting for their lives.“Every team knows they need to get something and they want to slow us down. It’s a cup final when teams play us. Inverness felt that when they played us the other week and it was the same for Ayr.“It’ll be a tough run-in with people taking points off each other but we just need to keep plugging away and re-focus.“Luckily, our schedule goes from weekend to weekend from now on so we can hit every game fresh, with teams coming in with strained squads playing Saturday-Tuesday.”Reynolds admits United are eager to get back on home soil after some tough games on the road.“Tannadice has been a good place for us and we’re looking forward to getting back on a nice pitch.“The pitch down at Ayr held up well considering the amount of rain we’ve had but it’s nice to get back home.“We need to keep going and pushing to make sure we get three points. I think there’s pressure on every game, home and away, when you play for Dundee United.“We’re coming into every game as the league leaders and it’s been like that all season, but we’ve managed to handle it so far.“We go into every game confident we can win but we know that’s not going to happen. If you’re not on it, it can be tough.

The previous season Main had run riot in scoring twice for Well to beat Aberdeen - in the Scottish Cup semi-final at Hampden in April .Main suffered a frustrating start to his Pittodrie career, due partly to the form of -goal striker Cosgrove.Now Lewis reckons he has rediscovered the form that terrorised the Dons at the national stadium.The keeper said: “We have a bit more to our attacking game at the moment.“It’s the player I remember playing against us when he was at Motherwell.“I didn’t look forward to facing him then and I know the centre-halves didn’t either.“He really does give the opposition a real handful.”January signing Matty Kennedy, secured for £, from St Johnstone until summer , will also be pivotal tomorrow.Kennedy supplied the cross that led to Connor McLennan’s equaliser against Kilmarnock on Wednesday.Lewis said: “Matty has been dferent class since he’s come into the club.“His attitude off the pitch is the same as it is on the pitch. It’s positive.“He’s a likeable lad and has been really good for us.”For the second time in less than a month Aberdeen fought back from behind at Rugby Park to salvage a result. Last month they hit two late goals in the final minute of extra-time to defeat Kilmarnock - in the Scottish Cup fth-round replay.Lewis said: “We were disappointed with the goals we lost, but again we showed character to come back from it.“We saw it before at Rugby Park and I thought we’d kick on and win the game at -. But both teams had chances.“We couldn’t find that final piece. We went there to win the game, but being two goals down, we cannot be too disappointed.”There was understandable frustration within the Aberdeen camp at the opening goal at Kilmarnock.Referee Alan Newlands awarded a penalty for hand-ball by Ash Taylor.However, the centre-back turned his back to the shot with his arms tight by his body. The ball struck his back.Lewis said: “It was two poor goals lost, although I think Ash had his arms by his side at the penalty.“I watched it again and he’s turned with his arm in. It wasn’t up in the air. It hit his arm, but I don’t know where  he could put it and that was harsh on him.”Although beaten twice at Rugby Park the -year-old keeper made a number of vital saves.He produced a superb one-handed ing stop to tip a Stephen O’Donnell volley over the bar.Lewis said: “I was pleased with the save from Stephen O’Donnell.“I was pleased to make some saves and play a part in winning a point.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column january 10 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCouncillors wil be put in an unenviable position when they finally decidewhere the axe will fall on council services.But exactly how much Argyll and Bute will have to spend will not be known until the daffodils are beginning to pop through the ground.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

This is a stunning route and the views over the Sound of Jura to the islands of Islay and Gigha are a rich reward for screaming muscles on the testing climbs.This will be the third year this increasingly popular event will take to the road. As it is a sportive, the Kilberry Loop is a non-competitive event and at just short of  miles long is perfect for a first-time competitor. Of course, for more competitive cyclists who want to push themselves or who are in training, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is a great event to get a personal best.The quicker cyclists in  managed the course # which has almost  metres of climbing # in under two hours, which is quick, and there are others who complete the course inside a comfortable four hours, so there is room for all abilities.Around  cyclists of all ages took part last year, with a couple of gentlemen in their early s and those in their twenties joining in # and organisers hope this year#s sportive will attract even more athletes.To make the event even more attractive Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club hopes to include race timing for the first time. And, for the third year, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is supported by British Cycling, the nation’s largest cycling organisation and national governing body for cyclesport, which actively helps and encourages people to get into cycling.If you’d like to sign up for this year’s Kilberry Loop Sportive or want more information visit the Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club website."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part four","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs crew for our cruise we were lucky, as we have been for the four previous years, and were able to get both the Doctor and Pilot to come again. The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ormsary man in oman endurance event","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAn Ormsary man is about to embark on the challenge of a letime as he cycles over ,km in a bid to be crowned BikingMan Oman .Lindsay McCrae, , will be one of only  cyclists to take part in BikingMan Oman, part of a series of ultra-endurance cycling events where competitors test their limits of strength and stamina.In , Lindsay bought a road bike through his employer#s cycle to work scheme and what started out as an active commute with a few local races thrown in for fun, soon became an opportunity to challenge himself in some of the toughest races on two wheels.His first big win came in the gruelling City to Summit duathlon from Edinburgh to Ben Nevis. The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

The glass came well back. At a quarter to eight we heard a poor weather forecast with gales and rain for practically every area including north-easters for both Malin and Hebrides. In the news that followed we heard that Moyanawas in trouble on her way home and was asking for help as she would have to be abandoned.As there was no hurry about moving as we meant to wait for the flood and there was obviously little enjoyment to be had on deck we turned over and went to sleep again. We hoped to make Tobermory in the late afternoon having the flood with us all the way andthings got no worse.At half past nine we began to turn out. A cold strong north-westerly was blowing but it was dry. Seewolf had sailed for Oban but Lindisfarne was still with us with Guy still shoutingand singing with undiminished enthusiasm. The Saguenay was not happy – a man was crouching in her cockpit with the lead line in his hand keeping watch for the first sign of dragging.We had a breakfast of grapefruitand bacon and eggs. One of the eggs when broken into a cup was so rotten it nearly blew the Pilot out of the forecastle.After our meal we had a big clean up above and below and the Tar pumped the ship then, with the wind falling light, the rain started again and blankets etc. up on deck to air had to come down in a hurry, but the glass was beginning to show signs of being somewhere near the bottom for the time being.The Tanky and Tar took shelter in the dog-house with the Major and talked of this and that while the rest of us occupied ourselves below. The Bosun and Pilot finished putting the tacklines in the flags, the former got a book while the latter started sketching. The Skipper had a patent lighter that could be used in any weather no matter how blowy or how wet, but which, when working emitted a series of sparks and this was the subject of one of the sketches. The Mate fitted up a tumbler holder in the ladies cabin then did some knitting, the Skipper, after cutting the tacklines to the requiredhad a snooze.At two o’clock by which time it was calm and raining less heavily, the Tanky and Mate started getting our dinner of lamb salad, greengages and custard, coffee and Yo-Yo biscuits, ready and the Pilot and Skipper tried mixing gin and Dubonnet but decided that to do so merely spoilt good gin. The Tanky, however, seemed to enjoy Dubonnet by itself and she was given the freedom of the bottle. About this time the man in the Saguenay got tired of holding his lead line and he shted billet to inshore from us.When we started lunch it was almost a flat calm, but coming on deck after it ready to go onto Tobermory, we found the wind had risen considerably and had veered a point. We got our anchor at four o’clock and under engine went out into the Sound of Mull and, turning west, began to get up our sails as we passed the Morven Pier.In view of the forecast and of what we could see ahead of us we decided to tie down two reefs. We got the tack and clew lashed down and had started on the reef points when we began to doubt the wisdom of proceeding. The wind was fresh and getting stronger every minute and the sea was increasing similarly – to go on would mean getting a proper hammering and the prospect of a north-east gale would mean our intended anchorage in Tobermory would probably be most uncomfortable .The decision of whether to turn back or not was left to the Skipper for as usual, on these occasions, the Pilot steadfastly refused to offer any opinion, but he did agree that the Skipper was right when he decided on the former course. Round we came, the jib was broken out, and we scampered back to Loch Aline. At the narrows the jib was furled and under engine only we ran up to Kinlochaline and let go off the boat-house at ten past five. The Mate, Tanky, and Tar, down below and unaware of our change of plan were quite bewildered when they heard the chain run out and the first named came on deck to find out where we had got to.The Saguenay had preceded us to this anchorage and the Lindisfarne came up a little later and Guy said that Kyle Bay, in the rapidly rising gale, was getting almost untenable. In Kinlochaline we were very comfortable though, even here there was quite a lop on the water and we were sheering about a good deal in the squalls. It was raining very heavily but the Bosun took the Major ashore, but still without any concrete results.At six we had a cup of tea with cake and biscuits and by the time this was finished it was blowing a full gale. The weather forecast was bad and our only consolation was that it was ever so much worse for the South.In the Channel the barometer had reached a record low level for July and force  and  winds were commonly reported all over England and Wales. With us the glass had turned and was . up since mid-day. Then with the exceptions of the Bosun who was in the dog-house and the Tar who played patience we spent the next hour or so dosing in the cabin.At half past eight we had a supper of scrambled eggs and meat roll for those that wanted it, then we put up the tents and down the angel and veered a further five fathoms of chain, making it twenty out in three fathoms of water.We could see out in the Sound of Mull that a huge sea was running and down by the narrows the top of the water was being swept off in spindrt. The squalls where we were were very fierce but, there being no sea, we were lying quite comfortably and never once put a pull on the anchor though we did suffer rather badly from bobstayitis.Two motor boats came up for shelter. One, Ormidale, anchored off the west shore opposite us, but the otherlet go out in the middle of the loch and kept steaming to her anchor for as long as we could see her.It was a wild night and at eleven o’clock to cheer himself up the Bosun made coffee for himself and the Pilot and half a cupful for the Tanky. While they were having it the rest of us started to turn in.That gale was news and in our sheltered corner we had no idea how bad it was. Even in Crinan warps were carried away and yachts set adrt in the basin. All round the coast were reports of vessels in distress one, a steamer in the Channel, being rolled right over.Next week:"},{"url":null,"title":"pedal power at macpool","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsIt was with trepidation I arrived at Mid Argyll Community Poolahead of the aqua bike try-out session [writes Rachel Carruthers].Exercise classes and I don#t often seem like a natural fit but I was excited to give the new craze a go.Aqua cycling uses stationary bikes immersed in a swimming pool, with water up to participants# waists, making it a non-weight bearing exercise.Aqua bikes can be used at all abilities and are often used in high intensity classes, giving a vigorous cardiovascular workout in a low impact environment # an ideal way to reduce obesity and prevent ill health.Stationary cycling and water-based exercises are also frequently recommended for patients suffering with osteoarthritis or recovering from knee and hip surgery or injury, therefore combining both is an obvious step.MACPool successfully applied for funding through the Argyll and Bute HSCP Self Management Fund to run the All Ability Cycling Project in partnership with Cycling UK and the Ardrishaig Bothy. As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Catriona, although only -years-old, seems mature beyond her years, taking the lead role in her stride, proving to be every inch the sophisticated s New Yorker.And Jacks lead role as Billy is perfectly paired with his unlikely partner, found in Dan Wilsons portrayal of Public Enemy , Moonface Martin. The duo first meet when stowing themselves away on the cruise liner, and their hare-brained schemes get them into some serious trouble, but also provides plenty of entertainment.A notable performance comes from Holly Nichol, who makes her GAOS principal role debut as the feisty and sassy nightclub singer, Reno Sweeney. Hollys passion for musical theatre is clear in her performance. Reno is a pivotal role, featuring in many musical numbers, and Holly doesnt miss a beat.A heavy dose of comedy is packed into this performance, whether drunk Eli Whitney, played by Simon Thomson, slurring around the ship, trying his hardest to woo the high-strung Mrs Harcourt, or the bumbling idiot, Lord Evelyn Oakleigh, who manages to make a mess of even the simplest of New York sayings.The audience will double over in laughter as James Bennetts performance of the incredibly posh Evelyn raises eyebrows, and Excalibur, when he sees Reno in her nightgown.As well as their top talent as actors and singers, this productions cast show they also have what it takes in the dancing department too. From the high kicks in the opening number, I Get a Kick Out of You, to the tap dancing break in the Act One finale performance of Anything Goes, members of the audience will be transfixed.Congratulations must go to musical director Jeff Thomson for creating a remarkable show.CAST LISTBilly Crocker - Jack McAuleyHope Harcourt - Catriona LambReno Sweeney - Holly NicholMoonface Martin - Dan WilsonErma - Jess ThomsonEvelyn Oakleigh - James BennettEvangeline Harcourt - Lorraine KempElisha J.

capacity of the mill lade and the application site is considered to be beyond the reach of the mill lade during high flows on the Ettrick Water.\"The risk of flooding from the mill lade to the application site is therefore considered to be low.\"The application, though, did attract  objections from neighbouring properties along Ettrickhaugh Road.As well as concerns over density of the

Then, from left back, Pupils’ captain Keith Mitchell wove a path between several Parkhall defenders and was unlucky to see his effort erted wide by the hosts’ keeper, amidst mounting pressure from the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils.Disappointingly, though, the visitors conceded a goal from a simple throw-in routine which undid their good work in the previous half hour, Parkhall midfielder Dougherty running off his marker and unleashing a sweet strike beyond Lamont to put Parkhall in front.Minutes later, Lamont, who was between the sticks for the team’s consecutive league titles in  and , then pulled off a wonder save to deny Parkhall a second.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils then produced another attacking spell of their own before the half-time whistle, with Liam Renton having two efforts on goal tipped round the post in the space of a minute by the Parkhall keeper.From the second save, the Pupils made the most of the resultant corner kick, when Renton delivered a swerving ball which found right winger Scott Souden, who guided a firm downward header into the Parkhall net to make it -.Into the second half, the Pupils had to weather a storm from their hosts, but found composure again and began to create excellent chances for themselves. Renton went close again from a free kick  yards out, but was denied by another fingertip save from Parkhall’s impressive keeper.Scott Souden had a chance to put the Pupils in front, after being put through on goal by a cutting through pass from Ryan Deans, but a loose touch gave the home keeper a chance to make a ing save and ert the ball wide.Then, the Pupils were pegged back for the second time when a corner from the hosts’ left-hand side was side-footed home by Parkhall’s Cannin, beyond Lamont’s clutches.Pushing hard for another equaliser, the Pupils had a lot of the play around Parkhall’s penalty area, and Donald McCallum, introduced as a substitute, pounced on a loose ball in the box from a Pupils free-kick but saw his effort blocked in the six-yard box.Into injury time, Parkhall, who had defended their lead resolutely in the closing stages, broke forward against the tide of Pupils pressure and made it - through striker Kevin Williams, who tucked a low effort into the Pupils’ net.The Pupils must now regroup for more league action tomorrowwith the visit of Neilston AFC.

Edinburgh University, astonishingly, failed to support her.The gay tennis icon Martina Navratilova was expelled from the LGBT group, Athlete Ally, for saying that people with male physiques should not complete in womenrsquos sport.Cultural and health bodies, and even the Scottish Government, were ceasing to use the very word ldquowoman in case it offended male-bodied transwomen. Bizarre substitutes like ldquowomxn, ldquomenstruators and ldquociswomen were being deployed in the cause of inclusivity.Well, times change. This issue is now out in the open. More and more women are speaking out against the undermining of sex-based rights.Even the ultra-wokeis permitting columns from feminists like Suzanne Moore calling for an end to the ldquono ing of gender-critical academics like Professor Selina Todd and Dr Kathleen Stock. They have been labelled as ldquoTerfs by trans zealots.Last week, the UK Government called a halt to self-identication legislation south of the Border. Ministers discovered that children as young as  are being given puberty blockers by gender reassignment clinics. Puberty blockers halt the sexual development of children. They are of the class of drugs once used as chemical castration for sex offenders.Influential figures in the SNP, like the former communications guru, Kevin Pringle, are now urging Nicola Sturgeon to follow the UK Government. But the Scottish Equalities Secretary, Shirley-Anne Somerville, apparently intends to press ahead with legislation to allow self-ID. Mr Pringle is speaking for many in the party who now realise that the growing backlash against Self-ID could threaten the SNPrsquos chances in next yearrsquos Holyrood elections.Yet it seemed glaringly obvious to me two years ago that women would never accept this existential assault on their sexual identity. How could they be expected to accept people with male genitalia and masculine physiques as real women  Why should women be forced to accept male-bodied transwomen in their protected spaces, in changing rooms and toilets Indeed, at first I thought this proposition that transwomen were literally women was just anti-trans scaremongering. Surely activists werenrsquot actually saying that they were biologically female I learned the hard way that this is precisely what they were saying. I was repeatedly accused of hate speech for suggesting that this would mean the removal of human biology from the school curriculum.Political leaders like Patrick Harvie of the Scottish Greens and the former leader of the Liberal Democrats Jo Swinson continue to insist that people with penises can be and are actually female. Labourrsquos Shadow Equalities Secretary, Dawn Butler, said last month that ldquobabies are born without a sex. This is pure flat earthism.Shamefully, leading feminists like Germaine Greer have been ldquocancelled for objecting to extreme transgenderism as misogyny. That it demeans and invalidates women.How could someone with a male body possibly experience social reality in the way real women do  Transwomen do not have uteruses, do not menstruate, do not give birth.Trans advocates reply that, well, some women canrsquot give birth and some women donrsquot menstruate. This is ridiculous and offensive sophistry. Asa woman ceases to be a womanshe canrsquot have children.These canards are still re on social media with people arguing that clown fish changing sex, and people born intersex ldquoprovethat there is no fixed biological definition of sex.Humans are of course mammals, not fish. The existence of a minuscule number of people born intersexdoesnrsquot alter the fact that . per cent of humans are born male or female.Humans are a binary species. We are not hermaphrodites. Sexual dferentiation is the basis of human reproduction. That this needs to be said is a shocking reflection on the intellectual integrity of the left. Many supposedly sensible people have been morally coerced into accepting something they know to be untrue. It is deeply worrying.Most SNP politicians know that transgender ideology is nonsense. They keep quiet partly because of fear of Britainrsquos onerous hate speech laws.It has been left to genuinely courageous women like Joan McAlpine MSP and Joanna Cherry, MP, to fight for reason. For doing so they have been the target of astonishing abuse on social media, and from the trans activists embedded in the SNP.Academics like Lucy Hunter Blackburn have bravely challenged the proposal to remove the question on sex from the national census.This has nothing to do with ldquotransgender rights. Trans people are free to identy as anyone they wish. No one is stopping them wearing what they want or loving who they wish. This is not homophobia ..In fact, advocates of Self-ID, like Stonewall, have set back the cause of trans rights by harnessing it to a quasi-religious dogma.Mr Pringle and others in the SNP now realise that the Scottish Government is marching into a minefield by persevering with Self-ID without proper debate. Given the pause in England, it could lead to a transgender Gretna Green.But there is an equitable solution. Of course allow transwomen to identy as female without needless bureaucratic obstacles. But the Government should make clear in the legislation reforming the Gender Recognition Act that this does not mean abolishing the biological definition of sex or infringing womenrsquos sex-based rights under the Equalities Act.Yoursquod think that a feminist like Nicola Sturgeon would regard that as self-evident. Perhaps she does.

The rest, as they say, is history. Except, in the case of the Tudor dynasty, this is a period thatrsquos never allowed to die. And in Henryrsquos case, as everyone knows, Anne Boleyn was only the second bite on his kebab.The publication of the final part of Hilary Mantelrsquos Thomas Cromwell trilogy, The Mirror  the Light, has been treated asitrsquos breaking news. The antics of the rapacious Henry VIII and his Machiavellian chief minister took place nearly  years ago, yet the airwaves, review and feature pages, and even fashion spreads are dominated by talk of the Tudors. Whether itrsquos their backstabbing ambition, headbands and bodices, or iron-fisted bureaucracy, weto them again and again, like birds to a hollow coconut shell, hoping for another flake.Mantelrsquos work is as thorough and intense an exploration of the political mind as yoursquoll find. That the previous two books in the series won the Booker Prize indicates their artistic merit as well as their accuracy. Those who donrsquot feel Cromwell merits so many pages might be surprised to find themselves hooked. And, although the factual detail is so well-founded the trilogy could become set texts for students, this is the past recast by the authorrsquos imagination. Official, dispassionate, unspun history it is not.Mantelrsquos portrayal of Henryrsquos sleekit, ruthless, tight-lipped consigliere has parallels with people in power today. Those echoes, and the entanglements of a murderous but exquisitely dressed court, are where the perennial fascination with Henryrsquos entourage lies. That his time on the throne was soon to be followed by Elizabeth Irsquos long tenure has ensured that,this era is to your taste, therersquos enough to chew on for a letime. Yet dramatic and richly brocaded as all this is, havenrsquot we now had enough  Isnrsquot it time to look where, and bid the Tudors farewell Historical fiction sounds like a timeless niche, untroubled by tides of fashion. As Mantelrsquos supremacy shows, however, it is as susceptible to fads as everything . There was a time when the Tudors were considered dusty and tired. Mention of Henryrsquos six wives or the Spanish Armada conjured up Jean Plaidy and school lessons: interestingthat was your kind of thing, but hardly thrilling or new.Writers in this genre are in a tricky situation. Publishers want them to be original yet follow the road more travelled, to mine a popular seam but make it their own. If nothing , Mantelrsquos oeuvre is a masterclass in how to go about this. Yet some years ago, before her meteoric rise, it seemed the appetite for Tudor was waning. The German market, a literary agent told me, had overdosed and lost interest in buying the rights to anything further from this era. Then Mantel rekindled the flame to such an extent that today, from Hamburg to Heidelberg, she will be in bookshop windows, kept company on the shelves by best-selling Alison Weir and Philippa Gregory, both of whom have also made Hampton Court their second home.And, just as the pitiless English royals in farthingales and ruffs are enjoying their moment in the sun, so too is anything set during the two world wars, or in Victoriarsquos later years. Like children who ask for the same story every bedtime, it seems that readers love nothing better than retreading old ground before they douse the lights.Most genre novels are looked down on by the literati as second class citizens. That is why Mantelrsquos Booker victories offered such encouragement for others ploughing a similar furrow. Yet having written historical fiction myself, set in the early th-century Borders, I have reservations: not about the calibre or worth of the genre, but about how it ranks with fiction that comes almost entirely from the writerrsquos imagination.As Andrew Marr said of The Mirror  the Light, the ending is never in doubt. The same goes for aspects of all books in which real-le figures play a part. When it comes to plotting, these fixed points become the beads on the rosary between which the narrative is threaded. They might cause problems when interweaving made-up with documented events, but they provide an off-the-peg outline around which to build a story. Writers portraying modern le through invented characters do not have this luxury. All they can rely upon are their powers of invention and the quality of their prose. To my mind, despite the spadework needed when researching previous centuries, that is a much harder act to pull off.With the Tudors dominating the bestseller lists, what astonishes me most is how little of our history fiction has yet covered. In this country alone there is material for libraries of new novels set in the centuries before the Stewarts claimed the throne, and long after the Jacobites retreated to their peaty hovels. The past might well be a foreign country, as L P Hartley wrote, but some areas seem to attract package holiday tours, leaving tumbleweed to roll through the rest."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-pandemic-clear-bed-blocking-people-taken-system","story":"Professor June Andrews recognised hercomments were ldquohorric but gave an honest assessmentof the potential consequences of a large-scale coronavirus outbreak.Prof Andrews is a former director of the Scottish Governmentrsquos Centre for Change and Innovation.

Struan Stevensonreveals an equally profound misunderstanding of my own country. Amongst his many wilful misinterpretations, his reference to ldquohellipattempts to break up Canadarsquos -year-old unionhellip is particularly revealing. The UK is a union Canada is a Confederation. Canadians routinely refer to their ldquofederal government. The federal nature of its governance is what has kept this geographically, linguistically and culturally erse country together.The two referendums on Quebec independence reinforced this federalism and changed the whole country. And even that may not be enough to save the confederation, whose fate still hangs in the balance. By contrast, there is not, and never has been, anything remotely federal about UK governance. The UK is the most centralised of all the democracies. It is as far from any kind of Canadian federalism as is possible. The idea that it would ever embrace such federalism is disingenuous nonsense.

outdoor stones so with all these changing weather patterns it may be a while before the new owners can get the opportunity to use them.Curling is said to date back to the th century, and was first played on frozen ponds and lochs in Scotland using flat stones taken from riverbeds.Known as the roaring game for the noise the stones make as they travel across the ice, the oldest stone dates from

A bottle of Buckfast wine, the favourite after-dinner tipple of Scotlandrsquos shell suit class.ldquoHeavens! gasped a deeply perturbed TV-watching nation, ldquowe canrsquot condone such abhorrent behaviour. Especially when it comes from a chap who commands such an unhealthy influence over our impressionable youth. At which point everyone reached for their vials of smelling salts, to prevent any untoward swooning over the chaise lounge.Actually, only a smattering of people seemed genuinely concerned about Lewis and the Bucky bottle. And most of them had a newspaper column to file, a deadline to hit, and nothing better to be incensed about in print that week. Everyone  just shrugged, with the occasional ldquoGrsquoon yer selrsquo, big man! thrown into the mix. People understood that itrsquos a music iconrsquos duty to shock with bad behaviour. It always has been.Lord ReithMost hip hop artists made their names rapping about gang culture, while the punk scenersquos spiky-haired peacock preeners took their hit of fame, then overdosed on drugs.Prior to that there was Led Zep zapping the zippers off groupies, and the Rolling Stones rolling over anything that was female and in a miniskirt.But when did such outreacute antics begin  When did it become all the rage to amp up the outrage  Therersquos no definitive answer, though Irsquom happy to take an educated guess. As far as I can tell, itrsquos all the fault of George Formby.Think about it, Gormless George was glorying criminal behaviour long before hip hop happened. According to UK law, voyeurism is the illegal viewing or recording of another person while they conduct private activities. Did such an edict concern our George  Not much, it didnrsquot. In his song When Irsquom Cleaning Windows, which he first belted out in one of his popular movies, Formby boasted about the amount of sneaky peeking he enjoyed while he was meant to be innocently plying his trade.On the tunersquos release, the BBC was as disgusted as any newspaper columnist spotting a bottle of tonic wine in the hand of a West Lothian crooner. The head of the corporation at the time, Lord Reith, sputtered: ldquoIf the public wants to listen to Formby singing his disgusting little ditty, theyll have to be content to hear it in the cinemas, not over the nations airwaves. As he was born and raised in Glasgow, Lord Reith surely must have been an expert on disgusting little ditties, so should have been obeyed by the great unwashed. But the public chose to ignore him instead, and Formbyrsquos song become one of the biggest hits of the s.Which proves that the public loves a bad boy. Eventhe bad boy plays a ukulele. It also proves, rather disturbingly, that the public has a genuine soft spot for Peeping Toms. Wersquore a nosey lot, and therersquos nothing we like better than seeing what people get up to in the privacy of their own homes.Jim-jamsWhich brings meto the subject of this weekrsquos Diary at Large. You guessed it, Irsquom spending the day spying on Lewis Capaldi. Okay...not quite. Though only because Irsquom assuming Lewis has a bunch of snappy, scrappy dogs roaming his grounds, protecting him and his privacy. And those snappy, scrappy dogs are probably tanked up on the Bucky, just like their sweetly-crooning master.Since an invasion of Capaldirsquos privacy isnrsquot on the cards, I instead find myself, late of an evening, in Glasgowrsquos south side. And just like Mr Formby, Irsquom staring through the windows of the homes of people I donrsquot know. Furthermore, Irsquom getting away with it. Is my reckless criminality going unpunished because Irsquom a slippery sort of fella, who happens to be lurking in a bush while draped in khaki  Afraid not. Irsquom wearing a caramel-coloured duffel coat which provides as much camouflage as Irsquod get dressed in Elvis Presleyrsquos Vegas-era pyjamas.Irsquom also standing quite conspicuously in the middle of the road, staring up at the windows opposite me, occasionally taking photographs of them with my mobile phone. I might as well have a neon sign above my head reading: ldquoYoo-hoo, house dwellers! Irsquom spying on you!So how am I getting away with such conduct  Well, for a start, Irsquom not the only person behaving in this murky manner. Therersquos a large crowd of us ndash men, women, children ndash all ogling the neighbourhood windows. We occasionally clap and cheer, too,we spot something we all agree is particularly entertaining or memorable. Meanwhile, the people in the houses play up to our prying. Some of them sing and dance others just cavort without musical accompaniment.The reason for all this vibrant voyeurism  Irsquom at Strathbungo Window Wanderland, a curious event, now in its fourth year, where locals decorate their windows in a lavish and sometimes surreal fashion.Why  For the entertainment of anyone who happens to be sauntering past, of course. Though most of the people on the streets tonight arenrsquot random rubberneckers. Like myself they arrived quite deliberately. Wersquore all loitering with intent here to experience a very unusual evening.Advent calendarSome of the windows I stroll past are decorated with simple designs. One homeowner has painted a barcode across glass. There are also pop culture references galore. I spot the silhouette of Yoda from Star Wars, and a Harry Potter themed house.A few images are political, and therefore tedious. A window is a transparent sheet of glass, after all, that allows light to shine through. Such glass should never be dulled by the dreary smear of dogma.The houses are backlit by interior lighting, making theof each street look like a glowing advent calendar. Perhaps the most impressive display is a two-storey house kitted out like a giant jukebox. And itrsquos a loud jukebox, at that. On the second floor of the house a live band are playing. They face the window, their music flowing onto the street.During my window walkabout I bump into Brian Morgan, who lives nearby and is manning a stall selling decorative art made out of fragments of old Strathbungo windows. ldquoWe reclaimed them, he explains, ldquoand turned them into shapes that are based on a map of Strathbungo.The glass shapes are crafted to look decidedly quirky. I ask Brianthe average Strathbungo resident is similarly offbeat in shape.ldquoPeople living here are more likely to come from an artistic or creative background than in other parts of Glasgow, he says, adding: ldquoNot everyonersquos like that, of course. But what most people do have in common is a sense of community. Strathbungo has a self-contained vibe. Itrsquos a little area in a very big city, with a real village-y feel to it.And how far does that community feel extend, Irsquom curious to know.

Immigrant communities and those fleeing terror from brutal regimes are already accustomed to being regarded as virulent. We round them up isolate and detain them and then pack them off to their country of origin using some minor refraction real or imagined.Those we give leave to remain must first be doused in the healing waters of a UK history exam which conveniently omits to mention any of those gnarly deeds of empire which caused them ultimately to seek peace here. We havenrsquot yet got round to forcing them to wear bells around their necks and shout ldquoUnclean! Unclean! but the Toriesrsquo Windrush project was a close approximation.We ascribe to them, in the manner of a pandemic, all sorts of anti-social behaviours and deploy our Conservative-leaning newspapers to de-humanise them and portray them as a danger to the British way of le. Only after we consider them safe and have absorbed them safely into the UK bloodstream do we permit a limited number ndash at a distance ndash to share in this nationrsquos bounty, much of which is built on what we looted from their countries in the first place.The instinct towards the survival of the fittest, which lies at the heart of Tory doctrine, comes to the fore when a global pandemic begins to rattle. In , the prestigious US think-tank Brookings studied how poor countries and disadvantaged communities suffer disproportionately when pandemics roar. ldquoRegardless of where a pandemic starts, once underway, the poor tend to bear the brunt. Low and middle-income countries have weaker health systems and limited capacity to handle surges in cases.The essay went on: ldquoWe can curtail pandemicswe quickly develop vaccines and make them widely accessible. However, without vigorous efforts to secure equitable access, vaccine distribution will follow the logic of the market. During the  swine flu pandemic, wealthy countries secured large advance orders for vaccines, but, despite the efforts of the World Health Organisation to negotiate donations, poor countries were crowded out ndash receiving vaccines more slowly than rich countries and unable to cover as many of their citizens.At its most primitive level this tendency is evident in bulk-buying at supermarkets or filling up at petrol stations during an energy shortage.

Global capitalism works by identying or creating shortages and then exploiting them and keeping them out of the reach of the majority.No mercy can ever be found here and anything that speaks of weakness infirmity or poverty is deemed to be self-inflicted.

Therefore, the decision to go with one team was made.“As I’m sure we can all understand, Shetland, who have supported us throughout, were unhappy with this decision and asked Orkney to reconsider and look at other ways to try to field a second team.“For Orkney, the cost of travel and the amount the association would have to subsidise players’ travel made sending two teams unfeasible.“Shetland voiced their concern over the cost of organising the event for only one team, and, after further discussions, the decision was finally taken that this year’s senior inter-county would not take place.“This decision has not been taken lightly, and the committee and players involved are very disappointed.“We hope the fixtures willnext year.”Shetland are in the midst of an unrelenting winning run at senior inter-county level Orkney having last won the ‘A’ fixture in .Leask said: “We tried to re-arrange it.

If Singapore — a city-state with no rural areas — is the economic model for those who inform this Government’s thinking then it speaks volumes about their priorities. This London-focused vision of the United Kingdom risks undermining the future of farmers, crofters and fishermen – and the communities that rely on them.“These views seem to be expressed at the heart of Government decision-making, and the pattern is all too similar to when the UK joined the Common Fisheries Policy. The Tory Government at the time claimed it would protect UK fishermen while privately dismissing them as “expendable”.He continued: “The Government must remember that the United Kingdom is far more than simply London or London’s financial sector. We should embrace and enhance the geographic and economic ersity of the United Kingdom, not toss it away in the name of a single-minded metropolitan view.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The organisation is now missed very much. It was an independent local organisation for the people of Orkney.#Ms Taylor, along with former colleagues and supporters, feels that there is now a big void in community mental health services. They are interested in hearing thoughts, views and ideas regarding a proposed new venture called Orkney Open Door Counselling, with the eventual aim being to source funding and sponsorship for the running of a service and its premises.The closure of OACAS, which was announced shortly before Christmas, has caused a great deal of upset in the community, with several clients and former staff members sharing their concerns with The Orcadian. The service#s former chairwoman, Chloe Jowett, has said that #years of underfunding# and a history of #undervaluing# community mental health services in Orkney was behind its abrupt and unwelcome demise.All are welcome at the public meeting, due to be held at St Magnus Centre, Kirkwall, on Saturday, March  at pm.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It suggests that agreement is possible on how the newer vessels that our internal ferry services so desperately need might be funded.“Fuel and maintenance costs continue to rise steeply, while the disruption caused by the removal of MV Eynhallow from service illustrates perfectly the urgency of putting in place vessels that are fit for purpose.“The Transport Minister has acknowledged again that Orkney’s internal ferry services fall well below the minimum standards set out in the government’s own National Ferries Plan. He also insists that discussions with the Council to find a long term solution to the delivery of these leline services are ‘ongoing’.“Meantime, however, the communities in Orkney most directly affected are growing increasingly frustrated at the lack of visible progress. No doubt they will be hoping that the resolution regarding the Golden Mariana’s replacement now paves the way for agreement between the council and ministers on a wider programme of vessel replacement.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But there’s also something for adults, with the Freaky Sequin Cabaret and the madness of the Old Time Sailors raucous flashmob concerts.Keeping to the sea theme, there will be two talks telling tales of the high seas — one on a canoeing trip around the UK and the other a near-death experience on the Round the World yacht race.“This year we’re trying to take events out across the islands and to introduce audiences to experiences in new venues,” said Alasdair.“So we’ll see a horn quartet in the kitchen of Noltland Castle on Westray and talks about le on the high seas in Highland Park Distillery.”The festival ends with a silent film, accompanied by a live performance of newly created music.Orkney’s midsummer St Magnus International Festival marks the start of the summer’s festivals in Scotland and each year brings large numbers to the islands, boosting the economy and revealing Orkney to the wider world.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Those that will need to be quarantined will be quarantined. Those who will require medical help will receive it.Princess Cruises said  of the more than , people on board, which includes  Britons, were tested in the first round.A military helicopter crew lowered test kits on to the ft ship by rope on Thursday and later retrieved them for analysis as the vessel waited off San Francisco, under orders to keep its distance from shore. All passengers have been ordered to remain in their cabins.US President Donald Trump, speaking at the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, said he would have preferred not to let the passengers disembark on to American soil but will defer to the recommendations of medical experts.He said: ldquoI donrsquot need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasnrsquot our fault.

And they are mostly Americans. vw,vw,px, px\"Health teams wore protective equipment to deliver virus testing kits to the ship Health officials trying to establish whether the virus is circulating on the Grand Princess undertook the testing after reporting that a passenger on a previous voyage of the ship, in February, died of the disease.In the past few days, health authorities disclosed that at least  other people who were on the same journey were also found to be infected. Some passengers on that trip stayed aboard for the current voyage, which increased crew membersrsquo exposure to the virus.Also on Friday, Thai authorities blocked a separate cruise ship from docking in the country due to concerns over the fact a number of passengers are from Italy ndash which with almost  virus deaths is the centre of Europersquos epidemic.Another Princess cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, was quarantined for two weeks in Yokohama, Japan, last month because of the virus, and ultimately about  of the , people aboard became infected.copy -.

After a third-place finish in the North District event in December and a fth place finish in the Inter Districts event in January, expectations were high for another strong performance in what is the flagship age grade cross country championship of the season.A field of  athletes took to the start line at Callendar Park in conditions which saw everything from sunshine, wind, hail and snow. The route had been changed because of severe weather over the previous week, making for a course that was very heavy underfoot and flooded in several places.Todd managed to get to the front of the queue at the line and set off at a steady pace, settling in to a position within the top  or so runners after the initial surge.Over the next  minutes she maintained her form and starting easing her way up through the field to settle in sixth place as the runner approached the final quarter of the race.As the finish was coming into sight, Todd started to kick for home and her efforts were rewarded as she moved up to fourth and battled all the way to the finish line to maintain that position, getting it on the line with no more than a foot’sfrom the athlete in fth place.Coach David Wagstaff said it was a fantastic achievement for the youngster, who was not only a great prospect for the future in athletics but also an aspiring triathlete who was doing well on the junior circuit.Todd and her parents thanked NorthLink Ferries, without whose generous sponsorship participation in the cross country championships would not have been possible..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 27 ","story":"With the Six Nations Rugby Championship now three-fths of the way through, only France remain unbeaten.Scotland’s victory over Italy in Rome on Saturday was deserved, and enough to avoid the ignominy of the wooden spoon.As a spectacle the match will not live long in the memory, save for captain Stuart Hogg scoring the kind of try that only a few in the world can produce.Hogg’s display overall was very good, both defensively and from an attacking point of view. From the former perspective, the big positive about the Scots so far this year is that they have conceded the fewest tries and the least points of any of the six teams. Few would have predicted that a month ago.Hamish Watson got the nod for man of the match against the Italians, another indication that the open-side flanker is back to his very best. Others to stand out were loose-head prop Rory Sutherland, the find of the tournament, and Watson’s back row colleague Jamie Ritchie.Elsewhere at the weekend France proved just too good for Wales in Cardf, and are now the only side left with the chance of a Grand Slam. The French have been very impressive this season and have about five or six players who would be in a combined Six Nations team so far.At Twickenham there was a typical battle between two outfits who prefer brute strength to artistry. What little flair was evident mostly emanated from Ireland in the latter stages, but England had got so far ahead by half-time the game was really over.Sadly once again we had a referee, this time Jaco Peyper, seemingly unwilling to penalise a side which is consistently in breach of the offside rule.Irish fly-half Jonny Sexton, who had an awful game himself including making a complete mess of two kicks, could regularly be seen complaining to the referee. That even included pointing to players who were blatantly in the wrong place, but Peyper refused to take action.Only midway through the second half, when the Irish were all but buried, did Peyper appear to notice that so many white shirts were lying on the wrong side of the ball. I found that absolutely baffling.A week on Sunday Scotland will be in action again, this time back at Murrayfield against leaders France. That could be close, with the French chasing a clean sweep and the Scots still harbouring hopes of finishing third or fourth in the table.While the Finn Russell saga shows no sign of sorting itself out, and Adam Hastings likely to continue at number  despite being out of touch against Italy, it would be good to have a couple of players back from injury. The presence of either winger Darcy Graham and lock back row Sam Skinner would strengthen things in both departments.Team of the tournament so far: Elliot DalyJonny May , Robbie Henshaw , Gael Fickou , Mattia BelliniRomain Ntamack , Antoine DupontC J Stander , Jamie Ritchie , Gregory AlldrittAlun Wyn Jones , Bernard Le RouxRory Sutherland , Julien Marchand , Joe Marler .: : : : : : : :Two of my favourite footballers, in my opinion the greatest ever strikers from their respective international sides, celebrated their th birthdays over the past week.Last Thursday it was the turn of Jimmy Greaves, who sadly is not in good health having suffered a serious stroke five years ago.A documentary on BT Sport that evening covered all aspects of Greaves’ career, ranging from his early days at Cha, a big money move to AC Milan, theto Tottenham Hotspur, the shock transfer to West Ham and his final days in non-league football.The programme also touched on the hepatitis which he suffered from during the - season. He was warned that he would lose up to a yard in pace as a result of the illness, but bounced back with four goals in an away victory over Norway.Then came the  World Cup, an injury against France and Greaves’ omission from the side for the final. To see his replacement Geoff Hurst, who was an inferior player, score a hat trick and ultimately receive a knighthood, must have been dficult for Greaves. But typically he was magnanimous about the issue.At the end of his West Ham career Greaves succumbed to severe alcoholism, which brought his contract to an end. After four years away from the game he made a comeback with Barnet among other non-league clubs, and although still impressive his best was long gone.Greaves later forged a new career in television, first with Star Soccer and then more famously as the funny half of the Saint and Greavsie double act with Ian St John.I have to laugh when the likes of Gary Lineker and Harry Kane are sometimes compared to Greaves. Watching old footage reveals how a good number of his goals involved running from just inside the opposition half, beating two or three players and then rounding the keeper. Comparison  There really is none.On Monday it was the th for Denis Law, my boyhood hero and favourite player of all time.Law has also not enjoyed the best of health, suffering from debilitating eye problems and also from prostate cancer. But happily he appears to be in reasonable fettle at the moment, well enough to appear at the recent BBC Sports Personality of the Year event and attend former Manchester United team mate Harry Gregg’s funeral at the weekend.They say it is not always advisable to meet your heroes, but I would gladly pay money to interview Law.: : : : : : : :It was reported last week that Neil Fenwick is in the frame for the Shetland football manager’s job.If that turns out to be the case then good luck to the Lerwick Spurs player coach.When the position was first advertised last year the wording suggested it would be a dficult task, with the applicant likely to need a strong back-up team. That probably explains why so few people came forward.I’m not convinced anyone needs to be going through an interview process over this. None of the most successful people to have held the position were subjected to such scrutiny, and they mostly did the job very well.If Fenwick is indeed the man, let’s all get behind him.: : : : : : : :There is obviously still plenty of power in the conveyor belt which produces Shetland athletics talent, as evidenced by the success of young Layla Todd at the weekend.The -year-old’s fourth-place finish in the Scottish National Cross Country Championships was a tremendous achievement, a credit to both her and her coaches.With distance runner Seumas MacKay now too old for the junior inter-county squad and sprinter Katie Dinwoodie just having a year or two left, it will be necessary for younger competitors to fill the void. Todd will likely be one of those in the frame soon for the , metres event.: : : : : : : :Boxer Tyson Fury’s display against Deontay Wilder on Sunday morning, to claim the WBC heavyweight crown, was sensational.After the previous draw between the two, when Fury was ahead on points but floored twice late on, many predicted that this time Wilder would have his measure. No chance.Whatever you think of the so-called “gypsy king”, who has not always endeared himself to the general public, he is massive box-office entertainment.Wilder may still be given a third fight, which would be disappointing, or Fury’s next outing could be a unication battle with fellow Briton Anthony Joshua.That could well be a mismatch, as Fury appears to be in a dferent league from the muscle-bound Joshua.

He works extensively at Westminster, Dublin and Stormont.In the late s, he was music critic for the News Letter and contributed to the New Musical Express.He says he uses music to escape from the pain of supporting Everton, Cltonville and Ballymena Rugby Club, not to mention the politics.And he equivocates excellently in true political fashion over his choices - and how they could all change overnight!He says: “The problem with picking a Top Ten is my taste can change from time to time. So perhaps the best option is mixing some old favourites with a few which only made the grade recently.” . Anyone who knows me will not be surprised my first pick will be a Van Morrison track. There are so many which mean so much. Caravan, In the Garden, Tupelo Honey among dozens of classic songs. But I’ve decided to go with a track from the new album Three Chords and the Truth. Morrison thrives when he dips into spirituality and mysticism. At  the Man still has it. The song is Dark Night of the Soul, Van Morrison.  Glen Hansard’s music has been a source of much enjoyment in recent years. Great tunes but my choice is a track featuring Clarence Clemons’ son Jake. Drive All Night, Glen Hansard  John Martyn was a genius. His music transcends styles and fashions. Solid Air one of the finest albums ever produced. This song is just beautul.May You Never, John Martyn. .Nick Drake died a young man but left a powerful legacy of fine music. This song is particularly haunting. Northern Sky, Nick Drake  Following a pattern here, this artist is also dead. Sandy Denny remains a personal favourite. The combination of her voice and the genius of Richard Thompson leaves a song which will never grow old. Who Knows Where the Time Goes, Fairport Convention.  There has to be some sweet soul music. The Rev Al Green remains a voice without equal. Let’s Stay Together, Al Green.  In the same direction, Marvin Gaye could melt the hardest heart. His music both political and romantic. Of course, he’s dead too.What’s Going On, Marvin Gaye . Big fan of the Waterboys. Mike Scott is immensely talented. This is a wonderful version of a Van song from Astral Weeks. Sweet Thing, The Waterboys.  The Alabama Three never receive the plaudits which they deserve. Woke Up This Morning is generally the band’s signature tune but this is even better. Hello..I’m Johnny Cash, Alabama Three . Just love J J Cale. This track is magical. Cocaine by J J Cale My choice will probably change next week and I’m amazed I’ve missed Springsteen and Peter Green’s Fleetwood Mac. But that’s it for now, pop pickers.

Van Morrison – Tupelo Honey, lesser known song from the Belfast Cowboy that in all the times I have seen him live, he has naturally never played!. The Waterboys – Whole of the Moon - just a wonderful anthem of my youth and still such a great song today, took me a long time to realise the lyric was a comparison between two people, “I see the crescent, you see the whole of the moon”. Sam Baker – Broken Fingers, a Texan who “got caught up in someone ’s war” after terrible injuries learned to play the guitar again and wrote this song about the process, read the back story before listening.. Dr Feelgood – All Through the City – first live band I seen in Belfast at  years old, had a huge impact on me and after all these years, Jim Bolan thank you for taking me!. Foy Vance – Two Shades of Hope – a wonderful singer songwriter from our wee country, and what a song!. Linda Rondstadt – Your No Good - I have probably bought this album times in dferent formats, loved it from no age.. David Bowie – Heroes - A song and artist who came alive for me when I went to Live Aid with John Connor in , best performance of the day . Bap Kennedy – Working Man – from the fantastic Sailors Revenge album, sadly Bap is not with us anymore, greatly missed. Was lucky enough to have him play at my th birthday party in the BT club, Vincent Close got him to do some Energy Orchard stuff!. Van Morrison – Into the Mystic- is there a better song to raise the spirit, “let your soul and spirit fly into the mystic” ace. The Undertones – You’ve got my number , I could be spotted from an early age jumping up and down on a dance floorafter forcing a DJto play it!

For these were not just trad troubadours whose genius would grace any stage where Irish music is celebrated but each of them in turn was exemplary in passing on the tradition to the next generation.Mayo harpist Laoise Kelly, who reminded us that the cry in Ireland from our betters was once, ‘hang the harpists and destroy their instruments’, not only excels at our national instrument but has founded an international school for an cláirseach on Achill Island. No better person to pick up the Musician of the Year Award.Ned Kelly from Tipperary, a box player, has inspired an entire community to use music to give hope with his ‘In Tune for Le’ traditional orchestra — scores of whom played from the balconies at the Waterfront Hall as his accordion raised the roof in Béal Feirste Cois Cuain.Then there was the golden-voicedheartbroken Lilis Ó Laoire from the Donegal Gaeltacht whose voice and values connect us with an area where language and song are the very backbone of the community. Lilis had buried his mother the previous day and his presence paid homage to all those who had acted as a bridge of song from the past to the present day. His rousing closing number – a traditional ditty rewritten to mark the event — was a highwater mark of an outstanding evening. Ón osna is sine a thig an ceol is binne, as Seosamh Mac Grianna observed Full marks to the set-designers who used images of Belfast to illuminate a glittering gathering – the shards from the surface of the Titanic Centre, the dome from the Dome of Delight and the yellow cranes in comic-book style —and kudos also to TG for bringing these awards to Belfast for the third year in a row. Maximum Respect. Meas Mór.Both those who attended and those who followed the live broadcast on TG were, indeed, “immeasurably enriched” by the Gradam Ceoil Awards, as the VIP who opened the Waterfront Hall had predicted.And who was he Prince Charles, of course.You can watch back at Gradam Ceoil on the TG player at www.tg.ie"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"from street busker to empire headliner","story":"JOHN Garrity is a familiar face to many around Belfast city centre, entertaining shoppers with his on-street busking.Originally from Enniskillen, the -year-old has made Belfast his home ever since ing from a spell in America and next month is set to headline a gig in the Empire with companion Jonathan Cariaga in a duo known as the  Johnatones.John, who has had a lelong passion for music, decided he wanted to have a shot at making a living from it.“When I left school, I was doing my best to focus on music. It was mostly country back then but now, it is totally dferent,” he explained.“The country scene isn’t as big so I have been out broadening my style and have started to write my own material.“Busking has been good for me and that is where people recognise me from. It was a bit of luck in that I bit the bullet and went out and did it.“It is great when people come up and ask for a photo which is all a bit surreal and new to me but I am enjoying it.”John hit the headlines in July last year after coming under attack when singing the ballad Grace in Donegall Place. He was verbally abused by a mystery woman, who went on to kick over his equipment. Footage of the incident went viral on social media, with John receiving widespread support at the time. He bounced back from the incident and says it hasn’t deterred him from singing the love song about Joseph Plunkett and Grace Gford.“I think it was just bad timing. I picked myself up and moved on quickly enough.“I don’t see Grace as a republican song. For me, it is very much a love song. People can have their own judgement on it but I love it and that one-off incident won’t stop me from keeping singing it.”John received publicity of a more positive note earlier this year when he caught the attention of Irish band Kodaline following his stunning performance of their song ‘All I Want’.The viral rendition also caught the attention of the band#s lead singer, Steve Garrigan, who wants John to join the band on stage at their next Belfast gig.John is enjoying unprecedented popularity thanks to his internet fame and is now doing more gigs than busking.In his biggest ever gig in Belfast, John, who previously appeared on the hit TV show Britain’s Got Talent, will take to the stage of the Empire Hall in Botanic Avenue on Sunday, March  for his biggest show to date.Looking ahead to the gig, an excited John said: “Things are good at the minute and we seem to be doing really well. We have been working hard and the style of our play is starting to take shape.“We are very excited about our first big gig in the Empire. Tickets have been flying out and there are only a few left at this stage.“It is going to be a big night and we are expecting a big crowd.“This is will be the biggest gig we have ever had and hopefully won’t be the last.“I would encourage people to buy a ticket and come along. It is going to be a lot dferent toyou have heard me on the streets or in the bars.”John’s sidekick Jonathan Cariagais originally from Argentina and has now made Belfast his home after teaming up with him.“I wanted to study music at university in Dublin and planned to only stay in Belfast a few months,” he told us. “I got some work gigging and have been here over three years now.“I was playing around bars in the city centre and got in contact with John. We met on a Thursday and by Sunday, we were playing together. We really enjoyed doing it together and haven’t looked back since.“It is really fun working with John. He is a really free and open singer so we can play whatever we want all the time.“I am so excited about the gig in the Empire. I really like the place and always wanted to play there.”John Garrity live in concert at the Belfast Empire is on Sunday, March . Doors open at pm.

And caps. I have quite a nice collection of headwear, worn and aged, like myself, dispersed between Dublin and Belfast, Donegal, the car boot and all the places in between. It used to be customary for men to wear headware. Look at any old photos. Dunchers and flatcaps galore. Peaky blinders in multitudes outside factories, mills, shipyards, farmyards, public houses, marts, markets, country fairs. Hats were also popular. Paddy hats, trilbys, bowlers. Though bowlers were more for Orangemen on parade or English civil servants on The Mall. Country men were hat and cap people. Christy Ring even played hurling in a cap. So my grá for head gear used to be widespread. And now its coming back into vogue. Especially the omnipresent baseball cap. It is the preferred head covering for rappers, golfers, other sports people, urban youth.I have a couple of baseball caps. And a few hand-knitted wooly hats. Síle Darragh knitted me a dark blue tea cosy-type one. Lucilita a white one. Both were too big. But very warm all the same. Wooly ear warmers. There are really fine knitted yokes for sale in expensive shops in the west of Ireland. But they are very dear. I covet one of those. Hint hint. Extra Large.I also have a Stetson. It was presented to me in Texas. It has an enormous brim. I only wear it indoors, usually while watching Westerns on TV. I haven’t the nerve to wear it outdoors. Before the presentation our man in America, Larry Downes, was very concerned that the Stetson should not be a black one. Apparently the bad guys wore black ones. So he insisted that my Stetson would be white. So it is. I never told Larry but I preferred a black one. I favour Jesse James or Billy the Kid over Hopalong Cassidy or The Lone Ranger. But Larry had his way.I have another hat which I’m also shy about wearing outdoors although I like it very much. It’s not unlike the one Martin McGuinness wore during the Easter Centenary events. I wore mine as well. I would like to have the nerve to wear it more often the way Martin started to do. Martins hat now features in many posters and pictures of him. I think the hat darkens his face too much and he looks too stern. He was stern sometimes but my best memories of Martin are when he was hatless and happy.One day he and I were going to see Brit Secretary of State Peter Mandelson. On the coat stand outside his office a hat was perched. To Martin’s chagrin I put the hat on my head and we breezed in to talk to Peter.“I have a hat like that” Peter told me cheerfully. “I wear it in the grounds of Hillsborough House.”“If you want to get ahead get a hat,” I replied, removing it and placing it on my knee. “You have very good taste in headware. That’s something we have in common.”When we finished our meeting I put Peter’s hat back on my head and Martin and I left.“You can’t take his hat,” Martin hissed at me. “That’s stealing”.“Stealing! They stole our country,” I said. “In the gospel according to Cleaky, I’m liberating it. This is appropriating the Imperialist Misappropriators.” Cleaky was a great liberator. An outstanding appropriator.One time in Australia John Little gave RG and me some fine head covers. We picked up two Koalas as well. Ach is é sín scéal eile. But that’s another story. No Koalas were harmed in the telling of this tale.I like tweed caps. I have one which belonged to my friend, the late Kevin McKenna. We swapped caps one time. I wear Kevin’s cap regularly. I also have a cap belonging to another friend, the late Stan Corrigan. His lovely we Kathleen gave me it. It is that cap which triggered this column. I lost it last week after the recent Ard Chomairle meeting in Dublin which mandated Mary Lou to explore the possibilty of agreeing a Programme for A Government For Change.I was distraught about the loss of Stan’s cap. I realised very quickly after the meeting that it was missing. But where  I enlisted the help of Saint Anthony. Again.Was it in Dawn Doyle’s car  No she told me when I phoned her. Or out the back of Ard Oig where RG picked me up  No. There was no sight of it when Keith searched the back lane in the dark in the midst of Storm Ciara.Next morning the search continued. I prowled the back lane of Ard Oig before being summoned heartbroken into a meeting. While I was so engaged, that darling man Mick O Brien drove back to the CWU building where the Ard Chomairle met.He ed triumphantly.“I have your hat,” he declared and handed me a Russian Cossack type piece of hairy millinery.“That’s not my hat,” I told him as I tried it on.“It’s lovely on you,” Mick told me. And so it was.But I was still fretting for big Stan’s cap. Negotiations for Government  The Sinn Féin surge  The posturing by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael’s leaders  Shadowy friggers running Sinn Féin  I focused with my comrades on all this but beneath my new, well nearly new, Cossack hat my wee mind refused to give up on big Stan’s missing cap. Apart from the sense of loss how could I face Kathleen  She’s a Tyrone woman. Hell hath no fury like a Tyrone woman chastising a man, particularly a Belfast man. My nerves were wrecked.“An bhfuil cead agam dul amach ” I asked Mary Lou. “May I go out ”“Tá” she said “Yes, but please take off that Russian hat#. and get your hair cut.”I exited despondently stage left, as sheepishly as Micheál Martin after Mary Lou scalped his arse. Out the back of Ard Oig the old Dominic Street flats, now demolished, are a building site. I made my way gingerly through the muck. A burly workman greeted me.“A great election result,” he said.“Yup,” I replied, “Did you find a cap ”“Is it a Bugatti ” He asked.I wonderedhe had a selection of caps. A Malloy. A Hanna. A Magee. But no he only had one. Stan’s Bugatti. He pulled it out – a grey wet crumpled item – from beneath his yellow high-vis vest.“That’s it!” I cried as I resisted the urge to hug him. Instead I told him about big Stan. His eyes welled up with tears.“I’m glad I found it,” he told me.“You look very like a painting my Granny had of Saint Anthony,” I told him.He looked at me warily.“Thank you,” I gushed.“No problem. Tell me one thing,” he asked.“Anything,” I replied.“When are you getting your hair cut ” He asked.“Soon,” I told him. After all he did find big Stan’s cap.He smiled at me and as he turned away I really could see that he looked remarkably like my Granny’s picture of Saint Anthony. I felt an urge to fall on my knees in the muck to offer a prayer of thanks to him but I suppressed this. So instead I just thanked him again. He smiled beatically.Now I’ve Mick’s Russian hat as well as big Stan’s cap. It’s great. No need to worry about the wrath of Kathleen. Or Mary Lou. Unlike Micheál Martin. If I had two heads I’d be landed."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"residents in limbo over move","story":"CHAIR of the Riverdale Finaghy Tenants’ Association says he, along with other members, remain in “limbo” over a proposed “take-over” of properties under the ownership ofVictoria Housing Estatesto Choice Housing.Currently a joint consultation is underway between VHE and Choice around proposals to agree a transfer of its stock in Riverdale to the housing body. Chair Joby Fox told the Andersonstown News that at a recent meeting with VHE and Choice, tenants initially thought that on the “face of it, the proposal looked like a good offer”.“But when presented with the details tenants felt angry and left with the threat of their homes being sold on the open market to the highest bidderthey don’t accept the deal. This is clearly a case of duress.“The issue now is that the terms that are being offered for the option to buy our properties or move to Choice Housing do not reflect the time that people have lived in their homes,” explained Joby.“VHE are only offering the properties at current market prices with no offer for commission based on the time we have resided in our homes or indeed no reflection on the severe hardship which we have endured under the watch of VHE and the Charity Commission NI ,” he said. “The biggest majority of our tenants and their families have lived and maintained the houses for over  years”.Joby said that he believes the proposal is “unlikely” to go through.“It would mean that VHE and CCNI put themselves beyond accountability, so we have to ask, who’s agenda is best served by this move  It’s clear that VHE and CCNI want to sweep their five years of failure under the carpet.”Commenting on the ongoing consultation Sinn Féin MLA Alex Maskey said: “The problems regarding Victoria Housing are well known, I have spoken about these issues with residents and representatives of Victoria Housing both publicly and privately. These issues are of a hugely concerning nature to the tenants of Victoria Housing. We are talking about the core rights of tenants and the condition of their homes.“This is why this consultation is so vitally important and I would ask that every tenant feeds into this consultation because it is the very basis of the future of their homes. Please seek independent advice being offered by the Housing Rights service and by Supporting Communities and exhaust every question you have.“It is up to the residents to shape this consultation and I look forward to the results of the consultation and most importantly hearing solutions to the problems Victoria Housing residents face.”No-one from Victoria Housing Estates was available for comment."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"rising star alanna gives hope to those in distress","story":"A SPRING Ball is set to take place at the Devenish Complex with all proceeds raised from the night going towards the vital work of mental health awareness charities.‘Stand By Me’, the brainchild of local man Daniel McGinley, will take place on Friday, March  and will feature an array of vocal talent including the launch of ‘Hidden Hope’, the new album and single from rising Twinbrook talent Alanna Flynn.A songwriter since age of , Alanna told the Andersonstown News how music has always been an important part of her le and how songwriting helped her through her own struggles with mental health.“I have always wanted to make an album for charity and the reason why the proceeds raised from it and the single will go towards Suicide Awareness and Support Group is because I’ve struggled with my own mental health,” she told us. “I went through a really dark period of time, I know what’s it like to be in a dark place. Music has been my escape in a way and that has really helped me to where I am today.“Music and songwriting really helped me, I always found it hard to open up, talk about my feelings and emotions. I found that writing it down was a way to get how I was feeling off my chest.”Alanna said she hopes her music will go some way to helping people in distress amidst the suicide crisis in the city.“I would never want anyone to feel like they don’t have someone to talk to. The suicide rates just keep going up and up every year. Mental health, struggles with mental health, is a sickness, it’s a sickness you can’t see but it’s there.

This will obviously be kept under constant review.As has previously been stated, there will not be a sharp transition between containment and delay phases. Many of the actions taken during containment will still continue in any delay phase. Responses may y between dferent regions, depending on the circumstances.It comes as five new cases were identied last night in the Republic of Ireland bringing to  the number of confirmed cases in the country.The National Public Health Emergency Team announced the new cases.Among them is a female healthcare worker in the south of Ireland and her case is associated with a close contact with a confirmed case, the National Public Health Emergency Team announced. The other four cases are a male in the east of Ireland and a woman in the south whose cases are associated with travel from northern Italy a female in the west of Ireland whose case is associated with close contact with a confirmed case and a male in the south of the country whose case is associated with travel.Liam Woods, HSE director of acute operations, said: Healthcare workers are at the frontline of this virus outbreak. The Department of Health and the HSE are equally dedicated to protecting and supporting this vital group of people.Dr Ronan Glynn, Ireland#s deputy chief medical officer, said: The past number of weeks have been challenging for everyone in our healthcare system. This challenge is going escalate as the number of cases here rise.We must prioritise the protection of our frontline healthcare staff and as part of this the National Public Health Emergency Team has established a sub-group to identy and implement appropriate measures to protect them.More than  have now tested positive for coronavirus in the UK, in the largest day-on-day increase. In total,  people had tested positive for Covid- as of am on Friday, up from  cases reported at the same time on Thursday.On Thursday evening another patient, reported to be a woman in her s, became the first person in the UK to die after being diagnosed with Covid- while at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading. Last night, a man in his early s with underlying health issues became the second to die in the UK.Meanwhile, St Patrick#s Day events across Northern Ireland are still scheduled to go ahead as planned despite fears over the spread of the coronavirus.Organisers of the biggest event in Belfast and another major gathering in Armagh say that while they are watching the situation closely, there are currently no plans to call off the traditional March  celebrations.At present Belfast City Council has no plans to cancel its annual St Patrick Day celebrations, a Belfast City Council spokesperson said.We will continue to follow public health advice and will act in accordance with any advice received.Thousands of people from all around the world are expected to attend the city centre celebrations. An independently organised parade in Armagh is also scheduled to take place.Chairman of the city#s St Patrick#s Day Celebrations Committee, Stephen Fields said: It is expected to be a bigger and more colourful event than last year.Organisers are keeping a close eye on any possible developments in the coronavirus issue but as it stands currently the parade is still going ahead as planned. If public health officials# advice was to change we would certainly take this on board.The first two parade cancellations in Ireland were announced on Friday, with events in Cork called off due to public health concerns.But Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said yesterday that mass public gatherings such as St Patrick#s Day parades will not be cancelled amid the spread of Covid-.Speaking following a stakeholder meeting with health officials yesterday, he said: We are not recommending at this stage that any major events be cancelled but this of course will be kept under review.That was despite a warning from a top scientist at trinity College#s School of Biochemistry and Immunology.Professor Kingston Mills said: It#s still at the very early stages so I don#t think we need the measures that were required in China, but we do need to be a little more stringent.St Patrick#s Day, personally, I don#t think they should go ahead.I think that#s a mass gathering that involved a lot of people that will have come from outside Ireland. I think the risk is too big to go ahead and I think it#s time to make a hard decision.It came after more than  staff at Cork University Hospital were asked to self-isolate following the identication of a case of community transmission of the virus at the site. In another development, Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald announced she was cancelling plans to visit Washington DC next week for St Patrick#s events.

A timely reminder to keep a level head in the face of rising panic, the slogan has been circulating on social media for the last week or so, as the numbers of infections and deaths from Coronavirus continue, apparently inexorably, to climb and even the most phlegmatic amongst us struggle not to get carried away in a growing atmosphere of alarm.We are all, it#s fair to say, pretty concerned. But what about those of us who are already predisposed to excessive worry  Almost one in five people, for example, has an anxiety disorder. For those with mental health problems, hours of any ordinary day can be spent firefighting panic and dread. So how does a catastrophist keep perspective at a time when the threat is increasingly real  For as long as I can remember I#ve worried, sometimes to the point of obsession, about health. Both my own and the health of those I love. In  I did a course of cognitive behavioural therapy which helped me recognise that my habit of losing hours searching symptoms on Google and rushing to the doctor at the slightest ache or pain was only compounding the problem. It would be better to try to tune out health news updates and think about something  instead.In the context of a potential global pandemic, there#s a cognitive dissonance happening for people like me prone to a dysal level of hypervigilance about health. We try to remind ourselves that hypervigilance is irrational and dysal. Butever vigilance was required and appropriate, it#s now. The public health messages currently being circulated are insisting that the general public exercise unprecedented levels of caution, and world-renowned scientists are going on record to warn us to prepare for the worst-case scenario.The gravity of the situation as Covid- spreads around the world remains unclear. But wherever there is a public health crisis, mental health sequelae are sure to follow. In Hong Kong, one of the worst-affected regions globally, where much of the country is on lockdown, Reuters reported on an unprecedented number of mental health issues becoming apparent. There, where there has been recent social unrest and nightmare memories of the  SARS outbreak remain fresh, a recent survey suggested that as much as a third of the population have symptoms of PTSD and Samaritans Hong Kong have observed a sharp rise in the number of people seeking support. We are, or course, a long way from this scenario here, according to leading mental health expert Paul Fearon. In his view, with three cases confirmed in Northern Ireland and  cases in the Republic at the time of writing, coronavirus is not yet exacting a heavy toll on our mental health. But there a realistic chance it might. We have had previous epidemics which have gone pandemic, so we have some knowledge of things, he explains. We know that people with anxious personalities can become more anxious, understandably. We know that people with anxiety disorders, particularly people with obsessional compulsive disorder, can have an increase in symptoms. You can imagine somebody with OCD, who has a ritual about cleanliness and sanitation,they have a fear of contamination, that their symptoms - hand-washing, whatever it might be - will deteriorate. There#s some evidence that psychotic symptoms, symptoms associated with schizophrenia like delusions, can get worse. And, of course, insomnia and depression can get worse during these phases.Andthe worst happens and a contained threat evolves into a signicant outbreak, Fearon believes an awareness of the psychiatric sequelae, as well as the physical health toll, both for the survivors of the illness and for people who have to self-isolate, will be vital. We also know from the SARS outbreak that, in survivors of SARS, there was an increase in anxiety and depression, panic attacks, psychotic symptoms and even suicidality and delirium, he says. Andsignicant numbers of people are going to have to self-isolate for two weeks or more, there is one research from previous outbreaks about the effects of isolation... there is a whole broad range of psychological and psychiatric sequelae related to both the phase of containment, when people are fearful, and alsothere is an actual outbreak, that need to be taken on board and planned ahead for. He#s at pains to stress though, at the moment, the situation here appears to be contained and that much of the coverage of the issue on social media seems quite alarmist and anxiety-provoking. Part of the problem is our ever-connected way of le. We live in a world now where the availability of information both true and  is just so ever-present in our lives, and we have an expectation to be updated on things and have information at our fingertips, he says. In this context, information-seeking can easily become compulsive. One of the central features of anxiety disorders is an intolerance of uncertainty, and here we are presented with a situation which appears to be spreading worldwide, and where we don#t know everything that we#d like to know about it yet… we don#t know how it#s going to play out. In this context, he says the first most important thing,you are anxious about this, while everybody has concerns about it obviously, is to stick to a trusted source of information. He suggests referring only to the Department of Health website and seeking the single-most reliable source of information. It#s very tempting when you don#t find the answers you want to go to other websites or social media. However, he advises against that there is also an awful lot we can do when we feel helpless. For example, it#s important to focus on the basics by washing your hands and practising good respiratory hygiene.For anyone feeling heightened symptoms of anxiety, he suggests taking a moment to think, #I#m anxious, but is there anybody I know - family, relatives, friends - who might be feeling more anxious than I am # This he says can be a useful way of deflecting some of that anxiety and using it as an almost altruistic, community-spirited way to make sure that those around us are okay. It#s also a good way to avoid feeling isolated. Often when we get anxious about something or scared about something, we clam into ourselves and we let the thoughts escalate, whereaswe are actually talking to someone  who maybe shares similar anxieties or even has more exaggerated anxieties, it can often be a way of distracting yourself from your own anxieties, adds Fearon. Talking through those anxieties, eventhey are shared, is often a way of putting them into perspective.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We brought together the entire scientic team, mobilised as soon as we became aware and then got active, said Prof Duprex.Other teams are working on developing drugs, but vaccines are our game, said the scientist, who graduated from Queen#s University, Belfast, with a joint degree in biochemistry and genetics. He gained his PhD in virology and lectured for  years at the university before moving to the US.Moderna, a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotech company, announced yesterday that it plans to begin human trials on a potential vaccine it is developing using RNA coding.It means there is a vaccine candidate, a step forward, the vaccine research director said, but cautioned that mass doses of a vaccine likely will not be available for a year or more.Prof Duprex said Pittsburgh was chosen as one of the centres to be picked to begin work quickly because of its long history working with viruses. The university is also internationally renowned as the professional home of Jonas Salk, the creator of the polio vaccine.We have a high security containment laboratory where we are able to work with pathogens safely, he said, adding that the centre staff has worked on other high profile viruses, including SARS and MERS.The scientist explained his team first developed cells on which the virus could be grown into millions of particles. Animal-based models to carry out deep lung tests are then produced. While historically the development of vaccines was slow - sometimes taking years as in the case of polio - times have changed with a iety of dferent ways to generate them, the former Lurgan College student said.In the case of the coronavirus, the National Institutes of Healthand the Food and Drug Administration , the regulatory bodies charged with policing trials and reviewing drugs and vaccines, have indicated they will speed up the review process.But Prof Duprex noted that it takes six months for a normal flu vaccine to be developed, tested, reviewed and be available in sufficient amounts to meet demand.We have to be realistic because when you say a vaccine is in development people have to understand what that actually means. It is potentially months, a year, more than a year, probably.The university staff are actively working with other scientists across the globe and co-coordinating with the World Health Organisation .No one#s ego is more important than the public health and we need to be collaborative, Prof Duprex said. There is a sharing of data which is not typical within the world wide scientic community, but it is critical that we are good partners.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

A security source said police officers have been standing guard at the station since early February.The Belfasthas chosen not to identy the location of the station but has observed officers carrying out foot patrols in its vicinity.Officers have also been placed at the station#s main entrances as a precaution.The source revealed that the PSNI fears the possible attack may occur during the daytime in an attempt by dissidents to catch officers off-guard.The source went into detail on how the security services believe the attack would most likely be airborne, and probably an improvised mortar device.The PSNI has declined to respond, stating it does comment on operational matters.The latest incident carried out by dissidents took place last December when a suspected grenade was thrown at a police car in west Belfast.It follows a -month period of increasing activity from dissidents. Last September a bomb - described as being in the advanced state of readiness - was made safe by ammunition technical officers after it was found in the Creggan area of Londonderry.A similar attack took place two days earlier which resulted in the PSNI making safe a mortar bomb that had been left close to a police station in Strabane.Last August dissidents used a hoax device to lure police officers and soldiers to a remote rural location at Wattlebridge near the border in Co Fermanagh and then exploded the real bomb.Chief Constable Simon Byrne later laid the blame on Continuity IRA terrorists for the potentially lethal incident.The previous month dissidents tried to murder police officers during an attack in Craigavon, Co Armagh, with a device discovered on Tullygally Road.In July  the New IRA claimed responsibility for a bomb placed under a police officer#s car at Shandon Park Golf Club in east Belfast.The PSNI later released a statement which placed the blame on violent dissident republicans.The latest PSNI security bulletin has revealed there has been an increase in the number of shooting incidents, bombing incidents and paramilitary-style attacks between March  and last month.It also recorded one security-related death - the murder of journalist Lyra McKee, who was killed by a bullet fired by dissidents during rioting in the Creggan in Derry.Also in March dissidents posted five explosive devices posted to locations across the UK, including one sent to Glasgow UniversityMark Lindsay, chair of the Police Federation of Northern Ireland, said yesterday that while he would not comment on the police station threat, any attempt by dissidents to launch an attack is to be roundly condemned. We need an all-out effort by society to isolate such extremism and help the PSNI bring these people before the courts, he said. Officers are resolute in their determination to serve society and it is intolerable that in  we still have to deal with such threats to our police officers.

We must see a radical change in the direction of travel of inspections.I detailed this in a previous policy paper #Reducing the Burden# and how I would like to see inspections reformed.Mr Weir said the culture of inspections had to change, based around three key principles. He added: We need to see a higher trust in the professionalism of teachers and to allow teachers to deliver, and, accompanying with that, a light touch regime when it comes to what monitoring needs to happen. Secondly, we need to reach a point where there is no additional data to be produced, by schools, ahead of any inspection. We should trust teachers as experts in their fields and not just data providers. The best schools are schools which start from the point of self-evaluating.Thirdly, there must be a change in the approach and in relationships. We need to sht away from the current model to an educational improvement service based around collaboration, based around supporting schools, based around mutual respect and generating two way discussions.INTO#s Northern secretary Gerry Murphy said teachers finally have something to look forward to. The round of applause and standing ovation said it all, he said. The burden they have had to put up with, by carrying out a regime which generates so much stress and pressure on top of their already pressured jobs, is unwarranted, unnecessary and unfair.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadBBC#s Stephen Nolan lost #a lot of money# in Flybe takeover DUP condemn threat against Northern Ireland Assembly Speaker Alex MaskeyMourners told of cleric#s courage in the face of #unendurable# illness Evangelical Orangeman Ian Kennedy, who died in collision, laid to restNorthern Ireland medic called in to assist with No #s coronavirus response,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Almost  million boxes are distributed across Ireland, north and south, each year. www.trocaire.org lentThe appeal this year will help to support women around the world who are struggling to protect their families from intimidation, violence, hunger and drought. As part of the appeal Troacutecaire has launched a report that reveals how woman are disproportionately impacted by climate change and corporate human rights violations throughout the world.The charitys Northern Ireland chief, Siobhan Hanley, said: “‘Women Taking the Lead: Defending Human Rights and the Environment’ details the experiences of courageous women, many of whom are engaged in defending their communities against the effects of corporate greed and the devastating environmental impact of climate change. By contributing to our Lenten Appeal, people in Co Derry will be providing vital aid, care and support to these brave women.”Bertita Zuacutentildeiga Caacuteceres, leader of the Civic Council of Popular and Indigenous Organisations of Honduras– an organisation supported by Troacutecaire – attended the launch of the report.Bertita’s mother, Berta Caacuteceres, an internationally renowned activist and winner of the environmental Goldman Prize, was shot dead in  after a long battle to stop construction of an internationally financed hydroelectric dam on the Gualcarque river, which the indigenous Lenca people consider sacred.Bertita was present to speak about her own experience of violence inflicted on female human rights defenders and the indigenous community’s long struggle to defend their land from corporate abuse.While she continues the work of her mother, Bertita is being supported by Troacutecaire in seeking justice to ensure that all those responsible for the murder – the company executives and state officials identied during the resulting trial – are prosecuted.“Around the world, women face huge risks in standing up for their rights in the face of injustice perpetrated by big business taking advantage of vulnerable communities. The threat of assault and murder is a daily reality for many of these women, who are fighting for their families to live better lives,” said Siobhan Hanley.“Women are also disproportionately affected by poverty, which is made worse by the effects of climate change on some of the world’s poorest people. Developing countries carry about % of the cost of the climate crisis, but the poorest populations are responsible for just % of global carbon emissions.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A spokesperson for JPM Contracts said they were honoured to be part of the team which has restored the castle to its former glory.“It is not every day you get to be involved working in a medieval castle, especially of such high signicance,” the spokesperson said.“The work started in March  to replace the existing flat roof which has been in place for the past  years. The new roof is keeping with the late-medieval architecture of the Castle.“It has made from Irish Oak used ‘green’ and oak-pegged without the use of nails or metal fixings.Storm Ophelia“The Irish Oak was sourced from oak trees which came down in Wicklow during Storm Ophelia in October .“The new roof is a series of open trusses and rafters carrying oak boards.“Externally the roof is finished in Cumbrian stone slates and lead.“The external appearance of the Castle does not look signicantly dferent from ground level as the roof is behind the battlements.“However, internally, the Great Hall at the top of the Tower has been transformed into a higher, brighter and more historically resonant space.”Minister for Communities Deirdre Hargey said: “This investment has secured the future of this important monument and prevented irreparable damage to the structure.“Archaeologists and conservation architects within the department worked together to design a historically appropriate roof,” said the Minister.“What has been achieved is an outstanding piece of architecture that safeguards this important and historic place.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Aoe Clarke, from Ballykelly, is an Engagement Ambassador for VOYPIC and told the County Derry Post that the evening was a great success.She said: “We had a few children singing the Bare Necessities and they had the whole crowd going.“It’s a  to highlight and show appreciation for the talents of these young people that might get bypassed in other areas.“It gives them a chance to stand on that stage and show who they are. One young boy performed his own rap at the event.“It was about being in care, his le at home and his feelings and emotions towards his social workers. Everyone in the room could relate to it.”The -year-old credits the organisation with a great deal of her own success.She said: “I became known to the organisation when I was about   and without them, I don’t think I would be where I am today.“I grew up care experienced and lived on the edge of care my whole le but at , I was made homeless. I lived in Jefferson’s Court on Shipquay Street.“That’s when I became known to VOYPIC, because I wasn’t getting what I was actually entitled to. If you are classied as a LAC, you are provided accommodation by social services.“I wasn’t. I was completely overlooked.”VOYPIC plays a crucial role in making sure that young people in care have access to the support and information they need to make informed decisions about their lives.With offices in Derry, Belfast, Ballymena and Lurgan, another aspect of the charity’s work is filling gaps in the information available to young people in and on the edge of care.Aoe says it is easy for some young people to slip through the cracks.“A lot of young people living on the edge of care can easily fly under the radar and I don’t think information is publicised enough for them to know what they’re entitled to.“I had a really bad experience with the teachers in secondary school because they just didn’t get it at all. It’s hard to expect people to get itthey’ve never received any training.”Aoe is currently in her final year of a psychology degree at Ulster University in Coleraine and, in her role with VOYPIC, is determined to make a dference to those currently re-living her experience.“I’m doing my dissertation on educational pathways to rd level education, specically for care leavers.“A lot of the students I’ve interviewed indicated they weren’t aware of the support available to them – we want to change that.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Clare grew up in Derrys Brandywell and was a popular and outgoing girl who and dreamed of being famous. googletag.cmd.push By her late teens, she had secured an agent and was on the verge a successful acting career, but like many girls her age she spent her weekends drinking in pubs and clubs. She wasnt a bit religious growing up, her sister, Shauna Gill, remembered. We used to dob mass and Clare and my sister, Megan, would go and buy fags and theyd buy me a Taz bar to shut my mouth, she smiled. Clare made her acting debut in Sunday Paul Greengrasss film about Bloody Sunday. She had also landed a gig presenting a youth show on Channel  and had been approached by Nickelodeon about further presenting roles. googletag.cmd.push In the year , Clares friend had to drop out of a trip to Spain and she was asked to go in her place. It was only after her name was on the ticket that Clare realised it was a Retreat, organised by the religious order the Home of the Mother. She thought she was going to Ibiza for a free trip away, laughed Shauna. Clare would later describe how she spent the first few days of the trip smoking and sunbathing, but on Good Friday she experienced something that was to change her le. The group attended a Good Friday service and the congregation were asked to kiss the Crucix. When Clares turn came, she had an overwhelming feeling that Jesus loved her and had died for her. She later told people that her sins had nailed him to the cross. She kissed the cross and it was her le. That was it, said Shauna. Clare ed to Derry as a very dferent girl, but it took her another year to answer Gods call to become a nun. She tried to fight it, said Shauna. If our father was giving her a lt to the Bound for Boston bar she would say dont drive past the Long Tower chapel because God used to stand at the gate calling to her. On one of her many nights out Clare had too much to drink and went into a toilet cubicle to be sick. She had a strong sense that someone was watching her and then heard Gods voice in her head saying why do you keep hurting me  Clare said she felt that she was nailing Jesus to the cross once again, and in that moment she decided she should devote her le to him.  She told her family she was moving to Spain to be a nun with the Servant Sisters of the Home of the Mother who she had met on the Retreat. We were shocked, admitted Shauna. She was the most dramatic, outgoing person you could ever meet in your le. I think the priests thought she was a big eejit at the start. But Clare had always been her own person and was determined not to let anything stand in her way. She didnt care what anyone  said, Shauna recalled. She had never cared what anyone thought of her. She used to wear horrible clothes, well to me they were horrible. Clare was stunning, but she didnt care what she looked like. She would just run her fingers through her hair and go out the door. Heartbroken at their daughters decision to start a new le so far from home, the Crocketts hoped she would be back after a few weeks, but Clare surprised everybody by fully embracing her new way of le. That was her le and there was no talking to her, said Shauna. We still sit and say did that really happen, did she really go away and become a nun  but she was so happy and she never complained. She made a dference to so many peoples lives. Clares determination to become a nun never wavered. She later said God told her I will be your mother, your father, your language, your country. After taking her first vows on February ,  she took the religious name Sister Clare Maria of the Trinity and the Heart of Mary. She went on to take her perpetual vows on September ,  and served the Servant Sisters of the House of the Mother in Belmonte and Valencia in Spain, Jacksonville in America and Guayaquil and Playa Prieta in Ecuador. Clares magnetic personality and gt for music and song helped her connect with people and she had a special affinity with children. Carmelite priest, Fr Stephen Quinn, who celebrates a Mass in memory of Sister Clare every month, said her extraordinary story blew him away. He first heard about Sr Clares story when he watched All or Nothing:Sr Clare Crockett the film made by the House Of The Mother Order about her le. The film shows footage of Clare during her  years with the Order and charts her le from her first Retreat until just days before her death. To witness someone of little or no faith experience Christ in such a radical way and who lived her le in such a radical way is amazing. She fitted more into her  years than most of us ever will. Its not just the attributed miracles. You have to look at who this girl was and the le she came from and how she became a nun. When you see nuns these days they are old women in their s and s, but this is a girl who gave her whole le to God and that is the greatest miracle of all. Towards the end of her le Clare started suffering from severe migraines that made her physically sick. It emerged after her death she was suffering from a bleed to her brain, but she had continued to work as hard as ever telling her Sisters that she wrote a blank cheque to God every day. Every time you saw her she had a guitar in her hand and she was singing and she had a whole tribe of wains behind her, Shauna recalled. Just days before she passed away Sister Clare told her fellow nuns that she knew she was going to die young and even suggested she might die at  like Jesus had. On April , , Sister Clare was crushed to death in the stairwell of her school in Playa Prieta in Ecuador as she attempted to guide five girls to safety during an earthquake. She was -years-old. When her body was discovered she was carrying a piece of her guitar in her hand.  Her mum, Margaret, who passed away on lSeptember  last year at  from vascular dementia, never got over her daughters death. She cried a wile lot, said Shauna. Shed say why did our Clare leave me  but shes doing more now that she has died than she could ever have done alive. It makes the grieving easier. She is doing so much for people. After Clare died she was brought back to Derry and laid to rest at the City Cemetery where her grave has become a place of pilgrimage for visitors from around the world. We were overwhelmed, said Shauna. Shes just not another person who died, people have kept her legacy and her name going. Theres a wee man who comes from Toome every fortnight with flowers from Marks  Spencer and goes to her grave. Thats her effect everywhere you go. People are just devoted to her. A prayer group which asks Sister Clare to intercede for them meets weekly in Derry. We have a packed room every time and people get a great feeling, said Shauna. Several miracles have been attributed to Sister Clare, including the birth of twins to an infertile couple and the recovery of a young boy on le support whose parents had been told he would die. So what would Sister Clare make of calls for her to be made a saint  She would love it, smiled Shauna. She went from only ever wanting to be famous and live a le of luxury to giving everything up. But she made the right choice. She said Im going to be famous. Im going to be a famous nun. The Mass in memory of Sister Clare takes place on the second Sunday of every month in Termonbacca at pm.Her anniversary Mass will take place on Sunday, April , in Termonbacca. The Sister Clare Novena prayer group meets every Monday at the Search youth group premises in the Iona Business Parkat .pm.

The delay followed a frantic period of negotiation as Peter attempted to ensure he got his passengers back to Belfast. He told Derry Now: “It was the last of four flights I had done yesterday. “It was quite subdued because most of the passengers were on social media and already had heard rumours and ious bits and pieces, which I hadn’t heard myself. googletag.cmd.push “When you’re flying, it’s all-consuming. You don’t have time to be looking at social media – there’s a job to be done. “For two hours, I was constantly on the phone back and forth to the ious authorities. “I was hopeful and then some of the guys at the airport dashed that, saying they were impounding the plane. But I stayed focused and we eventually got the news we wanted.” At the time, Peter was unaware of the flight’s signicance as Flybe’s last, but he took time today to reflect on the impact the airline has had, particularly on Belfast City Airport. googletag.cmd.push He said: “It’s a letime for me – I’ve been there  years. It’s more of a family than just a job. “It will be a massive blow. I know a lot of the staff at the airport and watched it grow from a couple of tin shacks to what it is today. “It’s a lovely wee compact airport and it’s modern but it was Nissen huts in  when I started. At the centre of the south Derry man’s thinking was passenger welfare, so much so that the plane was further delayed to allow a group of workers coming from Aberdeen to board. “We were all ready to go and we got a call saying Aberdeen was inbound with seven guys from the rigs. “Those guys were depending on us to get home, so we waited and got them on board. A lot of people were relying on Flybe to get to and from their jobs.” Peter admits it is a concerning time for all staff at the airline and revealed that getting any form of payment from the company could be dficult. He said: “We won’t get any form of payment from the company because it’s gone into administration. Any pay that’s owed, we won’t get that. “Maybe down the line there will be some form of payment, but there’s nothing we can use to pay our bills.” The pilot, who flies hot air balloons in his spare time, has planned to get the staff together at a later stage to try and keep spirits up, but in the meantime has received a unique job offer. “On a positive note, a friend rang me to tell me he needed a shepherd to look after his sheep on the Glenshane and askedI was available. “I said ‘sure, I’ll take anything!’. That’s my first job offer and it’s not even  hours yet.” “I’m glad we stayed with the process and got everyone back home. At least that’s some consolation.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ryan McGeough was coached by Gregg at Portstewart FC for three or four years as a teenager. “My mum texted me about his death and I couldnt believe it,” McGeough said. “I hadnt seen him in a few years and I would have loved to run into him and have a yarn but unfortunately I never got the chance.” Gregg, who was voted as the best goalkeeper of the  World Cup, a native of Tobermore, passed away at the age of  and aside from his talents between the posts he was most famous in football circles for his heroics during the Munich air disaster in February  which claimed the lives of  people. googletag.cmd.push Harry pulled some of his team-mates from the burning plane, after disaster struck on theirjourney from a European Cup victory over Red Star Belgrade. Among those he saved were Bobby Charlton, Jackie Blanchflower and manager Sir Matt Busby. Harry played  games but was a larger than le presence. Anybody who ever had a conversation with Harry would have remembered it,” stated Irish FA Chief Executive Patrick Nelson in a statement to the County Derry Post. Gregg started his club career with Windsor Park Swts, the reserve team of Linfield, before signing for his local club Coleraine. At the age of  he earned a move to Second Division side Doncaster Rovers before switching to Manchester United for pound,, which was a world record fee for a goalkeeper at the time and made  appearances for the Red Devils. googletag.cmd.push He entered management and became manager of Shrewsbury Town, before taking charge of Swansea City, Crewe Alexandra and Carlisle United. Gregg also had a spell as goalkeeping coach at Manchester United and as assistant manager at Swindon Town. Harry was appointed an MBE by The Queen in  for services to football, and was then made an OBE in , also for services to football. Each week the Harry Gregg Foundation facilitates a wide range of activities for thousands of people in the Coleraine area and beyond through participation in football and ious other activities. Sir Alex Ferguson, who took his United team to play in Harrys testimonial in Belfast in , paid a tribute on Manchester Uniteds Official Website. “Harry was a man of great character and a true legend at our club. I remember that he was always very excited and proud to host our youth team at his boarding house for the Milk Cup every summer, so he could recount the tales of his playing days. I loved his company and the many pieces of advice he gave me.” While back in Ireland, Gregg bought the Windsor Hotel in Portstewart and began coaching the local soccer team. One player who remembers him fondly was goalkeeper Ryan McGeough who would go on to win two Derry championship medals with Coleraine GAA team. GREGG THE COACH “He was thecoach but as a goalkeeper you got a lot more attention from him than everybody. He was the first goalkeeper coach I ever came across that made the goalkeepers train with the outfielders. “Ray Woods was an England capped goalkeeper whenUnited won the league in   and they bought Harry for a record fee. “Harry said to me the only reason why they bought him was that Woods was a linie,” recalls McGeough, referring to Woods reluctance to leave his six-yard box. “Harry was the first goalkeeper to sweep outside his box and cover for defenders. He would always have had you out in the box organising your defenders.” McGeough soon learned Greggs approach to goalkeeping during one of those coaching sessions with Portstewart. “Peter Schmeichel was my hero and having played European handball, he brought in the spreading himself”, McGeough continues, explaining the Danes trademark star-jump, making himself as imposing as possible. Harry Gregg didnt agree and stopped his young proteacutegeacute advancing a la Schmeichel during training.   It was by far and away the best coaching I have ever had. Ryan McGeough  “He dropped the ball and said you, e on it and you , challenge him. If you do the spread again, you will do this all night. In Harrys era, you ed and took the ball and man. “It was by far and away the best coaching I have ever had. I havent spread myself since in case Harry was watching,” laughs the affable McGeough. “He would have taken it as serious coaching a  year old as a senior.” “He taught you how to manipulate forwards on a one on one and force the forward to make the first move. What he was teaching was far and beyond seen before. “If another manager, who is not a goalkeeper, says something to you, you could question it butHarry said something to you - you just did it. “Wed sit around the changing room listening to him for an hour and a half after training. Hed be telling us stories about Best, Charlton and Busby. When you are a big Man Utd head, you are in dreamland listening to him.” McGeough speaks of how goalkeeping has changed and in the era of televised games too much of the routines being similar. “In Harrys day there were so many dferent styles and I would prefer to play the way Harry played.” READ ALSO - He was larger than le on the pitch.

Maiden Citys front  however was trying to break down a sturdy Ballymoney rearguard all afternoon with wave after wave of attacks from the outset.First to test the keeper on  minutes was Garbhan Feeney who cut in from the left and drove a fierce shot that the Ballymoney shot stopper was equal to.Bobby Sweeney always looking to get on the ball to make things happen for City was the driving force in midfield feeding the over lapping full backs Feeney and Moore but with the wind really swirling about now it was hard for any player to judge were the ball was going to fall.Peter Tracey was next to break up an attempted counter attack from Ballymoney on  minutes he played in Harrigan whos drive was always raising over the bar. googletag.cmd.push HT - City now playing with the wind in the second half immediately took the lead after the restart.Mark Toland with great work down the right beat  defenders and put a pinpoint cross onto the foot of Shae Feeney who made no mistake from  yards.From this point it looked like it was only a matter of time until Maiden City scored again only for Ballymoney to equalise with their only meaningful attack of the game. A long ball and a bit of pinball in the box allowed Taggart to lash the loose ball past Farrell to make it -.Grimley and Melaugh were mere spectators as the City onslaught on the Ballymoney goal was intensying. With  minutes remaining Sean Harrigan fired a low shot towards the backpost which the keeper parried into the path of substitute Dylan McGavigan who finished with a plum only for the referee to adjudge McGavigan was offside.Indeed it was the lively McGavigan again who in the final minute skipped past the Ballymoney full back who appeared to trip him inside the box only for the referee to point for a goal kick and not to the penalty spot to the dismay of City players. googletag.cmd.push TeamsOisin Farrell, Conor Moore, Cahir Grimley, Cahir Melaugh, Ruadhan Feeney, Peter Tracey, Bobby Sweeney, Garbhan Feeney, Shae Feeney, Mark Toland, Sean Harrigan.Subs- Keiran Kelpie, Calum Murphy, Dylan McGavigan, Sevan Albay, Ethan Doherty  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Candystripes have failed to win at the RSC since , and they didn’t look likely of ending that run as they were second best for the majority of this game in what a disappointing showing from Declan Devine’s team. It was all Waterford in the first  minutes but Derry City could well have taken the lead out of the blue when Walter Figueira bamboozled Tyrkee Wilson with a superb piece of skill to break into the area, before driving a shot across goal which beat Brian Murphy but just passed the post of the Waterford goalkeeper. googletag.cmd.push At the other end Michael O’Connor as causing the City defence all sorts of problems and he did well to evade Eoin Toal on the half hour before firing in a wicked shot which Peter Cherrie did well to hold. The home side were stunned just past the half hour though when Colm Horgan won a free kick and with the hosts reacting too slowly, Derry took the kick quickly and Mallon raced into the area and caught Murphy out with a fine finish to give City the lead. The home side took a while to respond but they hit back just before half time when Derry failed to clear from a corner kick and Cummins set up Sam Bone on the edge of the area and he fired an unstoppable and brilliant shot past Cherrie and into the top corner to bring the home side level. googletag.cmd.push Waterford started the second half as they started the first and took the game to Derry, coming close when John Martin twisted and turned in the box but shot straight at Cherrie. The home side kept pushing and they came close again when Coote dummied a free kick  yards from goal and O’Connor curled a brilliant effort towards goal only for Cherrie to get two hands to the ball to push it behind for a corner. Waterford looked more likely in the remainder of the game and they won it deep into added time when Shane Grfin lashed the ball into the net to send the Candystripes crashing to a deserved defeat.

Both acts put on lively performances that were thoroughly enjoyed by the packed crowd, but Cumann Pheadar Naofa impressed the judges most with their eight-hand reel and were crowned champions.Next up was solo the singing and the standards were outstandingly high. Ardglass, Mayobridge , Mayobridgeand Saul were all represented in the category and from an audience point of view it would seem an impossible job for the judges to separate the performances.They did manage it though and Mayobridgersquos Eimear Magee took the title with a beautul performance of Orphan Girl.The recitation category followed and the audience was treated to four heartfelt performances from Attical, Saul, Darragh Cross and Rostrevor.Clare McCartan of Attical recited an extract from Frank McCourtrsquos Angelarsquos Ashes lsquoMy First Holy Communionrsquo and the performance filled the audience with both laughter and nostalgia, which resulted in Clare being declared champion.The audience were treated to four wonderful ballad performances from Ballymartin, Bryansford, Saul and Mayobridge.Every performance was flawless and the talent on stage was outstanding, but it was the experienced Saul group who were awarded first placen with two wonderful performances mdash Leaving The Blaskett Islands and Homeland.Before the interval Cumman Pheadar Naofa performed a set dance. Although they were the only performers in the category, they didnrsquot allow the standards to slip and their performance was enjoyed by all.After the interval, Drumaness, Attical, Clann Na Bann and Bryansford had the audience laughing and giggling with their novelty acts.There were male nuns on the run, an Irish wake with a dference and a club struggling to form a Scoacuter quiz team, but it was Bryansfordrsquos performance of lsquoThe Passport Officersquo that won the title after showing the audience what le is like in an Irish passport office and what it takes to prove your Irishness.The final category of the night was the instrumental music. Clann Na Banna, Attical, Cumann Pheadar Naofa and Mayobridge all competed and ended the show with a high.Cumann Pheadar Naofa stole the show with beautul performances of The Maid at the Spinning Wheel, Andersonrsquos Reel and The New Mown Meadows.The standard of performances at Scoacuter Sinsir this year has been exceptional and is a testimony to the vast amount of talented performers within Down and the time and dedication put in by GAA clubs at promoting and nurturing culture within the county.Another massive thank you must go out to all the volunteers who help make Scoacuter possible, from setting up the stage and sound, adjudicating, judging, doing Fir Ban Na Ti, providing hospitality, selling tickets, doing the door and so on.Finally, well done to all performers and good luck to all those who will compete in the Ulster Scoacuter semi-final in Glenullin next week..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 Building.jpg","title":"Building work begins on ‘eyesore’ car park  ","story":"WORK has started on a new car park at the former Down Council headquarters in Downpatrick.A contractor is currently on site at the Strangford Road working on an area to the side and front of the remains of the townrsquos historic workhouse.The site of the former local authority base was being used as an unofficial parking area for bin lorries and other refuse vehicles, but late last year planning permission was secured to formally designate the area as a car park for both council vehicles and staff cars.Concerned residents who live nearby had expressed opposition to the move, describing the unofficial parking area in front of the old workhouse as an ldquoeyesore and highlighting the noise created by heavy refuse vehicles starting up in the morning.Council officials have sold part of the existing Strangford Road site to the Education Authority to pave the way for the development of Down Highrsquos new multi-million pound campus.Part of a main car park adjacent to the Orchard Way housing development will be used to form the main entrance to the proposed new grammar school campus.In papers submitted ahead of a planning meeting when formal approval for the new car park was granted, it was revealed that  homeowners who live close to the Strangford Road site were informed about the car park proposal, with some expressing concern about the impact it will have on property values.Concern was also raised about vehicle engines starting as early as .am, particularly at weekends, with those opposed to the planning application insisting that commercial vehicles should not be parked close to residential properties.Outlining their reasons for recommending that the planning application should be approved, planners admitted that the car park plan would impact on the remains of the former workhouse which is of special architectural and historic importance.But they confirmed that the Department of Communities Historic Environment Division accepted the parking plan in principle.In addition, government officials described the existing site used for parking as ldquowell established with the planning application seeking to formalise the arrangement with staff parking to the front and small vans parked at the side.The planning papers added: ldquoThe works proposed will aim to upgrade the existing frontage and use hardstanding to provide a more formalised parking arrangement.Planners say the existing land is to be regraded and resurfaced with low walls and have confirmed that external lighting also forms part of the proposal, with the current entrance set to be widened and new gates installed. Hedge planting is also proposed to help screen some of the activities to the rear of the site.The formal planning approval paves the way for council officials to relocate existing staff parking to the site of the formerly demolished council administrative building and use the other side of the car park for some additional fleet vehicle parking, with designated parking spaces marked and circulation routes displayed through the site.As part of the sale of council land to the Education Authority, there will be a two-hour daily traffic restriction over the use of the existing main fleet access to the site for local authority vehicles.Council vehicles will not be permitted to use the entrance between .am and .am and between .pm and .pm when the new school is constructed and opens for business..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 Classy.jpg","title":"Classy Oisin helps Down into league showdown  ","story":"DOWN earned a well-deserved two points in Liatroim on Sunday afternoon and all but secured a place in the isional final.A mid-week change of venue to Liatroim meant this encounter was played on a pristine surface, ensuring a thrilling encounter, which Roacutenaacuten Sheehan said was a massive contributing factor to today win.ldquoIrsquod like to thank all in the Liatroim club, to take the game at such short notice was a credit to them. The facilities and the carpet like surface of Fontenoy Park was a massive boost for us today, and suited our fast-open style of play.Kildare knew that a nothing less than a win would be good enough and despite playing into the wind, were quickest out of the blocks, opening up a - to - lead in the opening quarter with Jack Sheridan and Brian Byrne frees punishing Down indiscretions.A fourth minute Chris Egan point being Downrsquos only score from play in the first quarter.Sheehan got his match-ups spot on, as Caolan Taggart and John McManus put the shackles on Kildarersquos James Burke and Sheridan to minimise any threat on goal.Down created lots of scoring opportunities in the first half, but just couldnrsquot convert them, whilst Danny Toner and midfielder Pearse Oacuteg McCrickard got through a trojan amount of work around the middle of the park to keep the pressure on the Lilywhites.Down hit a period of ascendancy inside the final five minutes of the half, trailing - to -, Danny Toner struck over from  metres on  minutes and after MacManus pointed from outside the  metre line, Ronan Costello broke free from the attentions of Rian Boran in added time to fire over the bar, when a goal could so easily have resulted.MacManus, playing on home soil, opened the scoring seconds into the restart, firing over from  metres, before adding a free a minute later,much to the pleasure of the local home support.Kildare nosed out in front again, only to see the first of three second half Conor Woods monster frees from deep inside the Down half and a Matt Conlon score, tie matters for the third time. McCrickard sent over a wondrous  metre side line for the lead score.But disaster struck minutes when Shane Ryan rounded Mark Patterson and his shot flew past Stephen Keith, Kildare were up by one.The game was finely balanced as Egan levelled for the hosts once more and with Kildare having a game in hand over Down and the dayrsquos prize a league final spot in two weeks, Paul Divilly scored Kildarersquos final point, but Down pushed for the line and got the last four scores, two MacManus frees and two more long distance strikes from the impressive Conor Woods.Roacutenaacuten Sheehan was impressed with his sides work rate: ldquoWe were slow to settle in the first  minutes, given this was the biggest test wersquove had since the Derry game, he said.ldquoEoghan Sands led up front, and although we missed two to three goal chances, we kept our composure in the tackle and kept plugging away, once more Danny Toner had a brilliant game and with the experience of Caolan Taggart and Darragh Mallon in defence, Kildare were going to have out work us for every score.Down: S Keith, M Patterson, J McManus, D Mallon, C Taggart, C Woods , G Hughes, M Conlon , P Oacuteg McCrickard , R Costello , R McCusker, D Toner , O MacManus , E Sands, C Egan .

Itrsquos the least we can do in his memory to promote his brainchild. Irsquom certain we could get the backing of everyonepermission is granted.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Down Council chairman, Mr Eddie McVeigh, has renewed his plea to local planners to help the Housing Executive rind sites for housing development in Ballynahinch.Mr McVeigh said the Executive were anxious to build in Ballynahinch, but they had been repeatedly thwarted because they had been unable to find sites which met with the plannersrsquo approval.Mr McVeigh was speaking after planners turned down an application from the Executive to build on the Magheraknock Road. The application was refused because the planners considered the site was outside the area considered suitable for residential development.The planners consider there is sufficient land available for residential development in Ballynahinch. This is the comment which constantly annoys Mr McVeigh.DOWNPATRICK mdash Controversy over road proposals for Downpatrick town centre can be settled by compromise, according to the local chamber of trade.Traders are strongly opposed to DoE Roads Service recommendations for a through road which were published in the Recorder last month.They dislike the thought of a main road with high retaining walls cutting the town in two and are keen to meet officials in the hope that agreement can be reached.Mr Jim Cassidy, newly elected chairman of Downpatrick Chamber of Trade, is quietly confident that the designersrsquo commendable ideas can be better merged with local needs as the business people and residents see them.ldquoThere is considerable opposition for very valid reasons to the plan, he said. ldquoWe believe that the town centre should not be carved up by a road crossing Scotch Street, Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue.ldquoThe feeling among members is that a major traffic route should by-pass Down Cathedral and join the Newcastle Road. Without doubt, the traffic load in the town must be eased.ldquoOurs is not a modern town, but has character that should not be destroyed in an attempt to modernise everything.KILLYLEAGH mdash Killyleagh Town Committee is to throw its full weight behind an anti-litter campaign.The committee are considering launching a special design scheme for three schools in the town and are investigating the possibility of mapping out a programme to make local people more aware of the litter problem.The schoolsrsquo competition is an exciting idea aimed at getting pupils in the local high school and two primary schools to design a clean-up scheme, with prizes for the winners.

Any fair minded assessment of its local track record over the last decade would be damning to say the least.ldquoRecords suggest that Invest NI has only hosted one potential investor in the local area in  years. That is an astonishing failure and an indictment on an organisation that appears to suffer nose bleeds once it moves beyond the Belfast area.ldquoIndeed, Invest NIrsquos focus appears to have been solely directed at throwing cash incentives at investors to locate in Belfast at the expense of incubating local small and medium enterprises in areas like South Down.Mr Hazzard claimed that South Down has been one of the worst performing areas in terms of Invest NI assistance, despite the fact that the organisation has  acres of land holdings in the area mdash the biggest in the province.The MP added: ldquoI will be meeting with the new Invest NI chief executive in the weeks ahead to impress upon him the the importance of creating a regionally balanced economy and developing a much more ambitious vision for creating and supporting economic opportunities in South Down.Ms Rogan said the fact that no one from Invest NI had met with potential investors in the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area for such a long time was ldquounacceptable, suggesting that this was ldquoreminiscent of decades of discrimination and neglect of the area by British and unionist governments.Ms Rogan confirmed that she has written to the economy minister to ask why Invest NI hosted no potential investors in South Down for such a long period and asked what she intends to do to address the ldquoserious imbalance compared to all other constituencies.A spokeswoman for Invest NI said the organisation and Northern Irelandrsquos  councils were actively working in partnership to help grow investment and the economy in every part of the province.She said that investment comes in many forms and a set of figures about the number of inward visits is not reflective of the work that is going on.ldquoOver the past years, we have offered over poundm of support to businesses across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area, including  externally owned companies. This support has helped secure almost poundm of investment and is helping companies to create , jobs, the spokeswoman continued.ldquoIn direct response to Mr Hazzardrsquos comment that our focus is solely directed at investors in Belfast, in the last five years nearly % of investors chose to locate their project outside of Belfast and nearly % of Invest NIrsquos offers are to companies outside of Belfast.The spokeswoman said it was solely a companyrsquos decision on where it wished to visit and locate, based on its business needs.She added: ldquoThe vast majority of visit programmes start in Belfast before going to other locations or, in some cases, the investor has no time to visit specic locations so are hosted at our headquarters in Belfast which is why the Belfast figures are high.ldquoSteering an investor to locate in any one area that does not meet their requirements would be both counterproductive and damaging to Northern Irelandrsquos investment reputation..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 Late RUGBY.jpg","title":"Late Lansdowne try leaves ‘Hinch in relegation spot  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH suffered heartbreak on Saturday in their battle to avoid relegation from the ultra competitive AIL Division A as their Dublin opponents stole the result at the death, despite a much-improved Ballynahinch performance.The articial surface at Aviva Stadiumrsquos back pitch was the venue and the large travelling support braved Storm Jorge to roar their men on.It looked like turning into a famous victory until powerful Leinster Academy hooker Dan Sheehan drove over in the dying moments of a hard-fought match to seal victory for the home side and avenge their seven try thumping at Ballymacarn Park in November.Brian McLaughlin had made a few changes to his starting back line with Aaron Cairns moving into scrum half and Greg Hutley earning his first AIL start at out half. Ryan Wilson ed at inside centre and Conor Rankin came in on the wing with Ross Adair at full back.Up front, Bradley Luney continued in the number seven jersey with Conall Boomer on the bench as his recovery from a knee ligament injury continues to be managed.The match itself was a tight affair, dictated by a dficult, swirling wind and Ballynahinch did superbly well to overcome the concession of a try to Lansdowne flyer Peter Sullivan and the sin-binning of Luney, to lead - at half-time thanks to two well-taken penalties from Hutley.The defence in particular was vastly improved and this continued in the second half as the game turned into a real dogfight with defence on top.Skipper John Donnan and his fellow lock Jack Regan led the way with outstanding work in defence and huge work rate around the park with Chris Gibson having an impressive stint off the bench at scrum-half, but a penalty at a ruck around half way allowed Lansdowne to work themselves into an excellent field position as the game reached its conclusion and they manufactured the winning score.The losing bonus point kept the locals well in touch with their fellow strugglers, Trinity and University College Cork as both lost at home.Terenurersquos victory at the Mardyke looks to have pulled them clear of any relegation issues and although Ballynahinch are bottom of the table on  points, they remain just one behind UCC and three behind Trinity.The next two games against high flying Garryowen and UCD will be a huge challenge before a blockbuster home game against UCC on March .

It is not yet clear at what point new lts will be installed at the Cloonagh Road facility.Local drivers who were due to have their vehicles tested have been granted a four-month extension of their existing certicate and are expected to be informed of their new test dates over the coming weeks.Stormont infrastructure minister Nichola Mallon has confirmed that following the discovery of faults with lts in MoT centres in late January, her priority was the safety of DVA staff and customers.She said that since news of the faulty vehicle lts emerged, she acted quickly to minimise inconvenience to the public and allow drivers to tax their vehicles and continue to drive.Ms Mallon said that she has been examining all of the options to resume normal business as quickly and safely as possible, including the commissioning of two independent reviews to provide her with expert advice on the condition of the existing lts, the events that led to the situation and how it can be avoided in future.ldquoI have now been given the first report from the independent engineering expertrsquos assessment on the condition of the existing lts, she confirmed.ldquoIt has recommended that all lts with faults identied should be replaced, not repaired. The second audit investigation report has not been completed, however, it has highlighted that there are no issues with the purchasing of this equipment from the existing supplier.The infrastructure minister said she has decided to replace all  lts across MoT centres at a cost of pound.m.She continued: ldquoIt is clear that an inadequate inspection regime and metal fatigue led to this situation. I have therefore instructed my officials to put in place an improved equipment replacement cycle and regular robust inspection and maintenance, with an additional layer of independent inspection built into the new contract.ldquoUntil the lts are operational, the advice to customers remains the same. All vehicles will have the necessary cover to allow them to remain on the road, either through a temporary exemption certicate or a priority appointment.Ms Mallon said that road safety is a priority for her and she reminded drivers that they also have a responsibility to ensure their vehicles are roadworthy at all times.The minister continued: ldquoThe priority vehicle contact line, for owners of four year old vehicles, taxis and car dealerships, will continue to operate to make it easier for these vehicle owners to contact DVA for an urgent appointment.ldquoTemporary exemption certicates will continue to be issued to all cancelled customers, enabling the public to continue to use their cars and all customers who have been cancelled will receive a full refund of their booking fee.The infrastructure minister said that while the steps she has taken willtest centres to full capacity safely and swtly, the situation has brought to light the need to improve the MoT system and centres and this is something she will be considering in the months ahead.Ms Mallon added: ldquoI will continue to keep this matter under review and as the position changes and the new lts become operational I will ensure that the public are fully informed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 MP.jpg","title":"MP presses roads minister to give assurance on Ballynahinch bypass  ","story":"STORMONT roads minister Nichola Mallon has been urged to provide a public assurance that delivery of the Ballynahinch bypass remains a priority for the Department for Infrastructure.The appeal has been issued by South Down MP Chris Hazzard and comes just weeks after Newry, Mourne and Down Council agreed to seek a meeting with the minister to make the case for work to start on Ballynahinchrsquos proposed poundm scheme.The multi-million pound project has been shovel ready for some time, with local politicians hoping that the government department will allocate funding for the near two-mile scheme which is expected to take in excess of  months to complete.The bypass is the single biggest road scheme ever proposed for the district and roads officials have insisted that the bypass will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety.Designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the by-pass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.Mr Hazzard mdash who formally signed-off the proposal to start work on the by-pass in December  when he was infrastructure minister mdash has written to the new minister.He said it has been six weeks since Ms Mallon took the reins at the government department, claiming Ballynahinch businesses and commuters were beginning to question the ldquolack of public commentary on the bypass issue.The MP continued: ldquoThis is a relatively low-cost, yet strategic infrastructure scheme that is shovel ready, yet it hasnrsquot featured in any of the ministerrsquos public commentary on her departmentrsquos priorities for the time ahead.ldquoI have once again asked the Department to provide an update on this long overdue scheme. Hopefully, the minister will take this opportunity to definitively set out that the Ballynahinch bypass remains a priority for her department,and it is not being relegated for an alternative project where.Work on a major ground condition survey along the route of the by-pass has been completed, as has an archaeological investigation. Progression to the construction stage remains subject to clearing statutory procedures and securing finance.Roads officials have previously confirmed that given the scale of the multi-million pound scheme, the Department of Infrastructure is required to carry out archaeological and geotechnical investigations along the route of the by-pass.In addition, they say the ious surveys and other work is being completed in advance to ensure that key pieces of the development jigsaw are in place when the bid for funding is made.A spokeswoman for the department said the minister recognised that many in the local community support the provision of a bypass in Ballynahinch.ldquoUnfortunately, the minister has inherited severe and challenging budget constraints. However, recognising the importance of the Ballynahinch bypass and many others schemes within her Department, the minister is committed to working to find solutions that deliver better for our communities and improve lives across Northern Ireland, she said.ldquoThe minister is currently assessing the pressures across her department reflecting her priorities, the commitments in the New Decade: New Approach document and the budget made available for the period ahead.

Speaking to the East Belfast Herald newspaper at his Cregagh home in , he said he was unsurethe call-up could be legally enforced, but decided to enlist in case he would be subsequently directed to serve with the Navy. What happened next took the Belfast bakery worker on an epic journey through France and into southern Germany via the Haardt Mountains and Hitler’s ‘eagle’s nest’ mountain base at Berchtesgaden.As the war drew to a close in , Teddy’s unit was involved in the capture of Hitler’s deputy – Reichsmarschall Hermann Goering – in Austria, and it was the newly-promoted Sergeant Dixon who dispatched to check out reports of a salt mine filled with priceless artworks, and then tasked with guarding the treasures at Salzburg Castle.Members of Teddy’s family have travelled thousands of miles to be with him this weekend for a busy round of birthday celebrations, including a family lunch in the local church hall on Saturday and a hotel buffet event in his honour on Sunday evening.US Army veteran Teddy Dixon got the VIP treatment at Movie House Dublin Road in  when he came in to watch The Monuments Men starring George Clooney and Matt Damon. Picture: John Murphy Aurora PAThe much-loved centenarian is in good spirits and will be reliving some of the many highlights of his amazing le surrounded by family and friends, but the shock of discovering thousands of Holocaust victims in  has never left him. The dead had been packed into train carriages as the Nazis attempted to move the evidence of war crimes further away from the advancing Allies. “I was one of the first  soldiers to enter the gates of Dachau camp on April  and can still see the bodies in my mind’s eye,” Teddy recalled in .“The dead were lying everywhere and the smell was indescribable. We found one man who had been left for dead in a carriage but was still alive and we got him some medical attention. We gave our rations to as many of those who could eat but it was too late for several who died in front of our eyes.“It was like going into Hell.”Teddy Dixon at home in East Belfast ahead of his th birthday on May . Photo: Laura Davison Pacemaker PressSpeaking to the News Letter in , he said the vivid memories would never leave him, but he continued to carry out speaking engagements to raise awareness of the warning from history.“I still like doing the talks in schools but it can annoy you a bit sometimes when you think about it. Many a time when I wake up I find I’ve been dreaming about the Holocaust,” he added.But thankfully Teddy can recall many happier times during his eventful  years – including countless honours and awards from Holocaust survivors, the US Government and Belfast City Council,His wartime memories include partying on the Champs-Élysées in Paris on the first Bastille Day after liberation from the Germans in July .Teddy Dixon aged  in his US Army unormThe le-long member or Orange lodge LOL in Sandy Row had been granted leave from tracking down war criminals in Austria and was on his way home for the Twelfth – but got stranded in the French capital due to the decimation of the rail infrastructure.In more recent times, the Big Lottery Fund paid for Teddy to travel back to Dachau to commemorate the th anniversary of the liberation. • With Teddy Dixon’s war record reading like the plot of a Hollywood film, it was no surprise that George Clooney brought one of the Belfast man’s adventures to le in a blockbuster movie.The Monuments Men, released in , was based on the story of theNazis’ looted art treasures Teddy helped recover from an Austrian salt mine. Each one of thousands of priceless artworks – including Michelangelo’s ‘Madonna of Bruges’ sculpture and Vermeer’s painting ‘The Astronomer’ – had been packed on to several train carriages and hidden in the mine close to Altaussee. At the film’s launch, the then -year-old Teddy was a Movie House cinema guest for a special screening in Belfast. He told the News Letter afterwards: “I enjoyed it.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Of those who received the benefit,  per cent were unemployed.Universal Credit began in  and has been gradually rolled out across the country. It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system. Currently around  per cent of tenants have this system in place, which allows a portion of Universal Credit payments to be made directly to the council to cover rent.ldquoThis year, the council has been able to secure over pound, of additional income for tenants by helping them secure backdated claims, ensuring the correct benefits are being received, assisting with appeals, and helping secure the best tarfs for utilities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He made me feel very relaxed, said one patient after meeting Charles.ldquoWithin  seconds I felt at ease. It was nice to be able to say what you wanted, and he genuinely had an interest in the patients, said Kathryn Guercio, a Health Care Assistant at Marie Curie.For Kathryn, the royal visit was an opportunity to thank the prince.ldquoWhen I was  I left school with no qualications. I was an absolute angry drop out. I joined the Princes Trust volunteers because they didnrsquot know what  to do with me, Kathryn said.Established by Charles in , the Princes Trust helps vulnerable young people to find employment and gain valuable training.ldquoI did a fortnight of caring in Surry and I loved it. I absolutely loved it. Thatrsquos when I thought I could do this. I just love looking after people.ldquoItrsquos because of that choice to join the Princes Trust volunteers that I ended up where I am, so I genuinely do thank him for taming a very wayward -year-old.Describing her job at Marie Curie, Kathryn said: ldquoI love it here. Therersquos no comparison. You can give that  percent every sht. And wersquove got a cracking view. The sun rises and then the moon rises. We get to see it all across the water. Itrsquos gorgeous.Following the tour, the prince ended his visit at a reception where he met actor and Marie Curie ambassador, Suzanna Packer.In a brief speech, he commended the staff and volunteers for their dedication which he called lsquotruly remarkable.rsquoHe then unveiled a plaque to commemorate his visit and cut a daffodil-themed cake made by local Michelin-starred chef, James Sommerin.Angelina Hall and Cathy OrsquoDoherty, co-owners of Glass By Design at Station Approach, were commissioned to design and produce the plaque.ldquoIt was an honour for us as local artists to be asked to make this, said Cathy. ldquoItrsquos something which is going to be here for people to enjoy.His Royal Highness was also the first person to sign the charityrsquos Great Big Daffodil - a -foot tall model with paper books in the shape of petals which will start a UK wide tour this week.The Great Daffodil Appeal is an opportunity for people to share their stories, memories, or tributes to a loved one.After signing the book and cutting the cake, Charles gave a final farewell to the staff who had gathered to see him and left with his entourage.The prince met with flood victims in Pontypridd later that afternoon.His trip to South Wales also included engagements at the CAF train factory in Newport, the Aston Martin Lagonda factory in St. Athan, Barry, and the British Airways Maintenance Centre in Cardf. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

How do those people then stay, snuggled in snoozy paradise for hour upon hour until their alarm gives them a nudge and they arise rested and ready for a new day  I have never been a good sleeper, even as a child. If anything at all is playing on my mind, I never lose my appetite, but I will lose slumber. I have friends who similarly suffer. I use the word suffer quite deliberately, because lying there in the dark at am it can feel like everyone  is snuffling softly but for the wide-awake person, it can feel horrendous. As the time ticks closer to the alarm and still sleep will not come, it can feel quite anxiety-inducing and so the vicious circle whizzes, fizzes and flies through your brain making sleep feel further and further away.But, as this is a lelong way of living for me and I am overwhelmingly a lsquocrack on kinda womanrsquo, I have developed ways to use this time effectively. I listen to podcasts, and have learned about biohacking, how broccoli defends itself and the many twists and turns of the Brexit negotiations whilst the street snoozes. I catch up with messages . I also think a lot. I just lay there in the dark and puzzle though story ideas, events from the day and issues facing friends, family and myself. In a twisted way, this time and opportunity has become quite precious to me. I donrsquot know when  in the day Irsquod have the time and space to just ponder, muse, consider and percolate. It is during this time that I have considered my earlier point about jealousy. None of us know what is going on behind the closed door of either someonersquos home or their mind and whilst I hope you sleep well,you canrsquot, use that time wisely to think, to empathise and to learn. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Rather than adhering to a nationally prescribed learning program, schools and practitioners will be able to make decisions that best meet the needs of specic learners.As well as contributing to the framework, St Josephrsquos has also introduced their own bespoke curriculum, and is one of only  Curriculum Innovation Schools in Wales.The St Josephrsquos curriculum is based on findings in child development and cognitive science, with staff undertaking extensive learning on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop.Lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social and physical development, whilst also providing a detailed knowledge and understanding of the world, both past and present.The school has also benefitted from signicant on-site works, including the refurbishment of all classrooms, a complete reconfiguration of the Foundation Phase learning spaces and a state of the art new-build Nursery.Staff regularly deliver learning experiences outside of the classroom, as the schoolrsquos grounds include a playing field, wooded area, pond, orchard, wildflower meadow and polytunnel.The implementation of the schoolrsquos ambitious curriculum has seen standards improve year on year. Last yearrsquos National Reading Tests saw the average child in St Josephrsquos score within the top  percent of the country, with similarly high standards achieved in mathematics.Headteacher, Gareth Rein said: ldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos. Everything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.Cabinet Member for Education and Regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning. It encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom.St Josephrsquos will be hosting an open day on Wednesday March .

The short list of potential locations for e-bike stations includes Penarth Town Centre, Cogan Train Centre, Penarth Train Station, Llandough Hospital, The Esplanade, Cosmeston Country Park, Cardf Bay Barrage, and Pont-y-Werin Bridge.The scheme hopes to encourage people to switch from their daily car journey to e-bikes, saving on average g of CO for every  kilometre travelled.The average round trip from Penarth to Cardf is km, which would save ,g of COused daily.Nextbike Managing Director, Krysia Solheim, said the Penarth scheme would be great for those who commute into the capital.ldquoWe know from our research that a lot of commuters already cycle from Penarth into Cardf, said Ms Solheim.ldquoE-bikes will make that journey easier and quicker than ever before, which will hopefully persuade more people to switch from four wheels to two on a daily basis. Picking up an e-bike instead of jumping in the car is also a great way for people to reduce their own personal carbon footprints to help our communities tackle climate change.ldquoPenarth will play an important part in leading the bike share revolution in Wales - itrsquos an exciting time - and we want the community to be as involved as possible.\"Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, said: ldquoFeedback from the Nextbike consultation was overwhelmingly positive, with many residents hoping to see the expansion of the scheme to the wider Vale.ldquoHaving declared a climate emergency last year, and having recently proposed a pound.m investment into tackling environmental issues, the Nextbike scheme will be a leading example of our commitment to tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of our residents. We hope this will inspire the launch of similar schemes in future.The Nextbike project is being funded by Section  sustainable transport contributions. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

As the rain lashed down pretty much all day Friday and the wind did too much howling and yowling for my liking, we went to bed and then awoke to roads that looked like rivers between Sully and Barry and fields resembling lakes in Dinas Powys.My son and I played lsquospot the tops of the treesrsquo as we drove a erted route to get to his football match on Saturday morning and discussed climate change and the power of nature atas we drove through sun, hail, wind, and rain to get him to his match.The third weekend of storms has taken its toll. It feels tiring and worrying to be soaked once more.But it occurred to me as we left the house early and crawled along with other erted drivers that just a few miles up the road in Pontypridd and indeed in other parts of Wales and across the UK, people are witnessing their homes and business, their lives, being washed away and so as irritated and fed up as I may have been, I scrabbled for perspective.Perspective is a tough one. There will always be someone worse off and someone better off and whilst you can sympathise and empathise and seek to understand, you can only really know your own lived experience.But this is in part why I am so interested in the news, because in dealing with, embracing, enduring, revelling in my own le, I appreciate that window on the world to open my mind, teach me things and remind me that there are others in similar, same, better and much worse situations than me. It doesnrsquot stop a flooded road being frustrating, but it does remind me that in the midst of chuntering and muttering, because I do indulge in a chunter and mutter, thatpossible, it is important to take a moment to think about a world outside ourselves and our immediate surrounds.It can feel depressing. It is easy to feel powerless. But I do believe that as citizens in a democracy, it is important to have an idea about what is going on becausewe always turn a blind eye, eventually I fear, we might stop seeing anything at all. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Those that will need to be quarantined will be quarantined. Those who will require medical help will receive it.Princess Cruises said  of the more than , people on board, which includes  Britons, were tested in the first round.A military helicopter crew lowered test kits on to the ft ship by rope on Thursday and later retrieved them for analysis as the vessel waited off San Francisco, under orders to keep its distance from shore. All passengers have been ordered to remain in their cabins.US President Donald Trump, speaking at the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, said he would have preferred not to let the passengers disembark on to American soil but will defer to the recommendations of medical experts.He said: ldquoI donrsquot need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasnrsquot our fault. And it wasnrsquot the fault of the people on the ship either. Okay  It wasnrsquot their fault either. And they are mostly Americans. vw,vw,px, px\"Health teams wore protective equipment to deliver virus testing kits to the ship Health officials trying to establish whether the virus is circulating on the Grand Princess undertook the testing after reporting that a passenger on a previous voyage of the ship, in February, died of the disease.In the past few days, health authorities disclosed that at least  other people who were on the same journey were also found to be infected. Some passengers on that trip stayed aboard for the current voyage, which increased crew membersrsquo exposure to the virus.Also on Friday, Thai authorities blocked a separate cruise ship from docking in the country due to concerns over the fact a number of passengers are from Italy ndash which with almost  virus deaths is the centre of Europersquos epidemic.Another Princess cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, was quarantined for two weeks in Yokohama, Japan, last month because of the virus, and ultimately about  of the , people aboard became infected..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Cruise ship with  coronavirus cases on board awaits permission to dock in US article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
