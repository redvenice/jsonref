A government fund to help them can only be accessed if they are within 12 weeks of closure. If ever London and Whipsnade zoos got that close to closure they would have already had to start rehoming their thousands of animals. So far they have received none of the government aid money, and yet zoos need constant staff, have huge food and veterinary bills and need to retain a large percentage of their staffby  John Sutherland with photographs by  Sarah LeeLockdowns hit zoos hard. The cagers are caged. The worst confinement Paris ever experienced was the Prussian siege of 1870 to 1871. After dogs, rats and leather boots, the zoo became haute cuisine. Victor Hugo dined on elephant steak and pronounced it inferior to bear.London’s twin zoos, metropolitan in Camden, rural in Whipsnade, have suffered over the last year. Neither would ever go into the bush-meat market, but times have never in living memory been as tough - £20m tough and rising.The Zoological Society of London, a charity, depends on public admission revenue and donations. Over the last year paying footfall has been minimal. Easter is traditionally the beginning of the peak season. Not this year.The zoo is lobbying for access to the government’s zoo animals fund, largely unspent and due to close last week but now kept open. The Catch 22 is that an institution has to be in unsustainable peril to get support. Core ZSL staff can’t be furloughed because 20,000 animals need them daily, sometimes hourly.What shall we lose if London’s zoo complex continues to bleed? As well ask what the world would lose. The zoo began in 1827 as the Zoological Society of London, a college, and ZSL is still its badge. The society’s purpose was science, study and exploration, not showbusiness. For the first 20 years the public could only get in with a signed form.ZSL was founded and still opposes traditional zoo trophyism. England’s first considerable menagerie was that of Henry III at the Tower of London. Its walls were strained with the gift of an elephant from the French monarch, his brother-in-law, in 1255. The beast died in three years of a surfeit of red wine. Very French.Powerful rich men, from European monarchs and plutocrats such as William Randolph Hearst to Michael Jackson, have gathered expensive menageries. To prove what? Love of animals certainly, but mainly a love of personal supremacy.In King Solomon’s Ring, Konrad Lorenz points out that we sentimentalise animals insofar as we can mirror our faces in theirs. We Dumbo-ise and Shere Khan-ise them. Childhood fairy stories ingrain the habit.Those orange bags carried virtuously to and from our supermarkets and the child-delighting trunki suitcase distract us from our knowing what we don’t want to. What is that? The African elephant, the largest terrestrial animal on earth, confronts extinction.Anthropomorphism, humanising the animal kingdom, rolls knowingly off the visitor’s tongue. A thoughtful walk through the two London zoos should prove the contrary. We are not separate but among them. Temporary living things.Assigned keepers see the distinct qualities of “their species” and inidual identity. Jimmy the gibbon, an incorrigible swank nowadays denied spectators, gives displays for exercisers in nearby Regent’s Park.The keeper of the 64 penguins knows each by name and subtle character differences. The Whipsnade keeper, Stefan, extols his Asian elephant herd as they solemnly munch in their hangar-sized feeding enclosure. His eyes never lose them. Giving Bashu the giraffe a pedicure requires the skills of a Victorian farrier and the bedside manner of a family doctor with a handy satchel of carrots.London zoo split into metropolitan and rural in 1931.Each half “keeps” animals. Whipsnade is not a wild animal park. Visitors are encouraged to walk in both places. There are couple of unmenacing free-roaming species at Whipsnade. A nearby golf course, apparently, sometimes has wallabies in the rough.The zoo’s aim remains what it’s always been - to conserve, preserve, and serve. Serve what? Our need to learn and, more sombrely, to feel what our species is doing to the planet.At times, seeing yet again the caption “endangered”, one feels one’s in nature’s A\u0026ampE room. It’s humbling. But against the odds the mood of the zoo remains, if the right things are done. But do them now. Otherwise we shall witness continuing extinctions. We too, at the precarious top of the chain, will have our turn. Going to Mars to find extinguished life is a sad irony.As to ZSL’s current plight one can’t yet visit but one can donate. Better to buy a year’s membership and wait for it to validate when the gates are open again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09bf9fd53f47f4b44ec791e8eda173302a025e31/0_159_7531_4517/master/7531.jpg?width=1900\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=0e5751a3abb813a61b8c4d1dcd9d11c9 3800w","title":"london and accra over three decades in pictures james barnor","story":"James Barnor’s career as a studio portraitist, photojournalist and black lifestyle photographer s six decades, recording major social and political changes in London, UK, and Accra, Ghana.

Robert Jenrick cited rising controversy and new climate advice as reasons for the U-turn.The government had been criticised by its own climate advisers and leading scientists for failing to block the coalmine, which would produce fuel for steel production rather than electricity generation.Critics said the pit plan seriously undermined the UK’s leadership as it prepares to host a crucial UN climate summit in November. There will now be a public inquiry but it is unclear whether the final decision will be made before the UN summit.Creating the jobs would require many billions of pounds in investment, but the report’s backers said the government’s commitment to a green industrial revolution and to levelling up less affluent parts of the country could support this.“We have a global responsibility to do our bit,” said Karen Mitchell, the chief executive of Cumbria Action for Sustainability, the organisation that commissioned the report. “The coalmine is just looking backwards: why invest in that instead of in new technologies that have a longer-term future?”She added: “We’re in a climate emergency and Cumbria is often at the frontline of that.” The county has been hit by the worst flooding in centuries in recent years, with scientists finding the 2015 floods were made significantly more likely by global heating.Mitchell said she understood the need for jobs in the county, some parts of which are among the poorest in England. But she said green jobs bring additional benefits such as cutting people’s heating bills, reducing air pollution and boosting healthy travel such as cycling: “There are lots of co-benefits that you don’t get when you’re sending people down a deep dark hole.”Prof Rebecca Willis from the University of Lancaster said: “The Whitehaven coalmine proposals are totally at odds with UK climate legislation. Cumbria shouldn’t be chasing dirty jobs with no future, it should be working with government to bring green investment to an area that really needs it.”Cumbria council approved the mine in October. But as the backlash grew, the council said in February it would reconsider the decision in order to take into account climate advice published in December by the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), the same advice now cited by Jenrick.West Cumbria Mining, the company behind the plan, threatened legal action against the council last week, while opponents have also threatened court action against the government.A government spokesperson said: “The UK is a world leader in the fight against climate change, and we are determined to seize the economic opportunities and build back greener from the pandemic by supporting up to 2m green jobs across the country – including Cumbria – by 2030.”Some northern MPs reacted angrily to Jenrick’s U-turn, with one, Mark Jenkinson, calling it a “kick in the teeth”, but Greenpeace said it was “better late than never”. Ed Miliband, the shadow business secretary, said: “After months of pressure, ministers have finally been forced to act. The government must now block the mine and focus instead on creating low-carbon jobs in Cumbria and across the country with a proper green stimulus.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e673aa4f20d7e35587940b3f484888d0454e24b/0_0_5123_3074/master/5123.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=6480af3dd2b9e9f8c6955680605d48b0","title":"premier league team news north london derby buildup and more weekend football countdown live","story":"Already mentioned by Dave earlier, but here is Jamie Jackson’s story on the possibility that David de Gea will miss Manchester United’s meeting with West Ham - Thank you David and hello, everyone. A few lines here courtesy of PA, from Big Sam’s West Brom press conference ahead of tomorrow’s meeting with his former club Crystal Palace. He says that keeping the Baggies up would rank as his greatest escape:“I think probably (this would be) the greatest because of the number of points we need compared to the other clubs I’ve been at,” Allardyce said. “From this period of 10 games to go, it’s obviously a lot more difficult because of the amount of points we need to gain to try and get safe and keep this club in the Premier League.“We probably turned more victories in at Palace than we have done here at West Brom,” added Allardyce. “So this period was a crucial time for me, where all the new players had settled in and helped the players already here to improve the performances - and the big slip-up is too many draws (compared) to victories. Unfortunately we look back on those periods and say those victories really should have been achieved. But in the main we can only hold ourselves accountable for that because far too many chances have been missed to win a game and that’s left us in a more difficult position than we probably were at Crystal Palace.” Okay, I’m off to look at some videos of muddy pitches for a bit. I’ll hand over to Luke McLaughlin to guide you through the next half hour or so.Manchester City travel to Fulham on Saturday evening and Pep Guardiola is impressed by opposite number Scott Parker.Fulham have lost just one of their last seven games and scored aSays Pep: “They play incredibly well. They were relegated with Scott and promoted again. I was really impressed when they played here with their physicality, their strength. It is a big challenge.”City won the reverse fixture 2-0.Pep Guardiola has a grass problem. Nope, don’t get the lawyers involved, he means the Etihad pitch.They’re working a lot, they are trying to find a solution but the grass is not good. All the players know how good the grass is and sometimes it is not. I know the weather conditions here in England are tough but there are stadiums where the grass is good. We were in London against Arsenal, at Anfield, at Old Trafford and the grass was better. We were in Budapest in the Champions League and the grass was incredible, red carpet – and our grass still is not good. Dear oh dear. Check out Maine Road in the ‘70s mate.Manchester United also have selection problems at the other end of the pitch with Anthony Martial, Marcus Rashford ad Edinson Cavani all doubtful for the West Ham game.On Martial: “Anthony, he got a whack on his hip so that’s another forward that we need to scan and have to look at.”On Rashford: “Definitely hope Marcus is back for next Thursday in Milan, I’m not sure if he’ll make Sunday, but fingers crossed because we will need him.”On Cavani: “Edinson I don’t think will be ready for Sunday, no.”Paul Pogba, Donny van de Beek and Juan Mata are also out.Ole Gunnar Solskjær isn’t sure if goalkeeper David De Gea will be back for the visit of West Ham on Sunday.The Spaniard has returned to England following the birth of his first child but putting him straight back into the team in place of Dean Henderson isn’t that simple due to coronavirus restrictions. Current regulations allow travellers from Spain to be released from quarantine if they test negative for Covid-19 after five days of isolation.Totting up the days on his hand and doing his best confused Stan Laurel impression, the Manchester United boss said: “Yeah, David is back in Manchester. He is quarantining or self isolating. He’s just touch and go for Sunday, I think. I can’t really know when he came back, so I’m not really sure if it was Monday or Tuesday that he arrived back in Manchester. I think the rules are that he’s got to stay at home. He’s not training with us anyway. It’s different if you travel away and compete so, no, he’s not been training since he came back.”That’s that cleared up then.Some bad news for Everton as they try and push for a top-four finish. French midfielder Abdoulaye Doucoure could be out for up to 10 weeks due to a fractured bone in his foot while playmaker James Rodriguez won’t feature again until after the international break.Doucoure picked up his injury against West Brom just over a week ago while Rodriguez has had to fight through a calf problem. The Colombian will miss Saturday’s Premier League game against Burnley and next weekend’s FA Cup quarter-final at home to Manchester City.Boss Carlo Ancelotti has given this update:On Doucoure: “Doucoure had a small fracture on his foot. I don’t know how long, maybe eight weeks or 10 weeks. I hope he can recover before the end of the season.”On James: “James played well, really well, against Man United and against Liverpool but he was not 100 per cent fit. We decided to give him a proper recovery and don’t let him play at 70 or 80 per cent. We have taken this decision together. The player agrees.”Harry Kane should be fit for the derby against Arsenal despite picking up a knock in Thursday’s Europa League win over Dinamo Zagreb. Kane scored twice in that game and boss Jose Mourinho can’t say enough good things about the England striker.I’ve been lucky enough to work with players with great ambitions, it’s not possible to have a career like mine without players with ambition.He has that, no doubt he has that. No doubt that of course he wants to win matches, score goals, win trophies. Totally committed with the club, totally committed with the national team.He’s a very good example of a top professional and a top player. Sometimes top players are not always top professionals, and vice-versa. He’s a top player, he’s a top professional and he’s a great example for everyone.Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho has been speaking ahead of Sunday’s North London derby. He says he’s more worried about the teams above Spurs.I look up, I don’t look down. If Arsenal was seven points ahead of us, I would look to them. But because we have seven points more than them, I don’t look down. But at the same time, we look always to the next match. And if instead of Arsenal it was Villa or Newcastle, the next matches we’re going to play, exactly the same feeling.We feel we’re better than the position we have in the table and we want to improve our position so we need points for that.It doesn’t matter the opponent, doesn’t matter if it is a London derby – in fact it’s the fourth in a row in the Premier League. It’s a Premier League match, three points are there to fight for and that’s what we’re going to try to do.Hearing reports that an 80s Sheffield band are performing at the Chris Wilder press conference.Just can’t think who it might be or what song they may choose. Singer looks kind of familiar though.Today’s Sheffield United press conference scheduled for 1.30pm will now be held at 5pm. So plan your daily walk around that. EmJackson2021 observes: “Pep’s Manager of the Month Award looks like a deodorant from a Lynx gift-set.” (see 12:39)Good spot. Forget Lynx Africa, try Lynx Guardiola (available in body spray and shower gel).Another Chris Wilder update. A matter of when not if.Latest from the PA:Chris Wilder is set to leave Sheffield United, the PA news agency understands.An announcement is expected later on Friday which will confirm the 53-year-old has been relieved of his duties as manager.The Blades cancelled their Friday morning press conference with a player amid reports Wilder was set to be sacked, with the boss scheduled to face journalists via Zoom in the afternoon.That media duty, scheduled for 1.30pm, was also rescheduled into the early evening.But the club confirmed a player would not be appearing for interview as planned, suggesting something was going on behind the scenes.Have a read of Barney Ronay’s latest piece on Liverpool.“A brilliant team built out of Jürgen Klopp’s own restless energy have come to resemble a band of hollow men limping from stage to stage, but the manager has been more or less silent on the causes. Instead he has looked uneasy, an ancient mariner stalking the fringes – a little haunted and hollow-eyed, but passing for now on the discharge of blame. This is significant in its own right. Klopp analyses, and overanalyses. He will have his own very clear version of events. But right now he just isn’t telling.”Another award for Pep. Perhaps Fulham boss Scott Parker will be in the running for March if wearing iffy jackets is a factor as well as excellent results.Promisinglight asks: “Who’s Neil Young in this scenario? Dele, Lucas, or Lamela?”It’s not a perfect science. Alli has too many syllables to be Young. Perhaps Alli, Kane, Bale and Son?Chris Wilder update... and it’s getting a little confusing. Apparently, there is a press conference at 1.30pm GMT. Other rumours are suggesting he hasn’t gone. Perhaps they just mean yet. We’ll know more in just over an hour. Wonder if Steven Gerrard fancies it. Stepping stone to Liverpool? And he might be able to get a tune out of Rhian Brewster at least.Sorry about the comments not being available earlier. We have an ex-prison warden with a big set of keys that has to unlock them and he was dealing with a couple of questionable characters loitering near  HQ. They’re back on now.

Moura, Kane, Bale and Son scans nicely.Tottenham’s version of Crosby, Stills \u0026amp Nash - Kane, Son \u0026amp Bale - have found some welcome harmony of late. The Spurs frontmen have combined for 10 goals across Tottenham’s last five games and share 34 Premier League goals in the current campaign.Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta is wary of the Tottenham trio ahead of Sunday’s North London derby:It’s very difficult because the level of quality, precision, understanding and chemistry that they have between them makes them probably one of the most special (attacks) in Europe.And they don’t need much. They are able to create their own chances, they are able to link as a team.So it is really difficult to do, but we will prepare the game well to try to stop them obviously.A list of contenders for the Sheffield United job is emerging although still no official news yet on Chris Wilder’s exit.Current U23s coach Paul Heckingbottom is the favourite with the bookmakers and then, in odds order, we have Neil Lennon, Eddie Howe, Frank Lampard, Danny Cowley, Slaven Bilic and David Wagner.Women’s Super League champions Chelsea have announced that Fran Kirby has signed a contract extension.The England forward, who joined from Reading in 2015, has scored 15 goals in 21 appearances for Emma Hayes’ side this season.She said on the club’s website:I’ve been a part of this club for a very long time, and it didn’t take much thought.I knew where I wanted to be, and I think you could see that in my performances. I was really trying to prove myself to the fans who haven’t been able to watch me for a long time and to the club. It was a no-brainer for me that I wanted to stay in this environment.On the back of that Women’s Champions League draw, it seems a good time to flag up our exclusive interview with Manchester City and England defender Lucy Bronze.The draw has been made for the quarter-finals and semi-finals of the Women’s Champions League.The two English sides left in - Manchester City and Chelsea - were kept apart in the draw so both could meet in May’s final in Gothenburg.Chelsea face two-time winners Wolfsburg in the last eight while City go up against Barcelona.Manchester United co-chairman Avram Glazer has put shares worth more than £70m up for sale. Here’s the full story.Some team news from Chelsea. Striker Tammy Abraham and defender Thiago Silva will both miss Saturday lunchtime’s trip to Leeds.Blues boss Thomas Tuchel gave an update this morning.On Abraham: “Tammy still has ankle pain from the tackle against Newcastle, from the same injury. He’s still not 100 per cent comfortable. Yesterday he went off, the day before he was fine, yesterday he had some training. Honestly I’m a bit concerned because it’s still the pain from the tackle against Burnley, so we’re talking about a long time now where he does not really feel 100 per cent free and comfortable I can see it in training.On Thiago Silva: “Thiago also had a little setback in training, at the end of the training session, the day before yesterday, he felt at the very end something around the same area (thigh) where he was injured. So we had to take him off and he’s back into a transition phase but not back in team training. So he will be out.”For those asking (actually no-one but whatever), the dog on the front page of the Sheffield United website is called Little Blade.This lead story opens with: “Little Blade is no longer so little and has really had a growth spurt since Christmas. With his beautiful white coat, he can now easily be confused for a small polar bear.”Really? I know it’s been cold in Sheffield but...Anyway, on a more serious note, Little Blade deserves a pat on the back. “He’ll begin full time training to become a life-saving support dog for a family affected by autism, epilepsy or disability.” Another PA update on Chris Wilder.The PA news agency understands an announcement is expected later on Friday which will confirm Wilder, 53, has been relieved of his duties as manager and will leave the club. Sheffield United have cancelled their Friday morning press conference so that looks pretty ominous.The PA have more info:The Blades were scheduled to make a player available to the media at 10am but the club said this morning that would not be happening. It remains to be seen if the manager’s afternoon press conference will go ahead – and who will be in Wilder’s place should he depart beforehand.Tensions between Wilder and club owner Abdullah Bin Musa’ad Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud have heightened recently, with Wilder last week stating he did not know if he will be manager next season, despite confirming he wants to remain in charge at Bramall Lane if the board and owners “stick to the plan”.Meanwhile, the official Sheffield United website has a cute dog as its lead image to presumably try and defuse the rage surrounding Chris Wilder. Look at his little face (the dog’s that is).Lots of ‘hot takes’ around about Chris Wilder’s imminent departure but some are more balanced than others and have used actual reasoning and stats.Sheffield United travel to Leicester this weekend - and it appears they’ll do so without Chris Wilder. The general consensus appears to be that an announcement will be made this afternoon. The Twitter outrage is revving up. Will there be an official press conference? And, if so, will he storm off the set?Notably, a check of the bookmaker websites shows they seem to have pulled their Next Premier League Manager To Be Sacked markets.What you will find, though, is odds for the Next Permanent Liverpool Manager. Steven Gerrard is 64, Pep Ljinders 115, Xabi Alonso 112, Julian Nagelsmann 101 and Rafa Benitez 161.Not sure Nagelsmann has done much to turn Liverpool heads in recent weeks. Some rather dramatic early news. Chris Wilder is set to be sacked by Sheffield United today, according to several sources.The Blades boss has been in charge since 2016 but after last season’s fairytale when they flirted with the top four before finishing ninth, the current campaign has been a nightmare.United have won just four of their 28 Premier League games this season and are four points adrift at the bottom of the table.We’ll keep an eye for anything more concrete.The Premier League fixture list is going with a 1-4-4-1 formation this weekend. The two bookends are Newcastle v Aston Villa tonight and Wolves v Liverpool on Monday evening. The meat in this tasty top-flight sandwich includes Leeds v Chelsea, the North London derby between Arsenal and Spurs and Sunday evening’s ‘Jesse Lingard’ derby at Old Trafford where Manchester United host West Ham. However, it’s in name only as the rejuvenated on-loan midfielder cannot face his parent club.There’s much to talk about as we set the scene for what fantasy players are quite rightly calling Gameweek 28. Peeeeep, let’s get this bad boy started."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d63b9dd0cb349962703c553b419ab2d2dc497e25/0_0_3500_2334/master/3500.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85821430e20db2f8b6076b15ec8d07a1 720w","title":"scatting revival serpentwithfeet scatman john bobby mcferrin","story":"Serpentwithfeet’s latest track uses the classic jazz technique. But from Bobby McFerrin to Scatman John and Baby Shark, maybe it never went awayThere is a joyous moment halfway through R\u0026ampB singer Serpentwithfeet’s latest single, Same Size Shoe. In a tender falsetto, he calls for his “trumpet” before unleashing a series of rhythmic vowel sounds: a fanfaring instrumental solo with only his own voice over a minimal backing. To those unfamiliar with the phenomenon, this is scat singing. And to hear it amid a loved-up ballad in 2021 begs the question: is scatting back?Loosely defined as vocal improvisations with a wordless melody, scatting is a term perhaps most readily associated with cartoonish imaginings of zoot-suited men snapping their fingers in smoky jazz bars. While it might seem like a lost musical artform, it has always existed in popular music beyond its native genre, jazz. Rapper Eazy-E channelled a horn-like scat in his 1990 track Eazy Street, while Busta Rhymes and Twista’s hyperspeed flows often veer into scatting territory. In pop, Beyoncé overlayed an electric guitar solo with a scat on 2011’s I Care, while Amy Winehouse laced 2003’s Frank with it. In R\u0026ampB, scatting finds its ultimate expression in Lalah Hathaway, who has pioneered a remarkable chordal voicing of the form. Of course, there was also the vocal acrobatics of Scatman John, whose novelty track Scatman (Ski-Ba-Bop-Ba-Dop-Bop) conquered the charts in 1994. It could be argued that even the infernal ringtone-revving of the Crazy Frog owes its influence to scat singing.Historically a cornerstone of the jazz singer’s repertoire, the earliest recorded examples are thought to be found in a scratchy 1911 portion of the ragtime singer Gene Greene’s King of the Bungaloos – a chaotic segment that veers from bouncy monosyllables to a gravelly Popeye impression – or Al Jolson’s That Haunting Melody, which gives the scat a more languorous tone.It was not until the godfather of New Orleans jazz, Louis Armstrong, came along that scatting became a popular pursuit. His 1926 recording of the tune Heebie Jeebies saw Armstrong employ his signature baritone growl for a vocal improvisation. The song’s ensuing popularity saw scatting incorporated into Armstrong’s performances, while contemporaries such as Duke Ellington used scat sections as the core for compositions such as his Creole Love Call. Vocal powerhouses Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan transitioned from verse to scat solos in their songs, employing their liquid vocal skill to rival their backing bands. It is a tradition that has been continued by the likes of Al Jarreau and Don’t Worry Be Happy singer Bobby McFerrin.In fact, the scat has never really left us: it lies dormant in the “-ella’’ of Rihanna’s Umbrella, in Jessie J’s chaotic, meme-ready vocal freestyles, and in the nightmarish refrain of Baby Shark. Ultimately, when you have the voice, who needs words and instruments anyway?

But now as her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, and the ’s Patrick Wintour explain, having served her sentence she is being threatened with further chargesNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was on holiday in Iran in 2016 visiting her parents with her 22-month-old daughter when she was arrested at Tehran airport and held on what she was eventually told were national security charges. Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, tells Anushka Asthana that it was then that the five-year nightmare began. And very soon he suspected that his wife was not merely a prisoner, but a pawn in a geopolitical struggle dating back to the 1970s and an unpaid debt owed by Britain to Iran.  ’s diplomatic editor, Patrick Wintour, has reported extensively on the story and describes the deal the UK had struck with the shah of Iran for a consignment of British-made tanks shortly before his downfall. Iran had paid for them but the delivery was cancelled amid the Iranian revolution that installed an Islamic theocracy in place of the shah. Following decades of poor relations and demands for the debt to be repaid, Nazanin was arrested and charged with crimes that the regime presented no evidence for and never explained to her.  Now, with her sentence over and her release confirmed, she is still unable to return to her family in the UK as she is now threatened with further charges.

And even Jordan is making chin music, smacking Pandya on the hand, like a Victorian teacher. Five off the over, which has been par so far. The big question is whether India can go to eight or nine for the final third of their innings. 12th over: India 58-4 (Iyer 31, Pandya 1) Yet another change as Stokes gives way to Wood. He has a slip, and rightly so. He bowls a snorter to Pandya, climbing from back-of-a-length and ending up in front of Jos Buttler’s eyes. Great stuff from Wood, who has one for 12 from three overs.Here’s Julia on Twitter, quoting me back at myself. “‘The openers treat Rashid with respect. What do they think this is, a Test match?’ God bless the Over by Over, a lifeline for this Austrian who supports England and New Zealand and doesn’t get any cricket coverage here! #tailendersoftheworlduniteandtakeover.” Ah thanks. 11th over: India 55-4 (Iyer 29, Pandya 0) Morgan, spoilt for choice, opts to take Curran off after one over and bring back Rashid. Iyer plays a beautiful stroke, an inside-out drive, beating Malan at deep extra: that’s the textbook shot of the day, while Pant gets the prize for improv.10th over: India 48-4 (Iyer 22, Pandya 0) So that’s the half-way stage and India are in some trouble. Are they, to paraphrase Iggy Pop, deeper than the s*** they’re in? We will see. Hardik Pandya’s a handy guy to have around for the last ten overs, and Iyer has been quietly effective.Just when India were clawing their way back, Stokes strikes! Pant clipped him easily off his legs and gave a simple catch to Jonny Bairstow at deep square. That’s the wicket England really wanted, more even than Kohli. Game off again.9th over: India 40-3 (Pant 20, Iyer 15) And here is Sam Curran. He’s got a new hairstyle, choppy rather than floppy, but he still has the unstoppable air of a cartoon mouse. His pace is officially known as waspish, and he even persuades Pant to duck a bouncer. Curran switches to round the wicket for the right-handed Iyer and curses himself as a freebie on the pads brings another leg glance for four. These two have already doubled the score.8th over: India 34-3 (Pant 19, Iyer 10) Eoin Morgan is ringing the changes and now he turns to Ben Stokes, who concedes five singles. That means Sam Curran will be the fifth seamer. It could be worse: he could be his brother Tom, who has been dropped on his 25th birthday. Eoin Morgan has many qualities, but a soft heart isn’t one of them.7th over: India 29-3 (Pant 17, Iyer 7) Shreyas Iyer, facing Wood, gets a tickle on another super-quick ball and picks up four. That’s the first boundary not scored by Pant, who has been on a different plane from his team-mates.“Looks a little bit uneven, this pitch,” says Stuart Broad on commentary. He’s in Wimbledon, WFH. He’ll be doing the OBO next. 6th over: India 22-3 (Pant 16, Iyer 1) Chris Jordan replaces Archer and keeps up the pressure. India manage to get through a whole over, but their top three have had a shocker here: together they made 5 for 3 off 21 balls.5th over: India 20-3 (Pant 15, Iyer 0) Rashid had come off, as he had to if Morgan was to have any options in the middle overs. On came Wood, and he touched 94mph with his third ball, whereas Archer was dawdling along at 90. Great stuff from both of them, and from Morgan.“A decent start for England,” says Simon McMahon. “Socially distanced, outdoor drinks on me if there’s a super over.”Another one! Mark Wood, like Archer, strikes in his first over, finding top speed and rattling the leg bail as Dhawan, under pressure after using up 12 balls, goes for a big swing. 4th over: India 18-2 (Dhawan 3, Pant 14) A single for Dhawan, the first run Archer has conceded. And then Pant pulls out the reverse, and it’s a six! Ramped over the keeper. “Jimmy Anderson is smirking somewhere,” says Nasser Hussain. Pant follows up with a leg glance for four, the right way round. Game on.3rd over: India 7-2 (Dhawan 2, Pant 4) A boundary at last, as Rishabh Pant comes in and cuts Rashid for four as if there’s nothing amiss. But England are on top: their WinViz rating, 42 per cent at the start, has shot up to 62. Kohli’s gone too! Another step away, another mow, connecting this time but going straight to Chris Jordan at mid-off. That’s a goal for Rashid and an assist for Archer, who rattled Kohli’s hand and dented his pride. Oh India. Are you England in disguise?2nd over: India 2-1 (Dhawan 1, Kohli 0) Archer finds some bounce and raps Kohli on the glove. Kohli tries to answer back by stepping away to leg and having a mow, but he misses it. That’s a wicket maiden and a dream start for England’s gun bowler. Jofra Archer strikes with his second ball! It’s a wide half-volley, but quick enough for KL Rahul to be late on it and perhaps jagging back, as he drags it on. First blood to England.1st over: India 2-0 (Dhawan 1, Rahul 1) Rashid, who hasn’t bowled since December, does well to begin with two dots to the left-handed Dhawan. Then he drags one down, but gets away with it as Dhawan’s pull goes to the man at deep square. A single to Rahul too as the openers treat Rashid with respect. What do they think this is, a Test match? The first over will be bowled by ... Adil Rashid.India see England’s one spinner and raise them. Twice over. There’s no Ashwin, but Axar Patel is back for more, so is Washington Sundar, and neither of them is the spin king in this squad – that’s Yuzvendra Chahal. So the two captains seem to have read the pitch quite differently. And the last time that happened on this ground, England took a hammering.The good news for England is: no sign of Rohit Sharma, the batsman of the Test series, although the pundits are confused as they thought he was one of the names Kohli reeled off just now.England bring in Mark Wood, and Jofra Archer has recovered from his bad elbow, so there’s plenty of pace. But no Moeen Ali, and not even a part-time spinner to be Rashid’s wingman. Will they regret that?“Probably would have bowled first as well,” says Virat Kohli, candidly.Eoin Morgan calls heads, heads it is, and he elects to chase. “The wicket looks really good. The last couple of nights, there’s been a bit of dew around.”While we wait for the toss, Yash Gupta has a cunning plan. “If England rather than giving India a thumping in first match and then losing series 4-1, manage to lose first match by a handsome margin, I can see their chances of clinching a series. After all, they would want to avoid the pitch going Hallelujah again once they gain an upper hand in the series, and I guess THEY WILL DO WELL TO REMEMBER IT (whispering in Professor McGonagall’s voice).” Afternoon everyone. Once more unto the crease, dear friends, once more unto the Ahmedabad colosseum. But this time it’s a different ballgame. The clothes are coloured, the ball is white, the timing is congenial for anyone in the West. And the scales are beautifully balanced.This is a shoot-out between the world’s two best teams in T20 internationals. England are top of the ICC rankings, India second. Both of them have four wins in their last five T20 matches, but India have four in their last five against England. They also have home advantage (even a crowd) and our old friend Mo Mentum, who changed sides rather abruptly a month ago. Yesterday Virat Kohli and Eoin Morgan were both busy claiming to be the underdogs. If they were in England, Kohli would be right. As it is, the most likely result, according to Oddschecker, is 3-2 to India. For all Morgan’s mastery, England will be doing well if they avoid a 4-1 defeat – which is what India need to topple them from their perch.The big question for England’s big-hitters is this: how long will it take them to make a mockery of their Test brethren? (Some of whom are the same people.) In their catalogue of capitulation, England scraped 134, 164, 112, 81, 205 and 135. That gave them a team average of 138, which is fewer than they scored in 11 of their last 12 T20s (and the 12th, at Old Trafford, was ruined by rain). In those 12 T20s, they were never once all out. It’s quite an achievement to score more runs when you have only 20 overs to play with, as opposed to all the time in the world. They might even have won the Test series if only they’d handled the pink ball differently and gone hell for lacquer.Will Axar Patel be back to torment them again? Probably only if it’s another turning pitch – in which case Adil Rashid should be able to give India a dose of their own medicine. His fellow leggie, Yuzvendra Chahal, will be licking his lips too. It’s all mouth-watering. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m just going to nip out for a vaccination. See you after 1pm GMT for the toss and the teams."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e3ccf2d7acb9789881cc36d464ad4e6ed68b573/0_116_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=5d96fdcb0e9d97ed09ce1433f45de8a4","title":"can you kick it the definitive womens football quiz","story":"Women’s football has seen its audience rise to a whopping 1.12 billion viewers – but are you one of them?

Playing with her local club from a young age, she knew a big move was inevitable if she wanted to play at the highest level.In fact, it was the young women in the national team, the Football Ferns, who inspired Moore the most.“I think because New Zealand is so remote from everywhere else, I idolised a lot of the girls from our national framework. They’re actually still there now, and I remember when I had my first tour with the Football Ferns and I’d had those players on my wall – then I was going to training with them for the first time.“Players like Abby Erceg, Ria Percival, Amber Hearn, Ali Riley – all those girls were influential because I saw them, and I was like: ‘I want to do that, I want to be in the Football Ferns environment, I want to follow in their footsteps.’”The first leg of her journey was to Germany, where she played first for FC Köln in the women’s Bundesliga during the 2017-18 season. A couple of seasons at Duisburg followed, including a bad injury just ahead of the 2019 Women’s World Cup, before she signed with Liverpool, at the beginning of this season, where she is fitting right in.“Coming from New Zealand, we’re very carefree – we’re just living the life and quite chilled. So I think coming to Liverpool, it’s quite similar to home – you could say there’s a lot of banter between the girls, we get along quite well.”That said, it’s not always easy living so far from home.“I’m quite family-oriented, so that’s a really important thing for me. I regularly keep in contact with my mum and sisters, my grandma – I schedule in weekly video calls, because it’s so important to me. And being so far away, it’s important for me to keep those connections close, to be able to lean on when I need to.”When disaster struck and Moore tore her achilles while training in France ahead of the 2019 Women’s World Cup, she was lucky, she says, that her family was already travelling to Europe on the same day, and so they were present when she woke from surgery.Though Moore realises injury is “part of the game”, a tough time followed as she underwent rehabilitation in Christchurch, New Zealand, afterwards. However, it was in these difficult moments that she realised who the most important figures in her journey were. Her family, and in particular, her mum, who she describes as her “rock”, and says she is on the phone to straight away regardless of the 13-hour time difference, whenever she has a problem.She also hailed her physiotherapist, Tamsin, as a key figure in her recovery.“I couldn’t have done it without her, and I do think you notice in those sorts of times how important the people around you are – how much you can, and need to rely on them to get through it.”But Moore isn’t used to being confined to one place for too long. She loves travel and long journeys – in which she makes sure she always has some good music and a book with her when she’s on the road. But she is getting settled in Liverpool now and, as a big coffee drinker, can’t wait for normality to resume so she can explore some of the city’s cafes.Another thing Moore misses is playing in full stadiums. “The people make the atmosphere, and the people make the game, so to be able to play in a packed stadium again will be pretty cool,” she says.“It’s always nice to be able to play in front of people and hear them cheering behind you, but we know that it’s not possible right now and since coming here I have felt a lot of love.”In terms of where she wants to be next, there is only one destination, she says: “Anfield.”Expedia believes that travel, like football, is better experienced together.

She’s played for Canada under-20s, and spent four years at West Virginia University, but Liverpool has always been her dream destination. With strong family ties to the city, it feels fitting to her that this is where she has started her professional career.“I don’t think I had a choice when I was born,” she says, “I supported Liverpool for as long as I can remember.”Foster’s paternal grandparents were born and raised in the Wavertree area of Liverpool and travelled to Canada after the second world war. Though her father was born in Canada, Foster says the connection to Liverpool never left.“It was something that was in a sense drilled into me as a young kid, watching the matches every weekend with my dad or my mum, and my sisters on the couch,” she says.Her grandparents were also key figures in her early footballing aspirations.“My grandparents used to come to my matches and there were always words of wisdom: ‘Just keep your elbows up and don’t let anyone take you down. If someone comes close just give them a little knock – whatever you’ve got to do to keep strong.’”After her beloved grandmother passed away in 2013, Foster had the words of the famous Liverpool anthem You’ll Never Walk Alone tattooed on one of her biceps in memoriam. It was, she says, a reminder that her grandmother would always be with her.“But it also rooted me into my culture. I just wanted to have that reminder to keep going forward and keep representing my family, but also the Liverpool crest with as much pride as I could.“To be the first one to be able to return back to Liverpool and to have roots here to start something new and carry on the Foster name in the city is an honour.”Foster’s family is clearly as integral to her football journey as much as the physical one she has taken to be here, acting as her cheerleaders and support network.She started playing football around the age of five, when her father took her and her sisters to the local park. These are, she says, some of her fondest memories. But as well as starting her on her journey, her family gave so much and put everything else aside to make sure she was able to fulfil her potential.Not living close to a competitive training ground, her entire family would follow her for the hour-and-a-half journey to practice and back.“My dad would leave early to come and pick me up, my mum would take my sisters and they would miss time with their friends and do their homework in the car.”Given how close they are, and how meaningful her career move is to the entire family, it’s not ideal, says Foster, that they can’t be with her at the moment. Her sisters were able to visit during the year she has been in Liverpool, and her mother also came with her when she first signed with the club. Next, she really hopes her dad will be able to visit.“It’s been a dream for me to make that happen,” she says. “Just be at a match together, for him to see the Kop and be in that experience, that environment, would mean the world to me.”Although Foster hasn’t had much time with the club under Covid-free circumstances, having joined in January 2020, she’s already had a taste of the incredible fanbase Liverpool are known for.“The football culture here is amazing. We talk about the fans, but it’s not even that it’s a thing that they love, it’s like a religion, which is how I’ve felt all my life – so to be immersed in a culture like that is so fun and so cool.”“When I walk on to the pitch and hear You’ll Never Walk Alone, it kind of hits home a little bit more. It actually brings a tear to my eye every time I hear it.”Since she’s been in Liverpool, she’s been impressed by the food culture and lists Bold Street as one of her must-visit places. She’s also enjoyed travelling by foot to take in the historic buildings, particularly around the docks, as well as getting to know her fellow scousers.“If I’m wearing the kit in town it’s an automatic conversation. Other cities I’ve been in, they don’t really care to have that conversation, they kind of look at you and walk by, but people here want to get to know you and know where you’re from. I think it’s so cool to be able to make those connections.”Finally, of course, there’s Anfield itself, which is, in her opinion, “breathtaking”.Though it may have been chaotic at times, Foster is proud to have travelled so much, and is grateful for the opportunities football has given her.“When you’re going there for football you get a different feel for these countries, you don’t get the resort style stuff you get to see the inner cities and what the people are like – you can talk to the people and relate to them. I’m pretty lucky to be able to learn while being able to experience some of the greatest places in the world.”But that doesn’t mean she’s not keen to enjoy some leisurely travel too. She’s looking forward to seeing the Blue Lagoon in Iceland and surfing in Hawaii when things get back to normal. “I don’t think I’d be very good at surfing,” she ponders, “but I’ll try it.”Expedia believes that travel, like football, is better experienced together.

Now, at only 19, she’s one of Liverpool FC Women’s brightest stars. Here, she talks about the people who have been with her all the wayFor homegrown talent Missy Bo Kearns, playing at Anfield is the dream. Though the 19-year-old’s career may have grown – like many others – from humble beginnings, she is well connected in the local football community, and counts Liverpool royalty Jamie Carragher as one of her confidants.“I think growing up Steven Gerrard was my idol and I always looked up to him,” she says. “But now, I speak to Jamie Carragher quite regularly – he’s my dad’s friend – and he gives me the best advice I’ve probably had in football. He’s always there if I need to ask him anything, and I know he’s been there himself.”If that wasn’t enough, Kearns also credits Lioness, Atlético Madrid forward and ex-Everton player Toni Duggan as having been instrumental in her career. Duggan was a huge source of inspiration to the young footballer, having attended the same youth club in Liverpool.Kearns started playing football at the age of four with her cousins in the garden, and joined a local team with her cousin. She trialled and signed for Liverpool at the age of eight, and worked her way through each of the age groups at the club before breaking through into the first team last year. Though, it could have been different for the midfielder.Female role models are important in this game, with the age-old adage: if you can’t see it, you can’t be it – and Kearns hopes to return the favour one day.“Knowing what Toni has done for me, if I can do that for other young girls, that’s amazing – it’s got me where I am today. So if I can help, I’d love to.”Another important female figure in her football journey is her grandmother, who she says she has successfully converted to the beautiful game.“Believe it or not, she never used to watch football,” Kearns says. “But now she’s starting to get into it more. She used to watch when it was just me, but now she’ll watch actual games on the TV.”Kearns’s grandma also fulfilled the role of backroom staff as well as fanbase, and would pick her up from school, get her ready and take her to training. Several times a week, whatever the weather, she was always ready to help.“If she’d not done that while my parents were at work, I wouldn’t be where I am today. I’m grateful for what she’s done for me.”Like many of her fellow Liverpudlians, Kearns is an avid football fan, as well as a player, and is part of what she thinks of as “one big family”.“I was watching football in the house before I even played it. I was going to Anfield, so I’ve been brought up into football and I think being a Liverpool fan, it makes you want to follow football more because of the passion and how big a club it is. It’s just unbelievable when you’re in the stadiums feeling it, home and away, how much it actually means to the fans watching the team.”In her free time, as well as hanging out with friends in the city, and particularly the Royal Albert Dock, Kearns is a regular in the stands at Anfield, and appreciates the role of fans both as a player and supporter.“I think for us, as the women’s team, when the fans are there you feel like you’ve got more players on the pitch. You feel privileged that they’ve come out to watch you and support you.”Kearns has big aspirations for her career, hoping to get Liverpool back into the Women’s Super League, and hopefully winning some trophies.When she’s on the road now, to the slightly less exotic locations of Charlton in south-east London, and Maiden Castle in Durham, you’ll most likely find her with best friend Jade Bailey on the team bus, and she takes her PlayStation 5 with her everywhere to “relax”, she says. She hopes there might be some longer journeys in the future, though.“There’s loads of places I’d like to play,” she says, quickly clarifying, “as an away team, though.”Anfield is the dream, she says, but she thinks Barcelona’s famous Nou Camp would be a “good experience”. And she’d like to experience the atmosphere at Ajax’s Johan Cruyff Arena.“I just think Ajax fans are brilliant,” she says of the Dutch Ereisie club.She’d also love to play at German Bundesliga club Borussia Dortmund’s Westfalenstadion for the atmosphere and another familiar reason.“They sing You’ll Never Walk Alone, too,” she says, referencing Liverpool’s famous anthem. “I’d probably get goosebumps.”Expedia believes that travel, like football, is better experienced together.

Here too, the Christian Democrats could be left out in the cold as a result of their polling lead having disappeared in the wake of kickback allegations over mask procurement deals and a growing frustration with a sluggish vaccination rollout overseen by CDU ministers.For leader Armin Laschet, who has led the conservative outfit for less than two months but hopes to take Merkel’s mantle in September, the two state elections could provide a sobering reality check.“The danger for Laschet is that his leadership qualities will come into question before he has fully settled in his job”, said Thorsten Faas, a political scientist at Berlin’s Free University.“After the votes on Sunday there will be strategic attempts to blame the mask affair and weak candidates”, Faas said. “But one thing is quite clear: the government’s ratings, and especially those of the CDU, only shot up because of the pandemic – and now they are going down again”.How low the hegemon of German postwar politics can fall remains the great unknown. Recent polls still show the CDU as the strongest force in the country, at roughly the same share of the vote it received in 2017.And whether the second-placed Green party under leadership duo Annalena Baerbock and Robert Habeck can simply take its place on the national stage by copying their success story in Baden-Württemberg is questionable.“Kretschmann provides a blueprint for stealing a march on the Christian Democratic Union among the middle-class electorate”, Schulte wrote in a recent article for ta.“But such a cautious course of modernisation is far too slow in the face of the escalating climate crisis it would even fall short of an orientation on the Paris agreement, the minimal goal of a Green coalition government”.Kretschmann’s consensual approach has involved compromises that have made the more leftwing quarters of his party wince, such as a proposal for a scrappage scheme to incentivise the purchase of new diesel and petrol cars, designed to support automobile companies struggling during the pandemic.It has also created space for the foundation of a small new ecological party, Klimaliste Baden-Württemberg, which will compete for Green seats at Sunday’s vote.Signalling too much of Kretschmann’s flexibility in the run-up to the September vote, some Green supporters fear, could damage the party’s standing just as they limber up to play a role in the next government.They point a warning finger at Austria, where the Greens entered a power-sharing deal with chancellor Sebastian Kurz’s conservatives in 2020 but have been outmuscled in a symbolic battle over the country’s asylum policy. Instead of becoming Germany’s next indispensable political force, the Greens could also go down in history as the conservative’s litter-bearers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee0416ec991144564ad91605c5ce639a74cf1e52/0_268_4181_2509/master/4181.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=cebc7fd2519b1774ce198d22096e61ec","title":"uk covid live news wales restrictions coronavirus matt hancock vaccine latest updates","story":"Latest updates: ONS survey reveals 1 in 270 in England had virus last week non-essential retail to remain closed in Wales despite measures easingMark Drakeford has defended plans to allow supermarkets to sell non-essential goods ahead of non-essential shops opening in Wales (see 12.57pm.).The first minister said Welsh households would be able to purchase non-essential goods in supermarkets from 22 March for the first time since before Christmas. He said:It is safer to do it with shops that are open already because they are already having to comply with all the strict standards that we strengthened in the regulations we passed in the Senedd in January.So we know that these are safe places to visit and I know that environmental health officers of local authorities will be visiting those settings in the coming week to make sure that they are ready to continue to operate in that way after 22 March.Drakeford said the retail sector had advised that it needed time to reopen safely, to return staff from furlough and to demonstrate they could comply with standards in Wales. He added:I was also anxious about opening non-essential retail in the full sense here in Wales while no shops at all for non-essential purposes are open in England because that acts as a perverse incentive for people to travel across the border.That would be to break the rules in England and to break the rules in Wales but you don’t want to create the conditions in which it is more tempting for people to do that.A “mixed picture” across the UK this week, with the number of people infected with Covid-19 continuing to fall across England, but appearing to be levelling off in Northern Ireland and Scotland, PA Media reports.New estimates from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that around one in 270 people in private households in England had coronavirus between February 28 and March 6 – the equivalent of 200,600 people.This is down from around one in 220, or 248,100 people, for the period 21-27 February. It is the lowest figure since the week to 24 September when the estimate stood at one in 470, or 116,600 people.However, the number of people infected in England is still high when compared to last summer. In the week to 25 August, around one in 2,000 people had coronavirus.Meanwhile, the latest data for Wales shows around one in 365 people are estimated to have had Covid-19 between 28 February and 6 March – down from one in 285 the week before.In Northern Ireland, around one in 310 people were infected, up from one in 325.The estimate for Scotland was around one in 320 people, up from one in 335 the previous week.The ONS said the percentage of people testing positive has decreased in a majority of regions in England but there were “early signs of a possible increase ... in the south-east and south-west.”Sarah Crofts, senior statistician for the Covid-19 Infection Survey, said: We are seeing a mixed picture across the UK this week. It’s reassuring to see infection levels in the majority of English regions also continuing to decrease - however, it’s important for us to remain cautious and closely monitor those regions that are not showing a clear decrease. These are in the south of England, Yorkshire and the Humber and the West Midlands.”In England the estimates for the latest six-week period are based on 529,020 swab tests.Meanwhile, government scientific advisers said the latest reproduction number (the R) estimate for the UK is between 0.6 and 0.8, down from 0.7 and 0.9 last week.It comes after data on Thursday showed more than 23 million people have now had their first dose of a vaccine.The coronavirus reproduction number, or R value, across the UK is between 0.6 and 0.8, according to the latest UK government figures.R represents the average number of people each Covid-19 positive person goes on to infect. When the figure is above 1, an outbreak can grow exponentially, but when it is below 1, it means the epidemic is shrinking.Afternoon!

Your thoughts on what we should be covering are always welcome.Hammerson, the beleaguered owner of the Bullring and Brent Cross shopping centres, has warned it will need to sell more of its property empire to survive the coronavirus crisis, after reporting a £1.7bn loss for 2020.The property group, which also owns the Bicester Village designer outlet, said the closure of non-essential shops during lockdowns and the suspension of rent payments for struggling retailers in 2020 fuelled the biggest annual fall in rental income in company history. Annual losses more than doubled from £781m in 2019 to £1.7bn last year.Stanley Erck, president and chief executive officer at Novavax, said: “We are very encouraged by the data showing that NVX-CoV2373 not only provided complete protection against the most severe forms of disease, but also dramatically reduced mild and moderate disease across both trials. Importantly, both studies confirmed efficacy against the variant strains.”Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health, University of Southampton, said: One note of caution is the observed lower effectiveness against B.1.351 variant of concern, as first observed in South Africa. This shows the impact variants can have upon the pandemic response and thus is a strong argument for keeping cases as low as possible whilst the burden of Covid-19 is high.However, there is still a clear protective effect there in the Novavax trial, and data from across all the Covid-19 vaccines suggests that they will be hugely protective against severe illness from all variants, which is still an excellent outcome.A study into the impact of vaccination on transmission is “very encouraging”, the Scottish health secretary, Jeane Freeman, has said.Speaking at the coronavirus briefing in Edinburgh, Freeman said: It’s obviously very encouraging data indeed. We’ve already seen the impact the vaccination programme is having on deaths in care homes and increasingly in the community.Today’s study adds to the growing evidence that vaccination can also help reduce the transmission of the virus.Most non-essential retail will remain shut in Wales until April 12, the first minister, Mark Drakeford, said earlier.The announcement comes as a blow to parts of the industry that were expecting an earlier reopening date, with Drakeford previously saying the restart would be considered for this week’s review of coronavirus restrictions.Businesses said the Welsh government had left them with “the impression of being marched to the top of the hill, only to be asked to walk back down again”, while the Welsh Conservatives claimed the move was a “U-turn” and Plaid Cymru accused Mr Drakeford of offering “false hope”.It came as Drakeford confirmed Wales would move to a “stay local” period from Saturday for a fortnight before a further easing of travel rules in time for Easter, with self-contained holiday accommodation to be reopened from 27 March “if the public health situation continues to improve”.Today’s top comment so far, courtesy of Lord_Snooty:Yes, today is the first anniversary of Herd Immunity Day — Dominic Cummings’ pseudo scientific disaster plan, pumped out uncritically by pundits. They claim that the delay to locking down was a key factor in Britain having one of the highest coronavirus death rates in the world.On this day last year, ITV political editor Robert Peston wrote in the Spectator:The key phrase we all need to understand is ‘herd immunity’ – which is what happens to a group of people or animals when they develop sufficient antibodies to be resistant to a disease.The strategy of the British government in minimising the impact of Covid-19 is to allow the virus to pass through the entire population so that we acquire herd immunity, but at a much delayed speed so that those who suffer the most acute symptoms are able to receive the medical support they need, and such that the health service is not overwhelmed and crushed by the sheer number of cases it has to treat at any one time.The kind of coercive measures employed by China in Wuhan and Hubei have simply locked the virus behind the closed doors of people’s homes. And just as soon as the constraints on freedom of movement are lifted there, the monstrous virus will rear its hideous face again.Welsh first minister Mark Drakeford is now taking questions at his press conference.Infection rates across England and Wales are decreasing while those in Northern Ireland and Scotland appear to be levelling off, an official survey suggests. The Office for National Statistics estimates that just over 230,000 had Covid by the end of last week.In England, the number of people with Covid-19 in the week ending 6 March was 1 in 270 people, the lowest lowest since the week ending 1 October when it was 1 in 240.Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, has revealed that the pressures of his job extended to the bedroom, when he answered questions during the Association of School and College Leaders virtual annual conference this morning.“My wife is a teaching assistant and it’s always interesting, because I obviously get quite a bit of lobbying, our pillow talk is maybe a little bit different, she is always highlighting various issues where maybe the Department for Education hasn’t always got it perfect all the time,” Williamson said. “It’s always good to hear it from the frontline,” he added.“At every stage, I hear it from my wife, who is a teaching assistant, my brother, who is a teacher, about actually how schools have been so incredibly adaptable as well.”Asked about his own well-being during lockdown, Williamson revealed: “Like a lot of families we seem to have made an investment in a puppy during that time. One thing about pets is that they always seem pleased to see you, especially dogs. So that combination, families and dogs, are probably the things that keep you sane.”Confirming the old adage that if you want a friend in politics, get a dog. At least they don’t lobby you on your department’s failings on free school meals.Williamson lavished praise on the teaching profession for its work during what he called “the single greatest disruption to our education system since the second world war”. He told the delegates: “I can’t thank you enough for what you have done.”A government fund established to prop up the arts and heritage sectors during the coronavirus pandemic has handed over little more than half of the money it has allocated, Whitehall’s spending watchdog has discovered.The National Audit Office said the culture recovery fund had budgeted for £830m in grants and loans funding so far, but only £495m had been paid out.Early anecdotes from long Covid patients who have received the vaccine demonstrate that responses may be varied, with some patients reporting an alleviation of symptoms and others experiencing more intense side-effects.

Currently only Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are being administerd to over-70s in the State.Speaking on Friday, Dr Denis McCauley, chairman of the GP committee of the Irish Medical Organisation, warned changing the programme – currently based on the use of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines – could cause confusion.He said he would be “loath to have any dramatic change to the system without it being carefully considered and planned”. He said that there is a “supply guarantee” in the four weeks to come based on mRNA vaccines manufactured by Pfizer and Moderna for the over-70s, and “to change it midway could cause confusion among the over-70s”.“The dust is settlinng on the present system GPs and patients understand it,” he said. “The rollout of the mRNA vaccines is going very well, and we would hope that it would continue.” In addition to chronic supply issues associated with the AstraZeneca shot, some European countries have curtailed its use following reports a small number of people had developed clots after receiving the vaccine. However, the European medicines regulator has said there is no indication of an increased risk of blood clots assocaited with the shot. In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority said the nature of the reports did not raise a concern. The office of the chief medical officer, located in the Department of Health, is currently considering the NIAC advice and will then send its own advice to Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly. Earlier, the chairwoman of NIAC, Prof Karina Butler, had said Scottish data about the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine in the over-70s had shown equal efficacy and therefore gave more flexibility for use in all age groups. NIAC has given updated advice to the chief medical officer that the AstraZeneca vaccine can be used in all age groups. “We are now spoiled for choice with vaccines,” Prof Butler told RTÉ radio’s Today with Claire Byrne show. “It is down to logistics now and when they will be delivered.”The AstraZeneca vaccine had been in use in the United Kingdom since January 4th, and there were now reports in three scientific publications on “real world effectiveness”, she said, adding the positive data from Scotland now provided a little more flexibility.When asked about patients refusing the AstraZeneca vaccine, Prof Butler said such refusals were based on a lack of understanding. She said there would not be a choice, and she encouraged patients to take what they were offered, all were very effective. “All vaccines have proven to be extremely effective.”The effectiveness rates of AstraZeneca were no different from the MRNA vaccines – Pfizer and Moderna, she said.There was assessment ongoing in relation to clotting concerns reported in Denmark, and there was always a risk on balance, she said, but added the risk of clotting could be down to other reasons. Studies had indicated very little difference between those who had taken the vaccine and those who had taken the placebo, Prof Butler added.In the EU there had been five million doses of AstraZeneca administered and only 30 clotting events, which was a very small number that could have been seen anyway due to other factors, she said.The longer time between doses of AstraZeneca was an advantage as it gave the opportunity for more people to be vaccinated, said Prof Butler.Supply chainsEarlier Mr Donnelly said he had been communicating with the AstraZeneca representative for Ireland to convey the Government’s frustration with the revised volumes and delivery dates.The representative had admitted that the company was facing “complex” problems with supply chains, the Minister said. AstraZeneca was doing everything they could and accepted that their actions were causing “real anxiety for people on the ground,” said Mr Donnelly on RTÉ Radio’s Morning Ireland. “They have committed to doing everything they can to fix that.”High-level communications were also ongoing between AstraZeneca and the EU’s steering committee about supply for the European Union, according to the Minister. Mr Donnelly said he did not think there was “any funny business going on” about supply of the vaccine to the United Kingdom and the United States. Ireland will keep up the pressure to get the supplies that were contacted and promised, he said, adding time mattters and that it was important to get people vaccinated quicker so the country could open up.When asked if the Taoiseach would raise the issue of the 30 million doses of AstraZeneca preordered by the United States where it has not yet been approved, Mr Donnelly said if Mr Martin believed raising this would be of use he would do so.Mr Donnelly said the Health Service Executive (HSE) is making “significant changes” to address the issues with delivery of doses of the vaccine to general practices around the country. He also said 99 per cent of the target for the vaccination of the over-85 age group has been met.The Minister acknowledged distribution problems had caused anxiety for patients. The director general of the HSE, Paul Reid, has said a range of new supports have been put in place by the HSE to improve distribution of vaccines to general practices.A call centre, relationship managers and specific plans for practices too small to participate in the buddy system had all been introduced he told RTÉ Radio’s Today with Claire Byrne show. If deliveries were ramped up the HSE could cope, he said. Generally deliveries from Pfizer and Moderna had been “consistent and good”, but if there was short notice about a delivery being cancelled “that impacts us,” he said.The AstraZeneca delivery issue was not just for Ireland – it was a problem for Europe, he added. “We built our plans on the reliability of deliveries, we paid up front.”Discussions were ongoing with AstraZeneca and the HSE was going to sit down with Johnson \u0026amp Johnson to discuss delivery schedules for the 600,000 doses pre-ordered for the second quarter, he said.

Since then, over 200,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,000 people have died.Globally, over 100 million people have been diagnosed and over 2.5\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Scientists have been racing to develop a vaccine that would bring an end to the pandemic, and there are now 64 different vaccines in clinical development, with another 173 in preclinical development, according to the World Health Organisation.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspis also in talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva. 157,072 had received their second dose.Some 170,570 of these vaccines had gone to people in long term residential care facilities, while 273,215 had gone to frontline healthcare workers and 108,932 had gone to people over the age of 70. Some\u0026nbsp295 people in Cohort 4 - those\u0026nbspaged between 16 and 69 at very high risk of severe Covid-19 disease - received a dose.\u0026nbspGlobally, over 300 million doses of a Covid-19 vaccine have been administered.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 5.4 million doses by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.Two doses of the vaccine, four weeks apart, are needed to offer the best protection against Covid. However, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc. While talks continue on how to increase production, the company has now committed to a total of 40 million doses for the EU in the first quarter of 2021.While the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab, resulting in a significant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.How many will Ireland get? 190,000 doses in February and a further 95,000 in early March - supply after this is not confirmed.Storage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and expects to have its first results by April 2021. On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?In December the HSE published the provisional order in which people in Ireland will be vaccinated against Covid-19. After over-65s in care homes and frontline health workers, people aged 70 and older and other healthcare workers are next in line to receive the vaccine.\u0026nbspPeople aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions will then be\u0026nbspthe fourth cohort to be vaccinated.The next categories are: people aged 65-69 years an ill-defined group referred to as “key workers” and people aged 18-64 with certain medical conditions. Next up will be: those living or working in crowded conditions people working in education those aged 55-64 workers in other occupations important to the functioning of society people aged between 18 and 54 and, finally, pregnant women and those under 18.The vaccination of people aged over 85 began on Monday, February 15th. Those in the 70-84 age bracket should begin to receive their first dose by March 8th, alongside people aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions.The HSE has said everyone over the age of 70 should have received their second dose by mid-May.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4508649.1615555586!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"one in four now testing positive for covid 19 are asymptomatic","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIntensive care unit (ICU) admissions have been decreasing since the week ending January 8th.

However, the percentage of cases in that age group has been decreasing over the last five weeks from 18 per cent to 8 per cent.Number of contactsThe average number of contacts per positive case per week was three, a marked reduction from six in late December.Dublin has the highest average contacts rate at almost four per positive case and in the week under review, it accounted for 1,272 (45 per cent) of all new cases.Of the deaths recorded, 11 were in Dublin with the next highest counties being Cork (6) and Donegal (5).It is the eighth week in a row that Co Leitrim recorded fewer than 50 new cases, the sixth week for Co Roscommon, and the fourth for Co Sligo.In the last four weeks 4,230 cases have been linked to an outbreak which is defined as cases among two or more people.Those aged under 24 accounted for 42 per cent of all cases linked to an outbreak during this period. There were 505 cases (12 per cent) linked to workplaces.A further 432 (10 per cent) were in nursing homes, 189 (4 per cent) in hospitals or a community hospitallong-stay unit and 269 (6 per cent) in residential institutions.The process of measuring outbreaks is currently taking longer than normal because of disease levels, the CSO data points out, and so the number of those in private homes is considered an underestimate.“Similarly while every effort is being made to link cases to outbreaks as quickly as possible, there can sometimes be a delay.”Referrals for testing continued to decrease in the week however there was a small increase, from 5,281 to 5,327, among children up to the age of 14.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4507755.1615476187!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"peak twins more born than ever before but rate likely to drop","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t‘The absolute number of twin deliveries has increased everywhere except in South America.’ Photograph: iStockMore human twins are being born than ever before, mainly due to medically assisted reproduction and women giving birth at an older age, according to the first global overview published on Friday.Since the 1980s the twinning rate has increased by one-third from 9 to 12 per 1,000 deliveries, meaning about 1.6 million twins are born each year worldwide and one in every 42 children born is a twin.“A major cause of this increase is the growth in medically assisted reproduction, which includes not only IVF techniques, but also simpler methods, such as ovarian stimulation and artificial insemination,” the study, published in the journal Human Reproduction, concludes.Another factor is delay in childbearing observed in many countries over recent decades, since the twinning rate increases with the mother’s age.However, the researchers think the peak in twinning rates may have been reached, particularly in high-income countries in Europe and North America, because of increasing emphasis on the importance of trying to achieve “singleton pregnancies”.Prof Christiaan Monden of the University of Oxford said: “The relative and absolute numbers of twins in the world are higher than they have ever been since the mid-20th century, and this is likely to be an all-time high. This is important as twin deliveries are associated with higher death rates among babies and children and more complications for mothers and children during pregnancy, and during and after delivery.”Substantial increasesWith Prof Gilles Pison of the French Museum of Natural History and Prof Jeroen Smits of Radboud University in the Netherlands, they collected information on twinning rates for the period 2010-2015 from 165 countries, covering 99 per cent of the world’s population. For 112 countries, they obtained information on twinning rates for 1980-1985.They found substantial increases in twinning rates in many European countries, North America and Asia. For 74 per cent out of 112 countries for which data was available for both periods, the increase was more than 10 per cent. There was a 32 per cent increase in Asia and a 71 per cent increase in North America.Prof Monden said: “In both periods Africa had the highest twinning rates and there was no significant increase over time. However, Europe, North America and the Oceanic countries are catching up rapidly. About 80 per cent of all twin deliveries in the world now take place in Asia and Africa.”The twinning rate in Africa is so high because of high numbers of “dizygotic twins” – born from two separate eggs. This is most likely to be due to genetic differences between the African population and others.“The absolute number of twin deliveries has increased everywhere except in South America. In North America and Africa, the numbers have increased by more than 80 per cent, and in Africa this increase is almost entirely caused by population growth,” Prof Monden said.Because infant mortality among twins has been going down, many more of the twins born in the second period of the study will grow up as twins compared with those born in the early 1980s.“However, more attention needs to be paid to the fate of twins in low- and middle-income countries,” Prof Smits noted. “In sub-Saharan Africa in particular, many twins will lose their co-twin in their first year of life, some 200,000-300,000 each year ... While twinning rates in many rich western countries are now getting close to those in sub-Saharan Africa, there is a huge difference in the survival chances.”"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"world view how andrew cuomo went from covid hero to pariah","story":"Suzanne Lynch on the fall from grace of New York State governor Andrew Cuomo, whose early handling of the pandemic won him praise but is now subject to increasing scrutiny, and whose declining fortunes have been worsened by accusations of sexual harassment.The \u0027 unrivalled foreign affairs coverage, now brought to you in weekly podcast form.

It’s an official video about the Chancellor’s first year in the Treasury, now viewed a million times on social media. An envious No10 has responded with its own film: a Mission Impossible about how Boris Johnson and his team procured a vaccine against unthinkable odds.Their film isn’t ready yet but No10 has released a trailer, with Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance given starring roles. There’s a dramatic backdrop, rousing music – and an obvious problem. It’s not clear to anyone how this ends.After locking us all down, these gentlemen certainly have a captive audience for their videos – who, under the roadmap, have plenty time to watch things at home. And this is the point. In spite of all of this success, not just procuring but inventing Covid vaccines, Brits are still stuck under one of the most stringent lockdowns in the developed world. And denied any of the vaccine idends being offered abroad.Vaccinated Americans have been told they can now meet each other indoors, given how unlikely they are to catch or pass on the virus. No such latitude for the fully-vaccinated Brits. Israel has reopened, with Tel Aviv cafes now buzzing.It’s not as if Britain still has dangerously high virus levels: ours are almost the lowest in Europe. Ministers have been astonished at how few pupils tested positive in the lateral flow tests deployed for school reopenings this week. But the Prime Minister set his earliest date for a full reopening – June 21 – before any of this was apparent.His No10 narrative is simple: stay at home. We’re almost there. Let’s keep going: just three more months and we can all get back to normal. But this isn’t quite right.When Britain reopens, we can expect a third wave of Covid. It won’t be nearly as big, thanks to the vaccines. But not everyone will be protected and no jab is 100 per cent effective. So we should expect more illness, hospitalisation and Covid deaths. Then, perhaps, panic – and pressure for a fourth lockdown.The scientists are trying to talk about this risk, even if politicians are in denial. Earlier this week, Whitty warned MPs not to think that Covid “just goes away” after lockdown with “no further deaths”. Whitty’s models may have a bad reputation by now but less pessimistic models from Bristol University show the same thing: deaths falling away to almost nothing, but rising markedly over the summer once commuting, parties and festivals start. Next winter, it’s quite possible that Covid is as bad as flu.It will then be the job of Whitty and Vallance to explain why all this is tolerable, as long as the new cases don’t overwhelm the health service (which, with all these vaccinations, they shouldn’t). It will be a very difficult message for them to deliver: that Britain has to learn (or relearn) how to live with the risk. Not out of callousness or obsession with money, but from an acknowledgment that it’s lives vs lives. Going back to lockdowns would inflict harm that, this time, would far outweigh the benefits.Much of Europe is already edging in this direction. Bookshops and barbers have reopened in France, clothes shops have reopened in Denmark. Neighbours can now meet for dinner in Germany. All of these countries have more Covid than Britain (Germany has just announced a third wave) but they take the view that stricter lockdown would inflict more pain than was acceptable.Everyone knows that lockdowns are a tradeoff. But to say so, now, has become borderline heresy in Westminster. As I understand it, the Cabinet has never been briefed about the cost of the current lockdown – on mental health, cancer diagnosis or financial tradeoffs. For example, we’re told that nurses can’t be given a decent pay rise because there’s no money: it would cost about £200 million a year. A single day of lockdown costs far more than this. To govern is to choose.If we had a functioning Labour Party there would be plenty of causes for it to champion. We know, from last time, what lockdown does: the NSPCC says calls to its child abuse hotline rose by 49 per cent. Alcohol deaths rose by 16 per cent.Then there is the horrendous backlog in criminal court cases: it has a huge impact, not least in leaving criminals at large. Police are in despair over all this: one senior officer recently told me that many rape cases are now unlikely to be heard for years. It’s a growing emergency, receiving hardly any attention. We can add to this thousands of undiagnosed cancer cases, the 800 million lost school days and the collapse of rehabilitation in prisons.The US decision to allow vaccinated people (mainly pensioners) to meet again is driven by scientific knowledge that loneliness kills as surely as Covid: the unvisited elderly are more likely to succumb to Alzheimer’s or other diseases. Ministers will need to talk about all this when they come to lift lockdown.But for now, Johnson’s problem isn’t too much bad news: it’s too much good news. The vaccine has been even more successful that was hoped for at the beginning of the year. The real-world evidence from Israel shows the figure for Pfizer in trials – 95 per cent – was too pessimistic: it’s come in closer to 97 per cent. Oxford is not far behind. The vaccine effect on transmission, too, seems extraordinary: which may help explain collapsing cases in Britain. So it’s easy to see why No10 is itching to tell its good news story, or make the film that it understandably feels should be shown to the world.The scientists did their job. But politicians need to do theirs: this won’t just mean making proper use of the vaccine opportunity but being honest about how tough things will still be in months ahead.Just as lockdown posed tradeoffs, so will reopening. So perhaps the Prime Minister might want to wait a while before releasing the final version of his movie: it may be quite some time before he can declare anything resembling triumph.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"president xi sowing seeds destruction","story":"China’s “Parliament” yesterday approved Xi Jinping’s proposal that, in future, the Chinese government will decide who can stand for election to Hong Kong’s legislature. They thereby destroyed what is left of Hong Kong’s political freedom. In what must have been a nail-biting vote, the National People’s Congress approved the measure by 2,895 to 0. The brave people of Hong Kong will, in future, see their own local parliament reduced to such a hollow farce.The harsh reality is that the Chinese government has the power to do whatever it likes regarding Hong Kong. But it is destroying the goose that has been laying the golden eggs for the last 60 years. As Hong Kong becomes indistinguishable from mainland China, the great international companies that flocked there because it practised the rule of law will, in future, move their businesses to, or set up in, Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan or elsewhere.Xi likes to suggest to the world that it is Chinese communism that has transformed China into an economic superpower over the past 20 years and that this justifies the party’s dictatorship over the people. Such a claim is demonstrable nonsense. China would have been where it is now 40 years ago but for communist economics, the Cultural Revolution and the so-called Great Leap Forward. We know that because China is only now catching up with Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong, which became economic successes in the Sixties and Seventies and are still far more prosperous. Nor did they have to surrender their liberty in order to achieve economic growth. Indeed, the people of South Korea and Taiwan overthrew dictatorships on their march to both prosperity and freedom.However, the tragedy of Hong Kong does not exist in isolation. Xi is not as bad as Chairman Mao but he has imposed more surveillance and control over the Chinese people than at any time since the demise of the Great Helmsman.Hong Kong is, moreover, only one facet of his increasingly aggressive policy. The Uighurs, in the west of China, are facing a degree of persecution that amounts to cultural genocide. All of China’s Asian neighbours are being bullied by Beijing. Taiwan is threatened with invasion and India has had soldiers killed on the Chinese-Indian border. China has antagonised the countries of south-east Asia, including communist Vietnam, by occupying and militarising islets in the South China Sea. Japan and South Korea have rejected Chinese claims to islands which are part of their territory.Inidually, these provocations are difficult to resist. But the effect of this behaviour is that all of China’s neighbours, together with Australia and the United States, are coming together to contain Beijing. India, which remained non-aligned throughout the Cold War and never split with the Soviet Union, has now joined with the United States, Japan and Australia in an unprecedented “Quad” (Quadrilateral Security Dialogue), which is meeting today to discuss how to resist Chinese aggression.The Pacific and the Indian Oceans are no longer separate. We now have the Indo-Pacific geopolitical region, which combines all the countries resisting Xi’s foreign policy.Xi is strong enough to ensure that he can achieve short-term gains by throwing China’s weight around. But he is a poor strategist who is causing deep harm to China’s long-term interests.Many in China, including in the Communist Party, and perhaps some in the Politburo, must be asking what is so clever about uniting all of China’s Asian neighbours – from Tokyo, through south-east Asia to Delhi – with the United States and Australia, to work and plan together to contain the People’s Republic?Deng Xiaoping, when he ruled China 40 years ago, warned his successors not to throw their weight around and bully their neighbours when China became economically powerful.Xi is ignoring that advice. In doing so he threatens and undermines the future of his own country. He may also be undermining himself.

And in an interview last summer, Vine said the age of the audience was the deciding factor.“I did more than 1,000 episodes and it’s one of the most successful TV shows in the history of British television, but I think what’s happened is it’s fallen victim to the BBC’s understandable desire to pull in 16-24-year-olds,” he said.Channel 5 has ordered 40 episodes and is understood to be retaining the current team of Eggheads quizzers.The broadcaster has been encroaching on BBC territory for some time with shows that appeal to older viewers.It emerged last year that the BBC had turned down the remake of All Creatures Great and Small because they did not believe it would attract a sufficiently young audience. The show went on to become one of Channel 5’s biggest hits.A BBC spokesperson says: “We sometimes have to make difficult decisions in order to grow new shows and we would like to thank the Eggheads and host Jeremy Vine for their time on the BBC and wish them well with their next chapter.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"good vaccine european countries criticised suspending astrazeneca","story":"European politicians have moved to defend the AstraZeneca vaccine as Bulgaria became the latest European country to suspended its use over fears it causes blood clots. The health ministers of Belgium and the Netherlands said that their countries would continue to use the jab after the European Medicines Agency said it was safe to use. “There is no reason to stop,’ Dutch health minister Hugo De Jonge said. ‘It is a good vaccine.”Denmark, Iceland and Norway stopped administering the Oxford University jab on Thursday after a death from a blood clot in Denmark. On Friday morning, Bulgaria\u0027s government said it would not resume use of the vaccine until the European Medicines Agency had sent a written statement dispelling all doubts about the vaccine\u0027s safety.Italy and Austria temporarily stopped using a specific batch of the coronavirus vaccine after another person died. Thailand suspended its roll out of the AstraZeneca jab as fears around the vaccine grew. Belgian minister of health Frank Vandenbroucke criticised the Danish decision. “There is absolutely no indication that there is a problem with blood clotting,” he said. He said: It is difficult to understand what the Danes are doing. Unfortunately, people regularly die from blood clots. It\u0027s not that people vaccinated with the AstraZeneca vaccine are more likely to have blood clotting problems.”Thailand also delayed use of the AstraZeneca vaccine on Friday.A publicity event with Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha receiving his first shot was canceled with dozens of media attending, less than an hour before the scheduled start.Instead, health officials held a news conference to explain the delay was based on the decision made by Denmark, Austria and others as a precaution. The Danish health authority said Thursday it has no evidence the vaccine was responsible for blood clots.Other countries such as the UK, Sweden, Spain, Mexico and France have already said that they will continue with their vaccination campaigns. France’s vaccine chief said the AstraZeneca jab had shown “great efficiency”. The suspensions are the latest blow to AstraZeneca’s reputation in Europe, which has been sullied by a row over supply shortfalls to the EU. The British-Swedish company told the European Commission it was set to deliver less than half the planned number of doses in the second quarter of the year. Mr Vandenbroucke said the latest disappointment was “very boring” and would slow Belgium’s glacial vaccination roll out even further. After AstraZeneca told Brussels about delivery problems for the first quarter in January, the commission accused it of breaching its contractual obligations, which the company denies. A number of EU member states imposed age limits on the use of the vaccine, which stoked unfounded fears the jab was less effective than Pfizer and hurt pick-up of the vaccine across the Continent.  Most of those countries have since lifted the age limits, which were imposed after Emmanuel Macron said it was “quasi-ineffective” in the over 65s. AstraZeneca is now seen as having a crucial role in ramping up the EU’s slow vaccination roll-out. Italy last week became the first country to use an EU export ban to block a shipment of 250,000 jabs leaving the bloc for Australia. A spokesman for AstraZeneca, said, An analysis of our safety data of more than 10 million records has shown no evidence of an increased risk of pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis in any defined age group, gender, batch or in any particular country with COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca.In fact, the observed number of these types of events are significantly lower in those vaccinated than what would be expected among the general population.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"government pressure back sarah everard vigil","story":"Ministers were coming under growing pressure on Friday to back a vigil for Sarah Everard as the Prime Minister\u0027s spokesman refused to say whether people should attend.Organisers of the vigil, in response to the disappearance of Sarah Everard, are taking legal action after the politan Police ruled it would be unlawful under Covid restrictions. A High Court hearing is due to decide on Friday on their rival claims.Senior Conservative MP Caroline Nokes asked Home Secretary Priti Patel to step in and allow the vigil to go ahead so women could share their sorrow over Ms Everard\u0027s disappearance.Baroness Nicky Morgan, the former education secretary and women and equalities minister, urged authorities to enable the vigil to go ahead so the voices of women can be heard loud and clear.A Bishop who has campaigned for women\u0027s rights in the House of Lords, through her work amending the Domestic Abuse Bill, also called on police to allow people to mourn and come together in a safe way.The Bishop of Gloucester, the Right Revd Rachel Treweek said: “I express my deepest condolences to Sarah Everard’s family and friends and I am holding them in my prayers at this tragic time.“It is unsurprising that there has been such strong expression of grief, sadness and anger from women and men across the country. If the vigil planned can be held in accordance with current Covid lockdown regulations, then it is an opportunity for people to come together in a safe way, to show their support for Sarah’s family, to pray and hold a moment’s silence, and to express deep sadness that such violence against women continues.It has also been backed by leaders of the local council, Lambeth, who urged “the police to recognise the scale of feeling in the community about these events and allow it to go ahead in a socially distanced way.”However, the Prime Minister’s spokesman said Boris Johnson understood the strength of feeling but repeatedly declined to say if he thought people should be allowed to attend the vigil on Saturday.The spokesman said: He understands the strength of feeling around this case and nobody could fail to be moved by the experiences shared by many women since Sarah\u0027s disappearance.We are still in a pandemic, we would ask people to follow the rules and social distancing rules but we do understand the strength of feeling on this issue.Pressed again for his position on the protest, the spokesman said: He does completely understand the strength of feeling on this and we would ask that people continue to follow the rules and social distancing rules.Scotland Yard said it too understood the public\u0027s strength of feeling and that it remained in discussion with organisers in light of the current Covid regulations.The vigil, due to take place at Clapham Common bandstand in south London, was organised after 33-year-old Ms Everard\u0027s disappearance and concerns about the safety of women on the UK\u0027s streets.One of the organisers, Anna Birley, said plans for the vigil began on Wednesday and the group had proactively contacted Lambeth Council and the politan Police.Initially, we had feedback that they were looking at ways to navigate this, that they would be looking at how they could proportionately and appropriately provide community policing to the event, she said.And we were in conversation about how we could do that safely so that people could express their anger and their grief without putting themselves or others at risk.We then had an about-face mid-afternoon yesterday. We were being put under increasing pressure that, inidually, we would be at risk for doing so, but as would everybody who attended and all of the women across the country potentially who have been organising sister vigils in their own areas.Ms Nokes, a former minister who chairs the Commons Women and Equalities Committee, said the Met appeared to have sent mixed messages over the event as she called on the Home Secretary to help the organisers. I have asked Priti to step in and enable it to happen, she said.She said Ms Patel can send a very clear message that, at this awful time, when women want to express their sorrow at Ms Everard\u0027s disappearance and show their determination not to be intimidated by male violence against women and their solidarity with each other, they should be allowed to do so in a safe and socially distanced way.Under the current Covid-19 lockdown in England, people are largely required to stay at home and can only gather in larger groups for limited reasons, such as funerals or for education.Police can break up illegal gatherings and issue fines of £10,000 to someone holding a gathering of more than 30 people.Ms Birley said that safety of the vigil had been a priority from the get-go, adding: It would be ironic to organise a vigil to think about women\u0027s safety in public spaces without also thinking about the health and safety aspects.She said the location of Clapham Common was in part chosen because it is a wide open space, while organisers had emphasised wearing masks and the importance of social distancing.Dr Simon Clarke, Associate Professor in Cellular Microbiology at the University of Reading, said: “I think that there is still a risk, but that it is very low.  Remember that there were Black Lives Matter demonstrations in London last year which people predicted would cause outbreaks, but in the end didn’t.  “It’s outside, and fairly windy at the moment, so any shed virus would be quickly diluted in the air.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"israel launching strikes ships carrying iranian oil","story":"Israel has attacked a series of ships en route to Syria carrying Iranian oil, according to US media reports, in what appears to be a new front in the regional conflict. On Thursday, the Wall Street Journal said that since 2019, Israel has been targeting ships carrying Iranian oil and other cargo. At least a dozen ships were bombed, the newspaper added, citing US and regional officials.Although the strikes, some of which took place in the Red Sea, damaged the vessels and forced two to return to their ports, none were reportedly destroyed.In one incident, the newspaper said, Israeli operatives put limpet mines on an Iranian vessel carrying oil while it was anchored near Lebanon. While Israel has carried out hundreds of airstrikes on Iranian forces in Syria, it has not publicly confirmed whether it also conducts operations against the regime at sea. Israeli officials typically decline to comment on reports about its military activity abroad.It is not the first maritime dispute involving Israel and Iran in recent weeks. In February, a major oil spill from a suspected Iran-owned tanker coated the Israeli and Lebanese coast with more than a thousand tonnes of gloopy, black tar. Israel’s environment protection minister Gila Gamliel accused Iran of being responsible for the spill in what she described as “environmental terrorism,” though this account is disputed by Israeli intelligence officials.There is no suggestion of a link between the oil spill on the Israeli coastline and the Wall Street Journal’s reports of Israeli strikes on vessels carrying Iranian oil.In February, Israel also blamed Iran for attacking one of its ships, the Helios Ray, in the Gulf of Oman.“Iran is the greatest enemy of Israel. I am determined to halt it. We are hitting it in the entire region,” said Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, at the time. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"president biden crumbling eyes","story":"Joe Biden’s decline has become so painful to see and so embarrassing to watch that it feels cruel to mention it. But it’s even more cruel that Biden’s team act as if it’s not happening, and most of America’s media look the other way. On Thursday night, Biden marked the first anniversary of the Covid-19 shutdowns and his fiftieth day in the White House by giving the first televised address of his presidency. He hadn’t been seen in public for three days, which is what he seems to require if he’s not to unravel before the cameras.From the moment he wheezed up to the lectern and peered into the camera, you could tell Biden was on top form: croaky sentiment, sporadic belligerence, and only the occasional moment when he looked oddly distant and perplexed, as though he didn’t understand the words he was reading.He got through twenty minutes, then tottered off without taking any questions or falling over his dog. This is how low the bar now is for Biden. And we can see how hard Biden has to fight, and what a long run-up he requires, if he is to clear it.We can see it in his struggle to follow the simple lines on his autocue, and in his bungling of the simplest ad-libs. We see it in the clips of his increasingly desperate handlers trying to block him from questions at his rare and carefully managed appearances before the cameras. Most of all, we see it in his eyes.Biden frequently looks afraid and lost. Anyone who has spent time with elderly people in the early stages of dementia knows that expression – and the sporadic and worsening loss of focus that causes it.“What am I doing here?” Biden asked after fumbling his autocue lines in an address in Texas in late February. He reached for the cue cards that are now his constant companion. “I’m gonna lose track here.”Biden’s supporters call him “gaffe-prone”. It’s true: he’s always thought with his mouth open. It’s also true that he bravely overcame a speech impediment in childhood, and that anxiety and age can cause a stutter to recur. But these aren’t gaffes or stutters.Compare how he moves and sounds now to how he was a year ago, let alone five years ago. Biden looks and sounds frail. He seems visibly distressed at his inability to carry out the simplest requirements of office – and at a time when the requirements are simpler than usual.When Biden dodged the press during last year’s election campaign, his aides called it Covid-19 precautions. As the pandemic ends, he will run out of excuses for not travelling. He doesn’t look capable of leading an international summit, let alone taking the proverbial 3 a.m. phone call.Earlier this week, the Commander-in-Chief forgot the name of the largest department in the US government, the Department of Defense, as well as the name of the man he recently appointed as its leader, Lloyd Austin.“Thank you to the Sec… the former general… I keep calling him general… my… my… the guy who runs that outfit over there,” he flailed.Biden is the first President in decades to reach fifty days in office without giving a press conference. He missed giving the traditional speech to Congress in February. His handlers refuse to name when he might talk to the press, and only offer that it’s “something he will do in the future”.There’s only one possible explanation. Biden’s team don’t trust him to manage one of the simplest requirements of modern political office. But they know they can’t defer the reckoning.The longer Biden waits, the more newsworthy his delayed appearance will be, and the greater the scrutiny of his performance. And once Biden has surrendered to the rising expectation that he speak live and unscripted, he will be expected to do it again, and again, just like any other President.This presidency is turning into a theatre of cruelty. It can only end one way. Sooner or later, Biden will be caught in the spotlight. The Democrats who promoted an unfit candidate to America’s highest office, and the media who covered for him, will be exposed as having betrayed their responsibilities to the American people. The people’s trust in democratic institutions will decline further. And we will all be party to Biden’s public humiliation.Dominic Green is deputy editor of The Spectator’s US edition.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"seven 10 positive covid cases school children likely wrong","story":"Seven in 10 positive coronavirus tests in school children are likely to be wrong, experts have warned, as they called on the Government to bring back confirmatory PCR testing. Biostaticians are concerned that infections in the community are now so low, that false positives and negatives are vastly outnumbering true cases, leading to real cases being missed and families needlessly being asked to isolate.Pupils are currently being tested twice a week for coronavirus using lateral flow devices, but real-world data has shown they miss positive cases around 50 per cent of the time.Similarly, although they pick up 99.9 per cent of negative cases, meaning fewer than 0.1 per cent will be false positives, the prevalence rate is now low enough that false positives will be making a significant contribution to the overall figure.Previously, positive tests were confirmed using a more accurate polymerase chain reaction (PCR) lab test, but this week the Government admitted it had quietly scrapped the process at the end of January.It means that thousands of pupils and their families are having to isolate needlessly, and missing more school after months away from classrooms.Latest figures from NHS Test \u0026amp Trace show that in secondary schools there were 328 positive cases found in 663,332 tests between February 25 and March 5.It means that just one in 2,000 pupils are testing positive for the virus. Experts warn that is far lower than the 1 in 270 that the Office for National Statistics (ONS) believes to be the current community prevalence, suggesting large numbers of cases are being missed.In primary schools 613 positives found from 721,546 tests in primary schools giving an overall school prevalence rate of 0.067 per cent or roughly 1 in 1,500.With that prevalence rate, if a million tests were conducted 670 should come back positive.With current testing accuracy, half positive cases (335) would be missed and 1,000 would be false positives. It would mean that out of a total of 1,335 positives, just 25 per cent would be accurate.Professor Jon Deeks, a biostatistician from the University of Birmingham, said: “We would expect far more false positives than true positives amongst those testing positives in schools.“There are many uncertainties but given the DHSC data it seems likely that over 70 per cent of positive test results are false positives, potentially many more.  Addition of a confirmatory PCR would add little cost and would most likely reduce false positives to 1 in 1,000,000.    “The refusal to confirm lateral flow results with PCR is at best perplexing, will make testing less attractive, and create harm by wrongly isolating iniduals, families and other close contacts.”In a report to the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) last year, Dr Carl Mayer and Dr Kate Baker, from the Government Office for Science, warned that Britain would face a problem with false positives once the infection rate became very low. “When only a small proportion of people being tested have the virus, the operational false positive rate becomes very important,” they wrote in their report.They warned that there was risk of overestimating the Covid-19 incidence, and the demand on test and trace.Profesor Carl Henegehan, director of the Centre for Evidence Based Medicine at Oxford University said: “This becomes a huge problem when you have low prevalence. We have been working for years to try and minimise this problem of false positives in mass testing programmes. “Once you’re doing the levels of testing we’re doing, you’re false positive threshold will exceed the test positivity threshold and so testing becomes of limited value.”This week, the Department of Health said the accuracy of lateral flow tests was 99.9 per cent and could be as high as 99.97 per cent. But even at the upper end, the chance of a test being correct with the current school prevalence rate would only be around 50 per cent.Prof Sheila Bird, formerly programme leader of the MRC Biostatistics Unit at University of Cambridge, said: “NHS Test \u0026amp Trace and Public Health England have attempted to justify not offering PCR during school-monitored use of lateral flow devices for asymptomatic screening of secondary pupils on their return to school in England. “More than 600 positives can be expected this week when over 1.5 million asymptomatic secondary pupils have been screened. “Half may be PCR-negative. By withholding data and denying PCR-confirmations, the half who are PCR-negative will never know – unless families and schools demand fairness for our children.”Independent Sage has voiced concerns that data from voluntary Covid testing for pupils may not reveal the full extent of transmission rates.  Sir David King, chair of the Independent Sage Committee, and the former government Chief Scientific Advisor, said: “We know Covid-19 is not simply going to vanish and I’m afraid without a fully functioning system in place we will once again be forced into using the blunt instrument of lockdowns in the future.” More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"urgent search british woman fell yacht near us virgin islands","story":"A huge search and rescue operation has been mounted for a British woman missing off the US Virgin Islands after reportedly falling overboard.Sarm Heslop’s boyfriend raised the alarm after waking in the early hours of Monday to discover she was nowhere to be seen on his 47ft catamaran Siren Song.Police and ers searching for Ms Heslop, from Southampton, have been scouring the coastline and waters around the island of St John, where the yacht was moored.A friend of the missing 41-year-old said: “We have heard that Sarm’s phone, passport and all belongings were left on the boat, where she was living with her boyfriend.She would not just disappear, leaving no trace. We are asking for an urgent and thorough investigation into this incident as her friends here at home are devastated and just need her disappearance to be made a critical priority.”The friend said she was told that Ms Heslop\u0027s belongings, including her phone and passport, had all been left behind on the yacht.Speaking from the UK she added: “We would like to thank all the local community for their support in searching for Sarm both on water and land. “They have been so amazing but we urge them not to give up until she is found or we have more information.”The US Coast Guard told local media that it was alerted to Ms Heslop’s disappearance at 11.46am on Monday when her boyfriend said she was nowhere to be found. He called the coast guard\u0027s San Juan station to report that “his girlfriend may have fallen from their 47ft catamaran, the Siren Song, the night before”. The boyfriend is understood to have told the coast guard that Ms Heslop had gone to sleep at around 10pm, and that he woke “at 2am he woke up and realised that she was not on board”.The Virgin Islands Police Department has urged members of the local community to help find the missing Briton, who had been living on the Leopard 4700 catamaran.Ms Heslop is described as a slim 41-year-old woman, 57 tall, with a southern English accent and a tattoo on her left shoulder. Toby Derima, Virgin Islands police spokesman, said: “Heslop was last seen on March 7 aboard the vessel Siren Song, that was moored off the coast of St John.

The rules in England will not permit that. The Prime Ministeraposs road map says that for the weeks after March , people should minimise travel, there are to be no holidays, and people wonapost be allowed to stay away from home overnight. If it wonapost be safe to stay overnight in England, then obviously it would not be safe for people to travel into Wales. Wales will move to a stay local requirement for at least the next three weeks as the country eases some of its coronavirus restrictions, Mr Drakeford will announce today. The current stay-at-home restrictions will be lted from Saturday and are expected to allow people from rural areas to travel greater distances than those who live in urban towns and cities. From Saturday, four people from two households will also be able to meet outdoors to socialise, including in gardens - while outdoor sports facilities, including basketball courts, tennis courts and golf courses, can reopen. Indoor care home visits will also restart for single designated visitors from the weekend. Hairdressers and barbers can reopen for appointments from Monday, the same day that all primary pupils and those in qualications years canto schools.  Secondary schools will have the option to bring year  and  learners back, while there will be flexibility to allow all other pupils to check-in with teachers on a limited amount of days ahead of a fullafter the Easter break. Non-essential retail, which was considered for reopening from next week, will start to reopen gradually from March , while restrictions will be lted on what can be sold in shops which are currently open. All shops, including all close contact services, will be able to open from April , the same date as in England. Mr Drakeford insisted ing children and young people to face-to-face education is the top priority for the Welsh Government. He told BBC Breakfast that about % of children in Wales were back in school, with that figure rising considerably from Monday when all primary school pupils and students taking exams in secondary schools will . All students in Wales will be back in classrooms on April . That is the safe way to do it, that is what we have agreed with our teaching unions and local education authorities, Mr Drakeford said. And in the meantime, it does give us a bit of headroom to do some other modest things - the reopening of hairdressers and barbers, theof visits to care homes, allowing four people from two households to meet more outdoors. So thataposs a balance weaposve struck in Wales, a phasedto school, a phasedto business, a phasedto personal le. And he said he had anxieties about the resumption of foreign travel from as early as May .  Mr Drakeford told BBC Breakfast that September  was a dficult month in Wales as people ed to the country from holidays abroad and brought Covid- with them. I do not want to see all the hard work that people in Wales have put in over recent weeks being undermined by the reimportation of the virus, he said. The Prime Ministeraposs road map for England is very clear that these are indicative dates and when Iaposve raised this with UK ministers they always emphasise that the decision would be made in the circumstances much closer to the time. I am saying that for me, that does look early. I would want to be completely confident that we are not running the risk of a reimportation of the virus, particularly now that we know there are new iants of this virus in other parts of the world. Businesses that will be affected by ongoing restrictions will be supported by an additional £ million from the Welsh Government. Mr Drakeford is expected to say: We are taking a phased approach to unlocking each sector - starting with schools. We will make step-by-step changes each week to gradually restore freedoms. We will monitor each change we make, so we know what impact each change has had on Walesapos public health situation.

The numbers of women abducted by a total stranger are small. But the fear that you could be one of them looms large. Every day, thousands of women across the country make similar calculations to those that Sarah presumably made. They change their clothes and wear trainers so they can runthe need to. They grip keys in their fist. They assess every man they come across. They take the longer route because itaposs better lit and thereaposs more traffic, or houses where they could urgently knock on the door. Friends are on speed dial and promised a text the moment theyaposre safely home.The risk is low, but most women have a story of unwanted attention or harassment or even abuse by a man on the streets. Many are questioning whether they should have to put up with it - and what more the police, the Government and society can do. Here seven women MPs from across the political parties share their experiences. Caroline Noakes Tory MP for Romsey and Southampton North, Chair of the Women and Equalities Select Committee  Very few women are abducted by a complete stranger - fact. But it’s also a fact that when I walk to my flat at night I do it with my keys in my hand, ready to poke any would be assailant’s eye out. Of course I understand the men I pass on Westminster Bridge are not all potential attackers, but I don’t know which one might be. I remember the occasion in Southampton Parkway Station car park, in the dark, when a man followed me up  flights of stairs. Questioning why he was matching me step for step. Why hadn’t he got the lt  Why hadn’t I got the lt  And the relief at floor  when he commented he wasn’t following me. He shouldn’t have had to say it, but thank God he did, because I was already weighing up my handbag and how hard I would have to swing it to give him a good clonk round the head and run. I did the Krav Maga course in Parliament, with fellow female parliamentarians and staffers. I wear my trainers into and out of work with pride, despite the comments that, “your legs look better when you wear heels”. They might, I neither know nor care, I can’t run in heels.Bell Ribeiro-AddyLabour MP for Streatham and Sarah Everardaposs local MP I’ve lived in the area where Sarah went missing my whole le. When I heard that’s where she’d disappeared, my heart sank. Part of the issue is transport. To get back to where she is, she’d have to take two buses so it makes sense to cut across. I remember having to do that walk when I was a bit younger and feeling scared. I would stay on the phone to a friend of mine called Mark for  to  minutes. I’d be yapping away and he’d be tracking me - ‘are you turning onto this road now’. And we’d talk until I got to my door. People have followed me, trying to talk to me. I had a neighbour with some mental health problems so he would throw stuff at me. People shouting horrible stuff to youyou don’t want to talk to them. People driving quite slowly next to you in the car that’s really threatening. It’s so horrible to think that we have to think about what we’re doing all the time as women we have to change our behaviour we are the ones that have to take extra responsibility. That being a woman in itself means you’re under threat. It’s beyond unfair and it’s not a way to live - we should be free to walk those streets. I’d say to men,you see a woman walking late at night and she might feel uncomfortable, the man might cross the road, so she doesn’t feel like someone is gaining behind her. We’ve been told when we were younger, ‘someone’s trying to chat you up’ - but late at night is not the time to attempt to engage with a woman, when she’s walking home all alone. It’s a very selfish thing to do. Layla Moran Lib Dem MP for Oxford West and Abingdon  I’ve walked the roads Sarah Everard walked that tragic night. So much about her seems so familiar. In her beanie hat, phone to her ear rather than with headphones. I wonderedshe was holding it like that to visibly show someone is listening who will call for help. I know I’ve done that. When I was  the mother of Suzy Lamplugh came to speak to my school. What she told us stayed with me. Stay alert and don’t listen to music. Tell people where you are. I often share my live location on Whatsapp. Work out your exitsyou have to run. If I am alone and I hear footsteps behind me, I will often cross the street. If I’m feeling very scared I will make a phonecall and hold my keys in my hand in case I need them. I don’t do that every time, but it has been more than a few times in my le. Many men online have been asking what they can do to help women feel safe. My simplest advice is just cross the road, oryou can’t then perhaps stop and wait a moment rather than overtake. I can guarantee you’ll be silently thanked. Hannah BardellSNP MP for Livingston I have a very vivid memory of crossing that ide from childhood into puberty. I remember when I was a teenager I got flashed, when I was about , when I was out running. I ran all the way home and told my mum and the police came. In London, I was assaulted in a pub. A guy grabbed my boob and I threw my drink on him. One time when I was living in Woolwich, before I was an MP, a guy followed me off a bus. He had been staring at me on the bus and I stopped as I got off the bus and told the driver, but he was really dismissive. The guy started matching me step for step across the road until we reached the square, where there were people but I knew I had a deserted road to cross. So I just screamed at him in a really broad Scottish accent and he ran off. But I walked home shaking. As MPs we can take a taxi after pm but even sometimes getting out of the taxi, youaposre a bit worried. Now Iaposm older, I feel a bit more streetwise, a bit more like I would be totally prepared for it. Truth is you can never be prepared and we shouldn’t feel like we have to be. But Iaposve been in situations, definitely, where Iaposve had my phone out and close to me, on the tube when itaposs just been one or two guys or itaposs been a lonely station or a lonely road. Weaposve all done it. The Sarah Everard case, itaposs just hit so many of us. Sort of like a mini Me Too moment. Weaposre all like, yep, this is every single one of us. Anybody that has a daughter, anybody that has a son needs to be thinking I need to make sure my son never does anything like that. Young guys can be vulnerable as well but the vast majority of the time itaposs women. I wear my bracelet and personal alarm sometimes, but even that in itself, are we saying women should go about with personal alarms in their hands and keys in their hands and not wear certain things. How much does your le get limited, just to create space for violent men  Rosena Allin-Khan Labour MP for Tooting and Shadow Mental Health Minister  Walking the long way home just so you walk a brighter, busier path. Calling your mum, partner, mates or even faking a conversationno one picks up, just to scare people off. Making sure your phone has enough battery to last you getting home in case you need to call for help. Having flats in your bag to make sure you can run away that bit faster. Knowing that your daughters will have to pick up these tips because the world still isnapost safe enough for any woman to walk home alone in the dark. My heart goes out to Sarahaposs family - she is all of us. Tracey Crouch Tory MP for Chatham and Aylesford  As the days get shorter so does the window of opportunity for women to pop in some headphones, put on a motivational podcast or some appropriate beats, and go for a lone jog or walk. The me time we need in our lives is snatched away from us because the early darkness overwhelms many, including me, with fear. Our response is to either do nothing or to adapt our routes to the more polluted but better lit streets. Outside of cities this means even fewer options and so it has often been the case that I feel less safe in my own village where the streets have limited lighting, and no-one is out after dark than I did when I lived in London. For her family and friends, I am deeply shocked and devastated by the murder of Sarah Everard but for women around the country I am also appalled by the police’s “stay at home” message. Our physical wellbeing is already at risk because of the shorter days, but please don’t make us even more frightened of the dark than we already are – instead make the streets safer and punish those who commit crimes against us.

Earlier, Mr Drakeford failed to rule out the move as a apostemporary interventionapos in the event of a crisis, the First Minister has said. Mark Drakeford said a curfew on men wouldnapost be on the top of the list of measures that the Welsh Government would consider as it would be only a temporary intervention. But following media reports of his remarks, Mr Drakeford said: We are NOT introducing a curfew for men in Wales – or even considering it.This is misleading and deliberately misses the real issue. It’s a sad distraction when what’s needed is a proper discussion about women’s safety and why a woman is killed every  days by a man in the UK. Mr Drakeford told BBC Breakfast: If there were a crisis, and you needed to take dramatic action that allowed that crisis to be drawn down, then of course youaposd be prepared to consider all measures that would make a dference. But the sort of measure, the curfew measure that you describe, it could only ever be a temporary answer and therefore itaposs not at the top of our list. There are other things that we can do and should do and weaposll work hard with our third sector organisations, our local authorities in Wales. People need to be safe and to feel safe, and thataposs absolutely the sort of society we wish to create here in Wales. It comes after Green Party Peer Jenny Jones floated the idea of a pm curfew for men in the House of Lords yesterday. She said she might put forward a law in future that would restrict the movements of men at night.  Speaking in the House of Lords, Baroness Jones said: In the week that Sarah Everard was abducted and, we suppose, killed - because remains have been found in a woodland in Kent - I argue that, at the next opportunity for any Bill that is appropriate, I might put in an amendment to create a curfew for men on the streets after pm. I feel this would make women a lot safer, and discrimination of all kinds would be lessened. Human remains have been found and a male police officer is being held on suspicion of murder after Ms Everard, , vanished while walking home from a friendaposs flat in south London on Wednesday March . The case has provoked a debate about why it is women who are told to change their behaviour when walking alone at night.

Lealan Hague, , ed as a Year  pupil at Exmouth Community College in Devon on March  after months of not being able to go into class or interact much with friends. But just  minutes into class he was sent into isolation as his new haircut was deemed extreme and too short. The teenager was told he could face a whole week of isolation due to the haircut which his mum Kirsty said he got for no fault of his own. The furious mum tried explaining to the school that her son had ended up with such short hair as all salons were closed during lockdown and she only had a broken clipper that would give him a zero around the sides.She said the school initially failed to comprehend and insisted on putting her son in isolation, DevonLive reports. However, he was on Wednesday allowed out of isolation and back into the classroom. Kirsty said: Lealan badly needed a haircut, as do many, so we cut his hair short because he really suffers from itching with longer hair. Since Lealan was about five he has always had his hair fully shaved, but when he started at Exmouth Community College he was not allowed to do that any more. Instead weaposve kept it as short as is permitted. It got a bit long and wild during lockdown so I gave him a short back and sides, but it was grade zero as our clipper blade is broken.  I thought the school would be a bit more lenient considering the current circumstances, and understand why. They didn’t call me until .pm on Tuesday to inform me Lealan had been put in isolation and said it will happen all week, purely because his hair is too short. On his first day back he said he had no break times, no lunch time and had to stay in the room all day because of his hair cut. They got his lunch from the canteen for him as he wasn’t allowed to leave the room. When he wanted to go to the toilet he was told he would have to wait until everyone was in class so that they would not see his hair cut that is deemed unsuitable for school. I could understandhis hair had markings or things cut into it, or had been coloured, but heaposs just literally had a haircut at home which does not affect his learning. Itaposs hard enough for children and everyone at the moment they donapost need this on top. He has been in isolation since last March and we havenapost let him go out much or meet his friends. Heaposs literally been at home.

The Swansea boozer had built the dome out the back of the premises to host up to  punters at a time.But a planning inspector has said it must come down because the structure was aposunauthorised,apos according to Wales Online. Who do you think is in the right here  Share your views in the comments below... The owners of City Bar, St Thomas, had been served with an enforcement notice by Swansea Council more than a year ago requiring them to take down the unauthorised structure within two months. There was a right to appeal, which was taken up by owner Ernest Joyce, of City Eat Drink Enjoy Ltd, Mr Joyce set out to prove that the dome had been substantially completed for a period of four years before the notice was issued. Enforcement action, according to planning law, canapost be taken after four years. There was agreement by all concerned that a dome was built at City Bar by April, , which was more than four years before the enforcement notice.  But aerial photographs submitted by the council in  showed substantial parts of the dome removed. Mr Joyce said parts of the timber-framed dome were dismantled and put back together over the years to make it better withstand extremes in temperature and rainfall. Welsh Government-appointed planning inspector Aidan McCooey said construction work continued in , prior to an internal fit-out and the dome being brought into use in . He said this meant it did fall foul of the four-year enforcement rule. The photographic evidence, the appellant’s evidence and what I observed of the construction at the site visit, leads me to conclude that the dome was not substantially complete in December, , said his decision report.  But Mr McCooey extended the time frame to take down the dome from two months to four months.Mr Joyce had argued that six months was more appropriate, given the backlog faced by builders due to the coronavirus pandemic. The council felt that three months would be sufficient.The y planning dispute had involved a petition at one stage in support of the dome, which was signed by more than  people. Speaking in , joint City Bar owner Marc Strydom said around £, had been invested in the premises - formerly The Windsor Arms - to make it a more attractive destination.

The campaign is aimed at rallying society to encourage girls to stay in sports because the benefits of their participation go far beyond the field or court. Figures show  per cent of teenage girls are feeling more anxious about their future than they did before the pandemic. And research of , girls aged - revealed sports participation can help change that, with  per cent of girls currently playing sport saying it has helped them feel more confident about their future development. The study, commissioned by Always, found the benefits for girls in sports go far beyond the cheers and the wins. What is your view  Have your say in the comments section Women polled who played sports during puberty say doing so helped them build skills such as learning how to work as a teamand developing self-esteemwhich have benefitted them in adult le. In addition to participating in regular exercise and having fun, sports helped them develop important le skills including learning how to win and lose , persevereand become a better communicator . Another quarter also believed sports helped their mental health. Rachel Riley, speaking on behalf of Always which has teamed up with Sported, the UKaposs largest community sporting network, said: I played so many dferent sports at school, from hurdles to football and the skills I learned helped me in so many ways.

Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  The biggest impact sport had was on my confidence, especially as a teen - it taught me to be more vocal and encouraged me to take the lead and this is something that has stayed with me in my adult le. Iaposm really passionate about this partnership because I believe that playing sport has many unexpected benefits, including being able to build relationships with team members, improving communication skills and most of all, it really boosts confidence. And as someone who has reaped the rewards of staying in sports when I was younger, I really want to make sure that girls are encouraged to do the same because sport can help fuel girlsapos futures. However, despite all the value sports participation provides, nearly one in three girls will drop out of sports during puberty, because they either donapost think theyaposre good enoughor donapost feel encouraged to keep playing . The survey via OnePoll also found that half of women who dropped out of sports as teens wish they had continued to play.With sports looking a little dferent right now, even more support and encouragement is needed.In fact,  per cent of girls want more support to keep them involved in sports.Sported, the UKaposs largest network of community sports groups, reported that  per cent of community groups are not sure that their participants willin the future. Always will be donating to Sported to help hire youth centre spaces and equipment to ensure the organisation is equipped to support participants once lockdown eases.  To help show the nation that the value of sports extends beyond the field, a video has been created showing the unexpected ways sports can transform her future. The content showcases Rachel, the UKaposs youngest female pilot, Ellie Carter and COVID st responder, Ellie Pantlin, who all credit sports as a key enabler of their success.Successful social enterprise CEO Dr Anne-Marie Imafidon MBE also features as part of the campaign and credits her learnings from playing netball in her younger years as part of her success today.Anne-Marie said: What I most enjoy is seeing a direct impact as a result of my efforts."},{"url":null,"title":"denying entire family racism free","story":"NewsopinionDenying entire family is racism free a big ask for most, for Prince William it’s hugeJust how non-racist are the Royal Family, when the Queen’s uncle fraternised with the Nazis, when it still sits on huge amounts of wealth made from slavery  William didn’t pick this row, but denying his fa,ily is racist is a bigger ask for the Prince than for most of usmirrorShareCommentsByBrian Reade:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR Newsopinionthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video prince-william-confirms-hasnt-spoken-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Centuries ago we elevated those humans who were good at war, and today their descendants still rule over us although we now handle the battles ourselves. Andthey want to stay on that blood-stained pedestal, they need to deserve it.  So when the Duke and Duchess of Sussex said a member of the Royal Family inquired after their sonaposs skin colour, during debates about whether to give him a title or security, we wonderedthese higher-than-thous were pretty low. When Buckingham Palace didnapost comment for  hours, we became restless. And when a stf-backed Prince William declared we are very much not a racist family yesterday, there was relief he had deigned to mention it, although, to be fair, he didnapost really sell it.Which family was he talking about  His closest living relatives, the Windsors in general, or everyone going back to William the Conqueror, whose DNA is probably, by this point, distributed equally around the British Isles. The trouble with Williamaposs claim is that, whichever family heaposs talking about, there is racism. Quite a lot of it, in fact. And itaposs not out-of-context, reasonable-for-the-time racism. Itaposs eye-poppingly-bad-even-then-racism. Here are just a few examples.  . The time someone senior in Williamaposs immediate family repeatedly asked what colour his nephewaposs skin would be while discussing his security needs, and which he has yet to deny.. The time Prince William allegedly went to a party dressed as a gorilla, but couldnapost be clearly identied behind the mask, so pictures of Harry at the same party dressed as a Nazi caused a scandal instead.. The time his uncle Andrew left then-Home Secretary Jacqui Smith slack-jawed at a dinner for the Saudi royals by making racist comments about Arabs that were unbelievable... it involved a comment about camels. . The time that same uncle referred to the n***** in the woodpile to one of David Cameronaposs advisers, who was of Sri Lankan descent.. The time his grannyaposs uncle said Adolf Hitler was not a bad chap and taught three princesses to throw a Nazi salute, in the same year the Reichstag burned down, Hitler had seized power, the Gestapo was created, Dachau was built, and thousands of Britons protested against rabid anti-Semitism and persecution of Jews.. The time that same grannyaposs uncle ignored government advice to visit Nazi Germany, dined with Goering, Goebbels and Hess, take tea with Hitler, and gave a speech saying that what he had seen is a miracle one can only begin to understand it when one realizes that behind it all is one man and one will. - . The time the Queen Mother told a diarist during a drunken lunch beware the Blackamoors, the time she told a journalist she “had some reservations about Jews,” and the time she told a lady-in-waiting that the Africans just don’t know how to govern themselves…what a pity we’re not still looking after them.. The time Princess Michael of Kent wore priceless jewellery depicting an African slave kept as a domestic pet to the wider familyaposs first meeting with Meghan Markle.. The time the same princess told black New Yorkers to go back to the colonies and named two black sheep on her farm Venus and Serena. . The time Queen Victoria became close friends with an Indian Muslim, and her son Edward VII sacked him within hours of her funeral, had him deported, then ordered every record of their relationship to be destroyed.. The time the Royal Family set up the Royal African Company, of which Edward Colston was merely a shareholder and employee, and shipped more African slaves across the Atlantic than anyone .. The time that wealthy slave-owner, banker and MP George Smith became enormously wealthy, his granddaughter married the Earl of Strathmore, and her granddaughter Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon married a prince, became Queen, and on her death left most of her £m estate and fine art to the Royal Family. . The time she also left about £m each to Princes William and Harry, who have, presumably, happily lived off the profits of slavery ever since.Some of these have roots deep in the mists of time. Others are bang-up-to-date. And itaposs worth pointing out that Britain ended the slave trade, too, and freed those brought to its shores by Americans who held on to the nasty habit for decades longer. In  Prince Charles condemned the atrocity of slavery. Prince William has spoken about the horrors of racism in football. Princess Michael of Kent, Prince Harry, even Prince Philip, have apologised for what have become known as gaffes.And at the end of last year, the Historic Royal Palaces announced a review of their buildingsapos and contentsapos links to slavery, which will probably see a lot of heavy annotation in souvenir handbooks rather than having to lose, er, pretty much every palace and private home.

It was when the mum-of-three was standing over her sonaposs body in a street in Harlesden, north west London. Oliver Tetlow, , died after he was shot with a machine gun in a drive-by shooting as he waited outside a shop for his friend on March , . It was a horric case of mistaken identity that claimed Pamelaaposs innocent son - her only son. Tuesday marked the fth anniversary of his death and no one has ever been convicted of his killing. Sadly over those five years Pamela has been diagnosed with stage  breast cancer. Despite surgery and chemotherapy it has spread and she is now battling stage  liver cancer. The -year-old told the Mirror: I know exactly when I developed my cancer - it was when I saw Oliver dead on the street. I stood there and I felt a pain in my breast. That was the cancer. I refuse to let this cancer kill me because I want to get justice for my son. It is now five years since he died and his killers are still walking the streets. Before Pamela was given the devastating news that she had breast cancer, four men had been acquitted in court of killing her son in .  She had been forced to move from her home in Harlesden for own protection and was living in a hotel at the time. I didnapost want to move but since my son had been murdered I was told I must, she said. My son was waiting outside a shop for a friend when he was killed. He usually goes inside the shop andhe had he would still be alive. I have lost my only son and I canapost let this cancer kill me because I need to be alive to see the people who murdered him locked up. Pamela, who has two daughters and two grandchildren, had developed a persistent cough but thought it was a stubborn cold until she saw an advert on TV.  The stress of losing my only son put my body into shock, she said. I had surgery to remove my lymph nodes and had two rounds of chemotherapy but they have had to stop it because I was so stressed about his killers still walking freely in the street. I am taking chemotherapy tablets instead, I also suffer from lupus and have had a stroke so everyday I have to swallow a cocktail of medication to keep me alive. I also have to have an injection in my stomach every four weeks. Doctors had initially told Pamela she was cancer free after they removed her lymph nodes in March  but she said she knew something wasnapost right.  She said: Within weeks I started getting pain in my back, was nauseous and couldnapost stop vomiting so I knew the cancer was still there. I was told it was liver cancer and it was stage four. Doctors removed two tumours from Pamelaaposs liver and she is currently awaiting tests to seethe surgery has been a success. Once I beat this cancer I will concentrate wholly on finding my sonaposs killers, she said. The turmoil of losing her son and fighting cancer has taken a toil on Pamelaaposs mental health which culminated in a failed suicide bid. She said: First one cancer and then another - it just became too much for me.I felt like the devil was trying to stop me from getting justice for my son. I tried counselling but I found it made things worse but I am stronger now and am ready for whatever obstacles are thrown my way. As part of her mission to get justice for her son, Pamela plans to do a series of podcasts about the murder in the hope that witnesses will come forward. She said: My son was completely innocent and killed because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Itaposs now five years and people may be more willing to speak up. After the men were acquitted I was abandoned by the police as I have not heard a thing from them since so it is up to me to make sure people donapost forget about Oliver. I am begging anyone out there who knows who killed my son to speak up. They might have children themselves and need to think how would they feelthey lost the child the way I lost Oliver. Oliver was my only son. I will beat this cancer so I can justice for my only son. I want to be there in court when I see his killers jailed for taking away my boy.

Magazine Meghan explained: I’ve always coveted the Cartier French Tank watch.When I found out Suits had been picked up for our third season - which at the time felt like such a milestone - I totally splurged and bought the two-tone version. She even had the watch engraved with a special message, reading aposTo MM from MMapos.  The item, which is a lovely symbol of Meghanaposs career success, has always been intended to be passed down to her children. I plan to give it to my daughter one day.

In the months after Harry and Meghanaposs wedding in  there were reports the duchess had reduced her sister-in-law to tears in a row over bridesmaid dress fittings.

Writing in Harpers Bazaar, royal correspondent and co-author of Finding Freedom, a book centred on the lead up to Megxit, Mr Scobie claimed Meghan sent an email to Kensington Palace asking for them to address the incident with Kate.Meghan told Oprah in the interview last week: What was hard to get over was being blamed for something that not only I didnapost do, but that happened to me.It was reported in November  that Kate had cried over Meghanaposs demands for Princess Charlotte and other bridesmaids not to wear tights, something which is against royal protocol.Last weekend, Thereported the row was actually sparked by Kateaposs daughteraposs dress not fitting, meaning another session would have to be scheduled.Meghan told Oprah: The narrative with Kate that didnapost happen was really dficult.

The mum-of-one is a victim of torture, suffers major depression and PTSD and requires urgent psychiatric treatment, according to a charity which commissioned a detailed medical assessment of her. Human rights group Redress said it based its categorisation of Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe as a torture victim on UN standards, and said the assessmentaposs findings were highly consistent with Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfeaposs allegations of torture and ill-treatment. Richard Ratclfe said it would take a long time for his weaposs mental anxiety to go away and the situation was still very uncertain, ahead of herto court in Iran on Sunday. Speaking about her treatment on Times Radio, he said: In fairness to the Iranian regime they are quite sophisticated about not leaving physical scars but they do an awful lot of cruel tricks. Things are still very uncertain... that fear of bad stuff happening again, of being put back in solitarywill stay with her until sheaposs safe. It takes a long time for that anxiety to go away. Mr Ratclfe, said his six-year-old daughter Gabriella was definitely weaponised against his we but that was a standard tactic. He said that guards would call their own children outside his weaposs cell, when she could not, which he described as a real studied cruelty. As Mrs Zaghari-Ratlfe prepares toto court in Iran on Sunday, Redress has called on the Government to recognise her as a victim of torture, having sent the Foreign Secretary the -page report on the mother-of-one it commissioned from the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims . Coming a day after Boris Johnson demanded her release in a call with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, the report says Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe has post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and obsessive stress disorder because of extremely stressful, traumatising experiences in the prisons of Iran and the uncertainty surrounding her immediate future. It also says at the beginning of her sentence in , Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe was interrogated for hours on end, often blindfolded, while in solitary confinement. Redress says the report also shows the former Thomson Reuters Foundation aid administrator has suffered hair loss, developed obsessive compulsive disorder about washing, and was repeatedly forced to endure hearing a female prison guardaposs conversations with her daughter, exacerbating her distress at being separated from her own child. In addition, she experiences ongoing physical pain and impairment in her neck, right shoulder, and arm, which arose as a result of her treatment and the denial of medical care, Redress said in a statement.  Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe, , last week completed a five-year sentence in Tehran on spying charges levied by Iranian authorities, the last year of which was spent under house arrest due to the pandemic. The charity released a summary letter from from the IRCT detailing findings from the independent physical and psychological evaluation of Nazanin ... conducted by two doctors who are recognised forensic specialists over three days in October . That letter states Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe is in urgent need of psychiatric pharmacological and psychotherapeutic support, as well as evaluation and treatment of her physical symptoms. Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfeaposs pain and suffering have not abated due to her release from imprisonment to house arrest, the letter says.  While she is not feeling as acute stress as she did when she was in prison, she continues to relive and suffer from the serious and long-lasting traumatising issues she experienced during the past years. In the long-term, without reunication with her family in the UK and effective treatment, Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfeaposs conditions will become chronic and potentially deteriorate. Her psychological symptoms and disorders will be unable to resolve themselves and will become chronic and potentially worsen. Redress director Rupert Skilbeck said: Redress has long held that Nazaninaposs treatment by Iran amounts to torture. Based on this new evidence, the UK government should publicly acknowledge that Nazanin is a victim of torture in Iran, and do everything in its power to protect her from further harm. In their letter to Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab accompanying the report, Redress said: Iranaposs treatment of Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe is based on discrimination against her for being a British citizen.Iranian authorities have intentionally inflicted severe suffering on Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe for the purpose of intimidating or coercing the UK Government into negotiating a deal for her release, coercing her into giving a confession, and forcing her to provide information about others.

He was born into the risk of kidnapping or worse but his service as a front line Army officer and Apache pilot in Afghanistan means he is a top terror target. Almost ten years ago a senior Taliban fighter claimed in an interview with the Daily Mirror his men had plotted to target Harry “many times” during his tours in Afghanistan. Qari Nasrullah, an Afghan Taliban leader, told us: “There were many plans to capture him – maybe it was his good luck he managed to escape.” Today former SAS soldier Bob Craft told the Daily Mirror: “As a royal Prince Harry is clearly a target for kidnapping, terrorism and a whole range of threats. “But his military service adds to that enormously. “He will need some form of security for a long time, particularly as it is known he served in Afghanistan and was known to be a target whilst out there.” It is also feared that whilst living in America Prince Harry may face a large number of ied threats, not just from known terror groups. Ex Parachute Regiment soldier and security expert Paul Biddiss, military adviser to film directors, told the Daily Mirror: “Ex special forces soldiers have to be discreet about their identities after they leave because they are obviously under threat. “But Harry did not choose to be a threat, he was born into it as a royal. His service, particularly in Afghanistan presents obvious threats from terrorism. “But in America, as we have seen recently, there are also conspiracy theorists, fringe groups, far right-wing networks, all kinds of armed groups who could be a threat. “Harry will need to be protected as he is one of the,not the most under threat royals there are.He needs security protection, clearly.” Keep up to date with all the latest news from the Queen, Charles, William, Kate, Harry, Meghan, George, Charlotte, Louis, Archie and the rest of the family.

A senior former military intelligence officer who also served in the British Army said: “There are a whole range of range of threats facing him in America from armed groups and other networks. “Buthe has chosen his new le in America it is likely he should foot the bill for his security, which he will definitely need. “My recollection is that it would not be the Queen who would allocate how much the UK pays for this, or even makes a contribution but it is the Home Office. "},{"url":null,"title":"remembering mum how one mothers","story":"AdvertorialRemembering mum: how one mothers final wishes helped her daughter cope with griefMany bereaved families are preparing for a dficult first milestone after losing their loved onemirrorShareByLaura Tait:,  MAR AdvertorialClaire keeps a special photo on her phone of her as a child with her parentsLosing a parent is often one of the most dficult things people have to deal with in le. Along with many practical considerations, the emotional toll it takes can be overwhelming, creating a sense of grief that can be painful to confront. “Your parents are the people who knew you first, they know your history, they know all the stories about you,” says Claire Hewson. “They love you unconditionally. “When they’re gone, when that’s gone, and they’re not around, it’s a struggle.” Coping can depend on many things. The support you have from those around you, and the plans already laid in place. “I was lucky. My mother was a fantastic organiser,” says Claire, , a call centre manager from London. “She organised her funeral with the local Co-op Funeralcare – her coffin, the car she wanted, and even the flowers she wanted. “All I had to do was the music. Everything  was arranged and paid for. I will always be grateful to my mum for doing that. I wouldn’t have known what to choose.” Coping with loss The last couple of years have been ‘challenging and horrible’ for Claire, who lost her father, Bob, to cancer in May , and her mum, Eileen, who died suddenly in June , whilst in hospital being treated for an ongoing liver issue. “It just felt like the rug had been pulled from underneath me. No-one tells you about death or what it feels like to lose someone. There’s still a stigma when it comes to talking about it.” And yet, while she lost them both within a short period, her experience with each was quite dferent. “Dad was in a hospice so we were going in every day, and the nurses were amazing, telling us what to look out for,” says Claire. “Every day we went in, not knowing ‘will it be today’ ” Claire was still coming to terms with losing her father when her mum died.  “It was dferent dealing with each death. With dad, it’s like I knew he was gone, I saw his body. Mum’s death was sudden, so I never got to say goodbye, and that really does mess with your brain, there’s no finality. Planning ahead The fact that her mum had sorted out her funeral was a blessing. “When my mum’s sister died it was traumatic for everyone trying to arrange the funeral and sort the money out. Mum saw this unfolding and didn’t want that for me. “She said she didn’t want me to have to worry about anything with her funeral. She went to Co-op Funeralcare and had a chat and chose what she wanted. She said they were very pleasant, and it was easy to do. “I will always be grateful to mum for that because I wasn’t in my right mind and I’d urge anybody to do that. It makes that part so much easier for those left behind. All I had to do was phone them up and give them her details and that was it. It took the pressure off, and people don’t always have the money.” "},{"url":null,"title":"sarah everard familys tribute shining","story":"NewsSarah Everard familys tribute to shining example as daughter taken from usSarah was last seen in Clapham, south London before disappearing, and politan Police officer Wayne Couzens has been arrested on suspicion of her kidnapping and murdermirrorShareByJonathan ColesReporter:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video sarah-everard-map-key-locations-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Human remains were found in woodlands near Ashford, Kent last night after the marketing executive, , disappeared eight days ago. While formal identication awaits, Sarahaposs family said tonight: Our beautul daughter Sarah was taken from us and we are appealing for any information that will help to solve this terrible crime. Sarah was bright and beautul - a wonderful daughter and sister. She was kind and thoughtful, caring and dependable. She always put others first and had the most amazing sense of humour.  She was strong and principled and a shining example to us all. We are very proud of her and she brought so much joy to our lives. We would like to thank our friends and family for all their support during this awful time and we would especially like to thank Sarah’s friends who are working tirelessly to help. We are so grateful to the police and would like to thank them for all they are doing. We are now pleading for additional help from the public. Please come forward and speak to the policeyou have any information. No piece of information is too insignicant. Thank you.  A police officer arrested on suspicion of the kidnap and murder of Sarah has been further detained in custody, the Met said this evening. PC Wayne Couzens, , of the force, is being quizzed over her disappearance. He remains in custody at a London police station after an application to extend his detention was granted at Wimbledon Magistrates’ Court, the Met said. A woman aged in her s, who was arrested at the same time on suspicion of assisting an offender, has been released on bail toto a police station on a date in mid-April. Sarah’s family have been informed of these developments, the Met added. The family statement comes this evening after it emerged Couzens was rushed to hospital with a head injury. Scotland Yard said the suspect was injured in custody and taken for treatment before being ed. A statement said: The suspect was taken to a hospital for treatment to a head injury sustained while in custody.  He has since been discharged and ed to custody. We are not prepared to discuss further. Couzens was arrested on Tuesday night on suspicion of kidnap, before being rearrested yesterday on suspicion of murder. He is also being detained over a separate allegation of indecent exposure. It is claimed that CCTV footage from a passing bus led to his arrest, with another report claiming a car linked to the suspect was allegedly spotted on a motoristaposs dashcam. The serving cop - a member of the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command - is thought to have been off-duty when Sarah disappeared. Cressida Dick, the Metaposs Commissioner, announced the discovery of the human remains last night. She said identying could take time and added that the force was utterly appalled that one of their own had been arrested.

Sarah, , was last seen on CCTV shortly after exiting a property on Leathwaite Road in Clapham at around pm a week ago. She had been heading home to Brixton, a walk which should have taken around  minutes. Her disappearance sparked a huge manhunt, with family members said to have travelled  miles from their homes in York to help.

The Independent Office for Police Conductis looking into whether Met Police officers responded appropriately to the report of indecent exposure. It was one of five matters referred to the IOPC, which is carrying out its own probe alongside the Met investigation into Ms Everardaposs disappearance and suspected murder. Serving PC Wayne Couzens, a Met Police officer who protected diplomats and VIPs, was arrested on suspicion of abducting and murdering the -year-old marketing executive. He was also arrested on a separate allegation of indecent exposure after he was allegedly reported over an incident in a south London fast food restaurant on February . Do you know the takeaway where the incident allegedly occurred  Email webnews@mirror.  The alleged incident is said to have occurred three days before Ms Everard went missing while walking from a friendaposs house in Clapham, south London, to her home in Brixton at about .pm on March . It is claimed married dad-of-two Couzens, , finished a six-hour relief sht at the US Embassy in Nine Elms, south London, at pm on the night Ms Everard vanished. She left her friendaposs home at about pm and was last seen on a doorbell camera at about .pm as she walked towards her house in Brixton. It is understood Couzens, part of the Westminster-based Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command, was arrested at his home in Deal, Kent, late on Tuesday after ing from work in London.  Murder detectives have been granted more time to quiz Couzens. A woman in her s, who was arrested at the same address in Kent on suspicion of assisting an offender, has been released on bail until mid-April. These are the five matters which have been referred to the police watchdog. Alleged murder of Ms Everard One of the matters relates to the alleged murder of marketing executive Ms Everard, given that the person in custody is a serving police officer. Couzens, a former car mechanic, was an armed member with an elite unit that protects diplomats and VIPs. Police suspect Ms Everard was abducted and murdered by a stranger, and have had Couzens in custody since late Tuesday night. Human remains were found on Wednesday as police searched an abandoned golf and paintball centre near Ashford, Kent, some  miles from where Ms Everard was last seen alive.

Indecent exposure allegation Couzens was accused of exposing himself to a woman at a south London takeaway on February , three days before Ms Everard disappeared. The complaint itself is being investigated because the person accused is a police officer. How police handled that allegation A third matter relates to how two of Couzensapos Met Police colleagues handled the report of the alleged incident. It is said the incident was reported by staff and was captured on CCTV. Despite the allegation of indecent exposure, Couzens continued working until his arrest six days after Ms Everard was alleged abducted.  Staff reported it to police on the night, but it is said no action was taken in connection over the alleged incident, the Sun reported. Had Couzens been arrested on suspicion of indecent exposure, his firearm licence would have been revoked and he would not have been allowed to continue working. Former Met Police detective chief inspector Mick Neville said: He would have been suspended from duty and would have been at home. It is claimed the complaint had not reached command level and his colleagues are unlikely to have been aware of the allegation, the Daily Mail reported. Original reports of disappearance The fourth matter involves the way the Met Police handled the original reports of the disappearance of Ms Everard. She spoke to her boyfriend, Josh Lowth, on the phone shortly before she went missing near Poynders Gardens in Clapham at about .pm on March . Lambeth Police appealed for information from the public at .am on March , tweeting: We are increasingly concerned for the #missing Sarah Everard, , form Brixton. She was last seen on rd March in the area of Clapham Common.  Suspectaposs head injury The IOPC is also investigating how Couzens was injured in a cell at a police station in Wandsworth, where he was being monitored by CCTV. He received immediate first aid when he was found unconscious with a head injury, and taken to hospital for treatment. Couzens has since been discharged and ed to a police station. There is no suggestion anyone  was involved in the incident. What have the watchdog and police said  The IOPC said: The Independent Office for Police Conducthas started an independent investigation into whether politan Police Serviceofficers responded appropriately to a report of indecent exposure. The IOPC’s investigation follows a conduct referral from the MPS in relation to two officers, receivednight, which is linked to four other referrals. They are all connected to the arrest of a serving MPS officer on suspicion of kidnap, murder and a separate allegation of indecent exposure. Our investigation will look at the actions of the MPS after police received a report on  Februarythat a man had exposed himself at a fast food restaurant in South London. we determined that two conduct referrals relating to kidnap murder and indecent exposure allegations against the arrested officer should remain under local investigation by the force. We are still assessing a mandatory referral in relation to the actions of police after they received a report that Sarah Everard was missing. A fth mandatory referral was received from the MPSin relation to police contact with the arrested officer who was treated in hospital after sustaining a head injury while in custody yesterday afternoon. That referral is also being assessed to determine what further action may be required from us. The Met Police said in a statement: Following the arrest of a police officer, the politan Police Servicemade two referrals, one mandatory and one voluntary, to the Independent Office for Police Conduct .

But while we were merely watching through the screen, lusting after their designer outfits and accessories, one woman was taking things a step further and actually splashing the cash to copy their style.London-based social media influencer, Chaly D.N. claims to have spent around £million buying luxury items including clothing, handbags and shoes just like the ones her icon, Kim Kardashian wears. Appearing on Trulyaposs Hooked on the Look, Chaly who bears a striking resemblance to the reality star, showed off her incredible wardrobe and explained how she became fascinated with Kim.She says she came across her Instagram one day and thought they looked alike. From there she began taking inspiration from Kimaposs fashion and now regularly gets stopped in the street to askshe is a Kardashian.Chaly recalls: I started following her on Instagram and was like ‘oh my god, is that me.aposPeople tell me I look like Kim Kardashian every single minute. Every time they see me on the street or at a party or everywhere. I get stopped for photos all the time – I love the attention, it’s someone telling you that you look like Kim!  The influencer, who has over , followers, is quick to stress that she hasnapost had any surgery to make herself look more like Kim - she says sheaposs only ever had botox and fillers. I don’t try to look like her I just naturally look like her, she adds. I haven’t had any surgeries to look like Kim but I’ve had Botox and fillers – everyone does it. But while she may not have copied her face, sheaposs definitely copying her clothes, spending around £, on designer handbags alone to keep up with the ones Kim is spotted out and about with.  Chaly went through some of her most expensive items on the show, with brands including Balmain, Gucci and Prada. She admitted her family and friends often worry sheaposs spending too much and going too far, but she still prefers the finer things. For instance, she was particularly fond of a £, faux fur Givenchy coat, saying: When I wear this, I feel like Kim Kardashian - and it feels so good. And she also bought a pair of £, Tom Ford heels which match Kimaposs, saying theyaposre one of her favourite pairs.

He came up with the idea after Pustovitova said she wanted to break up with him.

at Dens Park this season – now is the moment for Dundee to finally get it together.The defeat to Hearts at the weekend well and truly put to bed any hopes of a late party-pooping surge to deny the Jambos the title.However, quite clearly that all-important second spot is sitting there waiting to be taken.The Dark Blues may still be in mid-table outside the play-off places but they are still within touching distance of their goal.With the three A’s coming up next – Arbroath, Ayr and then Alloa – this is an opportunity to get on that all-important run they’ve been craving at Dens Park all season.Some A-plus performances are demanded from the fans and no wonder.The squad most certainly has the quality to rattle up three victories in the space of a week.And what a boost that would be for the season, not to mention manager James McPake.Fans haven’t been slow to criticise McPake but that comes with the territory of being Dundee manager in the Championship.Between now and the end of the season is where he can turn that criticism around.In the past week, I’ve been accused by a Dundee fan of needing a reality check in saying on our podcast Twa Teams One Street that I still think the Dark Blues can win promotion this season.I always appreciate people taking the time to write in, eventhey don’t agree with me.But it won’t change my opinion that McPake can get this team going.I always remember Harry Redknapp being asked ‘what makes a good manager ’ a few years back.His answer: ‘Good players’.That’s where my belief comes from in this Dundee team.That faith hasn’t been proved correct as yet, however.I’m not for a second suggesting everything so far under the current Dens boss has been good, every decision correct or that mistakes haven’t been made.Dundee are underachieving right at this moment.However, there is plenty of time left still this season.It feels strange being in March but Dundee aren’t long past the halfway stage of their league season.They have  matches remaining.From the start of the season, second place would be an acceptable finish.Yes, they should be much closer to Hearts than they are but catching Robbie Neilson’s side has proved a tall order.That’s left them with second place to fight for.And, fair to say, that fight hasn’t gone well so far.But, from a Dundee point of view, all that matters is the destination, not the route you take.Ten games to take control of second place and build up some form for the play-offs.That starts with Arbroath on Saturday followed by Ayr and Alloa – an opportunity the Dark Blues must grab.The top six may now be – just about – beyond them but Dundee United can take plenty of heart from their performance at the weekend.By my sums, they need something like a - win over Aberdeen and both St Mirren and St Johnstone to lose their matches to get into the top half.Unlikely.However, that shouldn’t worry United fans too much.Coming up last season, even being within three points of the top six with a game to go before the split would’ve been welcomed with open arms at the start of the campaign.Barring a monumental collapse and sudden revival of the bottom sides, relegation isn’t really a concern either these days.That means Micky Mellon can start planning properly for next season.And Sunday’s draw with Celtic should fill the manager and fans with confidence for what could come in the future.Celtic might not be anywhere near their best and missed chances left, right and centre but United earned their point.And could easily have won it at the end, had the final ball been better on their numerous breakaways.They showed they can mix it with the top sides.Now they have a wee breather before taking on the Dons.Could be a new manager bounce by then at Aberdeen – all eyes will be on the New Firm Derby at Tannadice.Congratulations have to go to Rangers and their boss Steven Gerrard for a fine season after they were crowned champions.They have been a class above the rest all season – though the same can’t be said for the supporters who crowded Ibrox and George Square over the weekend.I’m no fan of the Gers but I was pleased to see my old pal Glen Kamara earn his first winner’s medal.Immediately it was clear he was a class act when he arrived at Dundee and was destined for big things.It’s just a shame the paths of Kamara and the Dark Blues have been so dferent. vw, px\"

occasions to be celebrated with cards, gts, hugs and even kisses.One milestone, though, whose passing brings only melancholy and frustration is the marking of a year since fans were at a football game in this part of Scotland.The turnstiles have not clicked, the pies have stayed unmunched and the referees have had slightly less abuse than normal.Boy, have we missed it all.Around . pm on Tuesday, March , , I sauntered up to the main entrance at Dens Park from my usual parking space near Radio Tay.By coincidence, I had also worked at what would turn out to be Dundee United#s final fixture of the campaign # the - draw with Partick Thistle at Tannadice on the previous Saturday.By then, there was awareness that a new virus – recently named Covid- # had made its way from China to other parts of the world, including Scotland.The first case here had been confirmed on March , when a patient was diagnosed after ing home to Tayside from Italy.However, we were all still working at our desks in the office, rather than occupying the couches and armchairs that have become home to so many backsides since.Masks were still things that were worn by bankrobbers, Joe Wicks was a place where you bought kitchens and the Grassy Beach path down at the Stannergate had yet to be walked by half the population of the city.Indeed, le was normal enough for , spectators to gather – not distanced, socially or otherwise # to watch Dundee play Ayr United on a freezing cold night.My match report made no mention of the health tsunami that was about to engulf Scottish football.Of more interest to me as a local hack was a good - victory for the Dark Blues.It read: “Goals from Kane Hemmings and Olly Crankshaw sent Dundee leaping over opponents Ayr into third place in the Championship.“Hemmings raced clear of the visitors’ defence as the game at Dens Park ticked into its th minute, shooting low into the net.“Substitute Crankshaw made sure with a goal two minutes into injury-time after he was found by Graham Dorrans’ cutback.“James McPake’s men have now gone six games undefeated – three wins and three draws – and are now tucked in behind Inverness Caley Thistle, who are four points ahead in second spot in the table.”None of us really thought it would be the last time fans would be in the stadium.Lockdown followed, as did a crazy summer in Scottish football, with Dundee at the heart of it all with their infamous yes no vote.Supporters’ absence has undoubtedly highlighted the privileged position of a football writer.No journalist covering the national game will have taken for granted their seat # complete with name tag and or tick sticker – while thousands around them remain empty.Being brutally honest, there have been some positives to the lack of crowds.There is the parking – no need to arrive at Celtic Park or Ibrox hours before kick-off – but even that brings with it a pang of guilt as you drive through empty streets that should be full of hustle and bustle.Also, we lucky few have been treated to the wonders of the touchline banter. This has given us all an insight into how managers conduct their players during matches, although some of the industrial language has left you wishing your mask could cover your ears as well as your nose and mouth.Interviews have changed, not for the better. Pre-match stuff is one over Zoom, while post-match has seen some players who normally talk in hushed tones become completely inaudible behind their face coverings.The wall table police tape between media and football folk doesn’t help but we all know why the barrier is there and accept it.There has been worth to the action that has taken place on the pitch this season and every official at every club deserves immense credit for making it possible.It just hasn’t been the same without the atmosphere created by people.The great Jock Stein said: “Without fans who pay at the turnstile, football is nothing.”The legendary manager was, of course, right to highlight how the game needs those who love it most.It is a diminished spectacle without them.The remarkable thing is, when the history books cover Scottish football during the Covid era, fans will still take pride of place.Tales will be told of season tickets bought with no hope of attending matches, modest bank accounts and piggy-banks raided to keep their club alive, and all manner of community and charitable good deeds done.This is not a happy anniversary we mark this week but,you can, try to imagine that first sight of the green grass when the doors finally reopen.It will seem like Christmas, holiday time and your birthday all rolled into one. vw, px\"  Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"new-bbc-documentary-series-jamie-genevieve-great-indoors-air-week","story":"SOCIAL media star Jamie Genevieve will feature in a new documentary series this week."},{"url":null,"title":"list-glasgow-shops-administration-lockdown","story":"GLASGOWS prominent shopping streets will look very dferent post lockdown with many major retailers calling in the administrators."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-celtic-memories-stein-met-busby-collect-top-team-prize","story":"IT WAS quite a moment for football fans around the country, when Matt Busby presented Jock Stein with the team prize at the BBCrsquos Sports Review of ."},{"url":null,"title":"great-glaswegians-five-facts-first-scottish-makar-edwin-morgan","story":" Edwin Morganrsquos love of literature began when he was a young child, and his early interest sparked a career that would take him all the way to becoming Scotlandrsquos first Makar, or National Poet, of modern times."},{"url":null,"title":"quake-made-glasgow-shake-1964","story":"IT IS almost six decades since an earthquake big enough to hit the headlines around the world made Glasgow shake."},{"url":null,"title":"cooking-mrs-conetta-surreal-holiday-moment-simple-delicious-beef-stew","story":"OUR new columnist, Lee Conetta, is Glasgow food royalty, with many yearsrsquo experience helping to run one of the cityrsquos biggest restaurant groups.

pandemic, healthcare staff across the north-east were redeployed to dferent areas to help fight virus.Dental nurse Karen Stephen was one of those who took on a new role, becoming one of the many workers to become a tester.Karen and her colleagues quickly adapted to the challenge of testing, even though the role was dferent to anything she had done before.And having enjoyed learning new skills so much, Karen says it has given her the confidence to try new things.“I originally worked at the dental school as a dental nurse and have worked for the NHS since ,# she said.#I was redeployed in March to work as a tester. It was a matter of days between being told we were being redeployed and then starting work at the tent.“I was definitely thrown out of my comfort zone – doing your first swab is very scary, especially when you’ve not done it before! Trying to stick a cotton bud down somebody’s throat and not make them gag was hard at first. But once you’ve done a few it’s second nature.“There was a bit of trepidation in the early days but thankfully among all the staff there was not a single case of Covid between us. We were very well protected with PPE and everything like that. Now we’re at the point where you don’t even think about whether someone might have Covid – you are just there to do the swab.#Karen spoke of how she enjoyed being deployed to help out her colleagues.She added: “As much as I love dental nursing and I’ve done it from a young age, I’d like to do something dferent. It pushed me out my comfort zone and showed me I can do dferent things. What that is, I don’t know! But it’s not something I’d have considered before. I wouldn’t have thought I’d be able to learn something new.“I am definitely proud to be part of the NHS and of having done my bit. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at the tent andthey were short-staffed I would still go and help out. I really do enjoy it.#Coronavirus in Scotland – track the spread in these charts and maps\" title\"#Coronavirus in Scotland – track the spread in these charts and maps# # Evening Express\" src\"https:www.eveningexpress fp news specials coronavirus-in-scotland-track-the-spread-in-these-charts-and-maps embed # secretGkLOHVsD\" data-secret\"GkLOHVsD\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Covid vaccine in Scotland: Track the rollout progress with these charts\" title\"#Covid vaccine in Scotland: Track the rollout progress with these charts# # Evening Express\" src\"https:www.eveningexpress fp news specials covid-vaccine-in-scotland-track-the-rollout-progress-with-these-charts embed # secretCvxwBGAlmE\" data-secret\"CvxwBGAlmE\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. vw, px\"  "},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2021/03/shutterstock_1670462338-140x84.jpg class=attachment-part-small size-part-small wp-post-image ","title":"aberdeen school pupil absence rates discussed in new report","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remA new report shows the number of pupils absent from city schools during the coronavirus pandemic.Aberdeen City Council#s education operational delivery committee will discuss the report on education performance levels, which includes updates on the number of absences reported in school, both due to self-isolation as a result of Covid-, and for pupils being kept at home.The report, which covers between August  and February , shows that .% of pupils on average were physically attending schools in the week ending February .For the week up to February , there was  pupils in the local authority area who were self-isolating due to Covid-, and were undertaking learning at home # one of the lowest levels recorded.reIn the week up to December , there was  pupils reportedly self-isolating due to Covid-, compared to  the week before.Of those self-isolating as a result of Covid for the week ending February , only eight were unable to undertake learning at home.Also discussed in the report is the number of pupils absent due to parents who have chosen to keep their children away from school as a precautionary measure.In the week ending February , there were  such pupil absences. These numbers have remained fairly low throughout the pandemic, however peaked on December , with  non-compulsory absences reported.The report, which will be discussed on Wednesday, states: #Early Learning and Childcare and Primary pupils in P- ed to physical provision on nd February, along with select numbers of senior phase pupils, which is being monitored through the management information systems in place.#In the week-ending th February, there were , P- pupil physical attendancesand , senior phase pupil attendances.

children to attend physical provision.#From the commencement of the current term, an average of around  children of key workers and over  vulnerable pupils have been in physical attendance on each school day, which is in line with the national picture, taking account of the known proportions of each cohort within the community.#Attendance of vulnerable pupils, where physical attendance is prevented, is also supplemented by specialist online measures where learners are enabled to access targeted support provided by school-based or other professional staff.#For as little as £. a month

We’ve brought incomers too: piglets from Cowal, calves from Loch Awe and a flock of wild blackies from Dana. Together we’ve set up home and embarked on a mission to live off the land.It’s funny to call something so basic a ‘mission’ asTom Cruise were about to somersault through a window with a self-destructing message exploding in his fist. For millennia it was how everyone lived, yet now the idea of denying oneself a breakfast of Peruvian avocado washed down with a Calornian almond-milk-latte seems intrepid,not heroic.The most heroic thing that happens here on our croft is the odd rugby tackle of a daft ewe trailing half a bramble bush behind her, or brushing one shaggy highland calf when her two pals are desperate for their turn. Our three girls are almost a year old now and on the ridge below our house with the Sound of Jura behind them they look unarguably majestic, but take a closer look and there’s a bucket of mischief in those ginger-fringed eyes.Take too long preening one young lady and there’ll be four stubby horns threatening the backside of either the groomer or the groomed. The pushiest of these -kilo beasties will then ensconce herself in the salon seat, head thrown back, eyes closed while her gorgeous tresses are prettied.It certainly would be mission impossibleanyone were even to suggest these pampered princesses were plate-bound. Their job is to look pretty and maybe have a wee winch with a handsome local bull when they come of age, but we’re not all veggies here on the croft, so something had to be done.The meat section is a pretty strip of woodland inhabited by three of the daftest, squeakiest saddleback pigs this side of Glen Croe. They’re known as Small, Medium and Splodge in the vain hope of maintaining a strictly professional relationship. Their main carer has, however, been encouraging them to use her as a playground to be climbed on, bounced on and nibbled. She, our eldest daughter, assures me she will still happily feast on sausages when the time comes.We’re already enjoying the two lambs and the ewe who made the ultimate sacrice a couple of weeks ago, so the precedent has been set, but it’s not easy. Easy would be flinging New Zealand chops and Danish bacon into the shopping trolley, but that’s not part of the ‘mission’. We’ll cut back on the almond-lattes and avocado toasts, but will the croft yield Argyll’s finest cocoa and coffee beans – and a mountain of chardonnay grapes  This is my mission and I choose to accept it…"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor february 5 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Many TSB customers will have a very long journey to reach their nearest branch. Not everybody can use internet banking.The FCA has already pointed out that during the Covid pandemic it will be hard for banks to reach their customers and engage effectively with them on closure proposals.They also pointed out that customers may not be able to get to a bank to make the necessary preparations before the closure, such as transferring to another bank.Instead of just pointing out these dficulties, the FCA should step in and tell TSB not to go ahead with these closures.Leaving only one TSB branch open in Argyll and Bute is unacceptable.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardSir,After an exceptionally challenging year for older people, Age Scotland is seeking their views in the first comprehensive survey of what it is like to grow older in Scotland.The Big Survey explores all areas of le for older people including health and wellbeing, housing, media representation and the impact of Covid-.We hope to gain a better insight into what older people think, experience and care about.

Indeed, it’s clear that this is the most worrying time in recent history to get a cancer diagnosis.At Macmillan, people are calling our support line every day to tell us about the heightened anxiety, loneliness and distress that they are feeling.On our support line – open seven days a week on     – specially trained nurses, counsellors and financial support advisors are available to help anyone affected by, or worried about, cancer. They can provide comprehensive information and advice, as well as emotional support, to help people with cancer cope with the additional strain of the coronavirus pandemic.We know doctors and nurses are working in unspeakably dficult conditions and are having to make tough decisions every day. Healthcare professionals are doing everything they can to keep cancer care on track, but we also know that some treatment – operations, for example – are being cancelled or postponed because essential services such as ITU are full of seriously ill people with Covid-.What is absolutely vital is thatthere are changes to treatment plans, these must involve the person living with cancer and be communicated clearly.Although some changes may be needed for treatment plans, this is not the case everywhere or for all treatments or tests. Healthcare professionals are doing everything they can to make hospitals a safe environment so it’s really important that people with cancer who have been invited for tests or treatment do attend.GPs are openyou are worried about possible cancer symptoms, and screening and other vital tests have resumed in a Covid-safe way. The NHS is still here for you.As well as our support line, comprehensive cancer information and support is also available on www.macmillan.org.uk and our online community is there to provide invaluable emotional and peer support.Gordon McLean, strategic partnership manager in Scotland for Macmillan Cancer SupportSir,Inclusion Scotland, the leading Scottish disabled people’s organisation, believes that planning for the post Covid- Scotland must be about building towards a more inclusive future for disabled people, not back to an old #normal# that excluded a lot of us.As we launch our manesto for the  Scottish Parliament elections, disabled people have told us about the problems they face daily, both before and as a result of Covid-, and what needs to change.Before Covid-, disabled people were already some of the most marginalised and excluded in society.We were more likely to live in poverty, be unemployed or earn less than non-disabled people, and less likely to leave school with qualications, because of the barriers and exclusion we face in our day-to-day lives.The Covid- crisis and responses to it highlighted this, aggravating existing inequalities and generating new ones, and putting the human rights of disabled people at further risk.Going back to the way things were before is not the answer. We don’t want to go back. We want to go forward to a more inclusive future.The manesto # Rights and Renewal # sets out what disabled people told Inclusion Scotland are the most important issues they face and what needs to be done to make a post-pandemic Scotland a better place for disabled people. It has five key asks:I call on all political parties fighting the Scottish Parliament elections and their candidates to pledge their support for disabled people’s Five Asks.Dr Sally Witcher, Inclusion Scotland chief executive officerSir,Our dilapidated roads continue to be raised as an issue by many constituents.While I understand that our roads department is struggling due to local authority budgets being cut, much more still needs to be done.It has been said to me time and time again that we are fast approaching the point of noand when it comes to our roads and that neglecting day-to-day maintenance will end up costing us more in the long run.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures february 12 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Once again, the group excelled, taking the tally for the month to beyond , miles.The Camanachd Association ran a competition on the final day of the month – whoever ran the furthest would be rewarded with a Scotland replica top from association partners Macronstore Highland.Aberdeen University player Joe Folan set the early pace, clocking up . miles at am. But Paul Ross put in an impressive . miles an hour later and must have thought he had wrapped it up when checking the group#s Strava leader board in the evening.Joe had one eye on the prize too though and snuck out for a . mile run at .pm to pip Paul to top of the leader board.Derek Keir, Camanachd Association chief executive officer, said: #We were delighted so many people joined us in staying active this January.#The positive impact being active has on your physical and mental health cannot be overstated.A key component of our strategy is to engage shinty communities. It was especially pleasing to see non-shinty players join our Strava group and help to get us to Barcelona and back.#The Camanachd Association also raised more than £ for the Scottish Association for Mental Heath through the event."},{"url":null,"title":"staying active while home schooling","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It therefore has a special responsibility to do all it can to advance the peace process.So, while calling for an end to violence, it is simultaneously supplying the weapons necessary to prolong the conflict.The shameful neglect of this leadership role and continued licensing of arms to facilitate Saudi-led offensives is unsustainable. It is a stance that leaves the UK increasingly isolated on the global stage, with countries including Germany, Italy and the Netherlands already banning the export of arms to Saudi Arabia.The UK government now faces a choice: to join President Biden and live up to its obligations as UN penholder by ending the UK’s involvement in the Saudi campaign, or to continue to act as both peacekeeper and warmonger, undermining any moral leadership it might claim.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,The SNP has voted to conceal Alex Salmond#s evidence to the parliamentary inquiry.The Scottish Conservatives brought a vote to the Salmond inquiry demanding that Salmond’s evidence, much of which is already in the public domain, be published.This would allow Salmond to give crucial evidence in person about the SNP#s botched handling of this case. All the SNP MSPs on the committee, however, voted against its publication, meaning it will not be released.The Scottish public deserves to know the truth of what happened and why £, of public money had to be paid to Salmond.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,The personal testimony of the men and boys in the final independent report into non-recent sexual abuse in Scottish football # who have shown incredible courage # demonstrates how needed this independent review has been.The abuse young players have suffered in football is inexcusable and heart-breaking. By bravely speaking up, they provided the catalyst for the review and the changes that will come from it are thanks to them.We welcome the ongoing work the Scottish Football Associationhas carried out in light of the report’s recommendations and encourage them to continue their progress.The SFA is showing it is willing to listen and implement changes that ensure no more children suffer the experiences described in the report.We are pleased to see children and young people’s involvement in the process, including the consultation with the Scottish Children’s Parliament. The voices of children and young people are crucial to developing improvements for their own wellbeing and safety and to change a culture where children can be frightened to speak up.Safeguarding in Sport, a partnership between Children st and sportscotland, has developed the Standards for Child Wellbeing and Protection in Sport, which state children have a right to express their views and have their voice taken into account. We are keen to support the SFA in its continued implementation of the recommendations to create a culture in football where we can be sure that every child is safe to enjoy the huge benefits of participating in sport.Any volunteer or official looking for advice or support about a child can contact safeguardinginsport@childrenst.org.uk or contact the Children st Parentline service on   or online at www.childrenst.org.uk parentline.Mary Glasgow, chief executive, Children st.Sir,Zero Waste Scotland’s Energy Efficiency Business Support Service provides free, independent advice to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprisesto introduce more energy efficient technology.Businesses can apply for an interest-free Scottish Government SME loan of £, to £,, with a maximum cashback grant of £, for those eligible.Many businesses in Argyll and Bute have decided to take action to reduce their energy use, adding profit directly to the bottom line while helping Scotland meet its target to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by .Since , the impartial advice given to companies in the region has identied almost £m of potential energy savings through heating, lighting and building upgrades.To find out more or to apply, visit www.energy.zerowastescotland.org.uk.

Options! There is only one possible and that should be obvious.When I first moved to Argyll, driving through Glen Croe was a beautul feeling that I had left the urban areas behind and come out into fresh country. No longer # it is a disaster zone and will remain so for a number of years, and possibly decades,a new  safe road is not built.With the elections in May for the Scottish Government, we should be calling on our  politicians to deliver a suitable road through Glen Croe and to do it soon, not  years  away with no firm plans to do it even then. Our politicians are in hiding and it is time they should deliver.The option should be for a new safe road well away from any landslide so that we, the inhabitants of Argyll, can get back to some normal le.Derrick Anstee, InveraraySir,The neglect of the A is a disgrace.It’s not just the long detour via Crianlarich when it rains heavily, it’s the potholes and ruts when we get a spell of cold weather.Three years ago we had a cold winter and the A became a dirt track. Emergency repairs had to be carried out. The Scottish Government said they’d solved the problem. Now we have another cold winter, and again emergency repairs are needed.Other trunk roads in Scotland don’t get closed when it rains or get all these ruts and potholes in a cold winter.We need serious money invested now to solve the A problems. Yet all we get from the Scottish Government is waffle about y public inquiries.We need money and action now to make the A as reliable as Scotland’s other trunk roads, not more cheap solutions.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardMr Reid is the LibDem candidate for May#s Scottish parliamentary electionSir,With reference to theto school, I do hope that the pupils in Lochgilphead Joint Campus are kept in at lunchtime instead of being allowed to roam the streets like herds of wildebeast, with absolutely no social distancing or the wearing of masks.There is a perfectly good ing canteen restaurant in the school and or packed lunches.There is no need, at this time, for them all to be out and crowding supermarkets, fast food shops, cafes and chippies.This needs to be addressed by the Argyll and Bute education department as soon as possible.Name and address suppliedSir,In a leaflet delivered to every home in the Argyll and Bute constituency, Conservative MSP Donald Cameron claims that the #UK Governmentannounced the Argyll and Bute Rural Growth Deal worth £ million# and goes on to say that he is working with local councillors #including Alastair Redman# to #see what further action is needed#.The Rural Growth Deal, however, is a joint project involving £ million from the Scottish Government and a matched sum from the UK Government as well as more than £ million from other sources.In addition the deal has its origins in discussions between the Argyll and Bute MSP Michael Russell, then Scottish Government Finance Secretary John Swinney and the former leader of Argyll and Bute Council, Dick Walsh, in February .

The conversations, Kaya hopes, will feel like the discussion that would usually evolve over a cup of tea or an evening pint.Kaya, who begins her residency this month, will record the conversations which will be stitched together as a sound-based artwork called Milk + Two Sugars which will eventually be exhibited on the island for local audiences to engage with and listen to.Over the last few weeks, invitations have been extended to the local residentsin the communities of The Bush and Ballochgoy. To take part they need only call   armed with a ‘cuppa’ of their choosing.The phoneline will be open to two people per day between am-pm on Thursday March  and Friday th, Thursday March  and Friday th. An answer phone message will be available in between times for people to register their interest in taking part.Kaya, who graduated from Duncan of Jordanstone in  with BA Hons First Class in Art and Philosophy in , said: #I begin this residency with a strong nostalgic feeling of connection to Rothesay even though only knowing it through family anecdotes of holidays there. I hope this residency extends these memories into my own stories of the people and stories I come to meet.#With Milk + Two Sugars, I aim to extend these connections beyond a screen and focus on the house phone as my source of extension. I anticipate these oral histories will create an enticing sound landscape reverberated in public spaces for the very community that it captures. The work will also be available to call and hear via a phone number—extending off the island the essence of Bute, those who call it home.#The residency, now in its third iteration, creating an opportunity for emerging artists, whose practice is rooted in social engagement.The Contemporary Visual Art Programme is led by Sophie Crichton-Stuart and curated by Morven Gregor."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures february 26 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Not before time.I was supportive of the mitigation plan, using nets and catch pits, as the simplest and least expensive approach. It was certainly worth a try, but it is abundantly clear now # with reputedly £ million spent # that it is not working.The , tonnes or more poised to come down on the road may well be an underestimate, and recent closures of the OMR, despite the new bund, doesn’t say very much for the efficacy of the protection. So we need an alternative, and we need it soon, not  years away.Talk of #alternative traffic corridors# is just a distraction.There may well be a case for a bridge-and-tunnel approach. Such has been successful in Norway and # notably # both in Iceland and Faroe Islands, which have much smaller resource bases than Norway. But these would be long-term schemes, each requiring the completion of several major interlinked crossings, for the like of which Scotland’s roads authority has hitherto shown neither interest nor aptitude.The problem at the Rest is a local one which requires a local solution. It’s only a mile or so of road which is at issue there.The alternatives, realistically, boil down to three:Overhead protection might well be required over quite a long distance, as it’s not just the bit at the catch pits which is threatened. The slopes of the Cobbler have experienced slides too. Since the hillside ies it might not be possible to use standard prefabricated modules, and in any case installation work would close the A for some time.A tunnel through to Butterbridge could be driven quite quickly # particularlythe Norwegians did it # but the approach in upper Glen Croe would require protection just like the OMR. Sir William Lithgow’s proposal mentions this, but construction would also almost certainly close the OMR, leaving no ersion for that period.The construction of a new alignment up the south west side of the glen, however, either on or roughly parallel to the existing forestry road, would avoid interference with through traffic.Both the gradient and the transverse slope would be substantially similar to those of the existing A, though thewould be marginally greater, which is probably why the north east side was chosen when the #new# A was built.The core of the case for the third option, however, is that the south west side of the glen has experienced far less erosion, both historically and in recent years, than the north east one.Stand at the upper viewpoint, or better still a little way along the Lochgoilhead road, and look around. The slopes of Ben Luibhean on which the A runs show far more watercourses and gullies than any of the others in the vicinity.This indicates a lot more rainfall impacting that slope, probably by the prevailing weather being funnelled on to it through the pass at the top of Glen More. And that weather is becoming worse.There have been no major slips over the forestry road in recent years, despite a spate of them on the opposite slope. It may just be the trees. I don’t think so, but in any case the trees are there, while it would take some years for tree cover to established above the A.Going back a lot further in time, the pattern is the same. The burn in the floor of upper Glen Croe has been pushed, over the centuries, by slip debris coming down from the north east slope, and the depth of that debris can easily be seen in the gullies recently carved in it behind the new bund.There is also a fair number of impressively-sized boulders on the lower slopes on that side, which at some point rolled down the hillside. Some of these came from the Cobbler, and although most are below the road a few are not. There is nothing to say that more will not arrive.A further point is that while the lower slopes on each side of the upper glen are similar, those on the south west side ease off towards the top, while those on the NE slope do not.It is on these upper slopes that the small slips develop which can pick up more and more water and debris on their way down, hence the fan shape of the typical slip. There is, in other words, a lot less potential for the initiation of slips on the south west side.I think that this all points to the need for a serious look at the forestry road, and I fail to understand why the investigations a few years ago dismissed it as a viable alternative.It’s the existing A which isn’t viable. And why any of these solutions would take  years to complete also beats me. Local objections  There is only one house in upper Glen Croe, and in the rest of Argyll I have yet to meet anyone who doesn’t want a permanent solution.My suspicion is that the biggest dficulty is that Transport Scotland can’t yet find a way to explain how £ million could be spent to such little effect. I might, of course, be wrong in all this, but I wait to be convinced of it.Arthur Blue, ArdrishaigSir,Since the temporary repairs to the Rest are clearly getting nowhere and costing money into the bargain, I would like to suggest a radical solution to the problem, and that is to build a viaduct right down the centre of the valley, based on the design of the MillauFor those not familiar with this structure, it is well worth an internet search. I believe this is still the world#s tallest bridge and is a really beautul structure.Seen from a distance, the white deck and piers look quite unreal # moreBefore anyone asks where that sum of money is to be found, I would point out that Boris Johnson#s proposed tunnel to Northern Ireland may cost between £ billion and £ billion # nobody knows because it hasn#t been designed yet. Nevertheless, Alister Jack is extremely enthusiastic about the proposal, so clearly money is not a problem.Not only would this new viaduct solve the problem once and for all, I suspect that, like the Millau Viaduct, it would become a much-photographed tourist attraction.John McCall, LochgilpheadSir,In last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser, Councillor Alastair Redman criticises the SNP for setting aside £, of its own money to campaign for an independent Scotland.Not surprisingly, he fails to enlighten us as to the costs of  the Tory party#s #Union Unit# set up by the Prime Minister at the taxpayers# expense.David Hay, MinardSir,Due to the speed with which the NHS is carrying out its vaccination programme, there is hope that we can soon all get out again andto normal.We still, however, face huge challenges. The economy has suffered. The NHS faces a big backlog of cancelled operations. Our young people have a lot of schooling to catch up on. We don’t have much time left to stop our climate changing before it is too late.Here in Argyll the Scottish Government must rise to the challenge of building a permanent solution at the Rest and Be Thankful.These must be our priorities. We can’t afford to spend the next few years arguing over independence.

And this number may continue to fall uponto play, as it is anticipated that only half of coaches are expected toto paid positions.In the last year, proactive measures have been put in place in a bid to increase the number of female high-performance coaches, who currently make up  per cent of all performance coaching roles.UK Sport recently launched its leadership programme in a bid to double the representation of female coaches in the Olympic and Paralympic high-performance community by Paris . The programme involves leading coaches mentoring a cohort of  through a six-month course that aims to help them reach the top of their respective sports.And to ensure talented coaches have the opportunity to join the high-performance pathway, UK Coaching has also recently introduced its own female leadership programme, working with national governing bodies to develop female coaches and elevate the positions of women in coaching across all sports at the base of the performance pathway.Yet with UK Coaching’s research showing the importance of female role models and activity levels among this group lower than that of their male counterparts, the organisation believes female coaches will be fundamental as the nation rebuilds after the pandemic.Emma Atkins, director of coaching at UK Coaching said: #We want to see more women come into coaching, be supported to stay in coaching and,it is their goal, progress to coaching in talent and high-performance sport.#Gender equality in sport has made considerable strides in recent years but we must move towards a balanced coaching workforce # and that means showing women that coaching is for them. It is an incredibly rewarding experience. We need more female coaches and we are calling on sports organisations to work with us in our mission to achieve an equitable   split in the next five years.#Our research shows that it’s really important that when starting to get active, women and girls are more comfortabletheir coach is the same gender. With the levels of inactivity amongst women and girls at a high, it is vital that we can encourage more females to join the coaching workforce.#"},{"url":null,"title":"lockdown heroes receive thank you gifts","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Without this investment, said the authority, there would have been a signicant deterioration in condition.Councillor Robin Currie, leader of the council, said: #We accept that many of our roads are in a bad way and we have listened to our communities.#This was reflected in our budget decision and as a priority we are putting as much resource as is possible into addressing the situation.

Melrose, Tweedbank, Earlston and Lauder are among the places within the ward.The pitches below originally appeared in the print edition of the Border on February .Jonny Adamson Jonny AdamsonIrsquom fed up with local politics not working.For  years, Irsquove had an interest in the campaign to secure an indoor tennis facility for the Borders.Last year, however, the project stalled and we were given little in the way of communication from the council on the decision.As someone who believes strongly in creating opportunities for young people, and knowing the dference this facility would have made, I felt let down and frustrated.Having engaged with hundreds of people across our community in the last year, Irsquove learned my experience is all too common. People donrsquot feel heard on issues affecting them.Instead of listening to communities, the current administration makes decisions without putting the needs and views of people first.Itrsquos not good enough, and certainly not what is needed as we look to rebuild from the pandemic.So what began as somewhat of a single issue campaign for me, has grown into something much wider.Our local services have been cut to the bone in recent years. Yes, there are funding challenges for all local authorities, but some of the spending decisions taken by this administration have been woeful.As a result, too many of our roads are not fit for purpose, bus services are under threat, playparks are being closed, recycling services reduced, outdoor spaces are not always maintained and public CCTV systems arenrsquot being funded.We can, and must, do better. This isnrsquot time for tribal party politics. We need a constructive approach that prioritises investment in our public services ensuring better roads, protection of green spaces, more opportunities for active travel, greater support for local businesses and groups and resources for our schools.An approach that always works to ensure that peoplersquos needs and views are at the very heart of decisions affecting our community.I know itrsquos possible and,you put your trust in me, yoursquoll get a councillor who will work tirelessly to make it happen.I promise to be an approachable, accessible, committed and energetic representative who will listen to you and make sure your voice is being heard.Mary Douglas Mary DouglasI have lived on a farm in the ward for over  years.My sons, who live and work in the ward, attended Melrose Primary School, as do two of my grandchildren. I worked for the NHS for most of my career before I retired.I am chair of the Scotland Multiple Sclerosiscouncil, and vice chair of the Borders MS Group. In addition, I am a Walk It leader in Earlston.As a member of the community, contributor to and consumer of council services one of my priorities will be to challenge how and why vital decisions on the use of finance and resource, which affect us all, are made.I, and many people I have spoken to, are concerned about planning processes.Permission is granted for large residential and other developments, often in questionable locations, seemingly without consideration of or investment in, the vital infrastructure required to support them.As is now evident, existing services are already stretched to capacity or facing cutbacks, including the NHS, education, social work, water etc. yet more extensive building is planned in the ward.How, for example, was the land at Melrose Gait considered a suitable location for a large residential development next to the refuse centre, on polluted ground, with an inadequate road to serve it.What consideration was given to the additional demands on the wider range of public services needed to support this scheme and its hundreds of residents.The COVID pandemic has most likely changed the way we live long term, people are now working from home, many permanently.Investment is needed in reliable broadband and mobile phone coverage, particularly in rural areas where signals can be unreliable, to support this new way of working.Existing offices, shops and other buildings that may become empty as a result of the pandemic could be repurposed for residential use, with careful planning.As we move forward the COVID Pandemic has made the most effective use of limited resources even more essential in the short and long term.The Borders must emerge from the pandemic in the strongest possible shape to best support the community and businesses into the future.I have no affiliation to any political party. I have always voted for who I believe can make a dference and contribute to local services.I believe that with my experience in public services and a knowledge of the local community I can help provide a focus for the council on the issues and problems that are faced day to day by the people of the Borders.Jenny Linehan Jenny LinehanMy professional le as both a former procurator fiscal and local solicitor taught me two things: speak plainly and never try to second guess the lives of others.Convincing you of my credentials to be your Scottish Conservative councillor for Leaderdale and Melrose is, therefore, a straightforward proposition for me: I will practice honest politics I will do my best to find out what it is that you most care about and fight your corner.Having lived in the ward for  years, I know how strong and ied our local Bordersrsquo economy is.We are lucky in Leaderdale and Melrose to have some of the best high streets in Scotland but they are under threat.I know the value of small business to our economy whether itrsquos standing up for farmers in Blainslie or supporting hotels in Melrose, to helping new businesses set up in Tweedbank.I will work tirelessly to ensure they receive the support they need.As this goes to print, the Scottish Conservatives have successfully pushed the SNP into a U-turn on extending business rates relief.Thatrsquos the kind of action I want to see from our government, not the dither and delay that wersquove seen from the SNP that threatens livelihoods and stles local enterprise.The challenge isnrsquot just to our economy. COVID- has been tough on all of us.With a vaccine on the way there is light at the end of the tunnel. Our NHS staff at the BGH have been fantastic.I would like to thank them for all the work they are doing to keep Borderers safe and healthy.As the mother of three children, education is another priority for me. Our teachers in the Borders have done an excellent job in dficult circumstances but the reality is they are being let down by the SNP government in Edinburgh, who would rather focus on independence than the future wellbeing of the next generation of Scots.I believe that education should be our priority, not further constitutional ision.I will work with our fantastic Scottish Conservative team on the council to make sure Borders schools get their fair share.Michael Needham Michael NeedhamMichael joined the Scottish Green Party several years ago after reflecting on a future with the impact of climate change, war, nuclear and pollution as key national and global concerns.Locally, however, the immediate priority is helping the Leaderdale and Melrose community to a Green recovery following the impacts of COVID- and considering how the new normal should develop.Scottish Borders Green Party welcomes the climate emergency declaration and Michael would push the local council into changing the words of the announcement into actions.Having studied the local development plan, Michael aims to drive environmental change with new builds utilising low carbon heating systems such as heat pumps, regulation has delayed mandatory use of these systems until  but we should show the carbon zero ambitions in the Borders together with improved local authority provision of electric vehicle charging facilities.With a greater gap between income levels and rental   house prices and a lack of affordable housing within the Leaderdale and Melrose areas, itrsquos vital that any new developments at least complies with the minimum provisions agreed for low cost housing.Michael would also aim to protect and improve local bus and train services throughout the Borders and ensure that the operators continue to work towards restoring timetables following the restrictions.The Scottish Green Party was responsible for changes within the Scottish Government that will mean under s will soon get free bus travel throughout Scotland.Other key local issues are: saving the high street with a shop local campaign, unemployment, which has always been more challenging in the Borders, together with people typically earning lower wages.Michael is from Galashiels, has lived most of his le in the Borders and works in the contact centre industry he is currently working from home and is acting co-lead GMB union rep and has been involved in national campaigning to make firing people to re-hire on lesser terms and conditions illegal.Michael is a disability champion within the global organisation he works for and is involved in union policy change and disability discrimination.John Paton Day John Paton DayLeaderdale  Melrose is the jewel in the crown of the Scottish Borders.Then, I may be biased, having lived, worked and raised my family here for the last  years.I have dedicated myself to standing up for numerous grassroots and vital voluntary causes that are close to the hearts of so many in our community.From co-founding the lsquoBorders Small Schools Networkrsquo to chairing Earlston Community Council, I am proud to serve those who call Leaderdale  Melrose home.Itrsquos important that our representatives within Scottish Borders Council understand the needs of local people.It is for this reason that I highlight the following three issues, on which I am seeking your vote next month.The first issue is roads.After yet another cold and wet winter our local roads require urgent repair and improvement ndash and this is not just dealing with potholes: we need to ensure all those using those roads can do so in the safest manner possible.Next is rural housing. As a committee member of Scottish Borders Housing Association, I am ready and able to hold to account those in charge of building affordable housing.I will call for increased investment to speed up the delivery of warmer, safer homes for all.And finally, recycling.Itrsquos vital we are able to do our bit to protect the environment and leave our Borders beautul for the next generation to enjoy however, many of our smaller villages are currently without facilities that make everyday recycling accessible.Itrsquos for this reason I will be seeking greater provision of recycling points that are accessible to all our towns and villages.Last, but by no means least, many of you will be familiar with the hard work and dedication of our much-missed colleague, Councillor Kevin Drum.When Kevin passed away last March after a short illness his loss was felt by so many in our community.Retaining this seat for the SNP will enable me to pick up where Kevin left off continuing his legacy of putting others first and helping to build a better Borders for all.Scott Redpath Scott RedpathThe impact of COVID over the last year has shown us the importance of working together and proved beyond doubt that it is through collective action, rather than constitutional arguments, that we can best face up to the great challenges of our times.I am neither unionist nor nationalist but a socialist and Irsquom standing for Labour in this election because I believe that jobs, wages and public services are key to our recovery from the pandemic.Born and bred in the Borders Irsquove spent most of the last two decades as a shopworker, serving my community, getting to know the problems and challenges people face.Irsquom an experienced campaigner and an active member of the shopworkers union USDAW.I successfully campaigned for changes in the law to protect my colleagues from abuse and tackle the bad practices of employers who, sadly, too often sought to cut corners when it came to their safety and pay.As a councillor I would campaign for a rise in the minimum wage to pound and would push to ensure that the key workers who have stepped up so magnicently during COVID are recognised not just by rainbows and rounds of applause but by better working conditions and proper pay.I would bring an independence of mind to the council chamber, campaigning for action to tackle the attainment gap in our local schools, ensuring people have the quality public services they deserve, pushing for a publicly owned local bus system that better meets our needs properly connecting our towns and villages and ensure that funding provided to SBC to assist people during and after the pandemic gets to those who need it most quickly and without red tape holding them back.On March  vote Labour to help achieve these goals ndash together.Karen Wilks Karen WilksI am a volunteer support officer and session supervisor at Musselburgh Citizenrsquos Advice Bureau.Previously I have worked with Domestic Abuse Advocacy Service in the Scottish Borders, Edinburgh Domestic Abuse Court Service and Victim Support Scotland ndash providing advocacy, information, emotional and practical support to victims of crime within the community and within the Scottish Criminal Justice System.From living in and around Earlston for most of my le and being a parent of a young person in secondary school, I have the same concerns as every other parent has in relation to education, especially given this past year and the dficulties our young people have had to face due to the pandemic.Currently I manage the general advice service within Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau. I have witnessed, as have other bureaux, a vast increase in the need for support due to COVID-.People being placed on furlough, loss of employment, businesses closing, requirement to self-isolate, reduced incomes, increase in demand for foodbanks and energy support.I have the knowledge and understanding in relation to these issues and many more that are prevalent within our community.My current and previous roles have taught me how to question, challenge those in positions of power on behalf of people in crisis and in vulnerable situations.My focus has been to get their voice heard, get them the information required, aid them to empowerment all working towards as positive an outcome as possible.I can and will draw on those skills, experience and dogeared determination, enabling me to confidently support local business, community groups, the inidual, transport infrastructure, local economy and health in our recovery and continued growth from COVID-.ExtrainformationPolling stations for this by-election will be open as normal.The council says that arange of measures will be in place to ensure that those who wish to vote in person can do so as safely as possible, including adherence to social-distancing guidelines and the wearing of face coverings.Returning officer Rob Dickson said: ldquoIf anyone develops symptoms ahead of polling day, or is contacted by NHS Test and Protect and is required to self-isolate, then you can apply for an emergency proxy ballot up to pm on Thursday, March .Visit: www.scotborders.gov.uk elections"},{"url":null,"title":"borders-girl-chops-off-hair-little-princess-trust","story":"CUTTING off almost  inches of hair for charity has left a nine-year-old Borders girl with a very stylish bob cut.Over Christmas, Hannah Ramsay decided she wanted to donate her long locks to the Little Princess Trust ndash the charity that makes wigs for young people who have undergone cancer treatment or live with other conditions.On Sunday, February , at her home in Darnick, Hannah and mum Claire created an at-home hairdressers on their driveway.And the verdict on the finished product  ldquoI love it, I think itrsquos cool, said Hannah, although Claire modestly joked: ldquoI donrsquot think Irsquoll get a job as a hairdresser somehow.Although apprehensive at first, Claire said she thinks Hannahrsquos new hair ldquolooks great.:Borders town could get one-way road system as council asks for opinions on trialldquoI was worried that she [Hannah] might not be so sure about it once it was done, but [she] seemed quite happy with it and [she] coped well with the attention which was quite good, said Claire.As the haircut was outside, passersby were able to stop and ask a few questions about what was happening, which Hannah took in her stride, explaining why she wanted to help the Little Princess Trust.And this week Hannah has debuted her new lsquodorsquo to her classmates in the virtual classroom.ldquoMy teacher knows [about the haircut] and she keeps asking questions and stuff, said Hannah on Sunday.ldquoShersquos like, lsquoI canrsquot wait to see you and your hairrsquo.Before the big chop, Claire said her husband Craig had ldquomixed feelings about the haircut as ldquohersquos really enjoyed brushing her [Hannahrsquos] hair and has now become a master of the plait.:Its an absolute bog: Muddy Borders play park needs work, meeting hearsAs well as cutting her hair, Hannah has been fundraising for the Little Princess Trust to help cover the costs of making the wigs.As at Tuesday , Hannah had raised pound ndash her initial target was pound.ldquoHopefully when the hairdressers are back we can get a proper cut because wersquore looking a little bit wavy in the back, Claire said.ldquoIt is definitely an amateur haircut.ldquoBut, it still looks brilliant on her.To donate to Hannahrsquos fundraiser, visit justgiving fundraising hannah-ramsayA donation tub can also be found at Bean Nrsquo Gone outside the Greenyards, Melrose."},{"url":null,"title":"urgent-recalls-co-op-lidl-tesco-meat-cakes-dog-food","story":"Customers are being warned over the posible health risk from products they have bought froms major UK supermarkets including Asda, Sainsburys, Tesco and Co-op.Salmonella poisoning,food allergies and glass are just some of the reasons behind a number of urgent product recalls across the UK.Weve rounded up the latest products to be recalled.If you have bought any of the items mentioned below, you need to be aware of these possible health risks.Co-op Irresistible Carrot Cake and Irresistible Coffee and Walnut CakeCo-op is recalling Irresistible Carrot Cake and Irresistible Coffee and Walnut Cake because the products may contain pieces of glass.

year.Now, new data from Public Health Scotland has given us a clue as to which level each area could enter when the system is re-introduced.Our interactive map shows the rate of Covid cases in each local authority in Scotland, taking the weekly new positive cases per , people up to March .Currently, Orkney Islands is the only local authority that could be placed into Level  based on the case numbers. Areas such as Glasgow City, North Ayrshire, Stirling and West Lothian could move to Level , based on cases.Unlike the previous levels system, the Scottish Government is taking a harsher approach to deciding the levels.They are taking point from the World Health Organisation, and are rebasing the indicators that are used to guide decisions on the allocation of levels on the recommendations made by WHO.It is hoped these indicators will be set out fully in the middle of this month.The framework reads: \"Although there are some dferences, this aligns broadly with our levels approach and indicates that we should lower or tighten some of the thresholds associated with each of our five levels.\"If following the WHO recommendations, levels will be based on cases per , population and the percentage of positive tests as core indicators, meaning the data in the above table details what we could expect, based on the cases per k.The Scottish Government also say they will continue to look at forecasts of hospital admissions and ICU occupancy, as well as patterns of infection in older people andthe ability of the NHS to resume paused serviced.According to their Strategic Framework update, the plan is to progress through the proposed easings for Level , \"at a pace that the data indicate is safe\", and from there to allocate protection levels again in accordance with geographical epidemiological data.They will look to the criteria set out by the World Health Organisation, and use it to assess whether it is safe to proceed with each new set of easings.However, they will also be adding one extra condition that they say \"must be met\" in addition to the six WHO criteria for easing lockdown.

Finding a permanent solution might not seem pressing to some of us, while travel restrictions remain in place, but it is causing havoc for the businesses which depend on the route daily.Hopefully pressure from the affected business owners, many based in Kintyre, who are now making their voices heard, will result in a quicker solution.When thingsto normal, the people of Campbeltown are looking forward to welcoming visitors to the most improved place in Scotland, but visitors need to be able to get here."},{"url":null,"title":"letters february 26 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It really will make a dference to our environment and is something that can be done easily on our daily walks.I would also like to say a big thank you to Jimmy Robertson, the bin man who contacted me and donated his litter-picker, bags and gloves. It is very much appreciated. I wish Jimmy a really happy retirement, and would like to thank him for all he has done over the years.I went back to work at MAKI Pups, the new outdoor nursery based in Lochgilphead, last week but I intend to continue with my litter-picking at weekends when I can. I won#t stop now I#ve started.If anyone wishes to help in any way, please phone me on  .There was an interesting letter from Ron Wilson in the February  edition of the Courier which, as with any politician#s pronouncements, was laced with spin, hyperbole or half truths and consequently tells only half the story.Regarding vaccines, nobody, except the SNP, talks about Westminster#s charity. It is my understanding that Great Britain and Northern Ireland are part of the UK and independently opted not to use the EU system and purchased vaccines for itself.This elicited the usual howls of derision by SNP politicians along the lines of: #This idiotic refusal is all about Brexit and nothing to do with the pandemic and will cost lives,# and others of a similar vein.The inept EU vaccine-purchasing system has been and still is chaotic. France, at the time of writing, with a population of  million, has vaccinated . million. Pro rata, under the EU system, Scotland would probably have received , as opposed to the . million currently vaccinated.The electorate keep hearing: #As an independent member of the EU#. This is possibly an SNP aspiration but I think there are several hurdles to an independent Scotland joining the EU.What currency would be used, what proposals are there to meet the EU fiscal rules for membership in respect of the annual GDP deficit which is currently running at . per cent, well above the three per cent required The last figures available for government debt to GDP of  per cent is well above the  per cent required. Then there is the strong possibility of a Spanish veto or perhaps they are proposing throwing Clara Ponsatí to the wolves and saying: #We are sorry we backed the Catalans in order to curry favour with Madrid.#Regarding the EU solidarity stimulus plan, I would hope that it was considerably greater than the UK there are  member countries. I understand that it is € billion, spread over three years, and the grants and loans are subject to strict requirements. I notice that you do not mention £. billion to date allocated through the Barnett formula which is separate from the money. I do not know how much, currently paid to Kate Forbes MSP, cabinet secretary for finance#s department in the furlough scheme.Regarding the comments relating to Brexiteers and leaving the EU as #Johnson#s folly#, it has obviously escaped Mr Wilson#s notice that leaving the EU, liking the decision or not, was a democratic one by the UK electorate and, unlike the EU or the SNP, in our constitution we do not send the electorate back to vote again until such time that they #vote correctly#.Banking crash  May I remind Mr Wilson that it was the Royal Bank of Scotland and Bank of Scotland which were the main protagonists in the UK which had a serious impact on our economy. Mr Wilson#s rather emotive #gimcrack imperial fantasies# could well have applied to the antics of the two Scottish banks# boards of directors.I am not particularly an avid supporter of politicians per se but the current SNP government by any yardstick is a really appalling administration with a record of declining education, health care and financial mismanagement, just to mention three areas.Leaving aside the first two, what should cause concern is the eye-watering amounts of taxpayers# money wasted. The new Royal Hospital for Children and Young People in Edinburgh is at least £ million over budget and still not fully operative Ferguson Shipyard ferry project, currently £ million and no ferries, projected final cost an additional £ million and no firm delivery date other assorted projects like the BiFab yards, £ million, two of which have been bought by a UK company for £, Prestwick Airport, there is a bit of #smoke and mirrors# but somewhere around £ million is close.A bit closer to home, the Glen Croe problem up to the Rest and Be Thankful, which has been ongoing since  and is regularly subject to closure, has had at least £ million spent on it to date. It is of no surprise that Jim McColl said that #everything the SNP touch is a mess#. Added to that, we have the current internecine Salmond Sturgeon Murrell case ongoing currently swallowed up in excess of £, of taxpayers# money and rising.Mr Wilson is perfectly entitled to his point of view, as I am to mine, but as I said in my opening paragraph, and this applies to politicians of all political persuasions, please present the full narrative not some unsubstantiated wish list.The neglect of the A is a disgrace. It’s not just the long detour via Crianlarich when it rains heavily, it’s the potholes and ruts when we get a spell of cold weather.Three years ago, we had a cold winter and the A became a dirt track. Emergency repairs had to be carried out. The Scottish Government said it would solved the problem. Now we have another cold winter, and again emergency repairs are needed.Other trunk roads in Scotland don’t get closed when it rains or get all these ruts and potholes in a cold winter.We need serious money invested now to solve the A problems. Yet all we get from the Scottish Government is waffle about y public inquiries.  We need money and action now to make the A as reliable as Scotland’s other trunk roads, not more cheap solutions."},{"url":null,"title":"postponed new year competition played in brutal conditions","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

But, we live in a world which increasingly believes that to disagree is to hate.Could it be that to disagree might in some circumstances actually be the manestation of love If a child searching for meaning and identity and love has chosen a path of destruction through heroin, for example, would a parent be loving to blindly affirm him Could disagreement be love The apostle Paul wrote this to Timothy, a young pastor: #And the Lord#s servant must not be quarrelsome, but kind to everyone, able to teach, patiently enduring evil, correcting his opponents with gentleness. God may perhaps grant them repentance leading to the knowledge of the truth.#Timothy was to be a model of the Lord Jesus, the most loving man who ever lived and yet the one who disagrees with everyone. Disagrees  Really  Yes, Jesus# first word to the world in the gospel of Matthew is, #repent#, that is, #you are heading the wrong way, turn from sin to God.#Jesus isn’t addressing a particular section of society, or a particular behaviour, he is not directing his gaze at #everyone except me#. This is the most loving call in the world to everyone everywhere. And it#s good news because it comes from a saviour who paid for sin and who offers us the power to change.#I have come,# said Jesus, #that they may have le and have it in abundance.#His invitation  Come, find out how to live and how to love."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 20 the final tee","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The conversations, Kaya hopes, will feel like the discussion that would usually evolve over a cup of tea or an evening pint.Kaya, who begins her residency this month, will record the conversations which will be stitched together as a sound-based artwork called Milk + Two Sugars which will eventually be exhibited on the island for local audiences to engage with and listen to.Over the last few weeks, invitations have been extended to the local residentsin the communities of The Bush and Ballochgoy. To take part they need only call   armed with a ‘cuppa’ of their choosing.The phoneline will be open to two people per day between am-pm on Thursday March  and Friday th, Thursday March  and Friday th. An answer phone message will be available in between times for people to register their interest in taking part.Kaya, who graduated from Duncan of Jordanstone in  with BA Hons First Class in Art and Philosophy in , said: #I begin this residency with a strong nostalgic feeling of connection to Rothesay even though only knowing it through family anecdotes of holidays there. I hope this residency extends these memories into my own stories of the people and stories I come to meet.#With Milk + Two Sugars, I aim to extend these connections beyond a screen and focus on the house phone as my source of extension. I anticipate these oral histories will create an enticing sound landscape reverberated in public spaces for the very community that it captures. The work will also be available to call and hear via a phone number—extending off the island the essence of Bute, those who call it home.#The residency, now in its third iteration, creating an opportunity for emerging artists, whose practice is rooted in social engagement.The Contemporary Visual Art Programme is led by Sophie Crichton-Stuart and curated by Morven Gregor."},{"url":null,"title":"campbeltowns colin joins team scotland staff","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

If we want children and families to come to the area we need to keep the school open,# he said.Argyll and Bute Council met yesterdaywhen members were asked to agree to hold informal pre-consultation meetings with representatives from  communities that may be affected by the school estate review.The council was also asked to agree to review the school estate #on an ongoing basis# and reducing the future scale of any changes which would be considered at any one time.Now the proposal is for Rhunahaorine to go into Glenbarr and Clachan and Skipness to go to Tarbert. Saint Kieran#s also goes into Castlehill in Campbeltown this is a paper exercise as Saint Kieran#s no longer has pupils and is mothballed.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGONew Post OfficeCampbeltown’s Meadows scheme is to get its own post office in the early summer.Post Office Counters plans to open a community post office in Ralston Road in late May or early June.Post Office Counters has already secured premises for the office which will be open for around  hours a week but the chairwoman of Campbeltown Community Council, Mrs Nancy Smith, said she would prefer a new post office in the town centre.Since the main post office moved from Longrow to the Co-op supermarket last summer, the town centre has not had a post office.Mrs Smith said: #I#m pleased that there is going to be another outlet for people, but unless people have got a car it#s only going to be suitable for people in the Meadows scheme.#She added: #The community council has always pushed for a post office in the centre of the town. Not only because it#s convenient, but also to help the commercial centre of the town.#FIFTY YEARS AGOLocal choir on radioCampbeltown Gaelic choir was taped at a concert in the Town Hall on Tuesday evening.The choir will be heard on BBC radio later this month.BBC men recorded a half-hour programme of all-Gaelic songs, which were introduced by Mr Hector McNeill.The choir was conducted by Mr Charles Bonar.

This is in contradiction to what is surely the council#s main aim when setting the budget # saving money where possible.Despite many of KRL#s staff having barriers to working, they do an exemplary job and are happy in their workplace # something which is evident from a visit to the recycling centre. The fact that some of them may lose the jobs they enjoy and do so well as a result of this decision is shocking and heart-breaking.Campbeltown has seen record levels of redundancies over the last couple of years, with more than  lay-offs at CS Wind and Campbeltown Creamery alone, never mind the many people who have since lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic. To potentially add to this level of unemployment for no apparent good reason is baffling.KRL not only provides an efficient and cost effective service but worthwhile jobs to people who may otherwise struggle to find employment and are no doubt very concerned about their futures right now.This decision should be reconsidered."},{"url":null,"title":"letters march 5 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I immediately hung up # wondering which of my frailties had been discovered # and phoned  which tells you the last number that called.I twice noted the number given by  and ventured to phone it. On dialling this number, the phone company advised me that there was #no such number#.Over a week, adopting identical procedures, five dferent #no such numbers# were found. The job of answering morning calls was then delegated to the message answering machine and only once did it receive a call which was terminated speedily by the caller without a message.Is there a flaw in our phone companies# systems with consequent loss of income  If this flaw could be eradicated, phone scammers might be less numerous and consequently afford a little more protection for the vulnerable.Going by theof John Newall#s reply to my letter on England#s disastrous Brexit, forced upon Scotland against our democratic wishes, I had expected better than the mishmash of worn out tropes and John Bull exceptionalism trotted out by Mr Newall.Mr Newall makes great play of the successful roll-out of the Covid vaccine in Scotland and the UK. He is absolutely right, it has been a fantastic achievement, but to then go on to use this success to denigrate the EU#s vaccine programme is crass and over simplistic.Our success is an illusion until both doses of vaccine are administered, crowing about vaccines when only . per cent of the UK population has had the vital second jag, compared, for example, to . per cent in Denmark, is both presumptuous and inappropriate.Mr Newall goes on to assert that Scotland has a deficit that will prevent Scotland re-entering the EU, without of course mentioning the elephant in the room, the UK#s ruinous £ trillion # and increasing # debt. Unionists need to get their own house in order before lecturing anyone .Of course, legally, Scotland has no #deficit# or #debt#. How can a country with virtually no borrowing ability have a debt  What Scotland does have is a notional #debt#, the price of Westminster failure within the UK, where spending outwith Scotland#s control is assigned to Scotland, such as Trident, HS and London’s Crossrail. Spending that Scots taxpayers cough up for.Indeed,Courier readers start counting now at the rate of one a second, they#ll reach the number of pounds spent on Boris Johnson’s failed Track and Trace system at about .am on April  in the year . Readers may well wonder where the money went and why this is being loaded on to Scotland#s ledger.Straight from the #Better Together# playbook, Mr Newall brings up the hoary old #Spanish veto# myth. The truth is that Spain has no issue with an independent Scotland in the EU so long as this is within the framework of the UK constitution # which it is.Unlike Catalonia#s predicament, Scotland is not a #region# of the UK, there is no constitutional prohibition on independence votes or indeed of Scotland abrogating the  Treaty of Union with England.This is why successive prime ministers, from Margaret Thatcher to David Cameron, have repeatedly recognised the right of the Scottish people to independence # and why Boris Johnson#s oafish #No# will run into the sand.Mr Newall and I will never agree but that is the essence of democracy, and the right to choose in a free country.Scotland can either remain, semi-detached and impotent, as part of an increasingly insular Little Englander Tory Britain, bringing in its wake further austerity and diminished le chances for our young people, or Scots can vote for independence, just like our neighbours.Yes, there will be dficult choices, yes, there will be mistakes, but they will be our decisions to get right as we work for the prosperous, open and internationalist country that is within our grasp.I am delighted that our council will be investing nearly £. million to help keep Argyll and Bute going and growing.After relentless campaigning from myself and others it#s great to see, at long last, some substantial investment in our crumbling infrastructure.Building on investments made in previous years, an additional £. million will be invested to drive forward improvements and repairs to Argyll and Bute#s network of roads in rural, remote, island and urban communities, bringing the overall roads reconstruction budget to £ million for  .We are also investing more in active travel, in line with the council#s agreed priorities. This includes a further £, in enhancing and improving footpaths. This investment complements the current allocation of £, in green transport and travel.This recent Covid pandemic has highlighted more than ever the need to tackle our urban-rural ide. Even now, many of my constituents are paying primum prices for snail#s pace broadband speeds.That#s why £, is being invested in a Tackling Digital Exclusion Top-Up Fund # to support people, businesses and communities to access improved digital connections for social and commercial opportunities supporting communities and in some cases iniduals that are missing out on national programmes due to logistics and economies of scale.While this budget is not perfect and there will be challenges ahead as we start to recover from the ongoing global pandemic this is a massive step in the correct direction.Now my constituents across the Kintyre and the Islands ward will quite rightly want to see action, not more talking.So that means more help for our small businesses, improving our digital connectivity and substantial improvements to our roads which in so many areas are sadly approaching the point of no .Six years ago, I had a sudden and le-changing stroke. I’m not alone in this: stroke strikes every five minutes in the UK, and around . million survivors are living with its devastating effects.Despite this, research into stroke is severely underfunded. Just one per cent of the total UK public and third sector health research spend goes towards stroke research.The Stroke Association has launched a unique opportunity for stroke survivors and those who care for stroke survivors to have our say on the future of stroke research. Partnered with the James Lind Alliance, the charity will find out what matters to us most so research can make the biggest dference to our lives.With such limited funds for stroke research, worsened by the Covid- pandemic, it#s vital that we come together and make our voices heard.If you#re a stroke survivor, or you care for or work with someone affected by stroke, join me and speak up for stroke.Visit www.stroke.org.uk jla by March ."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week march 5 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The owner just shrugged their shoulders and said, #What can I do #.#I know we cannot police these things without people#s names, but we need to be saying to the council that we must be getting out there.#Jim Smith, the council’s amenity services manager, responded: #By and large we have less of a problem than in some other areas, where it is quite disgusting.#I would say most dog owners are responsible and clean up after their dogs.#A social media campaign would assist and we will look at the council website as well to seemore information can be given out.#Councillor Currie added: #It is definitely a big problem in Argyll and Bute. It doesn’t matter where you go – it is all over the place.#I am being very strong here, but I think we need to be strong, and I would like to see a big push to try and pin down the owners, get them charged, and show people we mean business.#Social media may do some things but we will never get through to irresponsible dog owners.

The dinghy was then taken to Tayinloan.Fears that the flare signalled the ers were in serious trouble meant Islay leboat was launched and a rescue helicopter from Prestwick was scrambled.FIFTY YEARS AGOMarines scare: contact made with #missing# commandosCarradale was buzzing with excitement this week when it was discovered four Marine commandos had been missing for days in the hills of Kintyre.The Marines, who were taking part in an exercise, were to have reported back to a vessel berthed at Carradale harbour, to be taken back to the barracks.The original number of #missing# men had been , but eight gradually found their way back to the boat, an Admiralty MFV.Villagers were concerned about the safety of the Marines who were not accounted for.A Marine spokesman told the Courier at Carradale on Tuesday evening that four men were still #missing#.

Mr Wilson is trying to muddy the waters there.Whilst Mr Wilson is correct that Scotland cannot have debt , Scotland does have deficit, and the reason we know this is because the SNP-run Scottish Government tells us so in the annual Government Revenue and Expenditure, Scotlandbut Mr Wilson contradicts himself by going on to say that Scotland has a #notional debt# . Scotland has no debt. Scotland cannot have debt. Mr Wilson needs to realise that debt and deficit are two dferent things.With regard to HS, yes, Scotland pays a two per cent share of the total cost but will receive approximately . per cent back in Barnett consequentials. THAT is a very good deal for Scotland. London#s Crossrail  Not a single penny for that will be paid for by Scotland.Mr Wilson goes on to say that there is no #prohibition on independence votes#. Another error from him. Section  of The Scotland Act , the act which allowed us to have a devolved assembly and to which the then Scottish Office signed up, lays down the exact process required. We need permission from HMGov.Oh, and the notion that Scotland can abrogate the Treaty Of Union is also wrong. Whilst Westminster is a parliament of equals, it cannot of itself dissolve the Treaty of Union of which it was not itself a progenitor. That is the prerogative of the suspended national parliaments of England and Scotland, which will require to be recalled from suspension #in abeyance ad interim# where they legitimately reside at the present time. Only the recalled national parliaments of Scotland and England may re-negotiate the  Treaty of Union.I would take this opportunity to remind Mr Wilson of two things: we had a referendum in  and voted to stay in the UK, and he should really learn to live with that and in no election ever, General or Scottish, has the SNP garnered more than  per cent of the vote.The decision by Argyll and Bute Council to stop funding Kintyre Recycling Limited is perverse to say the least.No thought seems to have been given to the level and cost of the future support for the employees who will be thrown on the scrap-heap. Will that go to the social work department and will they get the same level of support as they do now No thought seems to have been given to the effect on the mental health of the employees # what support will be available and what budget will it come from How can the expenditure of a quarter of a million pounds be justied when the council is struggling for money and how long will it take to save this amount compared with the partial funding for Kintyre Recycling Limited It is shameful that only two of our local councillors are against vulnerable people being thrown on the scrap-heap when all three should be supporting their constituents.I am pleased to support the new business group set up to campaign for a quick and permanent solution for the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A.It’s now seven months since the landslide closed the A last summer. That should have been a wake-up call for the SNP Government, but all we#ve had since then is a failed attempt to protect the Old Military Road from landslides and talk of taking  years to solve the problem.This is just not good enough. We need urgent action now.Last week#s Courier letters page didn#t offer much hope. The SNP only wrote about independence, not the real issues facing us, such as the Rest and Be Thankful.The SNP Government should be concentrating on fixing the Rest and Be Thankful and recovering from the Covid pandemic, not spending its time plotting about independence.This Mother#s Day, school feeding charity Mary#s Meals would like to pay tribute to incredible women around the world.From the mums in the UK whose food has nourished us throughout our childhoods, including those who volunteer and fundraise for Mary#s Meals, to the women who cook and serve our daily meals for children in some of the world#s poorest countries, we celebrate them all.Mary#s Meals feeds more than . million hungry children in  countries every school day.That#s why I am asking your readers to send a Mary#s Meals gt card to the special women in their lives this Mother#s Day.

This will include improved stroke care bundle figures, improved stroke prevention measures, a national thrombectomy service and stroke-specic, person-centred rehabilitation.The charity is pleased that people affected by stroke will be included in the development of this work.A draft paper will be with the Scottish Government in the next few weeks.

A December poll in GPonline revealed that a third of GPs were facing \"very high\" levels of work-related pressure, a situation likely to worsen as the UK endures its second wave of coronavirus.While the added pressure brought on by the pandemic has triggered an immediate crisis for many within the profession, the environment for most GPs has been extremely challenging for many years, with numerous legacy issues still needing to be addressed beyond this current public health crisis.A lack of sufficient numbers of newly qualied GP candidates sits at the heart of the problem. It takes years to address this issue, meaning the UK public faces a decline in care standards or having to recruit additional experienced doctors from abroad, a costly process which denies poorer nations of much-needed medical skills.Here in Scotland, GP recruitment has been further set back by the Scottish Governmentrsquos attempted integration ohealth and social care alongside the implementation of its new GP contract. Under the new agreement, GP practices will continue to operate as private businesses with the partnersrsquo remuneration dependent on their level of profitability.The new agreement offers further Government support, in principle, by removing some of the risk burden from GP practice partners in running a business. It also provides more funding and reinstates the principle that doctors are expert medical generalists who should only focus on those patients who actually need to be seen by them.Some health boards are attempting to implement these policies but this has not been consistent across Scotland and progress has been slow. While this may be understandable in the current climate, failure to creating a stable working environment for GPs will lead to increased shortages and could trigger wider public health issues. The Scottish Government must therefore ensure all health boards take a consistent approach in implementing the new contract.There are also UK-wide issues for the Westminster Government to address which are currently preventing older GPs from working. While the Chancellorrsquos March  Budget took some steps towards addressing doctorsrsquo pensions earnings, issues around letime allowance limits still remain which are penalising experienced GPs who want to continue working beyond their retirement age.Andy Drane, partner and GP practice adviser at law firm Davidson Chalmers StewartAlong with the challenges it has brought to the profession, Covid also presents a real opportunity to revitalise GP service delivery through new, imaginative policies which will benefit those in the profession along with the wider public. However, Scottish and UK governments must firstly focus on removing the increasing level of burden that many doctors are currently facing.Given the essential role of GPs in safeguarding public health, politicians and policy-makers must ensure this is a key health priority.Andy Drane is partner and GP practice adviser at law firm Davidson Chalmers Stewart"},{"url":null,"title":"film-jennifer-garner-gives-children-want-day","story":"If that sounds like a recipe for lawlessness, think again.

Her image is everything, a potent symbol of UK sovereignty abroad. Even the Scottish National Party buys into royal mystique and accords the monarch pride of place in its independence project. Not perhaps for much longer.This crisis is arguably worse than the Abdication in . Then, the monarchy was a robust and unchallengeable part of the British institutional landscape. Edward and his American orcee went into convenient exile and relative obscurity. Meghan isnt going quietly. She is a destroyer ndash a heat-seeking missile, and she was bang on target.Read more: Its time for the SNP to ditch its attachment to the Queen, that last remnant of empireShe accused the royal family of propagating hoods, failing in its duty of care, discriminating against her children, ignoring her suicidal tendencies and putting her familys le in danger by withdrawing protection. Her tale of victimhood has reverberated across the world and particularly in the Commonwealth of former British colonies. Nothing could be more damaging than the head of the Commonwealth being tainted with racism.Meghan has at her back an army of international celebrities led by Hillary Clinton, who accused the royals of ldquooutrageous cruelty astheyd held Meghan in a dungeon in the Tower. Brexit Britain was already being portrayed by the US media as a reactionary and xenophobic place. Now comes confirmation from within.It hardly matters that much of what the Duchess said was nonsense. She claimed that during her pregnancy she was not allowed to visit her friends and was only allowed out twice in four months. If thats true the royals were guilty of coercive control, a criminal offence. The isolation, she said, contributed to her mental health problems and resulted in ldquosuicidal thoughts for which she was given ldquono support.She said that she approached the human relations office and was told they couldnt help because she wasnt an employee. This is hardly surprising. The Sussexes had their own private office staffed by well-paid people whose job it was to look after her welfare. They could have bought the best psychiatric help on the planet. Her husband, Harry, even co-founded a charity for people with mental health issues, Heads Together. Did he ignore his own wes psychological deterioration Meghan complained that her son, Archie, had been blackballed by the Palace because of ldquoconcerns about his colour. She says she was told he would not automatically be a prince, which is true since the Queens great-grandchildren dont automatically take on the title. Archie could become a princeand when Charles, his grandfather, becomes king.But this was not about protocol, but race. She connected the unspecied ldquoconversations about his skin colour with the fact that Archie was being deprived of his royal title ndash at risk to his le. Its not clear which she thought was worse: the racism or the fact that she was told, again during her pregnancy, that her son would not have police protection.Was she suggesting here that her protection officers would have been withdrawn because Archie was not immediately to become a prince  That is plainly wrong. The royal protection squad would never have been taken from Prince Harry and his family while he remained an active royal. Security costs only became an issue when the couple said they wanted to leave, ldquostand back, from their royal roles and seek their fortunes in Canada and America. They couldnt have it both ways and continue to be funded by UK taxpayers after theyd departed for La La Land.Read more: Its time to abolish the monarchyIn one of many startling revelations Harry said: ldquoMy family literally cut me off financially.... His dad wouldnt answer his calls, either. Thats obviously an issue for the Prince of Wales, who holds the purse strings. But the Sussexes werent exactly left penniless. Harry had around pound million from investments left by his mother and Meghan had her own millions. They are getting poundm from Netflix and Spoty. Harry said that ldquogoing to the streamers was never part of the plan. Perhaps not, but since they intended to earn large sums of money to pay for their pound million Santa Barbara mansion, media work must have been in the back of their minds.There were predictable claims of racism in the British media. The press is disrespectful, sometimes cruelly so but, unlike social media, claims of actual racism against Meghan have never been substantiated. Yet the Duchess is now offering concrete proof that the royal family itself, the pinnacle of state privilege, is racist. Just how ldquodark would Archie be This was the cruellest cut of all, and one the Palace cannot allow to stand. The context of the remark, or remarks, was not made clear. It was Prince Harry who heard it and he was refusing to ldquoshare any more of the story. Yet hed already shared the greatest possible libel of his own family. There can be no charge more damaging to a institution today than that it harbours racists.Could it have been a misunderstanding  I was once accused of racism for saying that, when watching her legal drama Suits, it had never occurred to me that Meghan was black. It was only after she hooked up with Harry that I learned she was a Person of Colour. Butit was a similarly misconstrued remark, the Palace should make that clear. If it does not, the monarchy will be indelibly smeared.It is said, jokingly, that Meghans interview was a rehearsal for the next season of Neftlixs Crown.

A deadline has been set for next month and any cities that dont meet the criteria for allowing fans back into grounds face being cut from the list of hosts.I sincerely hope that Hampden will be able to play its part in the Euros and we donrsquot want the impact of Covid to deny us that. If we donrsquot do the right things over the period of time until the Euros actually come around, or until a decision is made, then there is always that fear.We have to be on our best behaviour and we donrsquot want to find ourselves in the situation where Hampden doesnrsquot get the games.I donrsquot want to get into the politics of the situation but as football fans we will be disappointedthis decision goes against us. The Government run the rule here and it is a health issue before it is a sporting issue.There are some things that we can argue and some that we canrsquot win the case on and there is no doubt thatthe decision isnrsquot favourable then there will be fractures in those relationships.It would be a cruel blow to Steve Clarke and the players and certainly to the Tartan Army as well. You can see the impact that no fans has had on teams throughout the pandemic and some sides have lost that edge playing in front of empty stands.The Tartan Army havenrsquot had something like this to look forward to for so long now and the world will be wanting to see the Scotland support at it is best. We would all love to see that and to see the Tartan Army supporting a successful Scotland side.When the Euros were postponed last summer due to the pandemic, very few people would have thought that we would be in this situation all these months on. It is mind-boggling and so sad and frustrating.The virus has continued to evolve and there are new strains and iants and we are still living under restrictions. It has looked for some time that the vaccine will be the savour and hopefully that is still the case.At the moment, I would hope that the talk about not playing games at Hampden is just scaremongering and a ploy to keep us all on our toes to ensure we continue abiding by the rules.At the end of the day, it is probably above the head of the SFA andthe Government say that it is a no-go then that will be final unfortunately.It is obvious that powerful voices matter, though, and Stevie Clarke, as Scotland manager, has a powerful voice. I am sure he will sit down with whoever he needs to and put forward a caserequired but it will be a decision that is outwith his control. He will be in the talksneeded but that final decision will come from above.When it comes to health, the Government has to do what they have to do and that has to always be the priority. That is a given and everyone will realise that.But you can only hope that there will be a situation where the crowds can be back at games sooner rather than later. I donrsquot think we will see a , sell-out at Hampden with the way that things are going unfortunately though.The decision has to be made at the last minute possible to give Glasgow every chance to prove that it can host these fixtures. As football people, we will always make the case for it because it is our livelihood, our raison decirctre, and we must do everything we can here.The Scotland fans have been building up to this tournament for so long and the governing bodies that make these decisions have to do everything they can to make it happen.We know it probably wonrsquot be full houses but we need the approval of the Government and the SFA to make sure that can abide by the guidelines that UEFA have set out.In terms of the revenue that it will bring to Glasgow and Scotland, of course there is a compelling case for having these fixtures at Hampden. And there is the huge boost that it will give to the morale of the nation as well.But the health consideration has to be the most important one and that will be first and foremost I am sure.I know there will be meetings ongoing over the next few weeks and hopefully by the time a decision has to be made Scotland will be in a much better state thanks to the vaccine.We will be governed by the scientists and the numbers of infections. It is all a numbers game. I am sure the Government wonrsquot want to take a chance here.For me, the only saviour I have seen for months now has been the vaccine because we have been in lockdown two or three times and it felt like it was back to the future every time. I always thought it wouldnrsquot start improving until the vaccine programme was rolled out and effective.That could be the savour in terms of getting the Euros to Glasgow, but more importantly hopefully that is the savour in terms of Scotland moving out of this pandemic as quickly as possible."},{"url":null,"title":"racism-allegations-divide-commentators","story":"The Daily MailStephen Glover said the Royal couple set out to destroy the British press.ldquoPrince Harry described the tabloids as lsquobigotedrsquo and accused them of creating a lsquotoxic environmentrsquo of lsquocontrol and fearrsquo, he said. ldquoThe charge of racism is very grave.

He is surely right that ldquonothing less than a revolution in the way Whitehall acts and thinks is required, and is spot on when he points out that dferent parts of the UK require dferent policies, whether for education, labour markets, immigration or many other fields.His analysis, though, stops short at the civil service. Unfortunately this inflexibility pervades the whole body politic in Westminster, and a revolution is required in the political sphere too. For example, take immigration: Tory policy is to try to reduce it, and the Conservative Party plays on this repeatedly and everywhere in its messaging. How can they possibly reconcile this with a nuanced policy of encouraging it in Scotland and parts of England, while railing against it in others This is the way the UK political system works. If the civil service finds it hard to adapt its ldquodelivery to dferent parts of the UK, that is because it is the servant of UK politicians whose whole instinct is for bold, sweeping measures. Westminster politicians, seeing themselves reflected and magnied by a metropolitan media, are trapped in this mode. They want to be seen as ldquoworld-beating and ldquoglobal. This is the ambition that Whitehall has to indulge.Asking Boris Johnson to be otherwise is to plead forlornly against nature. Tasking him with making Scotland ldquofeel hellip part of a shared endeavour asks for the impossible. Itrsquos not just Mr Johnson, though. Any UK PM is ineluctably drawn towards grandiosity, because the Westminster London universe implicitly demands it. Careful attention to Scotland, Wales or English regions gets you nowhere in that world.The remedy, Lord Dunlop, is to leave it.Lyn Jones, Edinburgh.POLICE LACKED LEADERSHIPI AM moved to write this letter by a sense of incredulity at the events surrounding Rangers fans celebrations at winning the Scottish Premiership.First, it has to be acknowledged that the sporting achievement is certainly a signicant event for the club for which they have to be congratulated. However, as a retired former police officer I am appalled at the police handling of the ious incidents. In my view it highlights the inappropriate strategy of promoting officers with limited operational experience to positions of strategic control.When we see photographs of police officers having selfies taken with people forming part of an illegal mob, escorting the same mob to the main focal point of the city to celebrate illegally and indeed openly engage in ious aspects of illegal activity, then we simply have to speak out. Who is setting the standards Where was the leadership to make decisions on what was a slowly developing situation  They had the time it takes to slowly walk from Govan to the city centre to decide what to do, yet did nothing to stop the illegalities. This is a personal affront to me as a former member and an embarrassment to those taking good money to be entrusted with our protection. I believe I can say with confidence that in my day, the early s, this would never have happened, as the police would have simply refused to accept it and tackled the group head on with the confidence that we would have had the support of our experienced leaders rather than worry about any careerists who simply donrsquot know what to do.Unfortunately, there seems to me to be a cadre of senior officers who are more worried about their next promotion than in looking after our wellbeing.The demands of society havenrsquot changed in hundreds of years. People still lean out their windows shouting for help and ldquoGet me the Polis\", not ldquoGet me the statistical quality analytical unit.If these senior officers arenrsquot confident to carry out their duties, I know a number of very senior retired officers who would be more than happy toand advise.Brian Murphy, Glasgow.BLAME LIES WITH THE FANSIT is utter nonsense for Nicola Sturgeon, and indeed, for other members of the Holyrood Parliamentthey support the SNP line on this, to put the blame squarely on Rangers for this past weekendrsquos crowded fan street celebration . That is squarely on the fans themselves.The Government canrsquot stop mass gatherings in any circumstance ndash even the present Covid pandemic ndashthe public are intent on going out to themso how on earth is a vastly smaller entity such as a football club going to do so Rather, I see this as a cynical attempt to ert the attention of the public from the SNPrsquos in-fighting woes.

The UKrsquos Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said it was keeping the issue under review.The first real world data collected through theKings College London Zoe tracking app and involving , UK participants,found that women, younger people and those who have already had Covid- were more likely to experience side-effectsfrom both vaccines.However, the research team saidthis did not mean people were more or less protected than someone who did not feel unwell.The data shows that both vaccines reduced the risk of infection to a similar extent seen in larger clinical trial - with a % reduction in mild disease.Some of the most unusual side-effects reported through the app were sore ears, tinnitus and \"smelling petrol all the time\". The rate of side-effects was less than expected from any of the clinical trials.: It was incredible news: Dozens of people in Glasgow learnthey were protected from Covid-Nurses involved in the care of adults with congenital heart disease said there had been reports of some patients suffering irregular heart beatsafter vaccinations.A  of experts drawn together to comment on the findings, said it was reassuring that those with underlying health conditions were no more likely to suffer side-effects than healthier iniduals.The app asks participants to record the date of vaccinations and any side-effects and found that in some cases symptoms were actually Covid- infections.Eli Barnes, a professor ofexperimental medicine at Oxford University, said: \"The side effects that you get are related to your innate immune response, which is your immune systems first line of defence to either an infection or to a vaccine.\"That is quite a separate thing from the kind of T-cells and antibodies that protect you from subsequent infection later on, which takes much longer to evolve.\": Coronavirus: Estimated  Scots living with cancer as experts warn many cases will be detected too lateProf Barnes said that while both vaccines were considered safe for patients with weakened immune systems, it is not yet known howeffective they are for patients in this group including those with cancer.New real-world data published yesterday found cancer patients are much less protected against Covid- than other people after one dose of the Pfizer vaccine.Three weeks after one dose, an antibody response was found in % of people with solid cancers, compared to % of people with no cancer.Dr Sheeba Irshad, oncologist and senior study author from Kings College London, said the findings were \"really worrying\" and cast doubt on whether cancer patients should face a -week wait for the second dose.Up to  patients are being recruited in three cities including Glasgow to investigate the efficacy of the vaccine in patients with compromised immunity.Prof Barnes said there were \"interesting\" reasons why more women were more likely to report vaccine side-effects.She said: \"The two genders have a dferent immune system to some extent. Women are generally better at coping with infectious diseases generally.\"They are more able to counter things like influenza, they respond better to vaccines, there is less childhood mortality in little girls than boys - actually it starts as young as that.\"Man flu is actually a real thing. When a man has got influenza, hes actually got a higher viral load - he is more sick.\"So all those people who have been rude to their partners about man flu - they should feel really bad about that because he really will be feeling more unwell.\"And all of that is probably reflected potentially in the side effects we are seeing here.\"Its interesting. On the counter side of that women get more auto-immune diseases because sometimes they have a more over-active immune system and men dont have that.\": Vaccine spat: Top EU official summoned to Foreign office over Brussels claimSome people who had experienced a more severe reaction had reported a reluctance to having a second dose.Dr Anna Goodman, an Infectious Diseases Consultant at Guys and St Thomas Hospital in London, advised people to take paracetamol on the morning of vaccination day.She said: \"One thing that is interesting is that people get more symptoms from their first Astra Zeneca dose and their second Pfizer dose.\"We arent sure why thats happening.\"Professor Phil Spector, Professor of Genetic Epidemiology at Kings College London, said there was also some evidence that certain drugs, including steroids,taken by patients with underlying health conditions were the same used to treat the virus, which may have offered some protection to those patients.He said the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agencywas carefully studying data on more reactions to vaccines and stressed that around % of people will not experience any side-effects.He added: \"So far, there is no evidence in any country- and American is looking at this quite closely - that the amounts of severe problems is more than you would expect.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12393000.jpg?type=article-full","title":"linda-bauld-likely-catch-coronavirus-outdoors","story":"This week also saw headlines about some very dferent outdoor gatherings involving football supporters. These were not only illegal at the current time, but also criticised because of the infection risk to those gathering and to the police who had to intervene.So what are the risks of infection outside The first thing to make clear is that viruses donrsquot generally evolve to spread in houses or other buildings. Instead they survive by passing between hosts in nature, which in evolutionary terms has mostly meant outside. That includes respiratory viruses that are passed on when humans or animals breathe, sneeze, cough, call outor come into close contact. LINDA BAULD:Vaccines are giving us hope ndash and a cautious route out of this pandemicThe virus that causes Covid- can be passed on outdoors. But we know from flu and other respiratory viruses that indoor environments are much more risky. This is because they can be passed on through droplets that we are more likely to come into contact with indoors from someone breathing or speaking close to us, or landing onto surfaces that we might touch. Indoor environments with poor air circulation means viruses stay in the air and can be recycled with poor ventilation, so we breathe them in more easily.There are examples from studies of Covid- transmission in restaurants, during choir practice, in work places, and in food factories. The most high risk area by a long shot is our own homes, where it is clear that sharing bedrooms, bathrooms or other living spaces provides multiple opportunities for infection to spread.Many months on from the start of the pandemic, researchers have been able to assess the risks of indoors vs outdoors. Late last year a review was published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, suggest that the odds of indoor transmission are around  times higher than outdoors, based on research from Japan that analysed a series of cases and clusters of outbreaks. From all the published studies that the authors identied on Covid- from a number of countries, fewer than % of coronavirus infections happened outdoors.This type of evidence helps inform government guidelines in Scotland and where when deciding what changes can occur, and in what order, as stay at home restrictions are eased. The bottom line is that having a coffee on a park bench with a friend in the open air is much less risky in terms of Covid- transmission that popping into a friendrsquos house to do the same.It also contributes to why in Scotland children under  have been able to play outside in groups during lockdown, as policy makers have weighed up the risks of them losing out on exercise and social interaction with their peers vs infection risk to them . It explains why the easing of lockdown starts with small groups of adults and teenagers being able to meet outside in larger numbers than before ndash and why I expect hospitality venues to be able to serve customers outside rather than inside when lockdown eases this year, as was the case in .But going back to my point about how viruses evolve in nature, this doesnrsquot mean that we canrsquot lsquocatchrsquo Covid- outdoors. We can, but what determines risk outdoors is how close we are and how long we spend with others. You donrsquot need to be an expert in infectious diseases to understand that lots of people embracing, shouting or singing in close proximity outdoors means someone who is carrying the viruscan pass it onto someone .As we look ahead, there are some key measures that will allow larger outdoor gatherings in future. The first is that when people meet up outdoors, distancing still matters. If we are to get back to sporting events with punters in seats, then spacing will be key and will limit how many people can watch a match or attend an outdoor concert. Face coverings will help, particularly in communal areas outdoors, for example queuing to get in, or to access toilets.A further big question is how much vaccines will reduce transmission. Early findings are positive and may mean that, as in Israel, people who have been vaccinated can access indoor venues that others canrsquot. Israel is providing lsquogreen passesrsquo to people who have received both doses of a Covid- vaccine. These are shown on a mobile phone app to provide entry to indoor public venues such as gyms and hotels. This type of certication is controversial and could be a isive policy that will disadvantage those who donrsquot take up vaccines or are last in the queue for vaccination, like young adults and children. But it is actively being considered in a number of other countries.For now, we have spring and summer to look forward to in Scotland. We canrsquot rely on sunshine, but longer days mean we can do more outdoors. Many of us will be able to reconnect with family and friends while keeping the risk of infection low as vaccines continue to be rolled out.Linda Bauld is Chair of Public Health at the University of Edinburgh.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Because it is.But, unashamed, the UK Governmentrsquos argument is  the SNP, despite its rhetoric, does not believe in devolution, ie sharing power, because it wants to have it all in an independent Scotland and  it has used the devolved settlement not to improve Scotsrsquo lives but merely to further the push for independence.This week, the mother of all shovels-in-the-ground projects was highlighted with the UK Government announcing that a multi-billion plan for a bridge or tunnel across the Irish Sea would be scoped by two top civil engineering experts.It may come as a surprise to some that a plan for a ldquofixed link across the Irish Sea is not new.As long ago as  when the Act of Union between Britain and Ireland came into being, William Pitt, the PM, had a doozy of an idea to build a bridge between Holyhead and Dublin to cement the new relationship, quite literally.A century later, architects were eagerly drawing up grand designs not for a bridge but an undersea tunnel in the North Channel between Scotland and Northern Ireland.In , when a Tory MP in the Commons enquired about the project, Arthur Balfour, First Lord of the Treasury, told his colleague dryly: ldquoThe financial aspects...are not of a very promising character.Yet the dream persisted.MPs throughout the th century continued to broach the possibility of a tunnel across the Irish Sea.While the Dublin Government insisted it would not be economically viable, the idea was revived by Northern Irelandrsquos Democratic Unionists, who even made a feasibility study into a tunnel or bridge a precondition of their support for the UK Government in the event of a hung parliament in the  General Election. Thankfully perhaps for David Cameron, the Tories won a majority.But it was when the idea was resurrected by an academic three years later that Borisrsquos imagination suddenly took flight and he insisted a bridge would create a ldquoCeltic powerhouse fuelled by increased trade across the water.By the time he became PM in summer , Mr Johnson was firmly committed to exploring the fixed link idea, hence this weekrsquos scoping plan in the Union Connectivity Review.However, of the two options a road bridge seems the unlikeliest.As one engineering expert pointed out maintaining a -milelong bridge would be an even greater task than building it. Costs would be ldquoeye-watering, he warned.And to put the scheme into context, a Celtic Crossing on this scale would make it the second longest road bridge in the world after the Bang Na Expressway in Bangkok. It cost poundm back in .So, a tunnel then This project would be comparable into the Eurotunnel but it has been pointed out it would have to be erted to avoid Beaufortrsquos Dyke, a ,ft deep trench, which is loaded with more than m tonnes of munitions dumped there from the days of the Second World War.The Eurotunnel cost pound.bn to build a new version would cost at least three times that today. So, a Union Tunnel would be one of the biggest infrastructure projects ever to be built in the UK. From the PMrsquos point of view, it would solidy the ldquowonderful Union and be part of his legacy alongside Brexit.But will Britain, and more specically Scotland, buy into the Unionist vision of a Strategic Transport Network with better road, rail, air and sea links, making the UK a simpler place to get around.On Wednesday, the Scottish Secretary snapped that the Scottish Government was ldquopathetic for not engaging in the connectivity review because its title contained the dreaded word lsquoUnionrsquo while Michael Matheson, the Scottish Governmentrsquos Transport Secretary, huffed that transport was a devolved issue, dismissing the fixed link idea as Borisrsquos ldquovanity project.While some people will admire the PM for his Panglossian outlook, others will feel the idea of a Union Tunnel will simply go the same way as those much-loved flights of fancy: the Boris Island airport hub the garden bridge across the Thames and le grand pont to la belle France.All of which have been quietly filed away in a distant Whitehall drawer under B for bonkers."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12403340.jpg?type=article-full","title":"sas-red-notice-outlanders-sam-heughan-action-role-rival-james-bond","story":"The Outlander star, , plays special forces operator Tom Buckingham in SAS: Red Notice, an adaptation of former SAS soldier Andy McNabrsquos novel of the same name.:Outlanders Sam Heughan inspires fundraising duo to raise pound, for Lyceum TheatreThe film finds Buckingham on a train to Paris in the Channel Tunnel when it is hijacked by heavily armed mercenaries, who hold all the passengers hostage.Heughan, best known for his role as Highland warrior Jamie Fraser in the historical drama Outlander, explained that filming the movie had been \"very physical.\"He said: ldquoIt is an action movie and there are a lot of fights but strangely I loved it.

John Kerry, the former US secretary of state, summed up the station in two words: it is, he said, a ldquopropaganda bullhorn.George Galloway is a regular RT host. And so is Alex Salmond.I think it is worth pausing for a moment to think about this episode. Because this ndash however used to it we have become ndash is not OK.A Kremlin TV personality who is running for Holyrood on an ultra-unionist ticket is defending another Kremlin TV personality who is the darling of ultra-nationalists. And he is doing this on, yes, Kremlin TV.How did this happen The short answer: our polarised political eco-system makes us vulnerable to disinformation, and not just from Putin.RT and sister operation Sputnik ndash where another former radical, Tommy Sheridan, has been editorialising in favour of Salmond ndash are far from the only threats to reality-based political discourse in Scotland. But they are the easiest to spot.After almost a decade of endless constitutional politics, we now have tribalists ndash unionist and nationalist ndash who are prepared to give their heroes a pass on working for Putin media.What  are they ready to forgive  Do they care about what is true  Or just about winning  DAVID LEASK:Not being from Glasgow or Edinburgh gives me broader perspectiveThis is a huge red flag, and not the kind that once fluttered over the Kremlin.Putin TV has usually been seen ndash wrongly ndash as a Yes problem, not least after Salmond started a show on RT in .And a few ldquovery online Yessers have fallen for a core message that RT was no worse than the BBC they loathed.Nicola Sturgeonrsquos SNP has proved harder to dupe. Party insiders whisper their leader did not need to conspire against her predecessor, as his RT colleague Galloway claimed. Why  Because Salmondrsquos career was over the moment he signed up for the channel.There are still a few Yessers who shrug off worries about Kremlin outlets ndash despite them representing a regime which harasses supporters of independence movements.But with Galloway standing for Holyrood, for a list-only party called Alliance for Unity, some unionists are now sharing RT clips and links on social media.How has this come about ldquoThey fear that another referendum will bring a dferent result, explained David Clark, a former advisor to Labour Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and an expert in Kremlin influence campaigns. ldquoSo there is a sense that lsquoanything goesrsquo to try and prevent the outcome they fearhellip..This is an environment in which disinformation is able to flourish.There is a scent of desperation about unionism. I think propagandists, disinformation actors and plain grters of all kinds have snfed an opportunity. Just as they did when nationalism was struggling.ldquoUnionism is turning into a political wild west, explained Andy Maciver, a former Scottish Conservative strategist and Herald columnist.ldquoThey have become so emotional in their hatred of nationalism that they no longer seem capable of rational thought. So they are now content to jump into bed with someone who theyrsquove been calling a Communist for the last umpteen years, because at least hersquos a unionist Communist.Galloway is no Communist. He does, however, like his employer. Speaking to the Sunday Times last week, he rubbished concerns that the Russian president was an autocrat or that RT was propaganda.Why does he not criticise Putin, he was asked. ldquoBecause I like him, Galloway replied. ldquoI wouldnrsquot rant and rave about him because I agree with him. I agree with him on Syria. I agree with him on the geopolitical issues of the day.Galloway has been censured by the UKrsquos media watchdog because of his coverage of the  Salisbury attacks. He has cast doubts on whether the Putin regime attempted to assassinate anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny. And he has denied any suggestion of Kremlin interference in UK politics. He did all of this on RT, while preparing for an election campaign.I donrsquot believe many unionists will think these are credible positions. So why tolerate them just because they think ldquoanything goes to stop the SNP Disinformation watchers stress that there is nothing uniquely Scottish in any of this. Russian government media have been giving voice ndash and wages ndash to has-beens and isive fringe figures for years.Why does RT want both Salmond and Galloway ldquoTo fan flames,rsquo said Elisabeth Braw, a Swedish expert at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington. ldquoThey are not trying to stir up a completely new feeling, they exploit whatever is already there.I doubt Putin media is backing a side.

The benefits of having a constitutional monarchy as opposed to an elected politician as head of state are overwhelming.ldquoPatrick Harvie would be best served by actually focusing on environmental matters for once rather than spending his time obsessing about getting rid of the Royal Family."},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-case-numbers-jump-almost-700-24-hours","story":"Speaking during thedaily briefing on the state of the pandemic inScotland, Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said that the number ofconfirmed cases of Covid- recorded yesterday was  - almost  more than the day before.The test positivity rate was .%, lower than the % figurethe WorldHealthOrganisationconsiders the marker for an epidemic being under control.:Tributes to victims of the virus planned on lockdown anniversaryThe number of people being treated in hospital - including those in intensive care - .A total of  people are currently on a wardwith a case of the virus - anfall of  in  hours- while  are in intensive care wards, a drop of two.Since yesterday,  deaths have been registered, taking the overall toll from the virus to ,.Ms Freeman offered her condolances to the families of those affected, saying \"in every corner of the nation this pandemic has brought grief and heartcache.\"The vaccination programme continues apace, with ,, now having received their first dose of the virus - , since yesterday -while ,have been givena second dose, including , on Wednesday.:Oxford vaccine leading to more side-effectsMs Freeman said that recent vaccination efforts had been slowed by a drop in supply, but this is not expected to increase \"signicantly\" in the days ahead.A major study into the impact of vaccination on transmission is ldquovery encouraging, Health Secretary Jeane Freeman has said.The study of , people, led by Public Health Scotland and Glasgow University, suggested there is at least a % reduction in transmission as a result of the first dose of the vaccine, while the second dose gives at least %.Speaking at the coronavirus briefing in Edinburgh, the Health Secretary said: ldquoItrsquos obviously very encouraging data indeed.ldquoWersquove already seen the impact the vaccination programme is having on deaths in care homes and increasingly in the community.ldquoTodayrsquos study adds to the growing evidence that vaccination can also help reduce the transmission of the virus."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12403689.jpg?type=article-full","title":"set-emergency-sos-messages-setting-iphone-android","story":"A serving politan Police officer, aged in his s, is in custody as human remains were found in the search for the -year-old marketing executive who vanished last week.On the day of Ms Everardrsquos disappearance, he was reportedly working a pm to pm relief sht at the US Embassy in Nine Elms, south-west London, around three miles from where she was last seen.According to unconfirmed reports, detectives are investigating whether he might have used his warrant card to entice Ms Everard towards his car before snatching her.The officer, who is in the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command, was held on Tuesday night on suspicion of kidnap before being further arrested the following day on suspicion of murder and a separate allegation of indecent exposure.A woman in her s has been arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender.Police have removed vehicles from outside a house being searched in Deal, Kent, where the officer is believed to have lived with his we and two children.:Women tired of being afraid and angry over gender violence epidemicMet Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick said on Wednesday night that human remains ndash which have not yet been identied ndash had been found in an area of woodland in Ashford, Kent, by detectives investigating Ms Everardrsquos disappearance.The events have prompted an outpouring of shock and anger as women across the country shared their own experiences of feeling unsafe.Many women have shared tips on how to stay safe, including how to use the Emergency SOS feature on phones.The Emergency SOS feature allows youto call for help quickly and easily, as well as alert your emergency contacts.When you make a call with SOS, your iPhone will call the local emergency number automatically.You can alsoadd emergency contacts.After an emergency call has finished, your iPhone can alert your emergency contacts with a text message, although you can choose to cancel this option.Your iPhone sends them your currentlocation, and, for a period of time when you have entered SOS mode, it sends updates to your emergency contacts when your location changes.Heres how to make the call oniPhone  or later:Press and hold the side button andone of the Volume buttons until the EmergencySOS slider appears.Drag the EmergencySOSslider to call emergency services.

No positive impacts were noted.The report states that in Orkney, “the total impact is estimated as . FTE jobs and £, in gross salaries.

That appeal has been held up due to COVID- restrictions and remains within the appeals system.With reserves now running low at Cursiter, OIC is now urgently attempting to maintain supply hence the ,-tonne order, and now, this new order.Meanwhile, an internal OIC investigation is currently taking place to understand the methods in which the Glensanda stone was procured, with its findings set to be heard at the next meeting of the council#s monitoring and audit committee.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This ensures that local authorities are fully funded to operate their internal ferry services.“This delivers a key ask from the Scottish Government#s local authority partners at a time of unprecedented financial pressure on the Scottish budget.“Of course for Orkney it facilitates the introduction of Sunday services and Road Equivalent Tarfon inter-island ferries.“The Scottish Government has stated that it is well aware of the growing need for local authorities to replace ageing ferry fleets and infrastructure. While responsibility for funding replacement infrastructure remains with the councils, Scottish Ministers are committed to continuing engagement.“The passing of the budget also means £. million is coming Orkney Islands Council’s way, up £. million on last year — a . per cent hike.”Both Mr Leslie and Orkney#s MSP, Liam McArthur, welcomed increased spending in areas such as mental health services, education, green initiatives, business support and agri-environment.Mr Leslie added: “I am sure folk across Orkney will join me in welcoming this budget, there is plenty in it for islanders to be pleased about as we look to build a better, fairer and greener future for us all.”Meanwhile, Mr McArthur welcomed a number of concessions included in the budget, notably the additional funding for Orkney#s internal ferry services.But he says this now needs to be a long-term commitment from the Scottish Government and backed by support for new vessels.Commenting on the budget, Mr McArthur said: “Over the last year, along with my Scottish Liberal Democrat colleagues, I have sought to hold the government to account over its handling of this crisis. I have done so, however, constructively and with the interests of supporting constituents and our community at the forefront.“That approach has remained the same during this year’s budget negotiations and I’m pleased that we’ve secured funding for a number of areas that will be important for our country’s recovery. A signicant increase in investment for mental health services, for example, delivers on a key ask from the Scottish Liberal Democrats as we look to address our country’s mental health crisis.“The additional funding for Orkney’s internal ferry services is also very welcome after years of broken promises and Orkney being short changed.  It’s vital, though, that this is not just a one-off pre-election gesture but part of a long term commitment by government that also includes addressing the urgent need for new vessels.“Meantime, I’m glad that cross-party agreement could be reached on this budget at a time when politicians from all parties should be absolutely focused on putting the recovery first.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Centralisation remains the most expensive and most economically damaging option and yet HIAL are determined to continue with it.“The proposal of yet another independent study on generating further economic activity falls far short of what is required here. HIAL should immediately pause this project and commission a genuinely independent report considering the feasibility of an alternative localised model,they refuse to do so then the Scottish Government must step in.“This is a major test of the credibility of the Islands Act which was intended to stop projects like this and ensure organisations considered less damaging alternatives. If organisations are allowed to simply ignore these Assessments then the whole Act will be rendered little more than a PR exercise.”On the issue of staffing he added: “The report also confirms Prospect own survey which found that staff in island communities will not relocate to Inverness. HIAL need to explain how they intend to live up to their promise of no compulsory redundancies as all evidence suggests that widespread redundancies now seem inevitable.#While HIAL has claimed that the report proves that an alternative local surveillance solution is #not viable#, Prospect fundamentally disagrees with this assessment.Mr Avery said: “HIAL’s claim that local implementation is not viable or that this report endorses their position is simply not true. This report states HIAL’s position, it very clearly does not endorse it. Any attempt to claim the contrary is just more desperate spin.“Local implementation of air traffic services including surveillance is how air traffic is implemented at almost every airport across the UK including at HIAL’s own Inverness airport. It is a viable workable and resilient alternative but HIAL refuse to consider it.#Meanwhile, HIAL has promised to engage with local authorities across the Highlands and Islands region as it seeks to deliver #viable solutions# to secure the future of leline air services.The company#s managing director Inglis Lyon, said: “We have always known there would be impacts by undertaking such a signicant and complex change management programme.“To date, there have been no alternative proposals that provide a solution that fully addresses all of the challenges HIAL currently faces.”“We hope that everyone with a vested interest in the long-term future of air traffic services in the Highlands and Islands will work us to deliver viable solutions that will maintain leline services and essential connectivity for generations to come.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is always a balanced decision that requires a host of issues to be taken into consideration.Here are a few things to consider for those asked to respond to Stornoway Community Council’s consultation.The island grid, supplied by a shaky distribution link from Fort Augustus through Skye, is full to capacity and closed to new connections – it has been for years.SSEN have decided to replace the failed Skye to Harris cable with a like-for-like kV cable.The new kV cable will offer  per cent more export capacity, enough to provide firm connections for our existing community generators .SSEN will not build a second kV cable without solid demand for it, in terms of prospective wind farms with approved planning permission and solid grid connection contracts.This effectively means that the only way to achieve additional capacity for the islands is to back the planned MW transmission link with its MW of ‘headroom’ for future projects.Only the commercial wind farms, Stornoway Wind Farm, Uisenis Wind Farm and Druim Leathann Wind Farm , have the financial wherewithal to underwrite the planned transmission link .Ofgem will authorise the transmission link onlyStornoway Wind Farm goes ahead.• Any attempt to derail Stornoway Wind Farm is an attempt to derail the £ million deep water terminal, since it is premised on a renewables and a hydrogen economy.With no transmission link, no commercial wind farms, no community wind farms, no low cost electricity, continued dependence on imported fossil fuels, an undermined deep water terminal, an undermined Arnish fabrication yard and a hydrogen economy set back by ten years what is the alternative I love my wild and unspoilt vistas, my beaches and my hills as much as the next islander.I’d love the notion of population growth and sustainability, based on gin, tweed, tourism, crofting and salmon farming to be a reality but it isn’t.There needs to be, and I’ve said this before, a ‘mix’ of the strands that make up the fabric of our island#s economy.And we need to add another strand to move in anyway the right direction to reverse the current trend.There are several sides to every argument.We count the peatland, the visual impact and the hen harriers on the one hand and all the rest, outlined above, on the other.We take everything on board and hope that we are making the right choices for the benefit of more than just Stornoway.If there are any better alternatives, they’ve managed to remain hidden from view for far too long."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ARMADALE-STORES-OPEN-1-scaled.jpg","title":"new shop opens its doors in south","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineWhen the old shop, post office and petrol station closed in , the Sleat Community Trading board, management and staff expected to be operating out of their temporary container in Ardvasar for six months.Covid caused understandable delays, but eighteen months later the staff have now left their cold and draughty temporary shop behind.Shop and post office manager Mhairi Cousins said: “I can’t praise the staff, board and volunteers highly enough.

We’re not complaining about that — the ferry pays its dues — but we have to find a way of reconciling the effect that has on Ullapool#s tourist trade because the place where visitors congregate to admire the loch and the view is Shore Street.In addition, the -year-old sea wall will be replaced with a higher structure to protect the village from rising sea levels.As part of the pre-application consultation, an online Zoom meeting will be held tonight at pm when the proposals will be presented for the first time and as many people as possible are being urged to take part.To join the meeting people can visit the website: http:www.ullapool-harbour or phone    and enter meeting ID:  to listen in.Anyone who wishes to make representations can do so by contacting Fiona Henderson, Affric Limited, Lochview Office, Loch Duntelchaig, Farr, IV AW, or by email: consultation@affriclimited, by th March ."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ARCHIVE-CENT-ANGUS-OG-6.jpg","title":"chust lovely angus og finds a new home in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe collection of the comic strips were handed over to the Skye and Lochalsh Archive Centre in Portree, in recognition of Angus Òg creator Ewen Bain and his family links to Skye.Ewen was brought up in Maryhill, Glasgow but his father John hailed from Waternish and his mother Flora from Staffin.

Neil Gibson, who is chief economist with EY Ireland, said businesses will be able to compete for funds as we exit lockdown.The potential for a strong consumer recovery is signicant with perhaps £bn of consumer spending but we have to be mindful that not all of that will flow back in so there is the potential for prices to rise quite signicantly, which will bring challenges, he said. A phasedto full-time office working is planned for step three of the Executive plan for easing Covid- restrictions.However, analysis of day-to-day costs shows the financial benefits from home-working.At the start of the pandemic last March, fuel prices fell to their lowest level since the  financial crash. The AA had reported last February that Northern Ireland had the lowest prices in the UK, amounting to .p per litre for unleaded on average, and diesel at .p per litre.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseNeil Gibson, chief economist with EY Ireland FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueNeil Gibson, chief economist with EY IrelandA motorist with an average commute of , miles a year and a car that drives around  miles per gallon of petrol would save over £, in petrol costsasked to work at home.Many office workers enjoy a coffee to start the day. In one of Northern Ireland#s more ubiquitous cafes, Costa, a medium cappuccino costs £.. Buying just one cappuccino a day for  days of the year - which does not account for weekends or  days of holidays - will cost £. In comparison, a coffee made by a Nespresso machine at home costs anything from p to p per pod and a spend of £ a year for two drinks per working day alone in comparison. Or Lidl#s Deluxe Columbian Roast and Ground Coffee weighs in at £.. For a bag a week, this will cost £. a year. At lunchtime, workers may avail of a £ meal deal at supermarket chain Tesco, around £ a yearbought daily. Lunch still needs to be eaten at home and a g block of cheese will cost £. at the same supermarket. Buying a loaf of bread for less than a pound and a packet of ham for £ on average, will provide lunch for the week - and some money to spare. Commuters could also save, with an adult travelling by bus from Antrim to Belfast city centre usually being charged £. for a Translink  journey ticket. From Ballyclare to Belfast, a Smartlink ticket is £ or to travel from Coleraine to Belfast by train is £ for a monthly ticket. Even in the Belfast area, a dayLink ticket costs £ for a working week, adding up to £ a month. The American financial planner Pete Dunn has said % of our take-home pay should be spent on clothing. For those earning the average Northern Ireland wage of £, a year, take home pay might be in the region of £, a month. That equals £ a month for clothing. We can now get away with wearing leggings to our desks and are left with £, annually. Many households have found their spend on utilities has increased, having amounted to £- a year for electricity and £ to almost £ for gas or £. on average for  litres of home heating oil before lockdown, according to the Consumer Council. These bills can see a signicant bump now double the time is being spent there during the day. In the financial year ending March , UK households spent £ per week on activities now largely prevented by coronavirus restrictions, allowing room for spending or making up shortfall in other areas. HMRC has now launched a microservice that means even those required to work at home for just a day can claim tax relief for being asked to do so, accepting expense claims for a full tax year worth £ or £ depending on your tax bracket.Dr Esmond Birnie, a senior economist at Ulster University, said those of us who are now working largely from home have gained by not having to pay or spend time commuting, a reduced spend on lunch and relaxed dress code - but we have had to spend in other areas. In the opposite direction, perhaps more is being spent on heating the house, running gadgets, buying paper and ink for the printer and even getting more practical furniture, he said.Belfast Most ReadTributes paid to veteran loyalist Ken WilkinsonBangor toy shop#s decision to remove swastika stickers from window display welcomed by Holocaust survivor#s daughterPrehistoric burial site damaged by -strong gang of cyclistsEntire terrace of Belfast homes is infested with rats, says councillorBBC#s Stephen Nolan says many of , signing petition to cancel show #anonymous and made-up names#Top VideosPlayVideo: Celtic fan struck at Belfast airport - Warning Strong LanguagePlayFight breaks out in front of Carl Frampton#s car in BelfastPlayMichelle O#Neill ‘fell asleep’ during Harry and Meghan interviewLatest CoronavirusSchools don’t have enough time to prepare for pupils’to classes, warn unionsCovid related deaths decline for the sixth week in a row, Nisra figures revealStruggling NI hospitality trade welcomes rates holiday extensionNobody should be #greedy# with stocks of Covid vaccine, says O#NeillBallymena shop offers to visit homes to measure up young children for footwearLatest from Belfast Bloodlands: Five big questions viewers need answered in final episodeWe can#t afford to make any mistakes or clinical Linfield will punish us, warns Carrick manager CurrieWP Nel set for first Scotland start since  World Cup against IrelandFurther  deaths from Covid- in NI in week ending March David De Gea’sfor Man Utd against Hammers is ‘touch and go’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueThe ban on grassroots sports is a disgrace, says Glenavon manager Gary Hamilton.Andrew MaddenTwitterEmailMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailChildren are self-harming because of the ban on grassroots sports, Glenavon manager Gary Hamilton has said.Mr Hamilton is one of dozens of local sporting figures to put their name to a letter urging First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill to lt the restriction.“In England and Scotland, the Covid rates are a lot higher than they are here,they’re back in sport,” he told Glenavon’s YouTube channel.“Why are our kids being punished  Why are our kids being treated like this  It’s a disgrace. “There are kids out there who are self-harming because they can’t get to play sport.” Mr Hamilton argued there was no evidence to support the ban.“We’ve brought in testing in the Irish League over the last eight weeks. There’s been over , tests done and, as far as I’m aware, there have only been three positive cases,” he said. “It’s not backing up the statistics that are being put out there, especially when you consider that most Irish League players are working as well. “It’s madness. We’re taking away everything from kids. Mentally, we are destroying them. Physically, they’re not getting any activity. Socially, it’s been a mess also.”The manager said he could not understand why children were banned from playing sport when they had started ing to school.“Basically, what the Government and people in power are doing is destroying kids’ lives,” he added.“I have two kids. They love football and I’ve seen a dference in them. They’re not the same kids they were six or seven months ago.”Mr Hamilton also pointed to the impact the ban could have on his side’s youth academy, with the club potentially losing four or five kids out of every age group.Addressing Stormont decision-makers, he said: “Come out and think about the kids. We don’t want kids depressed. We want healthy young kids.”Under current Covid rules, only elite-level sport is allowed.A court challenge to the ban cleared its first hurdle on February  after the Department of Health declined to contest the matter.The case, brought on behalf of a child, argues the restriction is harming youngsters’ wellbeing.A judicial review hearing is due to take place on March .Belfast Most ReadTributes paid to veteran loyalist Ken WilkinsonBangor toy shop#s decision to remove swastika stickers from window display welcomed by Holocaust survivor#s daughterEntire terrace of Belfast homes is infested with rats, says councillorMoira teen Josh Fletcher killed in road accident an absolute angel, says fatherPrehistoric burial site damaged by -strong gang of cyclistsTop VideosPlayVideo: Celtic fan struck at Belfast airport - Warning Strong LanguagePlayFight breaks out in front of Carl Frampton#s car in BelfastPlayGerard McMahon mother says police have to learn lessons over death of sonLatest CoronavirusCoronavirus Northern Ireland: One death and  new cases reported as Boris Johnson visits Enniskillen vaccination centreSchools don’t have enough time to prepare for pupils’to classes, warn unionsCovid related deaths decline for the sixth week in a row, Nisra figures revealStruggling NI hospitality trade welcomes rates holiday extensionLatest from Belfast Somalia remembers former president who died with coronavirusCoronavirus Northern Ireland: One death and  new cases reported as Boris Johnson visits Enniskillen vaccination centre‘Top class’ Jamison Gibson-Park gets Ireland scrum-half nod from Andy FarrellWales captain Alun Wyn Jones warns Italy threat must be taken seriouslyCarlo Ancelotti resting James Rodriguez to allow Everton star ‘proper recovery’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Amanda Wallace - mum of Laceyand Lily- said the visiting service was amazing. My kids are in McKillens every four or five months to get their feet measured. They grow that quickly and I was wondering how would I get them done, she said. You can buy in Tesco or Asda but I think footwear is one of the most important things you can fit for your child. Wearing ill-fitting shoes isn#t great for their development. I#ve been going to McKillens since my eldest child got her first shoes. My kids like to pick their own and within a couple of hours they had new shoes.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseShoes: Amanda Wallace FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueShoes: Amanda WallaceIt was a pleasant and efficient service. You wouldn#t get the service in a supermarket and McKillens didn#t charge for delivery. For a door-to-door service, it was amazing.Mr McKillen said well-fitting footwear is vital for youngsters because it affects their development and walking.Small children grow every eight weeks on average and we#ve been in lockdown for longer than that. I#ve had a couple of customers I sorted out in January who said their children have already grown out of their shoes. Feet don#t stop growing in lockdown, he said. The service started after the family-run business approached the Department of Health to askchildren#s first shoes could be deemed an essential health requirement, but this was refused. They listened but gave a generic response to say essential retail stores selling food are also allowed to sell shoes, he said.Offering click-and-collect wouldn#t solve the issue as children need to be measured to be fitted properly for shoes, he said. The father-of-two said first shoe measurements are also a milestone for parents.

The red glow of tail lights shepherds motorists down Coleraine Road to the traffic lights, the sound of their engines reverberating off the closed shutters of Walshs Hotel.

Childrens voices carry down Station Road, in contrast to the eerie quiet of the Lurach Centre play park. Crows cackle in the trees above the Walled Garden and the smell of freshly slurried fields attacks the senses on the way through. The Largantogher Walkway cuts through the town. Through the dense trees lies the disputed Maghera High School site, ground zero in a long-running battle between the council and a local environmental group over its new purpose. Planning permission for an industrial park has been granted, but Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon is set to have the final say. googletag.cmd.push Asto underline the point, a council van sits outside the gate. Keep Out notices are festooned along theof the fence. On the corner, two metal slats have been prised off for access. On the way back up the Tobermore Road, two children come down on their bikes, their mum running alongside them. A treat on the final day of homeschooling, perhaps. Back on Main Street, tattered Slaughtneil flags hang outside the Dugout Bar, clinging on in defiance as it continues to wait for a reopening commitment. Two men in caps are chatting outside Kellys Eurospar. A woman opens the door of the pharmacy across the road and calls out. She wants to knowhes going in for the paper.     “Ive no money on me,” comes the reply. The chapel and Fairhill Youth Centre are deserted, but at Crawfordsburn four children move in tandem on the swings. Two teenage girls walk down Glenview, eating from a bag of chips. Its a case of small mercies for the young amid the pandemic. An empty playground at Crawfordsburn. Children have been hit hard by the pandemic. A mounted sign at the entrance to Crawfordsburn Drive urges Solidarity with Palestine. Across the road, a more understated sign from Watty Grahams GAC urges people to take home their rubbish. On the way back in the road, the play park is once again deserted. Neither young nor old are hanging around too long these days. At the corner of Fairhill, McKennas Bar is operating their off licence, and doing a brisk Friday afternoon trade. A table cordoning off the entrance and a screen that drops down from the ceiling bring a sobering reality to the scene. Caitliacuten McKenna is actually reading the Derry Post as I arrive and says it might be the first time shes given us her real name. Shes referring to the Out and About pictures, smiling revellers appeasing the photographer for a two-page spread that is sadly no longer a possibility. For now. Caitliacuten, Caoimhe, and owner Sean McKenna, are all pining for those better days. “Last summer was good craic out in the beer garden,” says Caitliacuten. “Wed always had that space but we revamped it a good bit to make more use of it. Even people who knew it was there were surprised at how big it was when it was overhauled. “Its not too hard to get your , steps a day carrying pints out there.” “Its been a big change, serving people through the hatch and not letting anybody in. Youd have been used to people around the bar a lot of the time,” adds Sean. Sean, Caoimhe and Caitliacuten McKenna hard at work in McKennas Bar. “This is a social hub, youd have had people in and out all the time, whereas out there, though they may be some of the same people from the bar, theyre only staying for a minute and away they go again. “Another change is Im sitting at home on a Friday or Saturday night from  oclock thinking I should be doing something.” The flow of customers interrupts our chat. People finishing up work for the weekend, some calling in on a whim, others a more regular sight. Caoimhe tells me it has been hard on those regulars for whom the pub is very much an arena for conversation. “You do get some who will stand and have a wee chat, because its maybe their only social interaction,” she says. “Its been a while since theyve seen some people, so you get a wee bit of gossip out there that you miss out on having the bar closed. “Then when it gets to  oclock, its mad out there, just before closing. Everybody ends up having a chat with each other at the hatch. “Theyre more likely to meet someone they know then. You also get a lot of people waving in while they are out for their exercise as well.”  We mention the general dferences between the current period of restrictions and the previous lockdowns, but its interesting to view them through the lens of the pub owners. “People arent buying as much drink as they were the first time round,” says Caoimhe. “The weather isnt the same and people cant sit outside in their gardens at the minute. It was a novelty, and people were almost treating it like a holiday. “The town is busier than last time round. It was really, really quiet before, but there is definitely more traffic and more people about than the previous lockdown. “We have noticed a wee bit of a change with a lot more people buying craft beer that they might have had access tothey were out in bars further afield – Belfast or Derry maybe. “A lot of people were making cocktails the first time down. People were asking for all sorts of things at the start that wed never had before because they were making cocktails.” On the way out, Sean draws my attention to the crystal Kalashnikov hanging above the off licence tills. From Russia with love. Covid-, a less welcome import from the East, has brought down a muffled filter on the streets of our towns and villages. Conversation is terse, interaction limited. Hope might spring eternal but you cant gulp on it forever. Magheras Covid rate fell into double figures last week, and despite a slight increase this week, expectant eyes turn towards the decisions of the NI Executive. Heading home on the Coleraine Road, the site of the old police station is busy with construction, the new leisure facilities moving closer to completion. Maghera is poised and ready when normality gets the green light.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Back on Main Street, tattered Slaughtneil flags hang outside the Dugout Bar, clinging on in defiance as it continues to wait for a reopening commitment. Two men in caps are chatting outside Kellys Eurospar. A woman opens the door of the pharmacy across the road and calls out. She wants to knowhes going in for the paper.     “Ive no money on me,” comes the reply. The chapel and Fairhill Youth Centre are deserted, but at Crawfordsburn four children move in tandem on the swings. Two teenage girls walk down Glenview, eating from a bag of chips. Its a case of small mercies for the young amid the pandemic. An empty playground at Crawfordsburn. Children have been hit hard by the pandemic. A mounted sign at the entrance to Crawfordsburn Drive urges Solidarity with Palestine. Across the road, a more understated sign from Watty Grahams GAC urges people to take home their rubbish. On the way back in the road, the play park is once again deserted. Neither young nor old are hanging around too long these days. At the corner of Fairhill, McKennas Bar is operating their off licence, and doing a brisk Friday afternoon trade. A table cordoning off the entrance and a screen that drops down from the ceiling bring a sobering reality to the scene. Caitliacuten McKenna is actually reading the Derry Post as I arrive and says it might be the first time shes given us her real name. Shes referring to the Out and About pictures, smiling revellers appeasing the photographer for a two-page spread that is sadly no longer a possibility. For now. Caitliacuten, Caoimhe, and owner Sean McKenna, are all pining for those better days. “Last summer was good craic out in the beer garden,” says Caitliacuten. “Wed always had that space but we revamped it a good bit to make more use of it. Even people who knew it was there were surprised at how big it was when it was overhauled. “Its not too hard to get your , steps a day carrying pints out there.” “Its been a big change, serving people through the hatch and not letting anybody in. Youd have been used to people around the bar a lot of the time,” adds Sean. Sean, Caoimhe and Caitliacuten McKenna hard at work in McKennas Bar. “This is a social hub, youd have had people in and out all the time, whereas out there, though they may be some of the same people from the bar, theyre only staying for a minute and away they go again. “Another change is Im sitting at home on a Friday or Saturday night from  oclock thinking I should be doing something.” The flow of customers interrupts our chat. People finishing up work for the weekend, some calling in on a whim, others a more regular sight. Caoimhe tells me it has been hard on those regulars for whom the pub is very much an arena for conversation. “You do get some who will stand and have a wee chat, because its maybe their only social interaction,” she says. “Its been a while since theyve seen some people, so you get a wee bit of gossip out there that you miss out on having the bar closed. “Then when it gets to  oclock, its mad out there, just before closing. Everybody ends up having a chat with each other at the hatch. “Theyre more likely to meet someone they know then. You also get a lot of people waving in while they are out for their exercise as well.”  We mention the general dferences between the current period of restrictions and the previous lockdowns, but its interesting to view them through the lens of the pub owners. “People arent buying as much drink as they were the first time round,” says Caoimhe. “The weather isnt the same and people cant sit outside in their gardens at the minute. It was a novelty, and people were almost treating it like a holiday. “The town is busier than last time round. It was really, really quiet before, but there is definitely more traffic and more people about than the previous lockdown. “We have noticed a wee bit of a change with a lot more people buying craft beer that they might have had access tothey were out in bars further afield – Belfast or Derry maybe. “A lot of people were making cocktails the first time down. People were asking for all sorts of things at the start that wed never had before because they were making cocktails.” On the way out, Sean draws my attention to the crystal Kalashnikov hanging above the off licence tills. From Russia with love. Covid-, a less welcome import from the East, has brought down a muffled filter on the streets of our towns and villages. Conversation is terse, interaction limited. Hope might spring eternal but you cant gulp on it forever. Magheras Covid rate fell into double figures last week, and despite a slight increase this week, expectant eyes turn towards the decisions of the NI Executive. Heading home on the Coleraine Road, the site of the old police station is busy with construction, the new leisure facilities moving closer to completion. Maghera is poised and ready when normality gets the green light.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Its a brilliant opportunity to showcase those who have gone before. One thing you notice is the pleasure people get from chatting about the past. Everyone has a story to tell. And in a way, it is a therapy for the sporting landscape they crave. In recent weeks Danny Quinn lted the lid on Derrys progression through the eighties. At a glance, it was a mixture of a competitive club scene and school conveyor belts feeding a minor and U group that took Ulster and beyond by storm. Danny puts the current Derry football landscape alongside the one he toiled in. And everything comes in cycles. googletag.cmd.push I agree wholeheartedly. Things are starting to pick up again. Since Derry minors chinned All-Ireland favourites Donegal in a  Clones ambush on the way to a first Ulster title in  years, the Oakleaf has been rising. The digger man is long since gone. The foundations have been poured, the first floor joists have been laid and the brickies are shaping the house towards wall-plate height in project Derry. In an aside, Damian Cassidys new football development committee have peeked into Kerry and Dublin, to see what it takes to turn one house into a new development. They have jotted down their findings, dotted their is and crossed their ts. The planning permission has been applied for. Its a waiting game now to see how much their proposed development can grow. googletag.cmd.push For now, Rory Gallagher is finding a way to get Derrys current side to roof height and beyond. Its often said that defeats are analysed more than wins. There always needs to be a reason for loss. Rory will no doubt have picked through the rubble of their championship defeat last year. The manner in which Donegal pulverised Armagh would suggest that a first Ulster title since  was beyond Derry. But one thing is for certain, victory that night in Celtic Park was well within their grasp. Chrissy McKaigue suggested it as much before the game. Theyd certainly be competitive, he assured me, as I briefly wished him good luck a few hours before the game.     Defensively,theyd have got anything out of the first  minutes, theyd have won a first Ulster championship game since . They were carved open too easy for the first four points. Possession was coughed up and when play ed to Derrys defence, there wasnt a hand put on Rory Grugan , Jamie Clarke or Jarlath Oacuteg Burns as they kicked Geezers charges into a grip of a game they never lost. Trailing by six at the break, Derry were a dferent animal in the second half and had more about them. Had they not been as wasteful during Armaghs  minutes without the black-carded Jamie Clarke, it was another reason why theyd have won. In time, Derry have the tools to build a team to oxter their way into the top table in Ulster. Like Cavan did, to lever themselves inside Donegal and Tyrone at the head of the queue. For now,we are going to break the mould and take a championship performance to a level where we are putting tiles on the roof, a medium to long kick-out strategy needs to be added to the locker. Of Odhraacuten Lynchs  kick-outs, on his championship debut that night,  of them found a red and white jersey. All but two of those won were uncontested and mainly in the defensive parish, eight of them by Padraig McGrogan who peeled into space. It is possession, but it only takes you so far. At the other end, when Derry had the full press on and were gnawing away at Armaghs lead, Blaine Hughes kicked over the top of midfield. It hurt Derrys defence. Three of the kick-outs in particular were won by impact substitute Niall Grimley. It was enough to stem the tide. Odhraacuten Lynchs legs are like rocket launchers. Roll back the years to the  MacRory semi-final over Maghera when he thumped the ball well into their defence. The previous year, when Bessbrook looked like they were taking the semi-final replay to extra-time, Lynch had other ideas. No sooner had the umpires white flag signalled Liam Kerrs equaliser, the Convent netminder grabbed a second ball from behind the goals and arrowed his kick-out down the wing to Conall Devlin. It was instinctive and in the white heat of championship. And seconds later Kevin Smalls winner had Magherafelt into the final. The conundrum for Gallagher is an absence of natural midfielders. Those who will pluck a ball when needed. Conor Glass is only back in the country five minutes and Oisin McWilliams has a paltry  minutes inter-county experience behind him. Aside from Emmett Bradley, thats Derrys out and out midfield options. Niall Holly is not on the  and the rest of the midfielders in the county are mobile runners. The Padraig Cassidys, Ciaran McFauls and the Danny Heavrons. Players who mainly operate there at club level because of their engines rather than a leap to pluck kick-outs. At club level, Lynch, Slaughtneils Antoacutein McMullan and new Glen keeper Connlan Bradleys games all revolve around using the spaces to find these men. Its effective. But, at county level, Derry need to find a couple of longer options. One could be an overload of players on a given wing, something built around a set of signals. For example, plonk Conor Glass on one flank, with breaking ball scavengers within running distance. A tactic could be a low trajectory kick in Glass direction and the area is flooded to create an overload. It wouldnt work every time, but it only needs to come into the game to offer iation. A second option would be the kick to the outside, something Steelstown used to perfection. A line of men down the middle and once goalkeeper Marty Dunne began his run, blue jersies peeled left and right to give him options. Like Devlin did for Lynch in that aforementioned MacRory game. Another example was Michael McEvoys selfless decoy runs, from wing to wing, in the  league final against Leitrim in Croke Park. He rarely handled the ball, but it opened so many doors for others and Thomas Mallons kicking into the spaces was a joy to watch. Kick-outs dictate so much of what direction a game takes. The kicking tees helped coaches find a way of convincing slender U keepers to stay between the posts a year later when faced with kicking a bigger ball, the size five, off the ground. With Stephen Cluxtons high standards, now the number one jersey is an attractive option for young players. Goalkeeping is now cool, but it is only as successful as the tactics further out the field and runs made. Rory Gallagher has found a goalkeeper with an age profile that can helphim grow into a long-term option for Derry. If a short-term success story is found to the countys terrible Ulster championship record, safe possessions in defence must be replaced with winning the ball further up the field to hurt teams and keep them guessing. Only then, will the ridge tiles find themselves on the roof. Rome wasnt built in a day. Neither was a house.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Chivers, the current Club Chairman, was an advocate of kicking the ball. He would later train the All-Ireland winning team he helped build. The relentless kicking drills instilled the message that led to their first All-Ireland final goal. Johnny McGurks high ball created panic in the Salthill defence. Alan Mulholland made a catch, but then he tried to play himself out of danger, Seamus Downeys tackle led to Don Mulholland finding the net. Spirit and kicking in the same sentence, on the biggest of days. “Sometimes we gave it away, but we were a smaller team and the quicker we moved the ball the better,” McGurk adds. “If the full forward line was out in front you kicked it andthey werent, you took another hand to toe. You didnt hold the ball unless you had to.” Hugh Martin McGurk, at , was the oldest player on the starting team. But it took a brave decision at the start of the  season to set them on their way. A defeat to Dungiven in , McGurk felt, was a watershed moment. When John Brennan came in as manager the following year he had a decision to make. Back youth, or go for what had been before. “John had a big part to play in our overall determination and our healthy attitude for winning, he put that into us,” McGurk added. “John came in and bred a pile of young ones from those minor teams. At the risk of being caught out badly, he had the faith in us and it was a big thing.” It paid off when they saw off Newbridge and  years after watching Hurley lt the cup, McGurk looked on as Henry Downey did likewise and he could reach out and touch the championship medal he craved. *** By the start of the  season Brendan Convery took over as senior manager, with Paddy Chivers on board and Laveys dream season was about to get off the ground. Also part of the management team was Paddy Dillon and Brendan Henry, who mixed secretary duties with his magic sponge. “Nerowasnt a man for coaching and ball drills,” Johnny points out. “He wouldve watched training and picked up things about players, it helped him to make changes at important times. “He didnt get too annoyed at any stage. He had the character of a golfer, which he was, so he was relaxed and just watched.” Laveys road to glory began with a very testing game with Castledawson. After a convincing win over Ballerin, it set up a semi-final clash with Dungiven, a rivalry that seemed to pen a new chapter every year between football and hurling. “They were a serious outfit,” McGurk said. “Theyd players with county titles and plenty who had represented the county over the years at all levels. “It was always dog eat dog until itwas over but there was a healthy respect. Lavey and Dungiven wouldve always have got on off the pitch, wouldve sat and had a pint with each other.” After a tight opening spell, Brian McCormicks long kick from defence, won by Seamus Downey, led to Collie McGurks goal and Lavey went on to control the game. With Paddy McGurk and Liam McElhinney clawing for a loose ball, it ended up in the Lavey net to give Dungiven a leline. When Eunan OKane later levelled matters, it took points from McCormick and Johnny McGurk to put Lavey into the county final. After shipping an early Sean D ONeill goal in the final, a similar fisted effort to the Screen net by Seamus Downey had Lavey back in the game. In the final quarter, McCormicks goal opened up a six-point lead before Hugh Martin McGurk netted a third to put the result beyond doubt. “There was never a moment when we felt wed have a chance of winning an All-Ireland,” McGurk replied. “Most teams, they think about the next game and its one less and you just keep going... you think two games ahead, youre gone.” Donegal champions Naomh Columba were waiting in the first round of Ulster in Ballybofey, a team that included county stars John Joe Doherty, Paddy and Noel Hegarty. Two Felix Convery points saw Lavey emerge from a tough encounter. As the players mingled with supporters after the meal back in Jacksons Hotel, there was a sense that something special was brewing. To help create a matchday atmosphere, the team travelled by bus for the rest of the season, even their home semi-final with Armaghs Sarsfields in Ballinascreen. “There was a routine for the last  or  minutes before coming out and wed always have Sean South of Garryowen belting out in the bus as we arrived at the pitch,” McGurk remembers. It was a tempestuous game and another one of inches. In the dying moments, Brian McCormicks scrappy goal, greeted by Collie McGurks somersault to celebrate amid a deafening din of air horns, told Lavey they were in an Ulster club final. The final against Kingscourt was a walk in the park. Despite having Cavan county players Jim Reilly, Pat and Michael Faulkner, Lavey cut through them and won by  points. The party was in full flow when word filtered through out of the blue of their pending All-Ireland Quarter-Final with a star-studded Tir Chonaill Gaels, who boasted Mattie McGleenan and James McCartan in their ranks. “We thought we had the Christmas break and well have a few pints all week,” McGurk remembers of their celebrations eventually put on the back burner. A lack of preparation or knowledge of their London opponents left it another sticky game. It wasnt helped with the wintry weather leaving the game in doubt less than -hours before. “They gave us a fright,” McGurk said, of Laveys three-point deficit as the final minutes ticked away. James Chivers won a throw-in in front of the stand before feeding Seamus Downey, who kicked the ball forward. Their coaching drills always had them finding the man in space. This was dferent. It was the pressure cooker. All shape went out the window. It was all hands to the pump. In the end it was the old dog for the hard road. When corner-back Damien Dohertys low shot came back off the butt of the post,  year-old Anthony McGurk slam dunked the rebound to the net to level the game and Lavey won after extra-time. It was David versus Goliath in the All-Ireland semi-final at Celtic Park against Dublin giants Thomas Davis, who had Dublin players Paul Curran and Dave Foran in their side. Lavey had prepared a scouting trip to watch them in the Leinster final that turned into a bonding day in a Kildare hostelry. The fog had descended by the time the bus, with both players and supporters, arrived in Newbridge and the game was postponed. It took two goals to get Lavey over the line against Thomas Davis, with James Chivers having a hand in both. His fist past teased the Dublin keeper off his line, but the incoming Don Mulholland, who was second favourite to get to the ball, had no reverse gear. He got a hand to the ball, and seconds later Seamus Downey slammed to the net. In the second half, Chivers high ball forward saw Hugh Martin McGurk fouled. He took the kick himself and when it somehow squirmed to the net, Lavey had one foot in Croke Park. They still had to breathe a sigh of relief when a late Thomas Davis snapshot, the last kick of the game, flashed across goal “Theyclapped us off at the end of the game and that was a very fitting thing to do,” McGurk remembers. Teenager Brian McCormick kicked - as Lavey finished the job against Salthill to seal their All-Ireland. It was the final step in an enthralling journey. The outpouring of emotion befitted the endless hours of toil and development to reach the pinnacle. It was a victory for community and channelling everything into putting themselves on the map. Johnny McGurk raises the Andy Merrigan Cup at Croke ParkLater in the year, the Derry championships competitive edge was again evident when Dungiven knocked them off their perch, taking all three titles in one swoop in another tense encounter at Glen. Lavey won Ulster again in  before retaining their title the following year, the last time John McLaughlin paid a visit. There is always the regret of missing a second All-Ireland. After having two men sent off, they left themselves too much to do against Skibbereen, who went the whole way. McGurk feels the sendings off were harsh. “I think wed have won it had we got over them,” he laments. “People say we got lucky the year we won the All-Ireland, but there were other years when we were unlucky not to have won a county title. It was hard to win the Derry championship and like most Derry sides, wed have been competitivewed got into Ulster.” When the parish of Lavey wakes up next Wednesday, the first thing theyll remember will be that magical day,  years ago, when a wave of emotion, on the back of years of toil, carried the Andy Merrigan Cup into their lives.\",\"keywords\":\"Lavey,,Johnny McGurk,All-Ireland Champions,Derry\",\"articleSection\":\"GAA\",\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"description\":\"Thirty years ago Lavey were crowned All-Ireland club champions.

Captain Johnny McGurk looks back on a year of memories and what made their journey special. Michael McMullan tells the story...Spirit. Johnny McGurk may be scanning back  years, but his answer is instant. What immediately comes to mind when he reflects on  and Laveys -game march to dreamland  Those two syllables say it all for the skipper. The Andy Merrigan Cup in McGurks grasp is like the parish he represented on that magical March Sunday. Small in appearance, but massive in every other way. Joxer was just  years of age when Niall Hurley held aloft the John McLaughlin Cup to end a -year Derry championship famine in . Hed always dreamt of winning a championship. “I remember standing behind the goals with a pile of other wains,” McGurk said of that afternoon in Magherafelt when Paddy Chivers pass set up Joe Boyles clinching goal in a - to - win over Ballinderry. googletag.cmd.push Standing in the Hogan Stand, on St Patricks Day , the clubs greatest day, the entire parish congregated below him, awash with orange and black. They emit pride and joy in equal measure. For McGurk, every man, woman and child represented the players the same as the players did for them. It was a two way street. Right down to Parish Priest Fr ODonnells fanatic support of the team. “After games, you werent as much a player, you were just part of the whole setup,” McGurk outlines. “Everybody was in the middle of it and nobody got any special treatment. There was a wave and everybody was on it...thank God it kept going. The spirit and atmosphere in the parish is something that always sticks with me.” googletag.cmd.push The Lavey team and some of their young supporters after the  Derry county final Lavey needed every ounce of their resilience in a season littered with turning points. On the face of it, their Derry, Ulster and All-Ireland finals offered the most daylight on the scoreboard. “Its easy to say that after a final,” McGurk says in disagreement. He digs deeper. Finals were there to be won. Moments from Laveys five-point win All-Ireland final win over Salthill were tense enough. It took a fullsave from Brendan Regan to prevent Mark Butler a certain goal that wouldve levelled the game in the second half. The same player denied Collie McGurk, Don Mulholland and the Downey brothers Hogan Cup glory with a late winning point seven years earlier.     “I dont relax in games, the only time I enjoyed was after them,” Johnny admits. Growing up, to win a Derry championship wouldve been a focus. Winning the top prize was never in his wildest dreams. “To come home with the cup on the Sunday night after the All-Ireland final was one of the most special moments youd ever have in your le.” After stepping off the bus, the kit-bags were stowed away in the dressing room before they paraded into the packed hall. On the stage behind them was a series of stars, each with their name. Goosebumps stuff. “It was a packed house for most of the nights that year,” McGurk recalls. “Population wise, we hadnt the greatest of numbers, but whoever was in any way attached to Lavey was there.” Last autumn, his sons Patrick and James retained their minor championship title on a team playing a ied brand of football. Johnny and Seamus Downey coached the team that includes their sons. The new crop are beacons for the future. Like all the clubs teams, the black star on the back of their jersies is the imprint of , when Lavey stood tallest. *** A November birthday isnt an underage players best friend. Especially one as slight as Johnny McGurk. Derrys U leagues didnt begin until he was overage. After primary school, there was nothing until U. Coming from a family of  and one of eight boys, sport was never far away. Their mother Catherine Bradley came from a family steeped in music and dance in Tobermore, while also lining out for Desertmartin camogs. “To throw a ball or a hurling stick out in the evening was as big a rest for my father and mother as anything,” Johnny said. Sadly, their father Hugh A tragically died after taking ill while watching his sons in championship action for Lavey against Newbridge on at Greenlough in . Growing up, he had high standards. Three things werent accepted, as Johnny outlines pulling out of a ball, not putting in the necessary effort and needlessly lying down. As a  year-old, Johnny shipped a decent tackle on a wet night against Banagher. A voice from outside the pitch, told him, in no uncertain terms, to get back on his feet. It was his father. “I got up brave and sharp, I can tell you,” Johnny laughs. “Hed let you know, but he was your biggest fan at the same time.” Packed into the car, with more bums than seats, to watch his older brother Anthony play for Derry in far flung corners of Ireland ignited a desire to play at the highest level. GAA was always top of the menu, but the local soccer games between Lower and Upper Gulladuff sharpened the competitive edge, the sort that end at dark or a call for dinner. “We were known as Upper Gulladuff. There werent too many of us and there were plenty of them, but that was kicking lumps out of each other every evening,” Johnny remembers. “There was a competitiveness about it which stood to us in later years.” At U level, Lavey were on the wrong side of a few hidings and the dream of winning a championship medal was light years away. Glenullins talented teams were ahead of them. They couldnt compete with the numbers Glen, Bellaghy and Dungiven had, while Kilrea also dished out hammerings. “We were well down the pecking order coming up,” was Johnnys take on the early years. Persistence was an important ingredient in the process. An U title arrived, followed by back to back minor titles in  and . It would form the backbone of a senior team on the cusp of making the breakthrough. “Paddy Chivers wouldve been instrumental in the younger years and the Doctook us as well, he was a great influence,” Johnny points out. Chivers, the current Club Chairman, was an advocate of kicking the ball. He would later train the All-Ireland winning team he helped build. The relentless kicking drills instilled the message that led to their first All-Ireland final goal. Johnny McGurks high ball created panic in the Salthill defence. Alan Mulholland made a catch, but then he tried to play himself out of danger, Seamus Downeys tackle led to Don Mulholland finding the net. Spirit and kicking in the same sentence, on the biggest of days. “Sometimes we gave it away, but we were a smaller team and the quicker we moved the ball the better,” McGurk adds. “If the full forward line was out in front you kicked it andthey werent, you took another hand to toe. You didnt hold the ball unless you had to.” Hugh Martin McGurk, at , was the oldest player on the starting team. But it took a brave decision at the start of the  season to set them on their way. A defeat to Dungiven in , McGurk felt, was a watershed moment. When John Brennan came in as manager the following year he had a decision to make. Back youth, or go for what had been before. “John had a big part to play in our overall determination and our healthy attitude for winning, he put that into us,” McGurk added. “John came in and bred a pile of young ones from those minor teams. At the risk of being caught out badly, he had the faith in us and it was a big thing.” It paid off when they saw off Newbridge and  years after watching Hurley lt the cup, McGurk looked on as Henry Downey did likewise and he could reach out and touch the championship medal he craved. *** By the start of the  season Brendan Convery took over as senior manager, with Paddy Chivers on board and Laveys dream season was about to get off the ground. Also part of the management team was Paddy Dillon and Brendan Henry, who mixed secretary duties with his magic sponge. “Nerowasnt a man for coaching and ball drills,” Johnny points out. “He wouldve watched training and picked up things about players, it helped him to make changes at important times. “He didnt get too annoyed at any stage. He had the character of a golfer, which he was, so he was relaxed and just watched.” Laveys road to glory began with a very testing game with Castledawson. After a convincing win over Ballerin, it set up a semi-final clash with Dungiven, a rivalry that seemed to pen a new chapter every year between football and hurling. “They were a serious outfit,” McGurk said. “Theyd players with county titles and plenty who had represented the county over the years at all levels. “It was always dog eat dog until itwas over but there was a healthy respect. Lavey and Dungiven wouldve always have got on off the pitch, wouldve sat and had a pint with each other.” After a tight opening spell, Brian McCormicks long kick from defence, won by Seamus Downey, led to Collie McGurks goal and Lavey went on to control the game. With Paddy McGurk and Liam McElhinney clawing for a loose ball, it ended up in the Lavey net to give Dungiven a leline. When Eunan OKane later levelled matters, it took points from McCormick and Johnny McGurk to put Lavey into the county final. After shipping an early Sean D ONeill goal in the final, a similar fisted effort to the Screen net by Seamus Downey had Lavey back in the game. In the final quarter, McCormicks goal opened up a six-point lead before Hugh Martin McGurk netted a third to put the result beyond doubt. “There was never a moment when we felt wed have a chance of winning an All-Ireland,” McGurk replied. “Most teams, they think about the next game and its one less and you just keep going... you think two games ahead, youre gone.” Donegal champions Naomh Columba were waiting in the first round of Ulster in Ballybofey, a team that included county stars John Joe Doherty, Paddy and Noel Hegarty. Two Felix Convery points saw Lavey emerge from a tough encounter. As the players mingled with supporters after the meal back in Jacksons Hotel, there was a sense that something special was brewing. To help create a matchday atmosphere, the team travelled by bus for the rest of the season, even their home semi-final with Armaghs Sarsfields in Ballinascreen. “There was a routine for the last  or  minutes before coming out and wed always have Sean South of Garryowen belting out in the bus as we arrived at the pitch,” McGurk remembers. It was a tempestuous game and another one of inches. In the dying moments, Brian McCormicks scrappy goal, greeted by Collie McGurks somersault to celebrate amid a deafening din of air horns, told Lavey they were in an Ulster club final. The final against Kingscourt was a walk in the park. Despite having Cavan county players Jim Reilly, Pat and Michael Faulkner, Lavey cut through them and won by  points. The party was in full flow when word filtered through out of the blue of their pending All-Ireland Quarter-Final with a star-studded Tir Chonaill Gaels, who boasted Mattie McGleenan and James McCartan in their ranks. “We thought we had the Christmas break and well have a few pints all week,” McGurk remembers of their celebrations eventually put on the back burner. A lack of preparation or knowledge of their London opponents left it another sticky game. It wasnt helped with the wintry weather leaving the game in doubt less than -hours before. “They gave us a fright,” McGurk said, of Laveys three-point deficit as the final minutes ticked away.

The government said it would pay up % of the salary of employees placed on furlough. At one stage, the local council had placed  employees on furlough. The council had agreed to pay the remaining % of the furloughed workers salaries during the lay-off period to ensure they received their full pay. Almost half of the council employees have ed to work but  remain on furlough. Details on the money saved by the council as a result of the furlough scheme were outlined on Tuesday at a meeting of the councils Governance and Strategic Committee. googletag.cmd.push A report shared with councillors at the meeting revealed that from March last year to January this year, the council had recouped a total of pound,, from the furlough scheme.

Two years ago, the council commissioned Playboard NI to carry out a detailed audit of all the play facilities available in the local area. The findings of the audit were outlined yesterday at a meeting of the councils Environment and Regeneration Committee. Alan Herron, Director of Service Delivery and Development with Playboard NI, told the meeting that they had inspected  play parks in the council area in November and December . They had also consulted with the local communities to find out their views on the play facilities. googletag.cmd.push Mr Herron said the parks had been awarded scores in relation to their standards. The audit report showed that in the council area, only six play parks secured enough points to be placed in the top band. These included Brooke Park, Pennyburn Play Trail, Ballyarnett Play Park and Strathfoyle Park. A total of  parks were assessed to be in the upper mid band category which means they offer a good level of play value but require ongoing maintenance. Some of the local parks in this bracket were St Columbs Park, Galliagh Park, Irish Street Park, Rose Court and Lapwing Way. googletag.cmd.push The next bracket was lower mid band and  parks in the Derry and Strabane council area were placed in this category. In Derry, these included Oakland Park, Shantallow Park, the Fountain Park, Bull Park and Primity Crescent. According to the Playboard NI report, these parks offer a low value of play value and will require upgrading to bring them up to an adequate standard. The final bracket was called the lowest. A total of  parks within the council area were placed in this category by Playboard NI, who said the facilities currently offer a minimal level of play value.     Among the local parks listed in this lowest bracket are Stevenson Park, Fountain Hill, Currynierin, Rossdowney Drive, Hazelbank and Ballynagard. The Playboard NI report put forward a number of recommendations on how the local play facilities can be improved. Karen McPhillips, the councils Director of Environment and Regeneration, said they have started to consider the high level costs needed to improve local play facilities and how the funding can be secured. She said the cost would run to tens of millions of pounds. “We do need to think about how we are actually able to do that and the number of funding sources and cocktail funding that we have in the past been very successful at using to refurbish and develop play facilities and can continue to do so, she said. “The better the funding strategy and the more finances as a council we are able to both lever in and create through our own capital plan, the quicker we will be able to get through all of these.” It was agreed at the meeting that a detailed plan should be put together on the costs involved in upgrading the play facilities and brought before councillors later this year for approval.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Two years ago, Derry City and Strabane District Council commissioned Playboard NI to carry out a detailed audit of all the play facilities available in the local area. The findings of the audit were outlined yesterday at a meeting of the councils Environment and Regeneration Committee. The report found that more than a third of the  parks in council area were of a poor standard. This included the Currynierin park. Speaking at the meeting, Sinn Fein councillor Christopher Jackson said the details of the audit report highlighted the scale of the task that is in front of us all in relation to improving local play facilities. googletag.cmd.push He said he had a number of concerns, particularly in relation to areas of the Waterside. Cllr Jackson said many of the issues had been red-flagged for a considerableof time. He said a consultation had been carried out with the community in Currynierin and a new play facility had been designed for the area and taken through the planning process. He said the project has been spade-ready for a number of years but work has not started. “As a council we have built up expectation in the local community but we delivered absolutely nothing,” he said. “It is not good enough that we bring play facilities or schemes up to the stage where it is spade-ready and then it sits on a shelf.” googletag.cmd.push Cllr Jackson asked for a report to be prepared by council officers specically on the Currynierin park plans to show what funding opportunities have been explored and what barriers have been put in place in relation to the delay with the project. Cllr Jacksons comments were supported by Alliance councillor Philip McKinney who described the current play facilities in Currynierin as an absolute disgrace. Cllr McKinney said thatchildren from the area wanted to use good playing facilities they have to cross two busy roads to access a play park in Drumahoe. In response, Colin Kennedy, the councils Parks Development Manager, said that a funding application for the Currynierin park had been submitted to the Department of Justice but it had been unsuccessful.     He said a further application had been made to the Department of Communities for the necessary funding but added that bid had been left underdetermined. Mr Kennedy said they would bring back a comprehensive report on what has been done to date in relation to the proposed Currynierin park and what the next stages are. He added that there was a huge amount of work to be done on how the council is going to find the funding to deliver on all the proposed play schemes in the local area. DUP Alderman David Ramsey described the park at Rossdowney Drive in the Waterside as dangerous and said that what equipment remained needed to be removed and replaced. It was agreed at the meeting that a detailed plan should be put together on the costs involved in upgrading the play facilities and brought before councillors later this year for approval.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The call comes from Lilian Seenoi-Barr, from the North-West Migrants Forum, who was speaking after figures showed the Derry and Strabane district recorded the biggest increase in racist incidents in the North last year, as well as the second-largest increase in racist crimes. Speaking to the Derry News, Mrs Seenoi-Barr said: “Racism and hate crime instil fear into entire communities and undermine social cohesion. “We cannot allow such fundamental rights violations to persist at their current high levels. googletag.cmd.push “We need to have serious conversations about race and racism in Derry before it gets out of hand. “It is now time for Derry City and Strabane District Council to develop a local action plan to tackle racial inequalities and racism in Derry. “We also need political and religious leaders in the city to take a proactive approach to tackle racism and prejudice towards people of minority ethnic backgrounds. They cannot simply be bystanders. “Political will and leadership are vital to countering racism and hate crime. The opportunities enjoyed by both political and religious leaders to shape opinions and set agendas come with a responsibility to unequivocally denounce expressions of racism and related intolerance.” googletag.cmd.push Sinn Feacutein Foyle MLA Karen Mullan has said the new figures were very concerning. “There is no place for racism in our community. “It’s imperative on us all to work together as a society to stamp out racism and a build a more equal society free from discrimination. “All incidents of racism should be reported to and dealt with by the police.” On Monday, Mrs Seenoi-Barr was among a number of anti-racism groups who met with local councillors to discuss racism, sectarianism and anti-semitism. During the meeting, she told councillors that the Derry City and Strabane area had seen the largest increase in racist incidents between January  and December , adding that in her view it was fair to say we are going backwards in relation to racist incidents in the city.     Foyle SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin described the reported rise in racists in- cidents in Derry and Stra- bane as deeply disturbing.  She said: “In Derry we are proud to call ourselves a welcoming city but these statistics expose how that welcome does not always extend to all. “It is also incredibly worrying that so few victims actually receive justice. Of the  racist hate crimes recorded in Derry and Strabane policing area last year, outcomes such as charges or cautions were recorded in just four cases from April to December. “I suspect that these statistics only just scratch the surface. The PSNI must work to build trust with black and minority ethnic communities and ensure victims are adequately supported. That must be an urgent priority. “Every single one of us has a role to play in actively challenging racism, in all its forms, within our communities. These conversations arent always going to be easy or comfortable, but they are absolutely vitalwe are to stamp out racism and build a society in which everyone feels safe and respected.” Meanwhile, a UUP councillor on the local authority has apologised after making insensitive comments in relation to the Black Lives Matter movement during Mondays meeting. Alderman Derek Hussey said the Black Lives Matter movement was not fully inclusive, and added that this weeks meeting was addressing issues which go beyond Black Lives Matter However, in a statement issued by his party the following day, he said: “I apologise for my comments which were insensitive. “I was grateful for the opportunity to hear from those who presented and to expand my own understanding of racism in Northern Ireland. The Ulster Unionist Party opposes all forms of racism and we want to see hate crime legislation strengthened in Northern Ireland as soon as possible.       --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The call comes from Lilian Seenoi-Barr, from the North-West Migrants Forum, who was speaking after figures showed the Derry and Strabane district recorded the biggest increase in racist incidents in the North last year, as well as the second-largest increase in racist crimes. Speaking to the Derry News, Mrs Seenoi-Barr said: “Racism and hate crime instil fear into entire communities and undermine social cohesion. “We cannot allow such fundamental rights violations to persist at their current high levels. googletag.cmd.push “We need to have serious conversations about race and racism in Derry before it gets out of hand. “It is now time for Derry City and Strabane District Council to develop a local action plan to tackle racial inequalities and racism in Derry. “We also need political and religious leaders in the city to take a proactive approach to tackle racism and prejudice towards people of minority ethnic backgrounds. They cannot simply be bystanders. “Political will and leadership are vital to countering racism and hate crime. The opportunities enjoyed by both political and religious leaders to shape opinions and set agendas come with a responsibility to unequivocally denounce expressions of racism and related intolerance.” googletag.cmd.push Sinn Feacutein Foyle MLA Karen Mullan has said the new figures were very concerning. “There is no place for racism in our community. “It’s imperative on us all to work together as a society to stamp out racism and a build a more equal society free from discrimination. “All incidents of racism should be reported to and dealt with by the police.” On Monday, Mrs Seenoi-Barr was among a number of anti-racism groups who met with local councillors to discuss racism, sectarianism and anti-semitism. During the meeting, she told councillors that the Derry City and Strabane area had seen the largest increase in racist incidents between January  and December , adding that in her view it was fair to say we are going backwards in relation to racist incidents in the city.     Foyle SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin described the reported rise in racists in- cidents in Derry and Stra- bane as deeply disturbing.  She said: “In Derry we are proud to call ourselves a welcoming city but these statistics expose how that welcome does not always extend to all. “It is also incredibly worrying that so few victims actually receive justice. Of the  racist hate crimes recorded in Derry and Strabane policing area last year, outcomes such as charges or cautions were recorded in just four cases from April to December. “I suspect that these statistics only just scratch the surface. The PSNI must work to build trust with black and minority ethnic communities and ensure victims are adequately supported. That must be an urgent priority. “Every single one of us has a role to play in actively challenging racism, in all its forms, within our communities. These conversations arent always going to be easy or comfortable, but they are absolutely vitalwe are to stamp out racism and build a society in which everyone feels safe and respected.” Meanwhile, a UUP councillor on the local authority has apologised after making insensitive comments in relation to the Black Lives Matter movement during Mondays meeting. Alderman Derek Hussey said the Black Lives Matter movement was not fully inclusive, and added that this weeks meeting was addressing issues which go beyond Black Lives Matter However, in a statement issued by his party the following day, he said: “I apologise for my comments which were insensitive. “I was grateful for the opportunity to hear from those who presented and to expand my own understanding of racism in Northern Ireland. The Ulster Unionist Party opposes all forms of racism and we want to see hate crime legislation strengthened in Northern Ireland as soon as possible.       --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Fermanagh teenager signed from Irish Premiership side Ballinamallard until Thursday, July  and has played in all three of the Candystripes warm-up games so far. Glynn, who is in the first year of his Environmental Planning course at Queens University Belfast, has played under Declan Devine in the IFAs Club NI developmental pathway. In his early days, Micheaacutel played for Enniskillen Rangers before moving to Ballinamallard for the next six years, including two in the first team and being part of the squad beaten by Crusaders in the  Irish Cup Final. googletag.cmd.push “I was on the bench and disappointed not to get on, but nothing I can do,” Glynn points out. “I was playing soccer up to U with Club NI and Northern Ireland Us in the Euros. Whenever I got in to do my A-Levels, I didnt have as much time for soccer.” He is also a talented Gaelic footballer. His attacking prowess helped his school St Michaels Enniskillen to prestigious MacRory and Hogan Cup titles in . It attracted the attention of Fermanagh senior manager Ryan McMenamin, but Glynn turned down offers to join up with the Erne squad to concentrate on his soccer career. googletag.cmd.push “Declan got in contact with Ballinamallard manager Harry McConkey and I had worked with Declan through the IFAs Club NI system for a couple of years at U and U,” Glynn told The Derry News. “When he heard the Ballinamallard season was null and voided, he gave Harry a call to seeI would be interested in giving it a go until July. It was an open offer, so I couldnt turn it down and in July, Derry can either offer me a contact full time or I can go back to Ballinamallard.” Glynn joins other signings Marc Walsh, Will Patching, William Fitzgerald and Joe Hodge ahead of Derrys league opener, away to Longford next Saturday.     Just three days after his arrival at the Brandywell, Glynn played  minutes in the first game, a goalless draw against Bray, followed by another  minutes in a - draw with Finn Harps and half an hour last Sunday against Bohemians, another game ending goalless. “I have been training nearly every day, as much as I can. Im trying to get the minutes in because its been a while since I have played soccer,” points out Glynn, who hasnt featured since Ballinamallards pre-season. “At the minute, I am enjoying it and its going well so far,” he adds. At the minute, it involves a -mile round trip from his home in Derrygonnelly. “The team are training four mornings a week and Im in for all of them, it changes every week with the friendlies. I am in no set routine, but hopefully when the season starts Ill get into a routine and be more settled.” Glynn speaks of the buzz in the Derry camp, with the hopes of getting their season off to a winning start against Longford, who were promoted from the First Division after a - win over Shelbourne last season. “Its exciting, there is good hunger in the squad to succeed,” Glynn said of his progress so far. “I have played with a few of the lads before and they have been great and very welcoming. “It is a very young squad, there are a few lads who have been there and done that and they are setting a great example. Declan has been telling us to learn from them as best as you possibly can.” “For now, it is a matter of keeping pushing, keep the head down in training every day and see what comes of it. Hopefully things go well.” Derry lost - at Dundalk in last seasons opener and chase a first winning start since their - win at home to UCD in . In the last  seasons, the Candystripes have won their first game on four occasions, drew - with Shamrock Rovers in  and last the other five.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The redevelopment plan has the potential to provide a boost for existing traders who have been at the heart of the town centre economy for decades.News of progress to redevelop the town centre site comes after recent confirmation that the location is one of a number of high profile schemes included in a real estate portfolio designed to attract potential national and international developers and investors.Newry, Mourne and Down is one of five local councils which are part of the Belfast Region City Deal consortium and is hoping for a share of a near poundbn Treasury and Northern Ireland Executive investment package.As work to secure city deal funding continues, the local authorities which form the consortiumhave come together to launch a new portfolio of real estate development opportunities within their respective areas with the aim of attracting global investment, boosting tourism and creating sustainable regeneration.The Irish Street regeneration proposal is one of  schemes being showcased in the so-called Belfast Region Investment Guide which have been identied by the ious councils. The portfolio details potential uses for each site with the guide used to market the development opportunities to developers and investors, both locally and overseas.City Deal members say the compilation of the portfolio is the next step in the progression of the consortium with the overriding aim of creating more and better jobs and attracting investment.Newry, Mourne and Down is hoping to secure money from the city deal for a multi-million pound flagship tourism project in Newcastle, with the so-called Mournes Gateway proposal a series of ambitious projects which includes a gondola ride into the heart of the Mourne mountains..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/10Mar2021-Council.jpg","title":"Council 159% rates rises third lowest in province  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has imposed the third lowest rates rise in Northern Ireland.The above inflation .% hike to fund the local authorityrsquos poundm budget was unanimously agreed last week by local politicians who described the increase as ldquofair and balanced.New figures confirm that the rise was the the third lowest across the provincersquos  councils, while three local authorities mdash Antrim and Newtownabbey, Lisburn and Castlereagh and Mid Ulster mdash froze their district rate.The smallest increase of .% was made by Mid and East Antrim Council with the second lowest imposed by Fermanagh and Omagh Council mdash .%.With Newry, Mourne and Down in third spot in terms of the lowest increase, fourth place went to Derry City and Strabane Council which increased its rate by .%.Belfast City Council hiked rates by .%, while Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon sanctioned a .% rates rise.

He had also urged local authorities to also freeze their district rates.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is to create two new funds to help the district recover from the devastating impact of the coronavirus.The Covid revitalisation fund is designed to help the business community, with the local authority also establishing an economic recovery reserve as the district plots its way out of the global pandemic.The local authorityrsquos budget for the new financial year represents an increase of pound.m on last year with the rates rise meaning that homeowners with a property valued at pound, will be paying pound. more a year or  pence a month.The organisation also has poundm in its cash reserve.Politicians say the .% increase is needed to cover the cost of delivering economic regeneration, planning services, leisure and community facilities, refuse collection and street cleansing across the district over the next year.Council chief executive, Marie Ward, said when the organisation struck last yearrsquos district rate, it had no concept of the challenges it would face over the following  months due to the global pandemic.She said Covid- had presented ldquosignicant financial challenges to all councils, with Newry, Mourne and Down no exception.Mrs Ward said the local authority was able to sustain many services and play a key role in responding to the pandemic, moving quickly to make its services safe.ldquoWhether it is supporting businesses through virtual workshops, helping residents stay active or connected during lockdown, working with community partners to get help to our most vulnerable residents, or carrying out environmental improvements works in our towns and villages, we have not stood still, she said.With infection numbers reducing and the coronavirus vaccination programme gathering increasing pace, Mrs Ward said that ldquoambitious thinking is required now more, welcoming progress on major plans to regenerate the district which will help bolster the local economy.The chief executive said the local authority has progressed business cases for both the Newry City Centre Regeneration and Gateway to the Mournes projects, while working with its Belfast Region City Deal partners, on progressing number of regional innovation and skills programmes which will produce benefits for the district..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/10Mar2021-Covid.jpg","title":"Covid cases increase locally  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK and Ardglass are included in a list of  postcode areas in Northern Ireland which have recorded the highest number of new coronavirus cases between March  and .Out of  people tested,  positive cases were confirmed on Monday by the Department of Health.The news comes after visitors again flocked to Newcastle and other popular beauty spots across the district last weekend, but the numbers in some other areas were not as high as reported the previous Saturday and Sunday.Police confirmed that last Sunday that they were made aware of reports of traffic congestion and parked cars causing an obstruction within the vicinity of the Trassey Road and Burrenreagh Road near Bryansford.There were also issues at the Bloody Bridge area on the outskirts of the town with a number of tickets issues to drivers for causing an obstruction, while cars were prevented from entering Castlewellan Forest Park on Sunday afternoon for a period as paramedics and the air ambulance crew responded to a medical emergency.Police had promised that they would be providing a ldquovisible presence in the Newcastle area in particular and had asked motorists to adhere to the designated parking areas provided. Cars parks across the resort were full for most of the weekend.People who live in the resort are particularly concerned that with the deadly coronavirus still in circulation, such a large influx of visitors has implications for public health.Local politicians had also highlighted the need for people to continue exercising social distancing and adhering to public health advice, insisting that there was no room for complacency at this crucial time, despite and increase in positive Covid cases across the district and the roll-out of a comprehensive vaccination programme.Senior Newry, Mourne and Down Council officials had met with police ahead of another anticipated busy weekend in a bid to signicantly reduce the number of visitors, with council officials placing cones in the Tollymore and Bryansford areas, with others located at Carrick Little near Slieve Binnian and in the Mournes.In addition, police set up a number of rolling checkpoints on the main approach roads to Newcastle last weekend, with officers also deployed in the heart of the resort.Police also managed parking at the hugely popular Bloody Bridge area on the outskirts of the resort, expressing concern that some drivers had shown little care or attention for pedestrians or other road users by the way they had parked their vehicles, one of which was a Transit van.Mournes councillor, Willie Clarke, has praised the response from PSNI, local council, the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership, the emergency services and others for their response to managing visitors to main tourism hotspots.He said there was a greater presence on the ground which has been welcomed by residents following the ldquodangerous level of visitors who flocked to Newcastle and other ious parts of the district the previous weekend.ldquoI welcome the co-operation between all the ious agencies to improve the safety of residents, continued Cllr Clarke.ldquoThe local council placed traffic cones in a number of areas popular with visitors, while the PSNIhad vehicle checkpoints at main arterial routes into Newcastle area. There were also a number of mobile police patrols in the resort, with tickets issued to motorists for causing an obstruction at a number of areas including the Trassey Track and Bloody Bridge.Cllr Clarke said these measures helped ease the pressures on what he described as ldquonatural environmental treasurers as the district moves into the Covid recovery phase.He added: ldquoIt is clear that extra resources are required to manage and maintain our rights of ways, forests, beaches and our parks. The local council and PSNI will continue to share social media messaging on restricting travel to within  miles, with police confirming that they will continue to remain active across the entire district, not just Newcastle.Many people took to social media after another busy weekend to ask why visitors from outside the district who had travelled quite a few miles were not stopped and sent home.

So I started to think about what I could do and this is where the business came from.After  years of working with adults with learning disabilities, Louise came up with the idea of creating sensory boxes.ldquoRiley is registered blind and is deaf, so he needs a lot of sensory input. I came up with the idea of providing affordable sensory toys and products for children who need them, explained Louise.ldquoAs a special needs mum, I find thatyou go online to find sensory toys, they are hugely expensive.ldquoIrsquove spent four years buying stuff for Riley and I have a good idea of the things that you wouldnrsquot necessarily buy as a sensory product, but that will provide a similar sensory experience.ldquoI tailor my boxes to the child and find out about their sensory needs to determine what type of things would help them, such tactile items or fidget stuff to help with concentration and children who are hyperactive, or visually stimulating items such as light-up toys, calming products or growing products for a darkened room. There are so many sensory needs out there.Louise has been supported from the Go For It Programme in association with Newry, Mourne and Down Council.The programme is part funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth and Jobs Northern Irelandprogramme.Louise sells mostly through her Facebook page and word of mouth recommendations.ldquoI put up a post on Shop Ireland and I wasnrsquot really expecting the numbers of responses that I got. In the run-up to Christmas I had  orders. I had to turn people away, she explained.The support of the Go For It programme was a key part of the impetus to get the business up and running.The programme is delivered free of charge by a team of experienced business mentors through Northern Irelandrsquos wide network of enterprise agencies and provides expert advice and help with developing a robust business plan to help turn ideas into a commercial enterprise.Louise joined the Go For It scheme through Down Business Centre and was able to access training.ldquoIt gave me the expertise in what to concentrate on first - I went and saw the accountant and got registered, she says.ldquoI was a bit apprehensive because I had absolutely no business experience, just a good idea. But the project gave me the reassurance that it was a good idea and we have put together a business plan.ldquoJoan OrsquoHara has helped me massively throughout the last few months and continues to be available for guidance should I need it or would recommend the best people to talk to in the subject I need.More recently, Louise has got her mum involved, branching out into making tactile and fidget cushions which are suitable for dementia patients and people with ADHD, autism and anxiety.Cllr Laura Devlin, chairwoman of Newry, Mourne and Down Council said: ldquoThe Go For It Programme provides new entrepreneurs with accessible, free and tailored support in the start-up stage of her business in areas such as financial and business planning, and sales and marketing to help get their business up and running.ldquoI wish Louise every continued success in developing and growing her enterprise and encourage anyone thinking about starting their own business to get in touch with the Go For It Programme.Joan OrsquoHara, business advisor at Down Business Centre added: ldquoItrsquos great to see Louise doing so well with a product that will undoubtedly support a childrsquos development through sensory play.If you have a business idea yoursquod like to develop oryou are thinking about starting a business contact the Go For It Programme on    or visit: www.goforitni.

While friends with John and Junior, Alan said he was also proud to have known their father very well.ldquoTo say that Jim was an acknowledged engineering genius is no overstatement, he continued.ldquoJim told me that he served his apprenticeship at Stewartrsquos Motor Works in Downpatrick before World War Two and thought the world of James Stewart whom he referred to as lsquogolden handsrsquo because he could turn his hand to anything.ldquoJim then worked for the former Ulster Transport Authority during the war and opened his Antrim Road Garage in Ballynahinch in late  which he purchased with a loan from a family friend.Alan also revealed that Jim and his son John sponsored him when he used to race cars.He continued: ldquoOnce Jim, or JN as he was known, started to help me with mechanical development, I quickly moved from being a back marker to a front runner in no amount of time. Jim always said that % of winning was done in the workshop before the race meetings.ldquoJim was very much a self-made man with an independent pattern of thought and kept his motorcycling hobby quite separate from his business interests, Alan explained.ldquoWhile he preferred not to align himself with any dealership other than David Brown Tractors, for whom he did development work and sold numerous new and second-hand tractors, he steadfastly refused to repair road going motorcycles.Alan revealed that it was Jimrsquos love of motorcycles and an interest in tuning and modying British machines, a process later adopted by manufacturers like BSA, Norton and Triumph in the s that earned him a much-envied reputation.He said James was ldquoalways extremely modest about his dramatic successes as he was happy developing innovation after innovation in his own workshop.ldquoJim was certainly well ahead of his time when explaining in simple terms that engines had to be enabled to breathe easily to make them perform better, Alan explained.ldquoHis new thinking about breathing, valve and camshaft design, carbureation and compression ratios brought phenomenal output at , rpm from an ordinary production BSA machine when the company was the worldrsquos biggest motorcycle producers in the mid-s, long before the surge of Japanese two-strokes.Many years later, Alan said he still finds it hard to understand that Jim Brown was given motorcycles by leading manufacturers with an instruction to keep them winning at world class level, which is exactly what he did.He also revealed that a lot of Jimrsquos ideas were incorporated into the BSA cc Victor machine that Jeff Smith used to win the motocross world championship in  and .Alan revealed that in earlier years, Jim provided Irish champion road-racer Wilfie Herron with a race-bike, as he did for Ian McGregor, Campbell Gorman and Tom Herron.ldquoHailed as a wizard, he personally tailored the BSA bikes which brought Mervyn McConkey so much success on grass tracks and motocross events throughout Ireland, he continued.The Crossgar man said that when Jim lost interest in the motorcycle industry because of its domination by Japanese-built machines, he turned to Cosworth, who employed him as a consultant.ldquoJim became great friends with Keith Duckworth, the English mechanical engineer famous for designing the Cosworth double four valve cylinder engine and cylinder head, and was also great friends with Sir Frank Williams and Sir Patrick Head from the Williams Formula One team, said Alan.ldquoThrough my friendship with Jim and his we Minnie and their sons John and Junior, I met some wonderful people. Jim was great friends with the Rev Harold Good who latter became the Moderator of the Methodist Church in Ireland, while I helped the Brown family run motorsport events in the Martin and McCormickrsquos quarries in the eighties in aid of the Ballynahinch Methodist Church building fund.Mr Brown passed away in  with a huge number of mourners making their way to Ballynahinchrsquos Lough Inch cemetery, including leading names from the world of motorsport including Frank Williams, Patrick Head and Keith Duckworth.ldquoI will always remember Jim as a great innovative, pioneering engineer who was fired by his own initiative. He is someone the like of which we will never see again, said Alan.ldquoIrsquom sure that Ruth will know that her two brothers and I are working on an article on the le and works of her famous father which we have substantially completed and hope to feature in the Down Recorder over the coming weeks, illustrated with a number of photos taken by the paperrsquos former photographer and Ballynahinch man Jim Miskimmin.Alan also confirmed that the Brian Steenson Memorial Group is planning to have a chat show and talk about the le and work of J N Brown later this year when lockdown restrictions have eased. He also revealed that the group will also have a new cup to hand present this year called the J N Brown Memorial Cup donated by his son Junior.The Crossgar man is also appealing to anyone who may have any photos or memorabilia about Jim Brown or Mervyn McConkey to email him at alan-lyons@hotmail and has also wished Ruth every success with her new book which he thinks will be a best seller..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3March2021-Joe.jpg","title":"Joe Toner – Ireland%2C  Arsenal and Down star  ","story":"HE was a sporting tour de force who played football for Ireland and Arsenal.

He came to Perth from Woolwich Arsenal, having already been capped for his country ndash which was Ireland.ldquoA tricky, pocket-sized left winger, he had an unfortunate start to his Muirton career. He signed in January , and made his debut on the sixth of that month in a First Division match against Motherwell.ldquoSaints lost -, but the Perthshire Advertiser, displaying an unusual degree of inaccuracy noted: lsquoThe Englishman [sic], who is by no means a giant, gave indications of being a sound investment for the Saints. He made the most of any chances he got, but I do feel that he was needlessly starved in the second halfrsquo.In his relatively brief time at Muirton Park he had distinguished himself by becoming the clubrsquos first capped international player.Upon moving back to Castlewellan, his le was touched by tragedy after his we Elizabeth died in her early s from influenza.

It is intended that existing school campuses would be used ldquopending capital investment for a one site solution.The final decision on the way forward will be taken by Mr Weir who met via Zoom with a delegation of parents and St Patrickrsquos Grammar representatives last Wednesday.The Board of Governors at St Patrickrsquos is opposed to the merger, while both De La Salle and St Maryrsquos are in favour of the plan going ahead.Members of St Patrickrsquos Board of Governors have urged parents, past pupils and the public to respond to the ongoing consultation, asserting that the outcome ldquowill have a lasting impact, not just in the school, with staff and pupils, but its ramications will be felt throughout the local community in East Down.The Board of Governors and school management say they do not believe the case has been made for the proposals as currently outlined and will be re-stating the reasons for this as part of the public consultation process and insist that they are focused on achieving the best outcomes for all concerned.De La Salle High School says the merger will ensure that families in the greater Downpatrick area will have an opportunity to finally get behind the vision to secure the town as a model of good practice, where childrenrsquos education is a priority, while St Maryrsquos High insists that an all-ability school can cater for the gted

ldquomany concerned parents who have contacted him on what he described as ldquothis important issue.He said has been working with them over recent days to ensure that their opposition to the current

him in respect of many of the key issues on the ground that, I believe, make the current amalgamation plans wholly unworkable, said Mr Harvey.ldquoThe plans, as proposed by CCMS, would reduce academic choice for parents and children from Downpatrick and the surrounding areas.ldquoIt would deny many Catholic schoolchildren the opportunity of attending a local selective Catholic grammar school and the proposed intake criteria would place children living in the rural areas beyond the urban Downpatrick area at a severe disadvantage in terms of the likelihood of being offered a place.Mr Harvey is

I believe that post-Covid we can work to improve the night-time economy of our main towns and villages which will boost the local economy and potentially help attract new investment, suggested Cllr Curran.ldquoIn the Newry, Mourne and Down area there is now an opportunity to create thriving high streets and villages and while there is a tough challenge ahead, nothing will be achievedall of us not seize the initiative and look to the future with confidence.Cllr Curran said he is particularly pleased that the task force is insisting that working alongside local government in moving forward will be one of its priorities.He added: ldquoRevitalising our town centres could also pave the way for people to live there again, with businesses releasing space above their premises for new accommodation..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3March2021-When.jpg","title":"When Frankie Fitzsimons claimed his final winner  ","story":"THE East Down point-to-point meeting of , which took place on March  at David Corbettrsquos estate at Tyrella, brought the curtain down for Frankie Fitzsimons.The popular Downpatrick jockey decided to call time on his long and successful career in the saddle after winning the opening race, the Alan Dunlop confined hunt race on his own horse, Killinick Robyn.Frankie always said to me that when he made the decision to retire, I would be the first reporter to know. True to his word, he informed me right away, sayingPeter Scudamore could do it, so could he.The race saw  of the  entries go to post, with Frankie making the early running. With three fences to go, the leader was Dave Anthony, ridden by John Bright, with Brian Hamilton chasing on John Turleyrsquos Friendless Friend.Anthony then crashed out and Hamilton was unseated from Fearless Friend, leaving Frankie on Killinick Robyn to win from Darragh Cross owner Judith OrsquoGradyrsquos Another Partner, ridden by James Lamb, with Raymond Martinrsquos Kasperova and Paul Parkin third.The best horses that Frankie rode over the years were Jim Gloverrsquos Hopersquos Choice, trained by his father and namesake, Frankie Sr.Frankie Sr also owned and trained young Frankiersquos first winner under rules, Bright Trick, in a Hunterrsquos Chase at Downpatrick in .One of his most notable winners was Joe Rearsquos Palo. Trained by Peter McCreery, it was the result of a big gamble the day that Frankie rode it to success at Navan.His reward that day from Joe, renowned as Downpatrickrsquos ldquobusy draper, was a new suit. I believe he still wears it on special occasions.The following week at Johnnie Grantrsquos Ramble Inn at Ballykilbeg, Frankie threw a big party for all his friends in the sport. I was lucky enough to be invited and it was a great night. Former amateur and top local funny man Terence McKeag was acting as MC. Frankie took to the stage to play the guitar and sing.Thankfully, Frankie has not been lost to the sport as he is now an officer at point-to-points, as well as being the inspector of courses. He is also a qualied steward at meetings north and south.Also at Tyrella in  there was a local winner in the two-winner race with Moving Statue, trained at Banbridge by Leo Young and ridden by Alfie Evans winning for Dromara owner David Hanna.The six-year old geldings race saw Ian Buchanan ride his own Some Day Soon to success and the Douglas and Cromie Maiden race was won by Mrs Stuart Catherwoodrsquos Bad Boy, ridden by Paddy Graffin.In the open race, Pyral, owned and trained by Moirarsquos Therese OrsquoNeill, and ridden by Graeme Martin proved to be too good for the hot favourite Mill Park Bay, ridden by Pat Kelly.At the Warwick meeting on Friday, Downpatrick jockey Caoilin Quinn recorded his first success for an outside stable when he won the racingtv Conditional Jockeys Handicap Hurdle on the   favourite Eaton Miller, trained by R Potter.Despite the fact that the race was for conditional jockeys, Caoilin was again listed on the card as a Mr. He had been a professional at this stage since early-January.This is something that does not make sense as, at present, amateur riders are unable to compete and sadly will not be able to do so at the Cheltenham Festival.They have always been a big feature of the action there, with so many Irish riders involved. Top riders like Patrick Mullins, Derek OrsquoConnor, Noel McParlan, Jamie Codd, and Barry OrsquoNeil are as effective as any professional.They are working with horses every day of the week, so it is a big disappointment for them and many others.Congratulations to Cumbria- based Downpatrick jockey Danny McMenamin on riding his th career winner. He led   shot Archie Brown at the recent Market Rasen meeting.At present, Danny leads the conditional jockeys title race on  winners. He is five ahead of Cork-born Bryan Carver. He started off in pony racing and is based with Nicky Richards, as was Anthony Dobbin..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/12406220.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

H. Shepard’s six-feet-apart Pooh and Piglet and the stay-at-home Christopher Robin, the online exhibitions applied a ied array of cartoons related to the pandemic and its irritating accoutrements. There was a ‘Guide to How to Self-Isolate’ with cautionary forewarnings on ‘How Not To!”There were cartoons about public transport, walking in the country, home-alone pleasures, pastimes and preoccupations, and staying safe, happy and well. \"First Day Back at School by Cartoonist Bill StottThe artworks radiated optimism and good humour, with a liberal garnish of sentiment and nostalgia, “to remind us” said Dr Beetles, “that even during times of greatest national challenge, Britain remains strong in spirit.”And now, as our youngstersto their classrooms, in dfering ages and proportions around the UK, the Chris Beetles Gallery is presenting a new online exhibition of cartoons and illustrations collectively entitled ‘Back to School.Running to March . , one of the headline artworks, very appropriately, is St Trinian’s cartoonist Ronald Searle’s ‘Welcome back Molesworth!’ illustrating his other comically dysal school.Nigel Molesworth was the supposed author of a series of books, illustrated by Searle, about le in an English prep school called St Custard’s.\"Kathryn Lamb CartoonThe first book, ‘Down with Skool!’ was published in October .‘Welcome back Molesworth!’ appeared on the front cover of The Young Elizabethan Magazinein October .The cartoon shows a black-robed teacher, grimly shaking his cane at reticent-ee Nigel.The narrative accompanying the online exhibition states, “Children ... It’s freedom at last no more pretending that your parents know anything at all about anything, least of all turning a computer on. “It’s Monday morning, the school term commences, and the cartoonists are here to help ease you back in, and reassure you about the orange, stick-thingy that nice Mr Hancock wants to shove up your nose twice a week.“Parents ... Hooray, holidays start now, and don’t pretend you were any good at that school stuff anyway, just get going again on that unfinished West Wing Box Set and the Midsomer Murder repeats. “Quickly, now, they will be home again at four o’clock! No more pretending to work, no more staring at the screens while longing for friends and teachers and proper games. But it might all be a bit scary, this re-run of the First Day of School, so we need a bit of parental ingenuity to ease them back in!”Cartoonist Bill Stott’s picture of a little boy, back in school with a broken arm bearing a badly spelt note from mother to teacher, beautully illustrates the “bit of parental ingenuity”!The exhibition’s narrative continues :“The teachers have missed the children…and have already forgotten all the drawbacks in their role as ‘loco parentis’, and it surely won’t take long to re-establish the dynamics of the relationship.” Amongst the many other uproarious artworks is cartoonist Edward McLachlan’s graffiti on the school wall of St Cuthbert’s Comprehensive - ‘Owr Inglish Teecher is rubish!!’Cartoonist Nick Newman is represented by a number of his drawings, mostly about Covid testing.One depicts a little boy who can’t go back to school, as the wee lad’s mum explains, because “he has a swab stuck up his nose”.The exhibition narrative optimistically philosophises “social scientists tell us that back under the watchful eye of the teacher and the stimulating input from their peers, the children can expand their le skills and social integration and get out of those bad habits they slipped into at home and of course how right they are!“We are told that children need a bit of discipline in their lives and that they crave clear guidelines and strict parameters of behaviour. “Parents are such softies that their kids are all dying to get back to school so that can follow the rules and get stuck into a bit of serious social distancing. “But the pleasures of the day can’t last forever and from the blissful, busy comradeship of schooldays children must be ed to their homes.”A homecoming that’s wonderfully illustrated by cartoonist Kathryn Lamb, whose little boy, home from his first day back at school, tells his father “Homework  Sorry, I’m not working from home anymore.” For more information about the ‘Back to School’ exhibition, and the gallery’s other online shows, plus their Instagram, Facebook and Twitter feeds, visit www.chrisbeetles  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularBoris Johnson was prepared to cut NI loose, says ex-advisor to Theresa May – but we also failed Northern Ireland over BrexitCovid: Orange Order preparing for possiblity of typical Twelfth... but no final decision yet‘IRA offered me revenge upon UVF killer – I turned them down’Man accused of exposing himself in Subway had Kinder Egg full of drugs in his backside, court toldLeo Varadkar left red faced after wrongly claiming Sinn Fein has no Protestant TDsMost PopularVeteran loyalist Ken Wilkinson passes awayBen Habib: Why I am challenging the Irish Sea border in courtHonouring terror victims: ‘La Mon first  last night out our parents had’Covid: ‘Apprentice Boys hopeful of bigger parades than last year’Meghan and Harry: staunch NI royalist hits out over ‘pretty poor’ criticism of family                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\" ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-cmTdod sc-jwKygS gRMrbt\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadLocal BuysAdvertise My BusinessPublic NoticesFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

If nationalism wins then unionism must face the reality of a border with Britain not just in the sea but as a matter of fact. Such a referendum would have to be a once in a generation thing as a referendum every seven years isn’t a test of democracy but rather a war of attrition.The terms of such a referendum should be that another one couldn’t be held for another  years unless a majority of people in an assembly election voted for parties that were clearly designated as nationalist in which case it would be reasonable for a secretary of state to call a referendum at any time. The Good Friday Agreement is not compatible with an Irish Sea border. If the British, European and American governments want to respect the Good Friday Agreement and republicans want a border poll then let us have one in     on the understanding that the result will be respected unlike the result of the Brexit referendum which was not respected for the two-thirds of unionists in Northern Ireland who voted for the winning side.Mr RG McDowell, Belfast BT——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Already the Orange Order has postponed its own main event, a huge parade to Stormont.Mr Lewis told the News Letter:“I’m going to be very unabashed aboutcontinuing to promote and push the positivity of that becausewe’re not trumpeting what’s brilliant about Northern Ireland, and the reasons to invest in Northern Ireland, we can’t expect others to do it for us.“It’s for us as those who have an understanding of, and a love for, Northern Irelandto do that.”Vowing to promote Northern Ireland and the Union, he said: “I’m not going to apologise - I’m going to be quite punchy about that I think part of my job in the UK government is to promote all parts of the UK and Northern Ireland is a hugely important part of the UK.“One of the other points I feel very strongly about is that I make the argument...that it’s important for Northern Ireland to be part of the UK. We’ve seen through covid what the Treasury could do because of the strength of the four nations together financially.”He said that “the UK is stronger because Northern Ireland is in it”.When askedit was not deeply problematic to be advertising Northern Ireland as a place for investment at a time when the Irish Sea border has disrupted trade and there is uncertainty about the future trading environment, he said that “it’s not just about the centenary year – this is using the centenary year to give a  for the future growth of Northern Ireland.“I would hope that as we get further into the year, as we solve these issues for trade for Northern Ireland, that people would see that there is that potentially competitive advantage as a reason to be based in Northern Ireland.”However, he said that even aside from the terms of Brexit, Northern Ireland has exceptional globally-leading talent in areas such asadvanced manufacturing, cyber security, financial technology, renewable energy, and weapons manufacturers such as Thales which supply the Armed Forces.The programme outlined by the government last night will include academic events which explore the historical context of the centenary.And a partnership with Royal Mail and the Post Office will mean that a special postmark reading ‘Our Story in the Making – Northern Ireland Beyond ’ will be applied to stamped mail sent around the world.Stamped mail across the UK will receive the postmark from  April to  May.

We started getting lots more people approach us, and wersquore now in a great position. Itrsquos been surprising.A host of top DJs including Miaszmafrom Florida, and Austrian duo Divisionand Seculahave signed up to the label, and Incurzion has grown exponentially in Florida, Austria, Germany and Russia.But strangely, Mr King says, he doesnrsquot think the label is known about by many people in Penarth.ldquoI feel wersquore starting to get rewards now for the way wersquove tried to really stand out in what is a saturated market, he said. ldquoWe feel wersquove done that by trying to offer a dferent sound and brand.ldquoOur style is deep and dark drum and bass, dark branding and graphic design ndash almost like horror.ldquoBut most of all itrsquos about bringing on board top quality musicians, and thatrsquos what wersquove managed to do.ldquoItrsquos been a massive shock to see how much interest our music is getting from Florida since Miaszma signed.

Itrsquos quite unbelievable for a small town to have such a big connection, and I think it needs to be celebrated more.As lockdown hit last March, so did all of Incurzionrsquos events, which kept Mr King busy every week.He believes musicians have been ignored throughout the pandemic, which he worries may have caused a mental health crisis in the industry.ldquoAs live events go wersquove been absolutely decimated, he said. ldquoThe financial impact of that on venues and on companies like ours, as well as inidual musicians, has been unbelievable.ldquoBut fortunately for us our digital sales have been through the roof. That might be because people have more time on their hands at home to explore dferent genres, and itrsquos great they feel they want to purchase our music.ldquoBut the major thing for this industry is the live events, wersquore nothing without those, just like every other label and performer.ldquoThe funding has been awful, and the impact this will have on mental health seems largely ignored.ldquoThis is what we do every single week, and to have that stripped away from you for so long is dficult. Itrsquos also our place to network, so to not have that space will have long-term ramications.ldquoI know venues in Cardf that have had next to no support, andit carries on you canrsquot see how theyrsquod survive.With cases going down by the week, he hopes the music industry will be able to start up just in time for those venues and for musicians.ldquoWersquore obviously very eager to get back to le as it was, and to pick up where we left off.To find out more about Penarthrsquos Incurzion Audio, visit https:www.incurzionaudio Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The decision, which was agreed by the Executive today, means that the youngest pupils will continue with face-to-face teaching for the remainder of this term. Decisions on the timing for theof other primary and post-primary pupils will be considered next Tuesday as part of an overall review of the current restrictions. Students in years  to , who will be awarded qualication results this summer, willto full time face-to face teaching with effect from March , . Education Minister Peter Weir said: “I welcome the decision by the Executive today to allow the youngest pupils to continue with face-to-face teaching until the start of the Easter holidays. “I know that many schools, parents and other pupils want clarity on when more year groups will be ing. I will continue to make the case for all pupils toas soon as practicably possible and in line with public health advice and scientic evidence. “It is clear that long periods away from the classroom has a signicant impact on the mental health and well-being of our children and young people. Remote learning, no matter how well provided and delivered, is no replacement for face-to-face learning and educational experience. I am particularly conscious of the disproportionate impact that this has on disadvantaged groups and vulnerable children.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_eddbbbdcec   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cedfaaaccc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1615472272670.jpg--covid_19___thu_11th_mar_figures.jpg?161547227200","title":"covid  thu th mar figures ","story":" The NI Department of Health dashboard shows a further  coronavirus related deaths and  new positive cases.  deaths occurred outside of the current reporting period.
