It’s a good name.’A town crier pictured reading a scroll outside the Lindo Wing (Picture: PA)The duke also remarked on how Sir Jerry Mateparae, New Zealand High Commissioner to the UK, had a ‘strong name’.William and Kate’s third child is a younger brother to Prince George and Princess Charlotte.Four-year-old George was christened George Alexander Louis in 2013, while Charlotte, who turns three next week, was named Charlotte Elizabeth Diana in 2015.Their names were announced when they were two days old.William joked on Monday that he had ‘thrice the worry’ now as he took the prince home to Kensington Palace, after the baby’s debut on the steps of the exclusive Lindo Wing maternity unit in London.The duchess is on maternity leave, but is expected to attend Harry and Ms Markle’s high-profile wedding in Windsor on May 19.Kate gave birth at the Lindo Wing of St Mary’s Hospital (Picture: Reuters) "},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/sec_9416849.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"pensioner offers burglar lift home catching act","story":"Harry Turner, 86, said he was in no position to get physical with the man (Picture: Cascade)An 86-year-old man who found a thief rifling through his drawers did something very unexpected – he offered him a lift home.Harry Turner described feeling ‘bewildered’ to find the would-be thief in his home just moments after he left to go out for dinner in Perth, Scotland.After leaving his home he realised he had forgotten a newspaper so popped back to pick it up.When he walked back in he found a young man sitting on his bed and going through his drawers.‘I was bewildered,’ Mr Turner said. ‘I’m too old to be getting into a fight.

Lying in that weird adjustable bed with guard rails and a bag of fluid (probably just water?) dripping into your arm.I recently had such an experience that left me immobile from the waist down and, furthermore, unsure what it meant for my future. Fortunately, I wasn’t paralysed.An hour earlier, I had torn two muscles in my penis and severed my urethra in one of the worst ‘broken penis’ cases on file while having sex in my New York City apartment.A couple years later, I wrote Broken Bananah, a journey through medical trauma and life without a functioning penis. There were a lot of frequently asked questions that I address midway through this timeless classic.The questions started with ‘is that really possible?’ and floated towards ‘how the hell did it happen’ and ‘are you doing okay.’ This was no broken armI basically had two routes to take when fielding questions. If you came for a personal visit at my apartment, I owned up to the truth. If I got a text or I randomly saw you, you got the bike accident story.For the people qualifying in the former, those usual two questions turned into an unusual five. Here are the truthful answers.Doggy style. This became a question that, the more I answered it, the less it seemed the way it should’ve happened. More often than not, this sparked a future safety discussion.Cowgirl has already been established as the most criminal for simple tears (in my case, I tore two muscles and severed my urethra). Without the proper control, the woman can do both unspeakable good and unstoppable harm.It’s no secret that, when on top, the chances of the woman orgasming increase exponentially in this position. Experts call this a high riskhigh reward situation.(Picture: Ella Byworth for )Traditionally, a man has far more difficulty cumming when he’s just laying there. Come to think of it, I guess everyone has a tougher time finishing when they’re just laying there.Missionary comes in as the safest for obvious reasons. Unfortunately for a woman (sorry again, women in general), there is the risk of getting jack hammered. For reference, the jackhammer is an involuntary college move that a boy does to a girl when he sees the finish line – and sprints.Honorary mention has to be awarded to spooking, which may be the safest position. Spooking is when a couple spoons while also having intercourse. With a nice soft cushion between the parties, it’s virtually impossible to misstep.It was one of the most painful accidents of my life.I’ve fractured five bones, had three moles scooped, torn two ligaments, been in two car collisions, and been gashed in the face by a woman’s front teeth in a mosh pit that I started at a Fall Out Boy concert. None of those accidents came with an adrenaline rush like this one.After I called 911 and sat down, I experienced a crippling sensation that permeated my entire body and didn’t subside until I got that drip. So yes, it hurt.The recurrence of this question baffles me. The only thing that came out was blood. Gross, right?The truth was that it takes me longer to finish than the male stereotype. This is not a gift. When Missy Elliott proclaimed that she didn’t want ‘no one-minute man,’ she left out that she also didn’t want no twenty-minute man. She probably wanted somewhere around a ten-minute man, followed by a water break, a nap, and then a movie to play in the background for another nine to ten minutes.The mathematical difference between ten and twenty minutes is nominal on paper, but those ten minutes can have an extreme impact during medium to high intensity physical activity.Again, the answer was no.Now this was an interesting one that truly highlighted how little I knew about the functionality of the human body. Logic dictated that the answer to this was just as much a ‘no’ as the previous answer, but my initial reaction wasn’t as certain.Given this logic, my best guess for wet dreams with the catheter would be ‘no,’ but you never know until you experience it firsthand, I guess.Finally one about the girl the one that served as primary witness to the whole incident. I was all pain and stain, but what about her?After that fateful night, she did stay in touch.She texted me often and sometimes included photos of herself that were as arousing as they were distressing. With every picture, her butt looked less like a peach and more like a weapon.We didn’t have much to talk about, but enough to make pleasant conversation.This one should probably have come first, but the cordial order of medical Q\u0026ampAs didn’t exist in this scenario. I was doing okay.Staying positive was tough when everything was status quo, and this was taking its toll. I didn’t like doing nothing. I didn’t like feeling helpless. I didn’t like moving slow. I liked being the one who moved fast and took care of others.As much as I didn’t want to admit it, I was having a much tougher time receiving help than I would’ve had I been giving it. But I needed it and there weren’t any doctors walking into my room anymore.The only doctor that I had spoken to since the break was my uncle, an eye surgeon, and his wife, an anesthesiologist.

Even Fergie’s daughter Princess Eugenie turned up to welcome the arrival of her first cousin once removed.For Charles, languishing in Scotland, the pain must be considerable.To many puzzled observers it may seem that the neglect in not yet having seen his new grandson, when the Middletons have, must lie with the Prince of Wales. But is that the case?On Wednesday, he understandably had to put duty first, travelling to northern France for the dawn ceremony marking Anzac Day and the centenary of the Second Battle of Villers-Bretonneux. A long-planned trip, it involved the prime ministers of France and Australia.All the same, there was a sense of unease among courtiers this week as the prince found himself relegated behind William’s in-laws in the queue to see the latest addition to the House of Windsor.Despite the fact no other senior royals have called in to see the baby, the prince’s absence shines an uncomfortable light on the tricky and perplexing relationship between father and son.We have been here before, of course. Three years ago, Charles complained that he ‘almost never’ sees his first grandson, Prince George, and that he occupied a peripheral role in the little boy’s life.The dismay at seeing less than he expected of his first grandson was amplified because he hoped to become a mentor to the future king.Just a few days before George was born, Charles was happily asking a ladies’ circle for ‘any hints’ on being a grandfather.The anticipation was clear, and it was obvious to those ladies that Charles was determined to be the attentive and loving grandfather he never knew himself.The prince was only three when George VI died, and he never knew his paternal grandfather, Prince Philip’s playboy father Prince Andrew of Greece, who died in 1944.It is not difficult to see how this sparked his desire to be involved in the development of young George, particularly as Charles feels they have a special connection.For he knows that, like himself, George is probably going to have to wait almost a lifetime before he fulfils his destiny. But from the outset, according to insiders, William’s attitude was somewhat different. ‘Very strange,’ says one.On the day Kate’s labour began at St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, Charles was on a train en route to a day of engagements.He had offered to cancel his duties, but was assured it was not necessary because William did not want visitors to come to the hospital immediately, fearing they would be disruptive. Instead, George’s first visitors were the Middletons, which established a pattern that, tellingly, repeated itself this week.When Kate’s due date with Princess Charlotte emerged, the same instruction not to visit and not to cancel engagements followed. But as a royal aide noted: ‘The Middletons don’t do engagements, so it didn’t apply to them.’In the event, Charlotte was born at the weekend and Kate quickly went home to Kensington Palace. When it became clear to Charles that the Middletons would be visiting, he made an immediate decision to go, driving himself and Camilla from Highgrove.According to a friend, he felt it would ‘look awful’ if he didn’t visit his new granddaughter at the same time as the Middletons.He was said to have ‘hared’ down the motorway to London, and even radioed ahead to London for an aide to collect a gift from Clarence House which Camilla had chosen for the baby, to be sent over to Kensington Palace.In the event, Granny Carole and Grandpa Charles arrived at the palace almost at the same time.‘When it suits him, William can be friendly and welcoming, but he can also be aloof and icy,’ says a close figure. ‘With his father, he can be cordial or effusive, especially if he wants more money, as he did for work on Anmer Hall – his house in Norfolk. He dispenses niceties like he is the owner of a sweet shop to a small child.’Nothing illustrates this wilful approach better than William’s reaction after Charles included a picture on his desk of him with George – alongside photographs of William and Harry – for one of the regular in-house videos the Prince of Wales makes for his charities in Commonwealth countries.William complained bitterly, even though the picture was one that had been issued publicly.Nor, say friends, has he made any secret of the fact that he views the relationship that Carole and Mike Middleton enjoy with their children as being just what he covets for his own family.It doesn’t take a genius to work out that he doesn’t think he has had that kind of relationship with his father.For Charles, who wants only to be a mentor and sounding board for his sons and his grandchildren, it is not just a puzzling situation. It is also a sad one.

Two or three sites are under consideration, he revealed.Trump and Kim, the North Korean dictator, have spent the last year trading threats and insults as Pyongyang made rapid advances in pursuit of nuclear-armed missiles capable of hitting America.But amid a softening of relations between Pyongyang and Seoul, the two men have reached an agreement to discuss nuclear disarmament in person.Trump affirmed said he would be meeting with Kim \u0027in the coming weeks\u0027 during a White House celebration on Friday for Olympic athletes.\u0027I want to express my hope that all of the people of Korea, North Korea and South, can someday live in harmony, prosperity and peace,\u0027 he said. \u0027And it looks like it could happen.\u0027           Their dramatic meeting that resulted in an end to the decades long Korean War comes weeks before Kim Jong-un (left) is due to meet U.S. President Donald Trump          North Korean leader Kim Jong Un (centre, right, next to his suster Kim Yo Jong) and South Korean President Moon Jae-in (centre, left) had \u0027serious, frank\u0027 discussions on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and a permanent peace in their first summit session on Friday   Trump cautiously praised today\u0027s historic Korea meeting in a tweet this morning then spoke about it at a ceremony for Olympians at the White House.Trump said that people claimed that denuclearization was an \u0027impossibility\u0027 when he began his campaign to force North Korea to its break point.\u0027And now we have a much better alternative than anybody thought even possible,\u0027 he said.This year\u0027s Winter Olympics, held in South Korea, were instrumental to bringing the North and South together. They walked under one flag in Pyeongchang at the Opening Ceremony. \u0027Hopefully the day will come when Olympic athletes can compete on a Korean Peninsula that is free of nuclear weapons and where all Koreans can live together and care share their dreams,\u0027 Trump today observed.Kim became the first North Korean leader since the 1950-53 Korean War to set foot in the South this morning during talks in which he and South Korean President Moon Jae-in agreed to a \u0027complete denuclearization\u0027 during the talks.  In tweets on Friday morning Trump acknowledged the progress even as he cast doubt over how long positive diplomacy may last.\u0027After a furious year of missile launches and Nuclear testing, a historic meeting between North and South Korea is now taking place. Good things are happening, but only time will tell!\u0027 Trump wrote this morning.In a second message, he added: \u0027KOREAN WAR TO END! The United States, and all of its GREAT people, should be very proud of what is now taking place in Korea!\u0027 Trump gave his blessing last week to South Korea, an important American ally, to end the Korean War.The U.S. president has said in recent days that he will meet with Kim \u0027very soon\u0027 and probably by the beginning of June.\u0027It could be that I walk out quickly, with respect,\u0027 he said in a Thursday morning update. \u0027But it could be that the meeting doesn\u0027t even take place, who knows.\u0027           The White House released photos of outgoing CIA director Mike Pompeo meeting North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un on Thursday after Trump revealed their existence      The White House released photos yesterday of former CIA director Mike Pompeo —now Trump\u0027s secretary of state — meeting with Kim during a clandestine visit to Pyongyang earlier this month.\u0027He wasn\u0027t supposed to meet with Kim Jong-un, but he did,\u0027 Trump revealed on Fox \u0026amp Friends. \u0027We have incredible pictures of the two talking and meeting, which I\u0027d love to release if we can, I\u0027ll do that,\u0027 the president had said.Eight hours later, the White House published photos of Pompeo and Kim shaking hands, their countenance pleasant without extending into a grin. On Tuesday Trump said that North Korea\u0027s tyrant \u0027has been very open, and I think very honorable\u0027 in the lead-up to nuclear talks.He clarified later, after he came under scrutiny for the remark, that he meant, \u0027I hope that we will be able to deal in a very open and honorable fashion with North Korea. A lot is happening. And I think it\u0027s going to be very positive.\u0027Trump said Tuesday, as he met with France\u0027s Emmanuel Macron, that \u0027a lot of promises have been made by North Korea over the years,\u0027 however he has reason to believe that Kim, a 33-year-old dictator who took over from is father in 2011, is serious about wanting to make a deal.\u0027We have been very, very tough on maximum pressure. We have been very tough on, as you know, trade. We\u0027ve been very, very tough at the border. Sanctions have been the toughest we\u0027ve ever imposed on any country,\u0027 he said. \u0027And we think it will be a great thing for North Korea and it will be a great thing for the world. So we\u0027ll see where that all goes.\u0027Trump reiterated that he would \u0027leave the table\u0027 if the discussions with Kim are not productive — a threat he first made during a summit with Japan\u0027s prime minister in Florida last week. \u0027Maybe it will be wonderful and maybe it won\u0027t. And if it\u0027s not going to be fair and reasonable and good, I will, unlike past administrations, I will leave the table,\u0027 he stated. \u0027But I think we have a chance of doing something very special with respect to North Korea. Good for them, good for us, good for everybody.\u0027           Kim and his South Korean counterpart embraced warmly on Friday after signing a statement in which they declared \u0027there will be no more war on the Korean Peninsula\u0027          Kim Jong-un has become the first North Korean leader to step into the South for 65 years as he met with President Moon Jae-in for a historic peace summit on FridayTrump said in a tweet on Friday morning that Chinese leader Xi Jinping deserved credit for the actions he took that helped to bring North Korea to the negotiating table.\u0027Please do not forget the great help that my good friend, President Xi of China, has given to the United States, particularly at the Border of North Korea. Without him it would have been a much longer, tougher, process!\u0027 he stated.China led global reaction to the historic Korean summit today with a quote from a poem that reads \u0027smiling, we meet again\u0027. North Korea\u0027s sole major ally, Beijing said it hoped for a \u0027journey of long-term stability on the peninsula\u0027.China\u0027s foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said, \u0027We applaud the Korean leaders\u0027 historic step and appreciate their political decisions and courage.\u0027We hope and look forward to them taking this opportunity to further open a new journey of long-term stability on the peninsula.\u0027She also cited a poem that reads: \u0027We remain brothers after all the vicissitudes let\u0027s forgo our old grudges, smiling we meet again.\u0027China is a North Korean ally but it has supported a series of United Nations sanctions to punish Pyongyang over its nuclear and missile tests. Beijing has pressed for dialogue to peacefully resolve the nuclear crisis.  Russia has also supported the sanctions and said Friday that the direct dialogue taking place on the ided peninsula is promising.\u0027This is very positive news,\u0027 President Vladimir Putin\u0027s spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. \u0027Today we see that this direct dialogue has taken place (and) it has certain prospects,\u0027 he said.   The dictator, wearing his trademark black Mao suit, and President Moon, in a navy jacket, hold hands as they walk side-by-side across the demarcation line inside the truce village of Panmunjom at the start of Friday\u0027s summit           Kim and Moon strode past an honor guard and military band, before Moon introduced Kim to South Korean government officials          The two sides were writing up a joint statement and the two leaders would announce it together when it was finished, the official, Yoon Young-chan, told a briefingDonald Tusk, President of the European Council said the messages coming from the talks could serve as a \u0027positive memento to all\u0027, and \u0027that the impossible can become possible, and that it depends entirely on the good will and courage of inidual people.\u0027The White House said in a statement as the conversation was commencing that it was \u0027hopeful that talks will achieve progress toward a future of peace and prosperity for the entire Korean Peninsula\u0027 and \u0027looks forward to continuing robust discussions in preparation for the planned meeting between President Donald J. Trump and Kim Jong Un in the coming weeks.\u0027 Just months ago, Trump and Kim were trading threats and insults as the North made rapid advances in pursuit of nuclear-armed missiles capable of hitting the United States. But Kim is now due to meet the U.S. President to discuss denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula.The White House at its allies credit the \u0027maximum pressure campaign\u0027 that Trump implemented that included robust international and unilateral economic sanctions.British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson says that he still does not expect a great breakthrough that would curb North Korea\u0027s nuclear ambitions.Johnson told reporters at NATO headquarters Friday, \u0027I am very encouraged by what\u0027s happening.\u0027He said, \u0027I don\u0027t think that anybody looking at the history of North Korea\u0027s plans to develop a nuclear weapon would want to be over-optimistic at this point.

However, his finish time was never recorded.According to Peter Mowbray, 51, a fellow runner who publicised the incident on Facebook, Mr Halliday was prevented from completing the race by two marshals who saw that he wasn\u0027t wearing a number and escorted him from the course.\u0027It takes a lot of work to run a marathon. It\u0027s not a matter of eating a bowl of pasta and having a go, it\u0027s 12 months worth of training,\u0027 Mr Mowbray said.\u0027Jake had his once-in-a-lifetime experience stolen from him by an imposter.

That man needs to go viral and be named and shamed.\u0027The London Marathon has seen a number of allegations of cheating in its 37-year history.In 2016, TOWIE star James Argent\u0027s sister Natasha had her results removed from the official race website and agreed to return her medal after she ‘ducked under a barrier’ during the race.She was found to have missed 11 out of 24 checkpoints and miraculously finishing the final 20km in just 39mins, quicker than Olympian Sir Mo Farah.In 2014, 34-year-old model Jason Scotland-Williams denied skipping nine miles of the course to achieve a \u0027miracle’ time, the second half of which fell just three minutes shy of the world record – and three minutes faster than Sir Mo.Four years before that, a runner thought to have recorded the quickest-ever time for a pensioner was stripped of his ‘fastest OAP’ title after admitting he took a 10 mile shortcut at Tower Bridge. He claimed he had altered his route due to injury.

Then he stopped and seemed to have second thoughts and he turned round walked back against the flow of the race. I assumed he was going back to get his shirt.\u0027The receptionist from Middlesex, who was running in support of Phab Kids, a charity for disabled children, added:\u0027He wasn\u0027t running at any point.

Kanye is years ahead of his time.\u0027  Kardashian also hit back at the media, which she said was trying to \u0027demonize\u0027 West.  \u0027Your commentary on Kanye being erratic \u0026amp his tweets being disturbing is actually scary,\u0027 she wrote. \u0027So quick to label him as having mental health issues for just being himself when he has always been expressive is not fair.\u0027 Don Jr jumped in to show his support for Kardashian, retweeting her defense of West and adding #ImWithHer - the hashtag originally used to show support for Clinton during the 2016 presidential election.West\u0027s public support for Trump even made its way into the discussion at the White House press briefing on Wednesday. A reporter asked Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders if Trump had reached out to West following the rapper\u0027s recent praise. \u0027I don\u0027t know of any conversation that they\u0027ve had over the last week or so, I\u0027ll keep you posted if that changes,\u0027 Sanders said, breaking into a smile.  \u0027I know they met during the transition, that\u0027s the only meeting I\u0027m aware of that\u0027s taken place, or conversation.\u0027   West first revealed his support for Trump shortly after the November 2016 election, when he told a California concert audience he would have voted for the Republican.\u0027I told y\u0027all I didn\u0027t vote, right?

And they were wealthy enough to employ six servants, socialise with the great and good of Leeds, and involve themselves in the politics of the day.

Together, the tentacles of their influence reached across the city.But the family was also struck by tragedy.Arthur’s wife Harriot, who was a cousin of Beatrix Potter’s mother Helen, died in childbirth in 1888, at the age of 35, before her famous cousin published her first children’s book The Tale of Peter Rabbit, leaving her husband a widower with three children Arthur, two, Elinor, one, and baby Elizabeth.

Within 11 months he was dead. A year later his father Arthur succumbed to grief.It was Hugo Lupton, son of Arthur’s younger brother Hugh and cousin of Kate’s great-grandmother Olive, who was responsible for linking the Luptons to Arthur Ransome.An old Wellingtonian and Trinity College alumnus, who won a Military Cross for his service in France, he married the author’s sister Joyce in 1920 and had four children Francis, in 1921, Arthur, in 1924, Cecily, in 1927, and Geoffrey, in 1930, ensuring the name Arthur went down through the generations.

Her paternal grandfather and uncle were both known as Charlie, although they were both christened Stephen Charles.The elder Charlie Goldsmith – Kate’s great-grandfather – was born at home in Acton, Middlesex, in 1886, and brought up in Southall. When he left home he lived in Uxbridge, where he worked as a mechanic and met his future wife Edith.A tiny woman, under 5 ft tall and weighing 7 stone, she was disfigured by a huge scar on her torso, which she had got during a narrow escape from death when she was a toddler.‘Grandad used to light his cigar in his big oil stove in the hall of the big house where they lived,’ his daughter Alice Tomlinson, the only one of his children still alive at 106 told me.‘He would roll a piece of paper up and put it in the stove and light his cigar. of course, when he went out, my mum copied. She had a go doing the same thing and nearly burned herself to death.’Charlie and Edith got married at Uxbridge Register office in 1909. She was four months pregnant with their eldest child, whom they named after his father.When Charlie Jnr was five years old, his father signed up, serving in France with the Royal Fusiliers, initially in the trenches and afterwards in the cookhouse. He was one of Kitchener’s ‘shilling men’.Luckily, he survived the war but returned home with emphysema. The father-of-six died in 1938, when his oldest son Charlie was 28 years old, and his youngest son, Kate’s grandfather Ronald was just six years old. His widow Edith was forced to move into a condemned flat and go to work at the local factory.Less than a century later, their great-granddaughter is living in Kensington Palace.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/27/20/4B77441D00000578-0-image-m-21_1524856582755.jpg","title":"Is royal baby look like","story":"    How a forensic artist predicted Prince Louis of Cambridge will look in years to comeThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have finally revealed the name of their newborn son, and this is how he could look in years to come.A forensic artist, who is based in Washington D.C, studied recent photographs of Prince William, Kate and their two eldest children.Joe Mullins then put together an image of what he predicts Prince Louis will look like in the future.According to Mr Mullins\u0027 predictions the youngster will have blue eyes, dark blonde hair and full cheeks.He has previously released images of what he predicted Prince George and Princess Charlotte would look like as they grew up.At the time Mr Mullins\u0027 pictures suggested that the children would both have dark hair and blue eyes.  Royalists and bookmakers alike have waited patiently since Monday to find out the name of the new arrival and fifth in line to the throne.     Joe Mullins has previously released images of what he predicted Prince George and Princess Charlotte would look like as they grew upThe name serves as a poignant tribute to Prince Charles\u0027 beloved great-uncle, mentor and \u0027honorary grandfather\u0027, Lord Mountbatten, who was killed in 1979 when the IRA placed a bomb in his fishing boat.   More than 100,000 bets were placed across the UK betting industry on the baby name, with both Albert and Arthur leading the way as the bookmakers\u0027 favourite.Legoland to give free entry to anyone called Louis after...Share this articleBut William and Kate have plumped for a moniker used for centuries across the Channel by the French, who have had 18 kings called Louis.    Following the baby\u0027s arrival, Prince Harry shifts down the line of succession to sixth place. The Duke of York, who was born second in line, has moved to seventh and Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie to eighth and ninth.             According to Mr Mullins\u0027 predictions the youngster will have blue eyes, dark blonde hair and full cheeksAndrew falling out of the top six means he will no longer have to ask the Queen for permission to marry - unlike Charles, William, George, Charlotte and Harry.The first six people in the line of succession must have the Queen\u0027s consent before they can marry on May 19, as set out by the Succession to the Crown Act 2013.The act\u0027s introduction also saw sex removed as a determining factor in the line of succession.It has also been claimed that the royal baby has been born a commoner.Royal historian Marlene Koenig told Town and Country: \u0027It sounds complicated, but in the UK, the only people who are not commoners are the Sovereign and peers of the realm, Duke, Marquess, Earl, Viscount, and Baron.\u0027  It was always thought that William and Kate would go on to have three children.Kate is one of three and had a happy home life with her sister, Pippa Matthews, and brother, James Middleton, and is close to both of her siblings.But William may need to adjust to caring for a newborn once again.Kate joked in the months leading up to her due date that her husband was \u0027in denial\u0027 about having a third.By having more than two children, William and Kate are following in the footsteps of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, who went on to have four children - although there was a gap of 10 years between their second child, Anne, and third, Andrew. Is this what royal baby could look like?

North Korean has been working towards acquiring nuclear weapons since the early 1990s and many analysts are sceptical about its conversion to denucleasizationChristopher Hill, who was the lead U.S. negotiator with North Korea under the George W. Bush administration, said the onus would be on the Trump administration to work out the details of a deal.Key hurdles would be to establish a timetable for denuclearization and to overcome North Korean reluctance to allow a verification process.\u0027I\u0027m guided by my experience which was they said all the right things but they gave us a declaration that was not complete and not entirely accurate, and they also failed to give us any kind of verification protocol,\u0027 Hill said. As for unification, the idea remains a distant dream, though one brought a small step nearer by the agreement to end the war, a precondition for talks both sides have long held.The first priority, according to South Korea\u0027s Unification Ministry, is to develop a sustainable relationship and resolve the issue of North Korea\u0027s development of nuclear weapons.South Korea wants to then develop trust and cooperation to the point where a sort of national consensus has been achieved.After a transitional commonwealth period, the next step would be the formation of a single market on the Korean Peninsula \u0027to create new growth engines and create an inter-Korean economic community of coexistence and co-prosperity.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/27/09/4B93F62100000578-0-image-m-13_1524817229890.jpg","title":"Brexit Secretary David Davis gives intimate interview","story":"    David Davis has always guarded the privacy of his family.

But true to form, Davis, a father of three grown-up children — Rebecca, Sarah and Alexander — and a grandfather of five, aged between one and 16, declines to be drawn further about Chloe’s condition.‘We all love her very much,’ he says simply.During the Easter break, the former SAS reservist took some of the grandchildren, who came to stay in his Yorkshire constituency home, on a typical Davis idea of a fun weekend: camping, kayaking, hiking and mountaineering.Was Chloe with them? A flicker of sadness comes into his eyes. ‘No. Not this trip.’Davis has always guarded the privacy of his family. Married to Doreen for 45 years, he says only that the Davis clan is very close, and his office is filled with photographs of them.          Asked if there are any Remainers in his family, he laughs: ‘I wouldn’t dream of asking them. We don’t talk politics at home.

When I go home there is no talk of politics. That’s family time.’One wonders if the absence of his own father in his life is why family matters so much to Davis, and why he is so protective of them.Born to a single mother in York in 1948, he was mostly raised on a South London council estate by his mum, Betty Brown, and stepfather, Ronald.He did eventually track down his birth father, who came from South Wales and was by then a civil servant, but they met just once and there was no happy-ever-after conclusion.Asked if there are any Remainers in his family, he laughs: ‘I wouldn’t dream of asking them. We don’t talk politics at home. Doreen thinks politics is for madmen.’However, he adds that Doreen ‘broke cover’ last weekend. ‘Someone on the radio was going on about Britain remaining in the customs union.‘She said indignantly: ‘‘What? What do you think the people have voted for?’’ It’s the first political thing she has said for months.’The question of whether Britain stays in the customs union — which would prevent the Government negotiating new trade deals with the rest of the world — is also causing serious tensions in the Cabinet, not least with Chancellor Philip Hammond.                             Imagine going clothes shopping and 27 other people have to agree what you’re going to wear                        David Davis on Brexit negotiations Theresa May is under pressure from Tory rebels to agree to a so-called ‘customs partnership’ under which the Government would collect EU tariffs on goods that pass through the UK. Brexiteers led by MP Jacob Rees-Mogg have described the proposal as ‘cretinous’, a bureaucratic minefield that is utterly unworkable.But a handful of those rebels who have never been reconciled to the EU referendum result are planning to join forces with Labour and the Lib Dems next month to defeat the Government in the Commons on the customs union — even though it could bring down the Prime Minister.When he is asked about the potency of this threat, Davis leans forward with a steely glint in his eyes, and says: ‘Let me make it very plain. We are leaving the customs union. We have to leave it. It’s what the people asked for.’He leaves us in no doubt that he sees his role as not just representing the Government.‘The people have spoken. They rejected the downbeat view of Project Fear. I have 17.5 million bosses — the ones who voted for Brexit. There is no question that leaving the customs union was a condition of Brexit.’In a pointed warning to the rebels, who include the Europhile veteran Tory Ken Clarke, he says: ‘In our manifesto we said unequivocally that we will leave the single market and the customs union.

To the south-west, it is overlooked by a parade of shops whose dilapidated Victorian edifices are colonised by garish takeaway outlets.A markedly deprived area, it is nonetheless popular with students from the nearby Camberwell College of Arts. It is also home to many young families — the average age here is 33 — many of whose children go to the four primary schools within a few minutes\u0027 walk.          This Chinese buffet suggests customers eat as much as they can, more than 20 courses, for just £7.99 to diners of all ages By the time these pupils are aged ten or 11, the official research shows, more than 50 per cent have a BMI of 25 or above (a BMI of 18 to 24 is considered healthy).It is a sobering statistic, which studies suggest is directly linked to the march of takeaway outlets, whose numbers grew by seven per cent between 2014 and 2017.Those figures make Camberwell Green Britain\u0027s worst area for childhood obesity, with the rest of the top ten comprising eight other wards in deprived London boroughs, including Newington, Livesey and Chaucer in Southwark, Hoxton West and Woodberry Down in Hackney, Lancaster Gate in Westminster, Woolwich Riverside in Greenwich and Royal Docks in Newham, as well as Fenton West and Mount Pleasant in Stoke-on-Trent.Meanwhile, affluent enclaves in the leafy shire towns of St Albans and Harpenden West in Hertfordshire, and Godalming, Surrey, along with Bath and North-East Somerset, are among the best.Tough obesity crackdown could see ban on BOGOF deals for...Avicii \u0027lived on fast food, energy drinks, booze and...Share this articleThese statistics were published this week as Theresa May promised further action if current strategies — including the soft drinks levy and mandatory exercise in primary schools — fail to help.She spoke at Prime Minister\u0027s Question Time after facing calls from opposition parties, coordinated by chef Jamie Oliver, to introduce a 9pm watershed for junk food advertising on television, controls on advertising on streets and public transport, and a ban on buy-one-get-one-free junk food deals.          By the time these pupils are aged ten or 11, the official research shows, more than 50 per cent have a BMI of 25 or aboveThe figures, collated via the National Child Measurement Programme, show 50.9 per cent of Year 6 children in Camberwell Green are overweight or obese, with Newington the second worst area in England at 49.7 per cent.Experts single out two factors as key: deprivation and the ready availability of junk food.Kieron Boyle, chief executive of the charity Guy\u0027s and St Thomas\u0027, which is linked to the NHS hospitals that share its name and works to improve public health in Southwark and Lambeth, says: \u0027These figures highlight the growing \u0027deprivation gap\u0027 when it comes to child obesity. It has increased by more than 50 per cent in a decade, with children in the poorest areas of England now twice as likely to be obese as wealthier neighbours.\u0027Child obesity is overwhelmingly an issue of environment, and too often inner-city areas bombard us with opportunities to eat high- energy food.\u0027It hits children in urban, erse and deprived areas hardest, and we need to design our schools, shops and cities with this in mind.\u0027Measures to reduce the density of the fast food outlets in the area are now in place — but they cannot control the shops already here.Walking around Camberwell Green this week, in one street I counted seven takeaways and budget restaurants in a row, with only a betting shop sandwiched in between. Bins disgorge empty food boxes and half-finished burgers. Even a hardware store also sells food and wine.Around the Green, there are more than 33 outlets. Big brands including Pizza Hut, Greggs, Nando\u0027s, McDonald\u0027s, KFC and Tennessee Fried Chicken vie with nine independent chicken shops plus kebab stores, Indians, Chinese, Lebanese and Caribbean takeaways.          Walking around Camberwell Green this week, in one street I counted seven takeaways and budget restaurants in a rowSchool leaving time, from 3.30pm, is rush hour — and the cheapest shops are the most popular. Morley\u0027s, with its cut-price chicken deal, is thronging. McDonald\u0027s heaves with chattering queues of pupils.It\u0027s here that I meet Vivienne de Bascarli, 43, and her 11-year-old son Italo, who is enjoying a burger. Vivienne, a lunchtime supervisor at her son\u0027s Camberwell junior school, is married to Italo (Sr), a driver. She says the meal is a rare treat.She brings Italo to McDonald\u0027s only once or twice a month because she is concerned that he has been classified as overweight. A month ago, when he was weighed at school, he was 54 kilos (8st 7lb). The average 11-year-old boy should weigh around three stone less.Ever since, he has been on a diet, is taking more exercise and has lost two kilos (4.5lb).Vivienne says her son\u0027s weight crept up after a recent sports injury. \u0027Italo stopped playing tennis and football when he broke his finger — he was playing three times a week — and he started putting on weight.\u0027The school offers these clubs and now he\u0027s playing again, getting fitter and losing weight.          School leaving time, from 3.30pm, is rush hour — and the cheapest shops are the most popular (file photo)\u0027He loves sweets and biscuits, but I don\u0027t buy them at all now. If he wants them, he has to buy them with his pocket money, which he gets only if he behaves at school and helps around the house.\u0027Vivienne, who came to the UK from her native Brazil 15 years ago, cooks from scratch at home, but is aware friends\u0027 children buy their evening meal at the chicken shops.\u0027I know a lot of mums who give their children £1 to buy a chicken meal, and you can understand why,\u0027 she says. \u0027But I think it\u0027s about educating the parents as well.\u0027On a nearby table, Chizoba, 45 — she prefers not to give her full name — sits with her ten-year-old son, who is tucking into a meal of burger and chips followed by ice cream. He, like Italo, has been classified as obese following a school weigh-in.\u0027I love cooking,\u0027 says Chizoba, a widow who lives with her sister and works nights in health care support. \u0027Where I was born, in Nigeria, you watched your mother cook and learned from her.\u0027But my son won\u0027t eat good home-cooked food. He only likes KFC or McDonald\u0027s, and he\u0027d come every day if I let him. As it is, we probably come three times a week.\u0027He\u0027d rather go hungry than eat vegetables, and as a mother I\u0027m not comfortable if he eats nothing. So I give in, and give him what he likes.\u0027Chizoba wonders whether she indulges her son\u0027s pernickety eating habits because he was born very prematurely, at just 25 weeks, and she was so eager to feed him up that she cannot now bear the thought of him going without.\u0027I\u0027ve talked to the doctor about his refusal to eat good food, and he says I shouldn\u0027t worry that he\u0027ll grow out of this phase of fussiness,\u0027 she says. \u0027But I wonder.\u0027She is only too aware of the link between the prevalence of junk food outlets and obesity: \u0027You see a lot of kids just walking along the street eating fast food and I think it\u0027s because parents struggle financially to give them quality food.\u0027I try hard to get good food to tempt my son to eat properly. I go to M\u0026ampS to buy him nice things, and go to cheaper shops for my own food. But nothing seems to work.\u0027She is right to be concerned. Children who are obese when they leave junior school are more likely to develop diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, as well as osteoarthritis and certain cancers, at younger ages. They are also more likely to die prematurely and face disability in adulthood, the World Health Organisation confirms.Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, comments: \u0027It\u0027s common for deprived, low-income areas like Camberwell, with single-parent families who have to work doubly hard to survive, to have a high level of obesity. Fast food outlets thrive in these areas.\u0027It may be relatively expensive, but it\u0027s still a lot cheaper than good, healthy food. And fast food is stuffed full of all the ingredients that cause high levels of obesity — fat, sugar and salt. \u0027Greengrocer Aris Giorgio, 76, has seen vast changes over the 47 years he\u0027s kept a shop in Camberwell, opening it soon after he arrived from his native Cyprus.\u0027These days, mothers aren\u0027t at home because they work, and it\u0027s easier to phone for a pizza than cook,\u0027 he says. \u0027In 1971, when I opened this shop, there were just a couple of restaurants — steak houses. Now we\u0027ve got kebabs, pizza, Chinese, Lebanese, God knows what.\u0027With children it\u0027s difficult. If they\u0027re hungry and food\u0027s available all round them, they\u0027ll eat doughnuts or fried chicken. They won\u0027t go home and cook because they haven\u0027t learnt how to and they can\u0027t be bothered. It takes application and time.\u0027Schools should teach children about food and cooking. Show them broccoli, carrots, turnips, parsnips, because some of them don\u0027t even know what fresh vegetables look like. Get them to identify them first, then learn how to cook them and enjoy eating them.\u0027Aris\u0027s shop is a haven of colour and abundance in the nutritionally void wasteland of the High Street. Piles of sweet potatoes, okra, yams and plantains are stacked alongside beetroot, lettuce, tomatoes, tubs of glistening olives and chillies.For the past four and a half decades, he has risen at 3.30am to buy produce at markets, and kept his shop open til 9pm, seven days a week. Profits are down, he laments, but he soldiers on, helped by his grandson David, 28.Among his regular customers is Cornelius Gray, 65, a retired electrical engineer with London Transport.\u0027There used to be a market on the Green when I was a kid here,\u0027 reflects Cornelius. \u0027It sold fruit, veg, fish. There\u0027s nothing like that now. The fast-food outlets have come in the past ten years.\u0027I\u0027m one of six brothers and we were always out playing. But it\u0027s too dangerous for kids to be out on their own now, so they stay at home on their computers. They don\u0027t exercise.\u0027Serge Cefai, head teacher of nearby Sacred Heart Catholic School, laments the selling of playing fields by local councils. His school compensates with table tennis and five-a-side football on its concrete playground.He provides healthy school meals for pupils, but cannot regulate their choices when they leave the premises. \u0027Naïve parenting is a problem,\u0027 he says. \u0027If children are given money and they have the option of buying vegetables or sweets and chips, of course they\u0027ll make the wrong choices.\u0027And temptation is everywhere. At Poundland, towering mountains of Fox\u0027s biscuits are banked alongside stacks of Maltesers and Chocolate Oranges. Cola lollies entice at the checkout.In the nearby Morrisons supermarket, by contrast, the vegetable display is unalluring. The broccoli bin is empty, and there is a space where the white cabbage should be. But the shelves offering two for £3 on flapjacks and honeycomb clusters are regularly replenished.The fragmentation of close-knit families, hard-pressed working single parents, poverty, lack of cookery skills and the ever-present allure of fast food — all these factors create the perfect conditions for soaring obesity and ill-health.I bump into mum Lilia Serna buying vegetables with her 11-year-old son. \u0027I cook for him at home every night. It\u0027s better than fast food,\u0027 she says, but concedes: \u0027He\u0027s overweight. I have told him not to eat chicken takeaways.\u0027The problem is as intractable as it is ubiquitous. And until temptation is removed, it will not go away. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/27/22/1A53A072000005DC-0-image-a-2_1524863751078.jpg","title":"RBS shutter 275 branches England Wales attempt reduce costs","story":"    Ross McEwan said customers are deserting bricks and mortar branches for the internet The cuts will be on top of 180 closures already announced, triggering fresh fears for the future of High Street banking.Campaigners warn that small businesses, the elderly and vulnerable people suffer most when branches are shut.The announcement of the latest closures came as the bank unveiled a profit of £1.2billion for the first three months of 2018 – up 70 per cent on a year earlier.The result suggests RBS is finally turning a corner after disgraced boss Fred Goodwin took it to the brink of collapse in 2008, almost destroying the economy at the same time. It paves the way for the bank to start paying idends again to its legion of small shareholders and for the Treasury to start selling taxpayers’ 71.5 per cent stake.RBS was previously ordered to sell 275 branches to satisfy competition regulators as a condition of its £46billion government bailout during the financial crisis. It spent almost a decade trying to split them off as a new bank called Williams and Glyn but this was too complicated.

However, his finish time was never recorded.According to Peter Mowbray, 51, a fellow runner who publicised the incident on Facebook, Mr Halliday was prevented from completing the race by two marshals who saw that he wasn\u0027t wearing a number and escorted him from the course.\u0027It takes a lot of work to run a marathon. It\u0027s not a matter of eating a bowl of pasta and having a go, it\u0027s 12 months worth of training,\u0027 Mr Mowbray said.\u0027Jake had his once-in-a-lifetime experience stolen from him by an imposter.

That man needs to go viral and be named and shamed.\u0027The London Marathon has seen a number of allegations of cheating in its 37-year history.In 2016, TOWIE star James Argent\u0027s sister Natasha had her results removed from the official race website and agreed to return her medal after she ‘ducked under a barrier’ during the race.She was found to have missed 11 out of 24 checkpoints and miraculously finishing the final 20km in just 39mins, quicker than Olympian Sir Mo Farah.In 2014, 34-year-old model Jason Scotland-Williams denied skipping nine miles of the course to achieve a \u0027miracle’ time, the second half of which fell just three minutes shy of the world record – and three minutes faster than Sir Mo.Four years before that, a runner thought to have recorded the quickest-ever time for a pensioner was stripped of his ‘fastest OAP’ title after admitting he took a 10 mile shortcut at Tower Bridge. He claimed he had altered his route due to injury.          The alleged imposter was photographed (pictured) by the friend of a fellow race-goer who said he took his t-shirt off and threw it into the grandstand and said he was behaving strangelyIn 2011, another competitor was disqualified from the Great North Run after it was revealed that he had travelled most of the final six miles on a bus.The following year, father-of-two Rob Sloan tried to get round his ban by entering the race again under a fake name while disguised in sunglasses. Runner Louise Rooney, 41, was coming towards the end of the race when she noticed the imposter behaving strangely.\u0027I was just running to the finish line past the grandstand when the imposter caught my eye,\u0027 she told MailOnline.\u0027He had a very distinctive haircut shaved all over apart from a stripe of hair at the back.\u0027He was walking with a woman I think towards the finish line and I saw him take off his t-shirt and throw it into the grandstand. It was a brightly coloured T-shirt, yellow or green.\u0027I thought that was strange as he hadn\u0027t even finished the race yet. Then he stopped and seemed to have second thoughts and he turned round walked back against the flow of the race. I assumed he was going back to get his shirt.\u0027The receptionist from Middlesex, who was running in support of Phab Kids, a charity for disabled children, added:\u0027He wasn\u0027t running at any point.

Together, the tentacles of their influence reached across the city.But the family was also struck by tragedy.Arthur’s wife Harriot, who was a cousin of Beatrix Potter’s mother Helen, died in childbirth in 1888, at the age of 35, before her famous cousin published her first children’s book The Tale of Peter Rabbit, leaving her husband a widower with three children Arthur, two, Elinor, one, and baby Elizabeth.

When he left home he lived in Uxbridge, where he worked as a mechanic and met his future wife Edith.A tiny woman, under 5 ft tall and weighing 7 stone, she was disfigured by a huge scar on her torso, which she had got during a narrow escape from death when she was a toddler.‘Grandad used to light his cigar in his big oil stove in the hall of the big house where they lived,’ his daughter Alice Tomlinson, the only one of his children still alive at 106 told me.‘He would roll a piece of paper up and put it in the stove and light his cigar. of course, when he went out, my mum copied. She had a go doing the same thing and nearly burned herself to death.’Charlie and Edith got married at Uxbridge Register office in 1909. She was four months pregnant with their eldest child, whom they named after his father.When Charlie Jnr was five years old, his father signed up, serving in France with the Royal Fusiliers, initially in the trenches and afterwards in the cookhouse. He was one of Kitchener’s ‘shilling men’.Luckily, he survived the war but returned home with emphysema. The father-of-six died in 1938, when his oldest son Charlie was 28 years old, and his youngest son, Kate’s grandfather Ronald was just six years old. His widow Edith was forced to move into a condemned flat and go to work at the local factory.Less than a century later, their great-granddaughter is living in Kensington Palace.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/27/20/4B77441D00000578-0-image-m-21_1524856582755.jpg","title":"Is royal baby look like","story":"    How a forensic artist predicted Prince Louis of Cambridge will look in years to comeThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have finally revealed the name of their newborn son, and this is how he could look in years to come.A forensic artist, who is based in Washington D.C, studied recent photographs of Prince William, Kate and their two eldest children.Joe Mullins then put together an image of what he predicts Prince Louis will look like in the future.According to Mr Mullins\u0027 predictions the youngster will have blue eyes, dark blonde hair and full cheeks.He has previously released images of what he predicted Prince George and Princess Charlotte would look like as they grew up.At the time Mr Mullins\u0027 pictures suggested that the children would both have dark hair and blue eyes.  Royalists and bookmakers alike have waited patiently since Monday to find out the name of the new arrival and fifth in line to the throne.     Joe Mullins has previously released images of what he predicted Prince George and Princess Charlotte would look like as they grew upThe name serves as a poignant tribute to Prince Charles\u0027 beloved great-uncle, mentor and \u0027honorary grandfather\u0027, Lord Mountbatten, who was killed in 1979 when the IRA placed a bomb in his fishing boat.   More than 100,000 bets were placed across the UK betting industry on the baby name, with both Albert and Arthur leading the way as the bookmakers\u0027 favourite.Legoland to give free entry to anyone called Louis after...Share this articleBut William and Kate have plumped for a moniker used for centuries across the Channel by the French, who have had 18 kings called Louis.    Following the baby\u0027s arrival, Prince Harry shifts down the line of succession to sixth place. The Duke of York, who was born second in line, has moved to seventh and Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie to eighth and ninth.             According to Mr Mullins\u0027 predictions the youngster will have blue eyes, dark blonde hair and full cheeksAndrew falling out of the top six means he will no longer have to ask the Queen for permission to marry - unlike Charles, William, George, Charlotte and Harry.The first six people in the line of succession must have the Queen\u0027s consent before they can marry on May 19, as set out by the Succession to the Crown Act 2013.The act\u0027s introduction also saw sex removed as a determining factor in the line of succession.It has also been claimed that the royal baby has been born a commoner.Royal historian Marlene Koenig told Town and Country: \u0027It sounds complicated, but in the UK, the only people who are not commoners are the Sovereign and peers of the realm, Duke, Marquess, Earl, Viscount, and Baron.\u0027  It was always thought that William and Kate would go on to have three children.Kate is one of three and had a happy home life with her sister, Pippa Matthews, and brother, James Middleton, and is close to both of her siblings.But William may need to adjust to caring for a newborn once again.Kate joked in the months leading up to her due date that her husband was \u0027in denial\u0027 about having a third.By having more than two children, William and Kate are following in the footsteps of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, who went on to have four children - although there was a gap of 10 years between their second child, Anne, and third, Andrew. Is this what royal baby could look like?

Having been to Bali every year for holidays, he also knew the drill when it came to airports and had watched his parents book holidays online.“He’s always been active and outgoing,” his mum, Emma, told  Australia on Friday. “His brother and sister are older and so he’s always thought if they can do it, he can do it. He doesn’t get that part. He is hyperactive. But he has a heart of gold.”Drew (not his real name) had had a tough time of late, said Emma, who broke up with her husband last year. He had also been bullied at school and was receiving counselling.Emma learned about the first escape attempt when she got an alert on her credit card account. She rang her bank to inquire and was told Drew had booked himself a one-way ticket from Sydney to Bali and a week’s accommodation at his favourite holiday resort on the island.“I called the police on him so he’d get dealt with,” Emma said. “I mean, he stole my money. I didn’t know at that stage that the payment had gone through ... Then he went to school, and he didn’t come back so I reported him to the police again and they found him near the airport. An Australian federal police officer told me they would flag his passport and not to worry as he would never get past authorities and on to a plane.“The police brought him home and I gave him a talking to – and it obviously didn’t sink in, because the next day he attempted it again.”This time Drew was taken to a police station near the airport, where a police officer returned his passport before his father came to collect himEmma says she locked her credit card and had no idea the A$3,000 (£1,600) he had spent had been approved. She said she trusted the authorities when they said Drew could never get out of the country on his own. But days later, while Drew was staying at his grandparents, Drew tricked his grandmother into giving him his passport, and told her that he was leaving for school as usual. Instead, having packed his backpack and collected his skateboard and some cash he’d saved up from mowing lawns, he headed for the airport.Staff at the airline for his first attempted flight refused his check-in attempt as he didn’t have a letter of support from his mother, so he got a refund and bought a ticket on another flight – no questions asked – to Perth.In Perth, he later told Australian media, he was questioned by staff who wanted to see ID to prove he was over 12, before he boarded another flight to Denpasar, Bali’s capital.Armed with an iPhone and connected to wifi at the airport in Bali, Drew used an app to rent a motorbike and found his way to the four-star All Seasons Hotel, which he knew from a previous holiday. While there, he bought a beer but only took a sip and threw the rest away. He rented a bike to go sightseeing, paid someone to wash his clothes and played alone in the pool. He ate either on the beach or by ordering takeaway food from his hotel room.Back in Sydney, Emma was panicking. “Everyone kept telling me he would never, ever make it to Bali, so why would I be looking overseas when the authorities were telling me he could never board a flight?” Emma said.After three days, a friend alerted her to a social media post saying Drew was in Bali, but she didn’t believe it. She called people she knew in Bali who confirmed they had seen him.“So then I rang the police and cried and said: ‘You promised me this would never happen,’ and that’s when I collapsed,” she said. Foreign affairs officials, who had asked Indonesian police to collect Drew from the hotel, said Drew’s parents would have to fly to Bali to bring him home. It cost the family another A$8,000 to collect him.Now Emma is speaking out about the loopholes that exist in the airline industry and border control that enable an unaccompanied child to leave the country with no questions asked.“Child trafficking was my number-one fear,” Emma said. “I was so stressed. I was living in a twilight zone. I couldn’t believe what was happening. No one rang me when we brought him home to see if he was OK.“He’s very sorry and he’s very remorseful, but I don’t think he understands the magnitude of what he’s actually done.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/347b9efc364034c874bd8f8fff3b39bdd7c71e54/808_1237_5097_3057/master/5097.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a516fb560ac5d5c5c2dd97d3e68c904","title":"david almond made in felling tyneside","story":"The Skellig novelist remembers the din of the shipyards and how he discovered the strangeness and exoticism of TynesideI recall a morning in my Felling childhood. I say to my best friend, Tex, that I want to be a writer. We’ve been serving on St\u0026nbspPatrick’s altar. Bread and wine’s been turned to flesh and blood. I still taste the Host on my tongue. We’re on the High Street outside Myers pork shop. A severed pig’s head grins out from its window. There’s\u0026nbspthe distant din of\u0026nbspcaulkers from the shipyards far below. It’s a\u0026nbsphot day and the sky above is eggshell blue.“A writer?” says Tex. “But you’re just you, Davie. And this is just the Felling. What the hell ye ganna write about?”“Aye,” I sigh. “Mebbe I’m just romancing, Tex.”And we wander on uphill, past Dragone’s coffee shop, past the Blue Bell pub, past the allotments on Windy Ridge, and across the great playing fields towards the lark-filled sky.I don’t really recall the rest of that particular day, but all these years later I continue to wander back there, blending the adult David with the young Davie, drawing together memory, imagination and dream, seeking the tales that grow from that far-off northern corner of the world.It wasn’t always so. For a long time, I\u0026nbspshared Tex’s doubts. I\u0026nbspdidn’t want to write about that place. Didn’t want to be a northern writer with a northern voice. Thought I’d write about more interesting or exotic places, in some voice that was totally different from my own.Then I was ambushed by a story called “Where Your Wings Were”, about the death of my baby sister in our little council house at the foot of the town. It generated a whole sequence of stories called Counting Stars. They were set in a Felling that was very like the real Felling but that was\u0026nbspalso a fiction. Real and imaginary people walked side by side. Real streets led to streets that were totally invented.Those tales changed everything. I relaxed. Accepted my northern Catholic roots. Discovered Felling’s strangeness and exoticism. I wrote about people and events that might seem insignificant, about tragedies and joys that might seem ordinary. I\u0026nbspwrote about a\u0026nbsplittle damaged lovely town that stretches from the\u0026nbspriver to the sky, and found great beauty in it.\u0026nbspI\u0026nbspfelt myself shifting towards a writing voice that felt something like my own. I\u0026nbspbegan to understand that the extraordinary is found in\u0026nbspthe most ordinary of places and that the local really does contain the universal. It was only when I returned to that little place that my work began to be read around the world.Counting Stars led to many other tales and novels inspired by Felling, by Tyneside, by Northumberland, the places that have become the geography of my imagination. I still write stories in the sequence. It’s a life-long project titled Stories From the Middle of the World. And in my new novel, The Colour of the Sun, a\u0026nbspboy named Davie wanders through his home town, Felling, on a\u0026nbspsummer’s day.My journey away and\u0026nbspback again has been taken by many writers. Flannery O’Connor, who struggled with regionalism and Catholicism, gave great comfort on the way: “The discovery of being bound through the senses to a particular society and a particular history, to particular sounds and a particular idiom, is for the writer the beginning of a recognition that first puts his work into real human perspective for him … The imagination is not free, but bound.”I didn’t know that, back when I was a kid with Tex outside the pork shop. I thought I’d\u0026nbspbe free as a lark, without understanding that the skylark’s song is\u0026nbspsung above a nest that’s scraped into the solid earth.• The Colour of the Sun is published by Hodder Children’s Books"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/402ad69e03f45b0823a8e1b0a3c529045d378355/0_6_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0283d0a9d80039ef1788b48b7ce000d","title":"top writers choose their perfect","story":"Crime fiction is now the UK’s bestselling genre. So which crime novels should everyone read? We asked the writers who know ...This is the perfect crime novel. It’s beautifully written – elegiac, emotionally intelligent, evocative of the landscape and history that holds its characters in thrall – and its clever plotting delivers a genuine shock. There’s intellectual satisfaction in working out a plot involving disappearing children, whose counterpoint is Mahler’s Kindertotenlieder. There’s darkness and light, fear and relief. And then there’s the cross-grained pairing of Dalziel and Pascoe. Everything about this book is spot on.Although Hill’s roots were firmly in the traditional English detective novel, he brought to it an ambivalence and ambiguity that allowed him to display the complexities of contemporary life. He created characters who changed and developed in response to their experiences. I urge you to read this with a glass of Andy Dalziel’s favourite Highland Park whisky.• Insidious Intent by Val McDermid is published by Sphere.My formative reading was before the internet, before fanzines, before also-boughts, so for me the “best ever” is inevitably influenced by the gloriously chanced-upon lucky finds, the greatest of which was a 60 cent Belmont US paperback, bought in an import record shop on a back street in Birmingham in 1969. It had a lurid purple cover, and an irresistible strapline: “She was beautiful, young, blonde, and a junkie … I had to help her!” It turned out to be Canadian, set in Montreal. The hero was a solid stiff named Maxwell Dent. The villain was a dealer named The Back Man. The blonde had an older sister. Dent’s sidekicks were jazz pianists. The story was patient, suspenseful, educational and utterly superb. In many ways it’s the target I still aim at.• The Midnight Line by Lee Child is published by Bantam.Does this count as a crime novel? I think so. Dickens presents us with a mazey mystery, a shocking murder, a charismatic police detective, a slippery lawyer and a plethora of other memorable characters – many of whom are suspects. The story has pace and humour, is bitingly satirical about the English legal process, and also touches on large moral and political themes. As in all great crime novels, the central mystery is a driver for a broad and deep investigation of society and culture. And there’s a vibrant sense of place, too – in this case, London, a city built on secret connections, a location Dickens knows right down to its dark, beating heart.• Rather Be the Devil by Ian Rankin is published by Orion. Siege Mentality by Chris Brookmyre is published by Little, Brown.This is my current favourite, in its own way just as good as Murder on the Orient Express. As well as being a perfectly constructed mystery, it’s a gripping, acutely observed story about a group of people, their ambitions, loves and regrets. The characters are vividly alive, even the more minor ones, and the pace is expertly handled. The outdoor swimming pool scene in which Poirot discovers the murder is, I think, the most memorable discovery-of-the-body scene in all of crime fiction. Interestingly, Christie is said to have believed that the novel would have been better without Poirot. His presence here is handled differently – he feels at one remove from the action for much of the time – but it works brilliantly, since he is the stranger who must decipher the baffling goings on in the Angkatell family. The murderer’s reaction to being confronted by Poirot is pure genius. It would have been so easy to give that character, once exposed, the most obvious motivation, but the contents of this killer’s mind turn out to be much more interesting …• Did You See Melody by Sophie Hannah is published by Hodder.I first came to Rebecca, published in 1938, with one of the most recognisable first lines in literature, not knowing exactly what to expect. That it was a classic I was in no doubt, but a classic what? I suspected a drama, possibly a romance, a book heavy on character but light on plot and one I’d read and then forget. How wrong I was.It is a dark, brooding psychological thriller, hauntingly beautiful, literature yes, but with a killer plot. I loved everything about it. The way Du Maurier slowly twists the screw until we have no idea who to trust, the fact that the title character never appears and exists only as an absence at the heart of the book, the fact that the narrator herself is unnamed throughout. But, more importantly, this thriller is an exploration of power, of the men who have it and the women who don’t, and the secrets told to preserve it.• Second Life by SJ Watson is published by Black Swan.To my mind this is the best crime novel written in the English language. Lehane describes horrible events with poetic lines that somehow heal the injury that his subject matter involves, not unlike Shakespeare or the creators of the King James Old Testament. That’s not a hyper-bolic statement. His use of metaphysical imagery is obviously influenced by Gerard Manley Hopkins. Mystic River is one for the ages.• Robicheaux by James Lee Burke is published by Orion.Today, Hughes is remembered for In a Lonely Place (1947) – Bogart starred in the 1950 film version. My personal favourite is The Expendable Man (1963). Hughes lived in New Mexico and her love of its bleak landscape comes through in carefully painted details. She knows how to use the land sparingly, so it creates mood. The narrative shifts from the sandscape to the doctor, who reluctantly picks up a teen hitchhiker. When she’s found dead a day later, he’s the chief suspect, and the secrets we know he’s harbouring from the first page are slowly revealed.Hughes’s novels crackle with menace. Like a Bauhaus devotee, she understood that in creating suspense, less is more. Insinuation, not graphic detail, gives her books an edge of true terror. She’s the master we all could learn from.• Fallout by Sara Paretsky is published by Hodder.What is it about any particular novel that means you’re so engrossed that you miss your bus stop or stay up way past your bedtime? A spare, concise style that doesn’t waste a word. A striking lead character who manages to be both traditional and original. A plot that’s put together like a Swiss watch. Child’s debut has all these things, but like all great crime novels it has the x-factor.In the case of Killing Floor that factor is a righteous anger, rooted in personal experience, that makes the book shake in your hands. It’s the story of a military policeman who loses his job and gets kicked to the kerb. Jack Reacher becomes a Clint Eastwood-style loner who rides into town and makes it his business to dish out justice and protect the underdog, but without the usual props of cynicism or alcohol. We can all identify with that anger and with that thirst for justice. We don’t see much of the latter in real life. At least in Killing Floor we do.• Blood Daughter by Dreda Say Mitchell is published by Hodder.The Long Goodbye is not the most polished, and certainly not the most convincingly plotted, of Chandler’s novels, but it is the most heartfelt. This may seem an odd epithet to apply to one of the great practitioners of “hard-boiled” crime fiction. The fact is, Chandler was not hard-boiled at all, but a late romantic artist exquisitely attuned to the bittersweet melancholy of post-Depression America. His closest literary cousin is F Scott Fitzgerald.Philip Marlowe’s love – and surely it is nothing less than love – for the disreputable Terry Lennox is the core of the book, the rhapsodic theme that transcends and redeems the creaky storyline and the somewhat cliched characterisation. And if Lennox is a variant of Jay Gatsby, and Marlowe a stand in for Nick Carraway, Fitzgerald’s self-effacing but ever-present narrator, then Roger Wade, the drink-soaked churner-out of potboilers that he despises, is an all too recognisable portrait of Chandler himself, and a vengefully caricatured one at that. However, be assured that any pot The Long Goodbye might boil is fashioned from hammered bronze.• Prague Nights by Benjamin Black is published by Viking.Although Nicolas Freeling wrote in English he was a European by choice – an itinerant chef who roamed between postwar France, Belgium and Holland, and who instilled in me a passion for crime set in foreign places. He detested the rules of the traditional British detective novel: stories in which plot seemed to be paramount. Love in Amsterdam (1962) is Freeling’s first novel and it breaks those rules both in terms of structure and of theme.It is a tale of sexual obsession and much of the book is a conversation between the suspect, Martin, who’s been accused of killing his former lover, and the cop. Van der Valk, Freeling’s detective, is a rule-breaker too, curious and compassionate, and although we see his investigative skills in later books, here his interrogation is almost that of a psychologist, teasing the truth from Martin, forcing him to confront his destructive relationship with the victim.• The Seagull by Ann Cleeves is published by Pan.I first read Laidlaw in 1990, shortly after moving to London, when I was aching for something with the flavour of home, and what a gamey, pungent flavour McIlvanney’s novel served up. A sense of place is crucial to crime fiction, and Laidlaw brought Glasgow to life more viscerally than any book I had read before: the good and the bad, the language and the humour, the violence and the drinking.Laidlaw’s turf is a male hierarchy ruled by unwritten codes of honour, a milieu of pubs and hard men rendered so convincingly by McIlvanney’s taut prose. “His face looked like an argument you couldn’t win,” he writes of one character, encapsulating not only the man’s appearance but his entire biography in a mere nine words.This book made me realise that pacey, streetwise thrillers didn’t have to be American: we had mean streets enough of our own. It emboldened me to write about the places I knew and in my own accent.I’m going to claim Lolita for crime fiction, something I never used to do. But it has kidnapping, murder and – it’s important to use this term – rape. It also has multiple allusions to Edgar Allan Poe and even hides an important clue – well, not exactly in plain sight, but in the text of, yes, a purloined letter. And now we know, thanks to the dogged scholarship of Sarah Weinman, that it was based on a real case in the United States. (Weinman’s book, The Real Lolita, will be published later this year.)Dorothy Parker meant well when she said Lolita was a book about love, but, no – it’s about the rape of a child by a solipsistic paedophile who rationalises his actions, another crime that is too often hidden in plain sight. Some think that calling Lolita a crime novel cheapens it, but I think it elevates the book, reminds us of the pedestrian ugliness that is always there, thrumming beneath the beautiful language.• Sunburn by Laura Lippman is published by Faber.Ross Macdonald, an American who wrote in the 60s and 70s, has enchanted me since then with the beauty of his writing and the decency of his protagonist, Lew Archer. I envy him his prose: easy, elegant, at times poetically beautiful. I also admire the absence of violence in the novels, for he usually follows Aristotle’s admonition that gore be kept out of the view of the audience. When Archer discovers the various wicked things one person has done to another, he does not linger in describing it but makes it clear how his protagonist mourns not only the loss of human life but also the loss of humanity that leads to it.Macdonald’s plotting is elegant: often, as Archer searches for the motive for today’s crime, he unearths a past injustice that has returned to haunt the present and provoke its violence. His sympathy for the victims is endless, as is his empathy for some of the killers. • The Temptation of Forgiveness by Donna Leon is published by William Heinemann.With The Woman in White (1859-60) and The Moonstone (1868), Wilkie Collins basically invented the thriller form. The first features a woman wandering out of the fog,madness, stolen identity, one of the great villains – Fosco, corpulent, witty, with pet mice in his pockets – and a strong, unfeminine heroine with a moustache. The Moonstone has a world weary detective, an apparently unsolvable crime and a story told from multiple points of view. Pedants might point out that Poe was a co-inventor (and an earlier one).They might also point out that after an extraordinary psychological duel between Marian Halcombe and Fosco in the first half of the book, Collins almost seems to lose interest. And that the solution in The Moonstone is an outrageous cheat. No matter. Those of us writing in the form are still in his debt – and we’re still reading and rereading his uncanny and glorious books.• Sunday Morning Coming Down by Nicci French is published by Penguin.The trouble with a classic, especially one as frequently adapted as this, is you can lose sight of the original. And yet, looming over the Cumberbatches and Rathbones, there lives my own personal Sherlock Holmes, the one who took shape when I read the story as a schoolboy. No matter how many film or TV versions I come across, none can match the thrill of that first encounter.And there’s a reason why producers and directors keep returning to Baskerville Hall. The book is a perfectly executed crime story: red herrings dropped in just the right places, a location full of mist and menace, a tangle of family secrets, the murderer’s apparently ingenious plan and, at the centre, an enigmatic, eccentric and brilliant detective. It is a recipe for pleasure that made me gasp as a child – and it’s never stopped working.• To Kill the President by Sam Bourne is published by HarperCollins.Summer 1976: student Adam inherits an isolated Suffolk house from a distant uncle. The bohemian commune he dreams of goes horribly wrong. Ten years later, the bodies of a woman and child are discovered in the hall’s animal cemetery. But which woman? Whose child?Rendell was best known for her Chief Inspector Wexford procedural novels but it’s the standalone psychological thrillers she wrote as Barbara Vine that have me by the heart. A Fatal Inversion is arguably the definitive Vine: set partly in the past, substantial in theme and language as well as length. Not a classic whodunit but who-was-it-done-to, ingeniously plotted using flashback and switching viewpoints to constantly wrong-foot the reader.It is a murder investigation, but seen from the suspects’ viewpoint rather than the detective’s. This is the kind of crime I like to read (and write). This book has it all murder, suspense, sex, property porn and a last-page twist that still makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up.What set Rendell apart was an underpinning of perfect psychological plausibility. She understood better than anyone I’ve ever read how petty obsession can spiral into violence. Rendell dealt in Middle England rather than the marginalised, with loss of control rather than premeditation. The violence is sparing and all the more chilling for it, letting readers’ imaginations do the real dirty work.• He SaidShe Said by Erin Kelly is published by Hodder.It was a tragedy when Kerr, one of my heroes, passed away earlier this year. He was a prodigious talent, but he’ll be best remembered for his fantastic antihero, Bernie Gunther, an investigator in Nazi Germany and in the postwar period. I love novels with an ambiguous, conflicted protagonist and, for me, Gunther is the gold standard. My favourite is A Quiet Flame, in which Bernie finds himself in Argentina, alongside a bunch of unsavoury characters including Adolf Eichmann. Bernie is tasked with hunting down a serial killer targeting young girls in a method very similar to another crime he investigated back in Berlin.• A Necessary Evil by Abir Mukherjee is published by Vintage.It’s slightly cheating, choosing Ripley, because he comes with five novels, not one, and they are all equally gripping, tantalising and psychologically fascinating. Across the Ripliad, our hero matures – his weird, glinting, almost masochistic relationship with guilt twists and mutates – but it is in The Talented Mr Ripley that he first crosses the Rubicon from conman to psychopath. Ripley, having befriended and then taken on the identity of rich, idle Dickie, ducks and es across Italy, using his wits to outrun the consequences of his actions and the devil of his own nature. Highsmith’s writing is deceptively simple – as when a smile is “deliberately hurled” across a table. But it’s her understanding of psychology that makes the novel so great. Like all the best confidence tricksters, Ripley reads people, each nervous twitch, each self-regarding simper, using every moment of weakness for his own gain. Highsmith does the same with the reader. She draws in your sympathies (Ripley’s right, isn’t he? How aloof and superior this character is), so that when the bludgeon comes out, half a page later, you are somehow complicit in the crime. Chilling perfection.• Take Me In by Sabine Durrant is out from Mulholland in June.Crime and Punishment is kingpin of the crime fiction prison yard. It’s a teeming, Rabelaisian sprawl, but from the moment Raskolnikov leaves his garret and sets off towards the Kokushkin Bridge it grabs the reader by the lapels. The murder scene, when it comes, is at once farcical, horrifying and enthralling. Raskolnikov is by turns irascible, compassionate, mean-spirited and astute. He infuriates, and commits heinous crimes, but Dostoevsky still contrives to make us root for him.Of course, it is no whodunnit. Instead, in common with much of the greatest crime fiction, its fascination lies in the exploration of the machinations of the mind of a killer – it’s concerned with the psychological impact of the crime rather than the unravelling of a mystery. The big questions it asks are those of guilt, free will and redemption and it’s this ambition that makes it not only the greatest crime novel, but perhaps the greatest of all novels.• The Accident on the A35 by Graeme Macrae Burnet is published by Contraband.This book is as close to perfection as I’ve come across. Structurally it’s extremely tightly woven and as psychological suspense, it pretty much has everything. Remote rural community harbouring secrets? Check. Dual time narrative – the original crime investigation of 1963 and current day? Check. Intrepid female lead, uncovering the truth? Check. Killer twist? Check. Ruth Rendell agreed it was “one of the best detective stories I’ve read”.I read it a long time ago, before I became a crime writer myself, yet when I think about it now, it seems more like a classic novel than a contemporary one. What stays in the mind is the Peak District community of Scarsdale, the investigator as outsider trying to permeate its secrets. And the sheer quality of the writing.• Persons Unknown by Susie Steiner is published by Borough.Seamlessly blending piercing psychological drama, solid procedural and geopolitical thriller plotting, le Carré tells his tales in a breathtaking style he manages to make both muscular and elegant. A Perfect Spy is perhaps the best fictional examination of a father-son relationship penned to date. And his dissection of American foreign policy (in any number of his works) should be required reading in the US state department.• The Burial Hour by Jeffery Deaver is published by Hodder.It was Cruz Smith’s Arkady Renko series that showed me the possibilities of “voice” and “character attitude” in crime writing and how those two elements can be brought together to create a truly memorable novel. In Gorky Park we are navigating the edgy, fractious world of cold war Moscow. There is something wonderfully distinctive about the Russian detective’s way of being and seeing. I am struck by the precision and insight in his interactions with others and himself and that honed cynicism that is never moralistic or judgmental. As Michael Connelly pointed out, “a crime novel – like any story – succeeds or fails on the basis of character”. Renko confirms this for me every time. It is an incredible feat of character portrayal.• The Bone Readers by Jacob Ross is published by Peepal Tree.Jar City was the first Icelandic crime novel to become a critical and commercial success. Published in Icelandic in 2001 (and translated into English by Bernard Scudder in 2006), Silence of the Grave is the second in the series, and proved Arnaldur Indriðason to be one of the world’s finest contemporary crime fiction writers. The book centres on the investigation into the origins of a skeleton found at a building site. This is intriguing enough to keep one glued to the pages, as is the flawed yet endearing protagonist, the policeman Erlendur. But it is a second storyline – which revolves around domestic abuse and its effect on the family involved – that really elevates the novel. It is heart wrenching, agonisingly disturbing and so utterly convincing that one feels present in this horrible household. • The Reckoning by Yrsa Sigurðardóttir is out from Hodder in May.An amoral drifter arrives at a truck stop looking for food or work and meets his soulmate, the wife of the cafe owner. The sultry self-loathing of the protagonist is mirrored by the woman and they begin a cruel, careless affair and devise a plan to murder her husband. The staccato first person delivery gives the book a thrilling, urgent tone. Neither of the central characters is given a back story and their motives are base. So far, so pulp noir, but Cain does something extraordinary within that. They are redeemed by their loyalty to each other. It takes an hour to read but you’ll never forget it •• The Long Drop by Denise Mina is published by Vintage.This is the high-water mark of the genre, for me. Martin Cruz Smith took a familiar trope – a good man trying to keep his head down and do his job, despite the corruption all around him – and made something entirely fresh, entirely new. What begins as a murder mystery becomes a cold war thriller unlike any that preceded it, and if the label “game-changer” had existed back in the 80s, here it would have found its perfect fit. Gorky Park is perhaps the most humane thriller I’ve ever read, offering a fascinating glimpse of a society in slow-motion collapse, and its thrills never pall with rereading every time the snow starts to melt, revealing those three corpses within earshot of the skating rink, I’m hooked again. The key to its success is its hero, Arkady Renko: brave, lonely and utterly sympathetic. “He’s a good instrument. I work better when I’m working with him,” Smith once said. We could all use such tools.• London Rules by Nick Herron is out from John Murray in August.• The Theakston Old Peculier crime writing festival, with Lee Child as programming chair, is at The Old Swan, Harrogate, 19-22 July. harrogateinternationalfestivals.  • To browse all the books featured in this article, please visit bookshop.

Britain and its overseas territories have become the jurisdiction of choice for dirty money because of the secrecy of our offshore ownership laws.”More than half of the offshore companies referred to in the Panama Papers were set up in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), according to Transparency International. The jurisdiction allows people to register companies in secret, prompting accusations that it is easy to hide cash and assets without external scrutiny.Conservative supporters of the amendment to the sanctions and anti-money laundering bill are led by Andrew Mitchell and include the former cabinet ministers Nicky Morgan, Dominic Grieve, Stephen Crabb and Ken Clarke. The SNP’s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, and the Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, are also backers.Mitchell said he was hopeful the government would recognise the strength of parliamentary opinion on the subject and find a way of “elegantly getting off the hook”.He said: “The argument that the registers are available in private to UK authorities is insufficient. Public registers allow reporting and discussion of these matters by the media and civil society, as was demonstrated by debate that followed the leak of the Panama Papers.”No 10 said on Friday it was studying the amendment carefully, prompting speculation that ministers may attempt to broker a compromise. “We want to analyse its effectiveness. This is an important issue and one we want to get right,” the prime minister’s spokesman said. There are 14 British overseas territories, with a combined population of 350,000. Several have become major offshore financial centres, including Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Gibraltar and the BVI.The overseas territories have introduced private central registers of ownership, which are accessible to UK law enforcement and tax authorities. The amendment calls on them to make those publicly available by December 2020, or have UK ministers impose that requirement upon them via orders in council.Some of the territories have expressed opposition to the imposition of public registers, with one leading offshore centre saying it would cost its public purse $100m (£72m) a year.In March, in a previously unreported submission, the BVI government told British MPs debating the bill that such a move “without consultation or consensus effectively disenfranchises the BVI legislature and its electorate creating resentment and damaging the historically strong relationship between the BVI and the UK”.It said the territory was still recovering from the impact of Hurricane Irma and could not afford to deal with the effects from lost revenue.

In the case of DExEu’s David Davis, however, he doesn’t even text it in. The secretary of state’s performance in front of the Brexit select committee this week basically amounted to a series of emoticons. He\u0026nbspcan’t do you an explanation of how in the name of magical thinking the government can square its promises on the Irish border with promises on leaving the customs union – but he can do you the shrug. ¯\\_(ツ)_¯ Did you miss it? Don’t worry. Just ask him another question and he’ll do it again.At such a late stage of the game, it is unclear quite how many civil service lectures on the problem Davis has failed to pay attention to. But on this evidence, he urgently needs to be bored harder over the hard border. Or perhaps the looming crisis point is what he wants. Perhaps Britain has had enough of exports.Since before the referendum was even a twinkle in\u0026nbspDavid Cameron’s eye, leavers have been immeasurably helped by the fact that many of us – most\u0026nbspof us? – don’t understand the simplicities of Brexit, let alone its complexities. I recently watched an ITV news dispatch from Norway’s border with Sweden during which I discovered that either Davis did not know what the word “frictionless” meant, or was hoping no one else did. On this basis, Joan Crawford and Bette\u0026nbspDavis had a frictionless relationship.I can only recall one hard lesson from Theresa May in the past year, when she said to the nation: “If we don’t get the negotiation right, your economic security and prosperity will be put at risk and the opportunities you seek for your families will simply not happen. If we do not stand up and get this negotiation right, we risk the secure and well-paid jobs we want for our children and our children’s children too.” And yet, in context, even this is not the moment of brutal candour it appears. May made these comments outside Downing Street in the course of a ludicrously aggressive diatribe against the EU, immediately after returning from Buckingham Palace to call her Darwin award-winning election.Last August, it emerged that some on the EU side of negotiations thought it impossible that the UK side should be as under-prepared and aimless as they seemed, and that it must all be a clever ploy. Pretty sure no one’s floating that theory any more. What’s somehow more unsettling, though, is the look on the faces of Brexiteers outside the inner circle as they realise we really are winging this. This week even such allies appeared concerned by Davis’s shallows.Elsewhere in the government of all the talentless, Amber Rudd’s eye-catching decision to make her terrible week worse is drawing conspiracy theories of its own. On Thursday, the home secretary popped to the Commons to apologise for misleading them over Windrush again, then told journalists she “was not going to be drawn” as to whether Britain would stay in the customs union, despite May saying it wouldn’t. It’s a mark of the government’s baroque dysfunction that the embattled Rudd’s gaffe was regarded by some as a cunning ruse. “I think a lot of people in government are willing us on,” judged one Tory customs union rebel.Underpinning all this is the government’s own structural problem – namely, the impossibility of even the sympathetic half of the audience being able to suspend their disbelief. These people might back them,\u0026nbspbut do they really believe them? We all know what they did two summers ago.The cabinet is now cobbled together from two sides of the referendum ide, each of whom accused the other of the most despicable lies during the campaign. Ever since, preposterously, they have expected the public to accept they are telling the truth when they act together. How is this supposed to work?It is difficult to overstate the absurdity of the home secretary presenting any sort of united front with the foreign secretary, for instance, given that she explained to a TV audience of millions: “Boris? Well, he’s the life and soul of the party but he’s not the man you want driving you home at the end of the evening.” This is a date-rape joke with a drink-drive cover story – a memorable attempt by Amber to cast herself as the Iceman to Boris’s Maverick. I’m not precisely sure where that metaphor leaves us after the past fortnight, but it’s fair to say that if world war three does threaten to break out, you don’t want Amber within two continents of a fighter jet cockpit. It feels more as if we’ve reached the point in a movie where Theresa May is using Rudd’s political corpse as a bullet shield.Or have we? In the sort of masterstroke of comic timing many have come to expect from this outfit, we learned on Thursday of the “war chests” that have been built up this year by cabinet ministers thought to be eyeing leadership bids. As the Sun revealed, those big beasts are: Gavin Williamson (who no longer sells fireplaces), Michael Gove and Amber Rudd. But of course. Reflecting on her abject and shameful Windrush failures this week, Rudd said: “I look back with hindsight and I’m surprised I did not see the shape of it sooner.”The same might be said of the government’s quarter-arsed handling of negotiations with the EU. What will eventually unite many leave and remain voters, one suspects, is the enraged conviction that the politicians should have known what they were doing with Brexit, and rather sooner than this."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84118ff263ae8bfdcbbd7791b7349f87486e5ad4/0_0_4422_2952/master/4422.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=fbaeeecde239e95cd9bb93909221cb3b 1400w","title":"peter rabbit hereditary trailer years scariest film australia perth","story":"‘Parents were yelling at the projectionist to stop,’ says audience member as teaser for horror film Hereditary is mistakenly aired before Peter Rabbit screeningFamilies were forced to flee an Australian cinema when a trailer for a horror film dubbed “the year’s scariest film” was accidentally shown before a school holidays showing of Peter Rabbit.WAtoday reports that the incident occurred an Anzac Day holiday screening of the Beatrix Potter adaptation at Event Cinemas in Innaloo, Perth. As audience members settled down for the film, a trailer for Hereditary began to play. The film, which stars Toni Colette, has received an MA15+ rating in Australia for “themes of strong horror”. Its trailer features a number of unsettling scenes, including one in which a child appears to cut the head off a dead pigeon with a pair of scissors.“It was dreadful. Very quickly you could tell this was not a kid’s film,” an audience member told the newspaper. “Parents were yelling at the projectionist to stop, covering their kids’ eyes and ears. Some parents fled the cinema with their kids in tow.”The cinema eventually switched off the screen, and later offered audience members complimentary tickets as a gesture of goodwill. A spokesperson for Event Cinema’s parent company, Event Hospitality and Entertainment, said that the issue was being “investigated internally to ensure situations like this do not occur again”.This is far from the first time a screening for a family-friendly film has been preceded by an unsuitable trailer. In 2012, a cinema in south London accidentally screened trailers for horror film The Devil Inside and Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance, which stars a flaming skeleton on a motorbike, ahead of a showing of Puss in Boots, while in 2013 a teaser for Lars von Trier’s sexually explicit arthouse drama Nymphomaniac appeared in advance of a screening of Frozen in Florida.

Hughes, the former Wales, Blackburn, Manchester City and Stoke manager hired to replace Mauricio Pellegrino in March, has taken one point from his four league games in charge.“Given where we find ourselves, arguably it is one of the biggest games of my career,” he said. “It’s a huge game for the club. The consequences of going out of the Premier League are huge. Everybody knows that.

In particular, women’s football history gets left aside. There are efforts by historians and football lovers to educate the public on the incredible contributions of women in football. On International Women’s Day I was at the National Football Museum in Manchester for a women’s football conference to present on football and the hijab to a room of academics and researchers. Although there is much to be celebrated, there is still a sordid past that, as footballers, supporters and writers, we must understand in order to do justice to the beautiful game. There are stories that are hard to tell but must be told.Asmahan Mansour. That name has stayed with me for more than 10 years. Mansour was the Canadian girl at the centre of what would become an exclusionary ruling by Fifa to ban the hijab from the pitch. In 2007 the young footballer from Ontario attempted to wear a headscarf at a tournament and was not permitted to play by the referee. She was told she could remove it and play but her hijab would not be permitted on the pitch. Her team, from the capital, Ottawa, withdrew from the event in the Québécois city of Laval in response.The issue with Mansour went to the Canadian Soccer Association and then to Fifa, which decided to uphold the ban and create a policy around it but exempted head coverings that exposed the neck. Despite the fact there was no empirical data or evidence on file that a hijab could strangle a player or injure an opponent, the equipment regulation concluded it was dangerous. This was the basis under which the referee ejected Mansour.The net result was Mansour did not play. Nor did thousands of girls and women for almost seven years afterwards.Initially Fifa cited “religious symbolism” as a reason for not permitting head coverings. But that was too difficult to enforce considering the multitude of tattoos, signing of the cross and goal celebrations by prominent male footballers that would have had to be monitored and enforced. So it stuck with “health and safety” as a weak shield for its policy.In a 2011 Olympic qualifying match against Jordan, Iran’s women’s team were banned from playing because of their hijabs. They wore hijabs that were supposed to meet Fifa standards. Heartbroken and frustrated, the women left the pitch. Their dreams of Olympic football lay in tatters. Photographs of the sobbing players were plastered over the media. This was not a case of Muslim women being oppressed by their faith, it was a serious case of women being excluded by draconian rules, steeped in gendered Islamophobia and ignorance, that were created by men.Even the young Mansour felt the pain of exclusion when she told CBC News: “I thought it was disappointing because I thought I would actually make a difference but I didn’t.”But football dreams were not over. In came supporters, including Moya Dodd of the Asian Football Confederation, Assmaah Helal, a player and activist, and Prince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan, the then vice-president of Fifa and head of the Jordanian Football Association. They spearheaded campaigns and partnered with Right 2 Wear, the United Nations and Fifpro to put pressure on Fifa to approve the hijab.Women came to the rescue with designs and practical solutions for problems created by men problems that kept thousands of people away from the sport they love.Companies such as Capsters and ResportOn designed sports hijabs with safety recommendations from the International Football Association Board, the decision-making body for the laws of the game.As the research and work continued, Muslim women were effectively sidelined. They were not encouraged to join regional or national teams because their status was unknown. Would they have to choose between faith and football? Why was this a choice that had to be made in the first place?On 1 March 2014, after much discussion, testing and clarification, Jérôme Valcke, Fifa’s then secretary general, announced that religious head coverings (including hijabs, turbans for Sikh men and kippahs for Jewish men) would be permitted on the pitch. The understanding was the headcoverings would meet Ifab medical regulations.Muslim women footballers all over the world – and the respective federations – heaved collective sighs of relief. But only after countless budding footballers lost out.In October 2016, less than two years after the hijab ban was overturned, the Under-17 Women’s World Cup was held in Amman, Jordan. It was the first time the hijab would be permitted, and more importantly welcomed, at a major Fifa tournament. It was also the first Fifa tournament to be hosted in the Middle East.It was an important – yet largely overlooked – moment in football. This victory came after much blood, sweat and toil of advocates and players who refused to give up and believed strongly in their connection and right to play. I tell tales about racialised women who might have been made to stay away from football but persevered with help from allies and s of the game.Football is for all of us. Sometimes it just takes women to prove it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebb92ad48e0355347d97f4c3fb5c8dfd520c1538/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a54f65800e326606f89695e0c844734 700w","title":"blind date becky daniel","story":"Does Becky, 26, barrister, find in favour of Daniel, 36, hospital doctor?What were you hoping for?Good food and company.What did you talk about?The criminal barristers’ and junior doctors’ strikes, port and Couch to 5K.Any awkward moments?I may have inadvertently drawn attention to the 10-year age gap.Good table manners?Impeccable.

Erica Buist speaks to five people whose lifestyles leave them in splendid isolationWhat’s the difference between solitude and loneliness? We may confuse the two because we’ve been trained since we were young to think about them as the same state. By sending children to their rooms as punishment, we teach them the idea that aloneness is a privation. “It should be a reward,” says Sara Maitland, author of How To Be Alone. “It should be: ‘You’ve been so good that now you can go to your room to be by yourself and do anything you like!’”It’s true that social isolation is a risky business. “If you look at it epidemiologically, it’s a surprisingly powerful bad thing,” says Steve Cole, genomics researcher and professor of medicine at UCLA in California. His research found it to be a substantial risk factor influencing whether people get sick and die. “Everything seemed to eat up the body of a lonely person faster.”But loneliness is simply being alone and not liking it, says Maitland. And while over 9 million adults in Britain say they are often or always lonely, she doesn’t believe we have, as scientists say, a loneliness epidemic. “An epidemic means an infectious disease, which is inaccurate and stigmatising.” Rather, Maitland believes we are “underskilled” when it comes to being by ourselves, and that we were deprived of those skills as children. “Everybody says it is natural for the human species to be social,” she says, “yet we put enormous amounts of effort into training our children to be sociable. We tell them, ‘don’t fight, say thank you, share your toys… ’, we send them to playgroup. We’re depriving them of the skills for being alone.”There is also, says Maitland, “something weird” about a culture that encourages high self-esteem yet discourages us from spending time with the person we ought to like best. Living in a rural village 70 miles away from the nearest railway station, Maitland says people feel sorry for her because she never goes to any parties. “I don’t feel sorry for me. We should be listening to people who enjoy aloneness more, and not assume they’re mad or somehow selfish.”For some, solitude is the ultimate prize, the key to happiness. So what’s the art of being alone? I asked five people who love nothing more.Erica BuistEvery weekday morning I climb Mount Frankland to a tower at the granite peak. There are windows all around and I can see miles and miles of forested hills – on a clear day, I can see the Stirling Range 145km away. I use binoculars, or just my eyes, to spot fires during the bushfire season. When I see smoke, I plot it on the map and radio in the coordinates to the office. They then send out a spotter plane or a truck to check it out. If it’s serious, they’ll call out the water bombers.Hours can pass without seeing anyone. I live alone and when I’m not on lookout, I spend my time writing or reading. I enjoy having the freedom to dream. I feel as if I can create worlds in my mind and on paper without interruption – although the space between boredom and panic is pretty small. I make sure to mentally check in on my own thought processes so that I don’t drive myself crazy. I love interacting with people and having meaningful conversations, so sometimes I fear my social skills are suffering through lack of practice.I like to listen to classical music: it’s thinking music. Occasionally, friends or family will visit me, but unfortunately, after that climb, they don’t often come back. It’s only about 700 metres, but up steps and ladders most of the way – people are usually gasping by the time they get to the top. I would like a boyfriend, but this lifestyle doesn’t seem conducive to meeting someone special.There are tourists, but they don’t stay longer than 20 minutes. Sometimes I’ll have a chat, but if I’m feeling as if I’m a photo opportunity, I’ll hide. There are highs and lows – apparently people getting photographed with their kit off at the top of the mountain is a thing it’s a moment when I wish I wasn’t holding binoculars.But nature is my salvation. The mountain and the sea thrum with life. There is a pair of young wedgetail eagles that cruise by the tower every day. Nankeen kestrels slice through clouds of bright orange butterflies. I read the weather constantly, and I’m learning about fire and country. Birds, animals and trees are all around me.Sarah Drummond is the author of The Sound, and Salt Story: Of Sea-Dogs And FisherwomenI work under the umbrella of global health, mainly in low- and middle-income countries. In Ghana, I was assessing telemedicine before that I was in Vietnam working on hypertension. My next project is in the far north-east of Cambodia, tracking down the contacts of people with leprosy to give them antibiotics as part of an ongoing trial to see if we can eradicate it. It’s very isolating to be an expedition doctor. When I was a student, I lived in the Arctic to do the first piece of HIV research among Inuits. It’s very expensive to live there, so I put an ad in the local paper, and I ended up living in a lady’s cupboard – there was a mattress on the floor that I had to move to open the door. I soon got used to a lifestyle where I travelled alone, running on my own steam.Later, I spent 11 months in Antarctica for the Concordia mission to Mars. I was working towards understanding the psychology and physiology of sending humans to and from Mars, using the Arctic and Antarctica in winter as a space analogue environment. It was -80F sometimes, and we had three months of darkness. You watch the human mind unzip at the seams. One in 10 people who are in Antarctica over winter have a psychiatric illness.Keeping busy was really important. You need to have some creativity to keep your mind going. I do a lot of photography during the Antarctic winter that was the equivalent of art therapy. I used to wander around outside at 1am taking photographs honestly, I’ve never been more alone. But I enjoy solitude. I think I’m so happy in my own company because I was the youngest sibling by four years and I was often left to my own devices. I inherited my dad’s very social, outgoing nature, but I’ve always found that solitude deprives and stretches you in a way that makes you more creative.Sometimes you can feel more isolated around others than on your own. One of the most lonely experiences I’ve had in my work was at an Ebola treatment centre. My first day in Sierra Leone, I sat across from a woman about my own age, lying flat on a bed, taking her last breaths. As a doctor, you’re trained to think about the person in front of you more than yourself, but I was overwhelmed with sadness. I couldn’t reach out and touch her, yet she was just 2.5m away. We lost half the ward every night.The key to being alone is having things to do: a sense of a quest and a purpose. Being alone in your flat with nothing to do is probably more isolating than being in the Antarctic with nobody around for miles.If I’m photographing a tiger, I have to sit on my own, waiting and watching for it to come out of the bush. It could be half an hour, an hour, or several hours. You need a lot of patience. But I love nature, and I also love my own company. I’ve always been like that – perhaps because both my parents worked while I was growing up.When I am in the field, the day starts at about 4.30am national parks in India usually open around 6am, and I need to be the first person to enter. In some places, there’s no phone connection, so I’m totally cut off. People always ask me how I cope with spending so much time on my own, but I love it, it relaxes me. I sometimes find being around people exhausting. I recharge when I’m alone, and I feel most alive when I’m with my own thoughts – and nature.If I have time in the evenings, I read – it gets my mind ready to work again. Thinking of new places I can visit or shoot keeps my brain active. I think it’s important to have time away from people and TV and the internet. I never get bored – there’s always books, or my own photographs to check.From October to March I have a very tight schedule. I might get one week in town with family – although after just two weeks with them all I start to miss my birds and the forest, become restless and want to go out to shoot.When I am in town, I have to go through the news to catch up, because when I’m in the field I have no idea what’s going on in the world.  Sometimes it’s been days without talking to anyone at all, though if I have a phone connection I like to call my mother and my husband. If I can hear their voices then I don’t get too homesick. The longest I’ve gone without talking to them is 10 days. That was really hard.I’ve had so many memorable moments. Once while shooting tigers I came across three cubs. It was the first time I had seen cubs in the same place together without their mother. So I spent half an hour with them and really felt a connection. Once, in Tanzania, in the Serengeti national park, I saw more than 17 lions sleeping like babies in a tree. It was beyond amazing. I say I enjoy solitude, but honestly, I never feel truly alone: I’m with nature. I spend most of my days driving across Europe by myself in my lorry. I do 11 nights away in a row, and then three nights at home. When I’m driving, I think about family and what I’m planning for my days off, but I mostly think about the job where I’m going next. Your concentration’s taken up by driving you can’t let it slip.I work for P\u0026ampC Hamilton, a company based in south-west Scotland. We do European and UK temperature-controlled transport. I carry anything from hanging meat to cleaning products, and work all over Scotland, the UK, France, Belgium, Holland, Switzerland and Germany.I come from a farming background, which is a lonely job as well – you rarely see people. So I’m used to being alone, it’s never bothered me.In the lorry you can only work for six days, and then you have to have at least 24 hours off. On my breaks I park up at a truck stop or services somewhere, go for a meal at a hotel or a pub and watch the sport, and have my evenings with a tablet I can download TV programmes on to. I try to keep fit by getting a walk in every night, because you don’t get a lot of exercise otherwise, but that’s harder to do in the winter.I spend my three free days with my kids: three boys who are 10, eight and four. I also do a bit of DIY like everyone does with their days off, and I try to get a few pints in the local pub if I can – but mainly I spend it with my family. My wife doesn’t seem to mind my work, she’s got used to it. I do at least a phone call a day. I miss my children when I’m away, especially after I’ve been home. The first two nights away are particularly hard.But I do enjoy my work life. I like driving. I’d probably prefer to have a driving job that got me home at night, but then the money isn’t as good. I wouldn’t say I’m an introvert, I’m pretty sociable, but there are maybe two or three days throughout the fortnight when I just don’t speak to anybody. I don’t mind that. If I want a chat, I can speak to other drivers when delivering and dropping off. There aren’t many quiet spells when you get two or three drivers together.I’ve been doing this job for nine months, and at the minute I’d say I’d like to do this for the rest of my life. I’d like to have my own lorry at some point, if funds allow and I can find the work. I look forward to my phone calls and being home, but I’ve just got totally used to being alone. I don’t really feel lonely, except when I miss my kids – but I know I’ll soon be home, so I just look forward to that.For 25 years, I was the sole employee on San Miguel Island, the westernmost of the Channel Islands. My position was law enforcement – we get a little trouble with drug smuggling, but mostly people would hunt for relics. There are archaeological sites that are close to 13,000 years old and there’s a lot of exposed prehistoric archaeology. I was there to educate and discourage people from taking things that can’t be replaced. Every day was different, which is probably why I stayed at it for so long.The National Park Service has mandatory retirement at 57 in law enforcement. My 57th birthday was a few weeks ago, and they were gracious enough to let me stay in another capacity. I’m now a safety specialist. I’ve got an office cubicle and a desk. It’s a very different environment.San Miguel is about as remote as you can get here the mainland is about 25 miles away. I’d fly out on a Tuesday, weather permitting, any other staff would fly back on the plane that dropped me off, and I’d work by myself for a week. Some weeks I never saw another human being, or even a boat close to shore. I’m not sure I ever felt I had to “cope” – solitude is just a part of being on an island. You accept it. The farther west you go, the rougher the weather gets, and that contributed to the isolation. There were many days and weeks when the weather was never good enough for any boats or planes to make it out there, so you could be pretty far removed from civilisation a lot of the time. Nature set the terms.I never felt completely cut off from other people – even though I was physically cut off, we were still working together on projects and logistics, talking via radio. We could call in the morning and they would check up on us later and make sure we were still alive. When my wife and I were first dating we had amateur radio licences and would talk in the evenings – it was a party line so everybody else was in on the conversation, but that was the only way we could keep in touch. Over the years, we got internet connections so we had email, which made it easier. I met my wife when I was already working on the island, so being away for a week at a time is the only life we knew. Coming home after being away made us appreciate being together even more.If I had spare time it was great for reading, or playing music, or just taking a walk and enjoying the view. I felt the solitude was a real privilege. It’s really hard to truly experience that in the modern world.• Commenting on this piece?

Instead, she can recall every second: the moment she threw herself into her father’s arms, before clinging to her mother and, in a gesture of disbelief and gratitude, raising an arm to the heavens.The reason everything is still so clear 12 years on is because the reunion took place on television, and she has rewatched it many times. “I thought in that moment I’d died,” Clemantine says. “You hear about how you’re united with the people you love in heaven, and I thought, this must be heaven. I was so happy, but I was also scared: had I died?”It was 2006, and Clemantine and her sister, Claire, thought they were being invited to appear on the Oprah Winfrey show to discuss their experiences of the Rwandan genocide. But, unbeknown to the sisters, the show’s producers had flown their family in from Africa. The last time they had seen their parents was in 1994, but although they knew they were alive, they had been able to speak only by phone and had no idea when they would be able to meet they had also missed the birth of a new brother and sister, then aged eight and five.They’d had, Clemantine says, an idyllic childhood, growing up in the Rwandan capital, Kigali: her father ran a taxi business and her mother’s life centred on the family garden, where they grew mangoes, lemons and papayas alongside hibiscus, geraniums and peonies. The family were Tutsis, although that didn’t seem significant until the slaughter began.For Clemantine, the first sign of trouble was when her parents started to talk in whispers. Neighbours were disappearing, and there were loud, ugly sounds in the air that her brother Pudi said were thunder (Pudi survived the genocide, but died of meningitis before the reunion). One day, her mother told Clemantine, then six, and Claire, 15, to pack because she was sending them to their grandmother’s farm a few hours south. Her parents had hoped they’d be safe there, but a few days later there was a knock at the door and her grandmother told the girls to run. They ran her grandmother, cousins, aunts and uncles were killed.The only thing Clemantine managed to take with her was a rainbow towel. “I held on to it. Claire and I lived on fruit. Days were for hiding, nights were for walking. Suddenly, we were refugees.”They remained refugees for the next six years, wandering through seven African countries. Clemantine’s book, published this week, details the highs and lows of that extraordinary journey: the refugee camps, foraging for food, the illnesses and unexpected kindnesses that taught them how to hold on to hope. Finally, when Clemantine was 12, she and Claire were given asylum in the US – She went to live with a family in Chicago and Claire, who by then had children of her own, lived nearby.In those early years in the US, Claire had a cleaning job, and Clemantine often helped her out. “We didn’t have a TV, but we discovered Oprah by watching it where we were working. We’d always make sure we were cleaning the sitting room at 4pm so we could catch her show. Claire used to say, ‘We’ll meet her one day, I just know we will.’”Clemantine entered a high school essay-writing competition, organised by Oprah’s show, about Night, Elie Wiesel’s book about the Holocaust, and why it was still relevant. She wrote about her experiences in Rwanda, which led her to Oprah. When the sisters were invited on, they could hardly contain their excitement. “They put us up in a hotel, and we thought, ‘This is insane: we’re going to meet Oprah!’ We spent hours getting ready.”Clemantine and Claire were in the audience when, midway through the recording, Oprah spoke to them from the stage. She asked Clemantine how long it had been since she and Claire had seen their parents, then she held up an envelope and said she had a letter from them. “She called us on to the stage,” Clemantine says. “Claire was holding on to me, she was shaking. Oprah handed me the letter and I began to open it, but then Oprah put her hand on mine. She said: ‘You don’t have to read it right now, in front of all these people, because… your family is here! We have flown your family here.’”Clemantine couldn’t believe what she was hearing. “I’d been praying and hoping for so long that I’d see my family – it was the constant thought in my mind. I remember when we were in South Africa, there was a man who looked exactly like my dad and I used to wait for him on the street when I knew he’d be passing, just so I could see him.”Now, with no warning , she was being swept up into her father’s arms, hugging her mother, cuddling her siblings. “Everyone was crying: everyone in the audience, all the crew. Everywhere you looked, there was someone with tears running down their face. They had to have a 30-minute break, just to give people time to recover, before they went back to recording the show.”In her book, Clemantine recalls how, after the show, the family were driven by limo across the city to Claire’s apartment. “Nobody talked in the car. In the apartment, nobody knew what to do, either. My mother, in her long blue dress, kept sitting down and standing up and touching everything. My father kept smiling, as if someone he mistrusted was taking pictures of him. Claire remained nearly catatonic: rocking, stone-faced.”Over the next couple of days, they went sightseeing in the botanic garden and for a ride on a ferris wheel, and then, on Monday morning, Clemantine’s parents and her siblings flew back to Rwanda. Clemantine went back to school.Today, Clemantine’s family have all moved to the US. They live in Chicago, and she lives in San Francisco. Now 30, she works as a human rights advocate. But the years of separation, she says, have left deep scars. “Claire and I are different people, and it’s hard to connect with our parents, because so much was taken away from us. When we’re together, we don’t really know where to begin it’s difficult even to have a conversation.” She devoted her studies to researching the effects of family separation she’s fascinated, she says, by how people are affected by loss, and what can and can’t be recovered after a family is ruptured.For her part, Oprah described the onscreen reunion as “one of the deepest, most joyful moments I’ve ever experienced”, calling it “beautiful… raw, raw, raw… pure”. What, though, does Clemantine make of it, 12 years later: was it right, or fair, that she and Claire were put through such a pivotal, emotional experience with no warning, and in front of millions? “You know, when people watch that clip they always feel something. Some feel joy, some feel sadness, some feel confusion, some feel anger. But for everyone it’s a trigger-point for something, and what I think it does, more than anything, is underline the power of our stories and the power of sharing our stories. Everywhere I go in the world, people have watched that moment and know what happened. I met someone from Australia who told me that clip had changed her life. So whatever anyone feels about it, it’s testament to the power of the human story and the power of reunion. I feel happy about that.”Commenting on this piece?

It’s hard enough to cope with without beating yourself up more.Seek out other people who know what you’re going through. It can take a long time to give up hope of becoming a biological parent, but with that can come real grief, which is often unrecognised by others. Look for involuntarily childless people online or via local groups. It’s a huge help having others who understand how it feels to be “the last one standing” among your mates.Ignore anyone who tells you to relax and it will magically happen. Parenthood is not the only way to have a fulfilling and meaningful life. Putting all your focus on becoming a parent can make you lose sight of the other great aspects of your life, so make a point of enjoying those things, especially the ones that are easier for people without the responsibilities of parenthood.Don’t fall prey to grief tourism, which can come from strangers as well as those close to you. Some people are simply too nosy, demanding details in the guise of caring. When pressed too far on the children issue, say, “I just can’t talk about it”, and hope they feel embarrassed enough to back off.The relationships you have with godchildren, nieces and nephews, and friends’ children can be very special and even healing.

She hates the idea of it, and the colour, and the way it gurgles when you plug it in.“It’s the quietest one they make,” I say.“I’m sorry, but I can’t have that thing in here,” my wife says.“I didn’t buy it for you,” I say.The only member of our household who hates the cat fountain more than my wife does is the cat: it walks a wide, cautious circle around it on its way to the catflap and out to the door of my office shed.“Miaow,” the cat says.I know what this means. It means: turn on the kitchen tap so I can drink from it.“Can I just direct your attention to the new system?” I say to the cat. “You may have noticed an intriguing device on your…”“Miaow,” the cat says.“I understand that,” I reply, “but it’s up to all of us to give this new system a chance, because 30 quid is a lot of…”“Miaow,” the cat says.I get up, go into the kitchen and turn on the tap.Even as my wife disparages the cat fountain, she remains inordinately enthusiastic about the expensive rocks I bought to put in the dog’s water bowl to stop its pee burning brown holes into the lawn. I, on the other hand, feel so foolish about this purchase that I hate being reminded of it.“I think your rocks are really working,” she says.“Of course they aren’t,” I say. “How could they possibly work?”“I’ve noticed a real improvement,” my wife says.“Anything that could actually purify dog piss would also kill the dog,” I say.Maybe this is what I’d secretly hoped the rocks would do then I could have blamed the man at the garden centre for letting me buy them.Two days later, I find the cat fountain unplugged on the back step, slowly filling with rain. Even as I take it back inside the house, I realise that I’m going to lose this battle. I plug in the fountain and return to my desk. A squirrel pauses by the little window above my computer screen to give me a hard stare. Perhaps I erected my shed on top of his buried nuts.Midweek, the weather suddenly turns warm and the tortoise emerges from his winter hiding place under the oven. After sitting in a square of sunlight on the kitchen floor for a few minutes, he slowly makes his way to the back door, levers his weight over the threshold, tips down the steps and plonks himself in the middle of the lawn, where he contentedly crops the grass. Then, when I have stopped watching, he turns west and devours an entire bed of annuals.“I’m not having my garden wrecked,” my wife says, locking the tortoise in the sitting room. “I’ve ordered a cage.”“You can’t cage his spirit,” I say.“Watch me,” she says.On Saturday morning, I try to enjoy the good weather by reading the paper on a lawn chair, but the tortoise is looking at me, his head poked between the bars of his new rabbit run.“He’s furious,” I say.“I don’t care,” says my wife, who is busy replanting annuals.I make a brief attempt to entertain the bright side – where there is cage, I think, there is also lawn the dog can’t piss on – but then I look down again. It’s easy to read too much into a tortoise’s expression, but there does seem to be a bottomless resentment in his eyes, as cold and still as one of the Elgin marbles, and conveying the same demand: send me back to Greece where I belong.On Monday morning, a spring chill returns to the air. As I walk out to my shed, I catch the cat lapping rainwater from the folds of a bin liner – a bin liner that may well contain a cat fountain.The cat spots me and stops.“Well, well,” I say.“Miaow,” the cat says.“I thought you were some kind of hygiene freak,” I say, “yet here you are, licking water off rubbish.”“Miaow,” the cat says.“I’ll write about whatever I please,” I say."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e891967e2c8f074f05b4caa3683ba329c02001f/98_340_5388_3233/master/5388.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7ffa0cdb1c4e38103de2efbb469b8cb","title":"yotam ottolenghi tray bake recipes","story":"Let the oven do the hard work, then sit down to a butternut squash bake, a cheesy gratin or some saucy roast vegI’ve been making lots of tray bakes recently. I am not sure I like the term – 1970s convenience food springs to mind – but I love what it stands for: the idea that, after doing the prep, you can sit down with a cuppa or a glass of wine and relax for an hour or two while your meal more or less cooks itself. And, unlike a stew, which offers the cook a similar break, a bake retains much of the freshness and integrity of its components, particularly vegetables.This ‘cake’ was a revelation to me: who would have thought you could cook pasta for two hours and end up with something fresh, super-comforting and full of texture? Serve hot for lunch or dinner, or leave to cool, cut into wedges and have it as a portable cold lunch for work, school or as part of a picnic spread. Bear in mind that the chilli heat really comes through, so leave it out if you want to make this more child-friendly.250g fresh egg lasagne sheets, torn into large pieces½ butternut squash, (400g net weight) peeled, deseeded and cut into very thin, 2-3mm-thick slices (use a mandoline, ideally) 50g parmesan, grated3 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed65g pine nuts, toasted35g basil leaves, roughly torn1½ tbsp fresh thyme leaves¼ tsp freshly grated nutmeg¾ tsp dried chilli flakes 1 egg2 large plum tomatoes (220g net weight), coarsely grated and skins discarded 150g baby spinach3 tbsp olive oil200g ricotta200g feta, crumbled into 1-2cm piecesSalt and black pepper2 tsp parsley leaves, chopped Heat the oven to 170C335Fgas 3½. Line the base and sides of a 22cm cake tin with baking paper.Put the first 12 ingredients in a large bowl with two tablespoons of olive oil, three-quarters of the ricotta and feta, a teaspoon and a quarter of salt, 50ml cold water and plenty of pepper, and stir to combine.Tip the pumpkin mix into the cake tin, pressing it down firmly to flatten, then top with the remaining ricotta and feta, and cover securely with foil. Bake for an hour and a half, then discard the foil, drizzle over the remaining tablespoon of oil and bake for another half-hour, until the top is crisp and browned. Leave to cool for 30 minutes, then remove from the cake tin, sprinkle with parsley and serve.Slow-roasting transforms garlic into a sweet and sticky version of itself, which, when combined with pungent, raw garlic, gives a dish a real umami kick.

Take out two garlic cloves from the head of garlic, then drizzle the rest of the bulb with a teaspoon of oil and sprinkle with a little salt and pepper. Wrap tightly in foil and roast for 40 minutes, until the cloves are soft and golden brown. Remove the foil and, when cool enough to handle, squeeze out the cloves and discard the papery skins.While the garlic is roasting, prepare the rest of the vegetables. Combine the potatoes, shallots and paprika in a bowl with two tablespoons of oil, half a teaspoon of salt and plenty of pepper. Toss the cabbage leaves in a tablespoon of oil, a quarter-teaspoon of salt and lots of pepper. Roughly crush the two reserved cloves of raw garlic and mix with all the herbs, the spring onions, lemon zest and the cooked garlic. Set aside a quarter of the herb mixture – you’ll use it later as a garnish.Arrange a third of the cabbage leaves over the base of a 20cm x 30cm, high-sided baking dish. Cover with half the potato and shallot mixture, top that with a third of the herb mixture, then dot half the ricotta and gruyère over the herbs. Repeat these four layers again, then top everything with a final layer of cabbage and the last of the herb mixture.Combine the stock, lemon juice and a quarter-teaspoon of salt and pour evenly over the bake, lifting up some of the cabbage leaves so the liquid sinks down. Cover tightly with foil and bake for an hour and 10 minutes, until the cabbage and potatoes are soft and cooked through. Remove the foil, drizzle over the remaining tablespoon of oil and bake, uncovered, for 10 minutes more, until the cabbage begins to crisp up and turn golden brown. Remove from the oven, leave to cool for 10 minutes, then finish with the reserved herbs and serve.This would go really well with rice or some other grain.

We’re devastated to be walking away from the jobs we love but we’ve been left with no choice.”An overwhelming majority of staff belonging to the NUJ and Bectu, which represents technical staff, have now voted to back industrial action in an attempt to force concessions from management. Al-Jazeera English is based in Doha but has about 130 staff in London, whose responsibilities include producing the news channel’s output between 4pm and 10.30pm GMT. These programmes are likely to be affected by the strike action. Union officials said they expect a substantial proportion of London-based al-Jazeera English staff to take part in the walkout, including on-air presenters, programme editors, field producers, reporters, camera operators and studio technical staff. After the strike, union members have pledged to adopt a policy of work-to-rule, including refusing to answer phone calls or emails outside of working hours and taking allotted breaks.“Journalists don’t take lunch breaks,” said Ging. “We’ll be taking lunch breaks.” Union officials said they remain open to resuming meaningful negotiations at any point and will consider suspending strike action if they believe there is a chance of achieving progress on a pay deal.Al-Jazeera did not respond to a request for comment.The news channel’s influential Arab-language sister station is at the centre of a dispute between Qatar and other Arab states including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain.

He had come to meet my flight from Heathrow and couldn’t remember where he had parked. The small white Peugeot, a hire car borrowed from his mother, was identical to dozens of others lined up in front of the terminal.It was May 2017, and Malta was days away from going to the polls in a snap general election called by the prime minister, Joseph Muscat. His administration was at the centre of a growing corruption scandal.On her blog, Running Commentary, Matthew’s mother had published a series of devastating revelations about the prime minister’s closest political allies. But voters appeared to be ready to return him to power. The hope was that coverage by the  and other newspapers outside Malta might shift public opinion.Back then, the family had been desperate to bring events at home to international media attention. Now, tragically, they have it. On 16 October 2017, Daphne Caruana Galizia was killed when a bomb placed under the driver’s seat of her hire car was detonated just outside her village home.Her assassination shocked Europe. Six months on, 45 reporters from 15 countries have come together to continue her investigations. The Daphne Project is the first to be led by Forbidden Stories, a newly formed organisation based in Paris, which hopes to deter attacks on journalists by taking up the stories of those who have been silenced through imprisonment, harassment and violence.The work began last November. ’s Rome correspondent, Stephanie Kirchgaessner, had been in touch with Matthew. He was in the UK with his two younger brothers and maternal aunt, Corinne Vella. The family had been warned they were at risk of further violence, and had come to an out-of-the-way country house for security training. Back home in the village of Bidnija in northern Malta, their father was under 24-hour police guard.Kirchgaessner suggested driving out to meet them. Sitting around a table in an oak-panelled room, we talked into the night about the material Caruana Galizia had been working on when she died, and discussed their theories about who could have ordered the attack. I was struck by the strong bond between them, and their determination to secure not only justice for their mother, but proper investigations into the activities of politicians she had exposed.A few weeks later we met again, at the ’s offices. This time, we were joined by Jules Giraudat, a young documentary film maker from Forbidden Stories, and Stephen Grey, an investigative reporter at Reuters.We agreed to join forces, and discussed which other partners to bring in. The template was already there: the  had established close working relationships with newspapers and broadcasters around Europe thanks to previous collaborations, most recently the Paradise Papers, organised by the ICIJ in Washington.This time, the sharing would be even more radical. Long-established rivalries had to be set aside so that competing organisations within the same country could work together: the  and Reuters in London, Die Zeit and Süddeutsche Zeitung in Germany. In this fight to defend press freedom, our collaboration could in itself send a powerful message.The group, by now joined by news organisations from Italy, Germany, France, Switzerland and the US, gathered in Paris in January.We set a joint publication date. The Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, based in Sarajevo, agreed to host the platforms we would need to access documents, interviews, films and photographs.Information was relayed to the Caruana Galizia family, and their contacts, both inside Malta and further afield, proved invaluable.As publication day approached, we wrote jointly with questions for our main subjects, from the Maltese prime minister down, and shared their responses. Such collaborations can be a burden on those at the receiving end of letters from multiple news organisations, so it seemed reasonable to combine our queries.In some cases, those we were writing about chose to communicate only through their lawyers. This has become an all-too-familiar tactic, particularly in the UK. Our colleagues in France, Germany and Italy benefit from much stronger protections, and are often surprised by the use of legal threats to try and deter British journalists from writing public-interest stories.The project was a big financial commitment for the . Kirchgaessner and I worked for five months to research not only Daphne’s killing, and the subsequent police investigation, but to expose how Malta is selling its services as a backdoor into Europe for money from high-risk jurisdictions including Russia, Azerbaijan and China.Our head of investigations, Nick Hopkins, spent hours editing and redrafting the articles. The video producers Irene Baqué and Laurence Topham spent days creating two brilliant films, retelling Caruana Galizia’s story and the events that led to her death.On the evening of Tuesday 17 October, six months and one day after the bombing, The Daphne Project launched. In the days that followed, the investigations reporter David Pegg pitched in, as well as the Brussels correspondents Jennifer Rankin and Daniel Boffey, and Dan Sabbagh, a Westminster-based editor, monitored the political reaction.In perhaps the most significant development so far, a special rapporteur has now been appointed by the Council of Europe to scrutinise the murder investigation. Malta is the first EU member state to be subjected to this measure.The impact I am most proud of is more personal. Last week, Matthew came with his father, Peter Caruana Galizia, to speak at our morning news conference. In his hand was a copy of the , with Daphne’s photograph on the front page. For the first time since her death, Matthew said, he felt as though his mother had been returned to him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c09116fef4088a9bbda33b93015ed37786720df0/57_0_3941_2365/master/3941.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12e84c4a147f497b158d34b8b8442d6f","title":"polling station voter id plans are deeply flawed say critics","story":"Electoral Reform Society says plans are ‘calculated effort by the government to make voting harder for some citizens’Plans requiring voters to prove their identity before casting their ballot are “deeply flawed”, the Electoral Reform Society (ERS) has said. The group said it appeared the plans were a “calculated effort by the government to make voting harder for some citizens”. Pilot schemes will be in place at five councils in the local elections in England on 3 May: Bromley, Gosport, Swindon, Watford and Woking. The ERS said personification fraud – where someone votes while pretending to be someone else – is “incredibly rare” and the introduction of mandatory voter ID “poses more problems than solutions”. The ERS chief executive, Darren Hughes, said: “It’s hard not to see this as a calculated effort by the government to make voting harder for some citizens. “As such it’s vital we think about the risks these changes pose to a free and fair franchise in the UK. We need policy based on hard facts – not rumour and innuendo. “With millions of people lacking the right photographic ID – and no government plans for a universal, free alternative – this can only mean another barrier for honest voters. “The government knows this, which makes this policy all the more concerning.” The ERS is part of a coalition of charities and campaign groups opposed to the change including Age UK, Stonewall, Liberty and the Salvation Army. The intervention comes after a leaked letter from the Equality and Human Rights Commission said the change could have a “disproportionate impact” on voters from minority groups. Hughes said: “These deeply flawed trials must not be a fait accompli for the government’s plan to roll out an ill-thought policy. “Mandatory voter ID is a sledgehammer to crack a nut. It’s time for an evidence-based approach instead.” In the Commons on Monday, Cabinet Office minister Chloe Smith defended the plans and said no one would need to buy new ID documents to be able to vote. She told MPs: “We already ask that people prove who they are in order to claim benefits, to rent a car or even to collect a parcel from the Post Office, so this is a proportionate and reasonable approach. “Democracy is precious and it is right to take that more robust approach to protect the integrity of the electoral process.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67aca18b3aac9107f6797c53d129b9943a7fa1a6/0_110_3250_1951/master/3250.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=810647ee5c07076825d853b8e624607f","title":"more than 120 homeopaths trying to cure autism in uk","story":"Exclusive: the ‘cure’ involves detoxing children of vaccines and antibiotics held responsible for the conditionMore than 120 homeopaths in the UK are offering a “cure” for autism that involves supposedly detoxing children of the vaccines and antibiotics held responsible for the condition, the  has learned.The homeopaths are accredited practitioners of CEASE “therapy”, which stands for Complete Elimination of Autistic Spectrum Expression. CEASE was invented by a Dutch doctor called Tinus Smits, who died of cancer in 2010. His book and website, which lists therapists around the world, describe a method of ridding children of toxins – predominantly vaccines and medication – that are said to cause autism. It involves homeopathic remedies and high doses of vitamin C in excess of those recommended by national guidelines.Diarrhoea, which could be a result of excessive vitamin C, and fever in children should not necessarily be cause for concern, say CEASE therapists, because it is the child’s body purging itself of toxins.“It’s absolutely appalling,” said Carol Povey, director of the centre for autism at the National Autistic Society (NAS), which helps develop best practice. “As healthcare practitioners, homeopaths should still be working on evidence-based practice and looking at national guidelines.”The NAS is concerned by the suggestion that autism, a developmental disorder, could be cured. It is also disturbed by the claim that autism is linked to vaccines, as proposed by Andrew Wakefield – a theory that has been comprehensively discredited. Wakefield, a former gastroenterologist, was struck off the medical register over his claims.Homeopathic cures, like other bogus therapies on the internet, “hoodwink new parents when they are vulnerable” and can cause harm, said Povey.A minority of CEASE therapists in the UK are members of the Society of Homeopaths. Its regulatory body, the Professional Standards Authority (PSA), has said the Society of Homeopaths must state by the middle of next month what action it will take to ensure children are safe as a condition of its re-accreditation.The PSA told the Society of Homeopaths that “CEASE therapy contravenes medical advice by apparently advising against vaccination of children, avoiding antibiotics in the case of infection and advocates high doses of vitamins not recommended for children. We are also concerned that the full name of CEASE (Complete Elimination of Autistic Spectrum Expression) strongly implies the ability to cure autism through this therapy,” it said in a statement.While the society had responded that its members “should not be practising the aspects of CEASE that defy medical advice”, this was not clear on its website, said the PSA.Mark Taylor, chief executive of the Society of Homeopaths, said it was looking into how many of its members practised CEASE therapy and whether they complied with advice on respecting medical evidence. “We are looking at the advice we will offer over the next few weeks so there is nothing more to say at the moment,” he told the .Many other homeopaths who are also CEASE therapists are not members of the society. The PSA urges the public to choose only those on its accredited register.Jennifer Hautman, a homeopath who is not a Society of Homeopaths member, says she has used CEASE therapy if parents have requested it. Smits’s book, she says, is written for lay people, who then look for a therapist. “I would never promise to cure anything. I do think autism can be treated. It can be improved,” she said. Children often had gut disorders, she said, adding: “I’m not a gut specialist. That’s what Andrew Wakefield was working on. She claimed: “There are a lot of scientists finding similar results to his.”While the causes of autistic spectrum disorder are unclear, she says on her website that “ASD is often linked to vaccine damage” and asks parents to fill in a questionnaire “if you feel you or your children have been damaged by vaccines”.Asked about the CEASE theory that fever and diarrhoea help expel toxins, she said: “Generally speaking in homeopathy, discharge can be a good thing. If you have infected wounds, you want the pus to come out. If you have diarrhoea you want it to come out rather than be constipated.” A child must not be allowed to become dehydrated, however.Smits, the creator of CEASE therapy, wrote in his book that “all kinds of detoxification reactions may occur” as a result of the treatment. Most common is fever, he said, which “should not be treated with medication, as it is a healthy reaction of the organism and not a disease! ... Eliminations like diarrhea, flu, expectoration, and bad-smelling and cloudy urine should also be left alone, because they are a part of the healing process.”One child he treated had diarrhoea that “relieved his system so much that his autism almost disappeared instantly”. After 10 days, however, his mother was so concerned that she took him to the doctor, who gave him immodium to stop the diarrhoea. “Almost immediately the child had a setback and became autistic as before. The diarrhea was a perfect detoxification for his bowels and brain. Neither the doctor not the mother understood this, and the medication interfered with the progress of the cure,” claimed Smits.Ursula Kraus-Harper, a member of the Society of Homeopaths, told the  she has used CEASE therapy since attending a seminar with Smits in 2010 but that she uses it in conjunction with classical homeopathy. Children started improving after a certain set of detoxes, she said. She did not believe homeopathy was a cure, however.She said she was not against vaccination, but said “vaccines can be a problem and so can medical drugs. That is more and more accepted by everybody who is not blinded by drug-driven medicine.” She denied CEASE put children at risk. “Tell me of one child, one person that has died from high doses of vitamin C,” she said. “When the body has had too much of it, it will produce diarrhoea then you lower the dose and the diarrhoea will stop.”The Labour MP Barry Sheerman, who chaired the cross-party Westminster Commission on Autism, condemned the claims of CEASE therapists to cure the disorder. “There is support and much we can do but there are no cures and if someone says so, show me the evidence,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75d89b7fcd6d486e02766bb787f3db19528be593/0_93_3100_1860/master/3100.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=212449e47de83db7e0527a1c583e3fc6","title":"elliot daly wasps england lions rugby union interview","story":"By this stage of a post-Lions season there are usually only two sorts of professional rugby players: the ones already lying in a knackered heap and those about to join them. Rare to the point of invisibility are Englishmen who trekked all the way around New Zealand last summer, finished fifth in the recent Six Nations and still have a glint in their eye. Elliot Daly is either a brilliant actor or a serious glutton for punishment.Nor will there be much respite in the next two months. First there is the challenge of banishing the question marks hovering over Wasps and atoning for last year’s Premiership final disappointment against Exeter. Then there is England’s tour to South Africa which Daly, far from sidestepping, is massively keen to be involved in. Given he is also poised to open a cafe in Leamington Spa – complete with baristas tutored by the UK’s five-time latte art champion – the beachside hammock will have to wait.Nail all those goals successfully and the 25-year-old really will have had a special 12 months. Without his long-range kicking and all-round assurance on the wing, the Lions might not have earned their famous series draw against the All Blacks. In his last four Tests for England he has contributed five tries. As a cricketer talented enough to have represented England at under-15 level, he is the nearest thing British sport possesses to a modern-day Wilson of the Wizard.All of which raises a question: how much more influential could he be if he saw the ball more often? England have generally employed Daly in a roving wing role but he initially broke into the national side as an outside-centre and reckons he could also prosper – “There’s more space and you get the ball a bit earlier than you do on the wing” – at full-back. With Bath’s Jonathan Joseph and Anthony Watson both set to miss the South African tour through injury and Manu Tuilagi’s participation still up in the air, the odds on the Croydon-born flier wearing either 13 or 15 in June must be shortening.How fortunate, then, that the multitalented all-rounder – in his cricket days he used to bowl right-arm quick despite being left-footed and writing left-handed – feels fresher than many of his contemporaries. Injuries, most recently an open finger dislocation which pierced the skin, have allowed him to recharge slightly and rediscover the zest for life currently eluding one of two of his weary colleagues.“You’re still training and trying to get fit but a couple of little niggles does allow you time to get yourself right and get back to firing on all cylinders. I’m ready and raring to go for whatever the end of season holds for us.”Daly, in short, is no poster boy for those insisting future Lions tours from 2021 onwards must be trimmed from 10 to eight games to safeguard player welfare. “I really enjoyed the Lions tour. The length of it wasn’t an issue for me personally. I was involved in eight of the 10 games having played in the Premiership final the weekend before departure. For me it was quite good to keep focused on rugby.”He is smart enough, nevertheless, to sense that even his buzzing energy levels will be impossible to sustain if the switching of summer Tests from June to July from 2020 is not satisfactorily dovetailed with the domestic fixture list. “I don’t think you can play more. We’re kind of playing all year round at the moment. It just needs to be clear because then we can plan for the future.”Even his new caffeine-oriented sideline, it seems, is not going to ert Daly from his primary addiction. One day he fancies playing abroad, possibly in Super Rugby – “I would like to try and play in that kind of rugby but it would have to be at the right time” – but given he signed a new Wasps contract only last September it really would require a major implosion for him to abandon the team he has represented since he was a schoolboy. For all the current frustration caused by Wasps’ continuing lack of a permanent training base, the players’ desire for silverware remains undimmed. As Daly puts it: “This is where we said we wanted to be at the start of the season: in the top four chasing a semi-final.”A free-flowing home victory over the Saints on Sunday would also honour the clutch of established players – James Haskell, Danny Cipriani, Guy Thompson and Sam Jones – bidding farewell to the club this season. “There are a lot of characters leaving so giving them as good a send-off as possible is a big one for us,” says Daly.What will he miss most about Haskell? “It’s a constant case of: ‘He’s not going to say that, is he? Oh, he’s just said it.’ He just doesn’t have an off-button. He says exactly what he thinks but says it with a smile. He’ll be a big loss for the squad.”And Cipriani? At their best, Wasps attack with more thrilling verve than any other side in the country, with Daly’s acceleration complementing his fly-half’s rare vision. “The mindset he brings to attack is something we’ll keep when he leaves,” says Daly. “He’s very gifted in what he does and he knows what he wants to do to defenders. It’s definitely been helpful for me.”Another of his fleet-footed partners in crime, the quicksilver Willie le Roux, could soon be among the opposition when England fly south in June for a three-Test examination of their stamina and recently shaken confidence.Daly is one of many who sense a Springbok side licking their lips at the prospect of piling into their visitors on home soil. “I reckon they’re going to be a handful in the summer,” he says.On the flip side, with two Tests being staged at altitude, his bazooka of a left boot could do the Boks plenty of damage from distance. Assuming Eddie Jones’s side can shake off their Six Nations torpor, the trip would also help erase the memory of his only previous tour to South Africa with England Under-18s.“We lost 2-1 in a best-of-three series which was very annoying. I think we had a kick to win it at the end and missed.” If anyone can help England and Wasps finish their endless winter in style, it is the inexhaustible Daly.Elliot Daly was speaking on behalf of Land Rover, main club partner of Wasps.

The protagonists, who must now include Red Bull alongside Ferrari and Mercedes, will doubtless want to keep it clean on Sunday but none can afford to give any quarter at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix.For Hamilton and Mercedes this is a vital race and one they will want to win clinically without a slugging match. They have not won this season and Hamilton trails Vettel by nine points but this is the first grand prix where power can be decisive. This has been a key Mercedes strength but it will also be another technical examination of their car. They have struggled to find the correct tyre temperature operating window and qualifying will be indicative of whether they are nearer to discovering the solution.Hamilton has struggled, particularly over the single lap where he has been beaten in two of three races by his team-mate Valtteri Bottas.“We believe the car is sound,” Hamilton said. “That’s not the biggest issue – tyres is something we are still learning about. One weekend we’ve got it, the next we haven’t. If we get on top of tyres we can show the true performance.”The team’s technical director, James Allison, also acknowledged their target. “We have not always got it right in qualifying – to make the tyre wake up and play on the single lap – that’s our job to do,” he said.The Mercedes does not appear to run as well in turbulent air as the Ferrari and claiming front-row spots is the simplest way of addressing it. With temperatures expected to drop as the weekend progresses, it will represent a major step forward if they can find the sweet spot.Ferrari show every indication of having a stable platform on which to build. They secured two front-row lockouts in Bahrain and China and Vettel has two wins. Their car is finding the operating window more easily and there is a quiet, calm confidence in the team.“We know we’ve built a good car,” Vettel said. “We know we have a lot of potential to make it faster and that’s what we are working on. It depends on a lot of things, conditions, tyres, track. We have three cars that are a match, and whoever does the best job bringing all these little things and details together is up front.”The triumvirate is completed by Red Bull and their charge is being led by Daniel Ricciardo. The Australian won in Baku last year and drove magnificently to take the third race of the season in China. He was quickest in second practice on Friday and only three-hundredths down on Bottas in the first session.Hamilton and Vettel could not put in clean quick runs and were fifth and 11th respectively in the afternoon. Max Verstappen crashed early in the first session but recovered to be only 0.116sec slower than his team-mate, Ricciardo.Red Bull struggled on the straights but looked to be making great time through the tight second sector and did not share Mercedes’ problems with the tyres. Their car appears to be going from strength to strength.Mercedes are far from panicking. In China they would have expected Bottas to win if not for the intervention of the safety car but Hamilton recognised that, while the fight may be fair in Baku this year, no one is going to find it easy.“We have Red Bull close to their best and Ferrari at their best,” he said. “If we can pull through and deliver, it will be the biggest achievement this team have accomplished.”Jenson Button, Hamilton’s former McLaren team-mate and the 2009 world champion, will race in the Le Mans 24 Hours in June. Button will drive for the Russian SMP team in the top LMP1 class. Fernando Alonso will drive for Toyota.“It’s always been a dream of mine to race at Le Mans,” Button said. “I think it’s every driver’s dream to take part and hopefully go on to clinch that win at Le Mans, and I’m definitely no different.”Button will compete in the full world endurance championship season, which concludes next year at Le Mans again, with the exception of the first round next Saturday at Spa."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9eaa96c022547dd8ea4d687dc7cb2ea7d28b5d0/0_115_1792_1075/master/1792.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=553e2bd854cff66d603b48f512e51a37","title":"london marathon impostor accused of claiming runners medal","story":"Man pictured at finish with lost race number of charity runner who was removed from courseLondon Marathon organisers are investigating after it emerged that an apparent impostor may have used a genuine runner’s lost race number to collect a medal.Jake Halliday, 28, an investment manager from Edinburgh, reportedly lost his race number and was removed from the course three and a half hours into his run and about 15 minutes from the finish. Halliday was running with his friend Andrew Keiller for the blood cancer research charity Bloodwise, in support of Keiller’s girlfriend who was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in October 2016. The pair – along with their friend Chris Chisholm who is due to run the Stirling marathon this weekend – have raised more than £48,500, smashing their £20,000 target. According to race tracking data, Halliday crossed the start line at 10.05am and reached the 40km mark in a little over three and a half hours, but did not record a finish time.Pictures have emerged apparently showing an alleged impostor posing at the finish line with Halliday’s race number, 35179, and a finisher’s medal.Officials said they were aware of the claims and were investigating but would make “no further comment at the moment”. According to Peter Mowbray, 51, a runner who publicised the incident on Facebook, Halliday was prevented from completing the race by two marshals who saw that he was not wearing a number, the Daily Mail reported. “It takes a lot of work to run a marathon. It’s not a matter of eating a bowl of pasta and having a go, it’s 12 months’ worth of training,” Mowbray wrote. “Jake had his once-in-a-lifetime experience stolen from him by an impostor. The running world is very close-knit and when I saw the photograph of that man taking Jake’s medal I cried.”It is not the first time in the London Marathon’s 37-year-history that allegations of cheating have surfaced. In 2016, Natasha Argent, 26, agreed to return her finisher’s medal after she was found to have missed 11 of the 24 checkpoints. She was recorded as having completed the final 20km in 39mins – quicker than Sir Mo Farah. She later said she had had a panic attack and got lost.In 2010, a runner who was initially thought to have recorded the fastest London Marathon time by someone aged over 65 was found to have taken a 10-mile shortcut at Tower Bridge. He said he had done so because of an injury.Donations to a fundraising page set up by a former MasterChef contestant who died after collapsing during this year’s marathon have topped £220,000. Matt Campbell, 29, from Kendal, collapsed at the 22.5-mile mark during Sunday’s event, which took place in record 24.1C (73.3F) temperatures.Campbell was running to raise a target of £2,500 for the Brathay Trust, which was where his father had worked before he died suddenly in 2016.

President Moon, please feel easy and enjoy the delicious Pyongyang noodles that we brought.” The idea of a meal fit for a nuclear-armed king was irresistible and Kim is clearly a man who relishes good food, so I found a Michelin-approved shop in Seoul and set out to try the noodles for myself. It turns out I was not the only one with this idea. Woo Lae Oak, opened four years before the outbreak of the 1950-53 Korean war, was already packed by the time its doors opened. While there are many versions of dish, Pyongyang style calls for a chilled beef or pheasant broth filled with springy buckwheat noodles and topped with slices of beef brisket, pickled vegetables and pears.The noodles shot to the top of Twitter’s trending topics right after Kim name dropped the dish. “Now the symbol of peace has changed: it’s Pyongyang cold noodles, not a dove,” wrote one user according to the Korea Herald.In the hum of the waiting room, hungry patrons swapped thoughts on the summit as they waited for a coveted table. The mood in South Korea was overwhelmingly one of euphoria, with ordinary Koreans hailing the meeting as a success and praising Moon’s policy of engagement.“I feel great about the summit,” said Lee Ok-hee, a university student, echoing a common refrain. “Usually we’re sandwiched between China and the US, and they are imposing their own interests, but yesterday showed if we work together with North Korea we can achieve great things.”That idea of the two Koreas standing on their own was included in the joint declaration signed by Kim and Moon, emphasising the need for “the principle of determining the destiny of the Korean nation on their own accord”.“It was fantastic to watch them, I couldn’t focus on my work,” said Park Soon-hee, a banker in Seoul. “I know this is only the beginning, but it’s a wonderful start.”In a rare and surprising move, the front page of the Rodong Shinmun, the official newspaper of the North’s ruling Workers’ party, was splashed with over a dozen photos of Kim shaking hands with Moon and his first moments in the South. The paper carried a total of 60 photos of the event, devoting four pages of its six pages to the summit.North Korean media also took the rare step reporting the joint declaration’s goal of “complete denuclearisation”.“North and South Korea affirm the common goal of realising a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula through complete denuclearisation,” the official Korean Central News Agency said. Images the two men meeting also saturated South Korean media, played on a loop on major news channels and gracing the front page of every newspaper. “I was very touched when I saw them holding hands,” said Lim Nam-yon. “It was emotional in a way I hadn’t expected and made me feel like peace is actually possible.”But aimd the atmosphere of bonhomie, not everyone was optimistic about future relations. Park Won-thaek, a gruff 79-year-old man in a bolo tie and dark brown sunglass who looked as if he stepped right out of the 1970s, was unmoved.“It looks good,” he said. “But you can’t trust any leader of North Korea and Kim Jong-un will betray us if we don’t remain vigilant.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c643c0c7b52bb983779e347d526889a7450beb2/53_0_2498_1500/master/2498.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9e064cca11d3f174eaf6543b2dce33b","title":"north korea hails new milestone and credits kim with summit success","story":"The meetings between North and South opens the way for reconciliation and peace, says Pyongyang’s news agencyNorth Korea has hailed its summit with the South as “new milestone” in the history of the two countries after the two leaders pledged to pursue a permanent peace and rid the peninsula of nuclear weapons.The official KCNA news agency carried the text of the leaders’ Panmunjom declaration in full and said the encounter opened the way “for national reconciliation and unity, peace and prosperity”.In flowery prose, the news agency said the meeting was “accompanied by sunny April weather” and “born with a new energy of endless joy and hope”. A band played “jolly music to heighten the welcoming atmosphere”, it said.In the Panmunjom document, the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, and the South’s president, Moon Jae-in, “confirmed the common goal of realising, through complete denuclearisation, a nuclear-free Korean peninsula”.Leaders from around the world welcomed the summit outcome, but analaysts warned that previous displays of inter-Korean affection and pledges by the North have come to nothing.For years, Pyongyang insisted it would never give up the “treasured sword” of its nuclear arsenal, which it says it needs to defend itself against a possible US invasion.But it has offered to put it up for negotiation in exchange for security guarantees, according to Seoul – although Kim made no public reference to doing so at Friday’s spectacular summit.In a separate report, KCNA said the two leaders had a “candid and open-hearted exchange of views” on issues including “ensuring peace on the Korean peninsula and the denuclearisation of the peninsula”.The Rodong Sinmun newspaper, the mouthpiece of the North’s ruling Workers’ party, devoted the first four of its six pages to the event, carrying a total of 60 photos, 15 of them on page one.When Kim stepped over the military demarcation line that ides the peninsula he became the first North Korean leader to set foot in the South since the Korean war hostilities ceased in 1953 with an armistice rather than a peace treaty.He then persuaded Moon to step into the North – a fact reported by KCNA on Saturday – and the two leaders shared a day of smiles, intimate moments and a half-hour-long one-on-one conversation.The North has made rapid progress in its weapons programmes under Kim, detonating its sixth and most powerful nuclear test last year and launching missiles capable of reaching the US mainland, in moves that triggered increasingly strict UN security council sanctions against the regime.Kim and the US president, Donald Trump, traded personal insults and threats of war, sending tensions soaring before Moon seized on the Winter Olympics to broker dialogue, beginning a dizzying whirl of diplomacy that led to Friday’s meeting in the demilitarised zone between the two countries.Analysts and diplomats say that a combination of factors were behind Pyongyang’s change of heart, including feeling that it was in a position to negotiate from strength, the looming impact of sanctions and fear of potential US military action. But KCNA gave Kim the credit.“The historic meeting at Panmunjom came to be realised thanks to the supreme leader’s ardent love for the people and will for self-determination” independent of outside influence, it said.Washington is pressing Pyongyang to give up its weapons in a complete, verifiable and irreversible way, and analysts say that meaningful progress will depend on the outcome of Kim’s much-anticipated summit with Trump in the coming weeks.Trump hailed the Korea summit as historic, but warned “only time will tell”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0f8af50cbf34a55ec7c08f133769afbec7c4fbc/0_222_4568_2741/master/4568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=13c269868e2e3322cf3951c9288a242f","title":"six months metoo how soon guys come back hadley freeman","story":"Months are like dog years for men, so four months on the sidelines for a man is definitely the same as decades of groping for a womanGosh, remember the #MeToo movement? That was exciting, wasn’t it? All that talk about how nothing was ever going to be the same again. No longer would men get away with sexually exploiting women, and powerful men who once seemed untopplable were duly toppled. Red lines, everyone said, had been drawn. And six months on from the beginning of this movement, there’s only one question, really, that is being asked: how soon can these guys come back?“Several powerful men, in several industries, have had their worlds kicked out from under them as the #MeToo movement has gathered momentum… Is a comeback possible?” an article in the New York Times recently asked about the American chef Mario Batali. Yes, the poor men! Those accusations really came out of nowhere for them. It might be worth interjecting at this point that Batali, a popular and powerful media figure in America, is alleged to have sexually harassed women for decades. But the allegations came out in December, and it’s April now, and we all know months are like dog years for men, and so four months on the sidelines for a man is definitely the same as decades of groping for women.Similar pieces have also run in the past few weeks about US journalist Matt Lauer, whom you might remember as the one who allegedly had what was referred to as “a sex button” on his desk, allowing him to lock his office door from his desk while he harassed women. Similarly, Garrison Keillor, who reportedly made female employees feel “mistreated and sexualised” for years, is “determined America still wants to hear his voice”, if, perhaps, not feel his hands and receive his creepy emails.The Hollywood Reporter recently ran a heart-tugging profile of the once eminence grise broadcaster Charlie Rose, depicting him as “broken, brilliant and lonely”, miserably playing tennis at his $4m-$6m home. “I think he is trying to understand,” a friend told the reporter. Allow me to help you with that, Charlie. You have been accused of harassment by multiple women, who say you groped them, made gross late-night phone calls to them, exposed yourself to them and put your hand down their trousers while they cried. Your habit of giving women surprise massages was so established, it was referred to by your colleagues as “the crusty paw”. So ponder on that while you and your crusty paw are hitting those tennis balls, Rose.Last November, Louis CK finally admitted, after years of denials, to masturbating in front of women. Some of his victims had gone public with their accusations in the past, and CK’s denials had left them open to abuse from his fans – something, incidentally, all those who question the credibility of anonymous allegations in similar situations could do with bearing in mind.This argument has come up a lot since the start of the #MeToo movement, with men solemnly explaining to women that a grope is really not the same as a rape, which is super helpful of them because if there’s one group who really aren’t clear about the severity of rape, it’s women. But increasingly when I hear someone say, “Harassment isn’t as bad as rape”, what they seem to be saying is, “It isn’t that bad at all.”All of these men are multimillionaires, so concerns about their current lack of employment are not based on them no longer being able to pay the gas bill. Rather, it shows that, despite the alleged realigning of power dynamics by #MeToo, men are still seen as the stars of the show and women as faceless background nobodies. You know, it’s that classic Hollywood plot: man strives for success, man gets success, man frantically masturbates in front of women and gives them the crusty paw, man makes glorious comeback. In the case of Batali, Rose, Lauer and Keillor, it’s the men wanting this storyline in the case of CK, it seems to be others wanting it for him. In all cases, it’s the diminishing of the women who were harassed. Are the women these men exploited being interviewed about how their careers were hampered? How they were denied opportunities because they spoke up, or said no? The answer, of course, is ha ha ha. Increasingly it looks like #MeToo didn’t topple the patriarchy – it showed how tenacious the patriarchy is at enforcing its stranglehold."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/765f2dcdd73ebcc0436b6ee3fa59c9402ff7c931/0_0_3500_2334/master/3500.jpg?w=480\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da8b1c12b67cb4f5771eaad0b8f214c6 480w","title":"my financial future can i have my brunch and eat it too","story":"The options appear to be: never socialise and stay in to save for a house, or live a normal, modern urban life and spiral into debt. But is there a third way?Sitting firmly in the middle of the millennial generation (those born 1981-2000) and I’m told I could easily afford to buy my first home in London if I just give up: coffee, my gym membership, an annual weekend away, takeaway food, and a mobile upgrade, or one night out a week, for five years – or avocados.Sure, London living is afforded by renting the equivalent of a dodgy hostel dorm, nights out revolving around two-for-one deals, and “side-hustles”, which is a glorified term for my three jobs. So, should I accept that I can’t have my brunch and eat it too? Living paycheck to paycheck isn’t the dream and maybe neither is owning a home, but there must be a way I could at least consider the option.I’m certainly not alone, but maybe we’re placing too much value on “Yolo” – apparently a typical habit of young people today – so I’ve asked Paul Bridgwater, head of commercial and proposition at financial services provider OneFamily, and millennial lifestyle and personal finance expert Lisa Rowan from The Penny Hoarder what they think – and luckily neither suggested a five-year period where I give up all that I hold dear.Is it really that hard to save in a big city or am I being led astray?Rowan suggests that, unfortunately, it’s not all in my head. “Affordable, low-amenity units are being replaced with luxury buildings that are simply out of reach for many people, especially young people in the early stages of their careers,” she says. “This competitive housing environment means more workers in their 20s and 30s are enduring long commutes from the suburbs or are living with several roommates in order to make the most of their budgets.” But, Bridgwater says, while it can feel unattainable without the help from “the bank of mum and dad” we do have the benefit of living in a connected, digital age that can help us achieve our financial goals.I really value my social life – do I have to give up a chunk of it for five years?No, says Rowan, but there are some hacks to help make sure you don’t spend most of your monthly wages during the excitement of payday. In short, be at least a bit prepared. “Knowing the type of activity upfront can help you determine whether an event is a social and financial priority for you – then, it’s easier to make compromises. You may skip on the 12-person birthday dinner at a fancy restaurant, but you can still meet the group for drinks or dessert afterward. You can still go on a bar crawl with your friends, but perhaps eat a hearty meal before you leave the house,” she says.Bridgwater agrees, and says it’s safe to assume that most of your friends are in the same boat, so be straight up with them. “Money is a bit of a taboo subject for any age group, especially in the UK. On a practical level, earnings, savings and debts are not really discussed and perhaps they should be,” he says. “Like anything else in life, by talking and sharing issues, interesting solutions will come to light.”OK, so maybe I should be budgeting. What are some handy guidelines?Bridgwater says that budgeting isn’t the same for everyone, but taking away the temptation to spend is often the easiest way to save. “Create different accounts for your big expenses (housing, bills and savings) and then set up a standing order into these accounts one to two days after your wages go in from your main account. You’ll then know the money you have left in your main account is money you can spend,” he says.So, can I think about saving for a big purchase and still keep seeing my friends?Yes, says Rowan: “You can have your instant and delayed gratification at the same time.” A product like OneFamily’s stocks and shares Lifetime Isa is a good start when considering your options. With a Lifetime Isa, for every £4 put in, the government adds £1 – so save up to £4,000 a year and get £1,000 as a bonus (available after 12 months). Lifetime Isas are available either based on cash investments, which can be preferable for first-time house purchases in the short-term or stocks and shares investments, which might be preferable if you are aiming to buy your first home in five or more years, as they offer potentially better returns over the longer term, but be aware that capital is at risk.For information on the OneFamily stocks and shares Lifetime Isa, visit OneFamily.

Photograph: Collins CourtsThe clinical director of the national cervical cancer screening programme advised a Limerick gynaecologist to file some audited test results rather than to tell women in certain cases that all-clear smear tests they had received years earlier were wrong.Dr Gráinne Flannelly, clinical director of CervicalCheck, told gynaecologist Dr Kevin Hickey in an email in July 2017 that several women in the mid-west region should not be told about the false negative tests discovered in an audit after he wrote to her to confirm that she felt some women with cervical cancer should not be informed about them.The private correspondence was submitted in the High Court case taken by Vicky Phelan, a 43-year-old mother of two with terminal cancer from Annacotty, Co Limerick who was not told about an incorrect 2011 smear test until September 2017, despite a 2014 audit by CervicalCheck showing that the test was wrong.The records emerged after Dr Flannelly publicly acknowledged that she could not say for sure that all of the 206 women who missed early treatment for cervical cancer had been made aware of the situation.Dr Hickey wrote to Dr Flannelly on June 20th, 2017 referring to a list of patients with cervical cancer noting that in three highlighted cases the women should be told about the false smear test results after a 2014 review.“There were other ladies where the review process has altered the original smear report and it looks from your notes that you have felt that these should be filed in the patients’ notes and that no review is necessary,” Dr Hickey wrote to her at the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street in Dublin.“I just wanted to confirm that you are happy with this whole process centrally from the Cervical Screening Unit given that it looks that some of the review smears were different from the original.”Dr Flannelly replied on July 7th, 2017 in an email with the subject line “clarification”.“Yes – a balance needs to be struck in deciding who needs a formal communication of the outcome of the audit. The possibility of resultant harm is crucial,” she wrote.In cases where women have not had cancer or who have “local and fertility-sparing surgery”, Dr Hickey should “simply file” the audited test results in the patients’ medical notes, Dr Flannelly wrote.“The concept of delay is important,” she said. “I based my judgment on the medical information available to me and using the same criteria I use in my own practice when dealing with these cases. Only three of the women merited a closeout meeting using these criteria,” Dr Flannelly wrote.On August 8th, 2017, after being told by Dr Hickey that he had taken it upon himself to inform all the affected women, Dr Flannelly wrote to him again, noting his decision and saying that this “underscores the value of the local clinician reviewing the clinical context”.“The advice I gave was based on the limited information available to me and was given as an honest assessment of what seemed to be the best way to proceed with these cases,” she said.“It is right and fitting that your own clinical judgment should take precedence.” Yesterday, Minister for Health Simon Harris appointed a senior team of experts to examine the cases of the 206 women who missed early treatment for cervical cancer and to assess how many were not made aware of the delay in diagnosis.The appointments followed Mr Harris’s failure to declare confidence in the leadership of the programme. A HSE spokeswoman said Prof Flannelly would be “continuing in her role” and was “directly involved” in the process to provide assurance around the communications with the 206 women whose cases were under review.Asked about doctors using their “judgment” on whether to inform patients of wrong test results, the spokeswoman said the “practice was deemed to be appropriate and is in line with the practice in the UK for the communication of cancer audit reviews”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3476929.1524858809!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"phelan case the days of doctor knows best are behind us","story":"Tánaiste Simon Coveney has apologised to Vicky Phelan and her family, the 43-year-old mother of two was incorrectly given the all-clear from a smear test taken in 2011.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tVicky and Jim Phelan from Co Limerick: Ms Phelan wasn’t told of the false negative in her 2011 smear test until September 2017. Photograph: Collins Courts The case of Vicky Phelan, and subsequent news that more than 200 women diagnosed with cervical cancer should have received earlier interventions, have put a serious dent in public and ministerial confidence in the national cervical cancer screening programme.There is now a strong argument that the promised external review of CervicalCheck be extended to all health-screening programmes. The National Screening Service oversees BreastCheck, BowelScreen, CervicalCheck and the diabetic-retinopathy screening programme, which tests for early signs of eye damage associated with diabetes mellitus.Strangely, the National Screening Service came under the remit of the National Cancer Control Programme only relatively recently. It previously reported to a different section of the HSE. That the screening programme and the control programme were separate entities – a possible governance deficit – may have contributed to the events leading up to Ms Phelan’s High Court case and the dramatic revelations about CervicalCheck’s communication failures that followed it.There is no question mark about the clinical excellence of inidual programmes, but CervicalCheck’s former practice of not ensuring open disclosure for the women it invited for cancer screening means the public must be reassured that screening programmes for other diseases do not have similar loopholes.Modern healthcare must operate in an environment of full candour. The days of doctor knows best are firmly behind us. And previous thinking around ownership of medical notes has been replaced by a clear understanding that information about our health belongs, in the first instance, to each of us inidually.This means healthcare professionals informing patients, as soon as is practicable while in their care, of problems with test results, changes in diagnosis and any errors associated with their management.The principle of open disclosure was introduced almost two decades ago and is now accepted as a global norm. In practice it means doctors, nurses and hospitals must inform a patient of any untoward event. Most of these will not involve error but, rather, reflect the uncertain nature of healthcare and the known side effects of investigations and treatment. But patients must be informed promptly, as the adverse event is likely to influence a person’s future choice of treatment.So for CervicalCheck not to have a robust policy in place to manage events such as a look-back at previous smear results was a significant failure of governance. Such a policy would clearly identify how to ensure the patient and her doctor would receive simultaneous notification from the screening programme of a potential error. In order to limit any collateral damage to screening programmes for breast and bowel cancer, the promised review must examine their open-disclosure protocols as well. And although some observers have said a voluntary approach to open disclosure must be maintained, cold analysis suggests that particular horse has bolted.Irish healthcare, despite numerous scandals and promises to improve, is systemically incapable of making this important cultural change. Unlike some of his predecessors, Minister for Health Simon Harris must not shy away from his commitment to enshrine open disclosure in law."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Garda\u0026iacute thank the public for their help in finding the teenagersThe 18-year-old died after the car he was driving collided with a second vehicleIPU member speaks of alarm at the high volume of anabolic steroids seizedDeceased who was in her in 70s was killed in incident near Boula, PortumnaDr Gr\u0026aacuteinne Flannelly told Limerick gynaecologist to file audited test results insteadHarris to sign regulations on voluntary open disclosure in health service by end of JuneFormer Ulster Farmers Union president elected as Sinn F\u0026eacutein backs Fine Gael candidateCrevan Mackin prescribed cocktail of drugs at time of Garda Tony Golden murderGroup to examine how CervicalCheck dealt with their cases and report back to HSESam Coulter-Smith calls for urgent review of outsourcing of Irish tests to US companiesEmployer group says Ministers must hold firm line on pay even if it means strikesPresident, who returns from visit to US on Saturday, says \u0026lsquoultimately\u0026rsquo the people will decideDirector general says sorry to Vicky Phelan for delay in being told about incorrect testParty will support Government\u0026rsquos proposition for abortion within first trimester\u0026lsquoI suspect getting away with crime isn\u0026rsquot one of his abilities,\u0026rsquo says judge\u0026lsquoLast thing I expected, God knows.

Photograph: Eric LukeUnlike the Bill to reform the way judges are appointed, the efforts of Minister for Transport Shane Ross to change the State drink-driving laws are almost certain to pass through the Oireachtas. The vast majority of TDs in the Dáil are either supportive of its measures, or have decided not to oppose them, and the same is likely to be the case in the Seanad. The main thrust of the Road Traffic Bill is to increase penalties for those caught drink-driving. It will introduce a mandatory driving ban for a first drink-driving offence if a motorist has a blood alcohol level of above 50mg per 100ml. Currently, first-time offenders receive a fine and penalty points.It has met with strong opposition from rural politicians, and there were doubts at one stage if Fine Gael would even apply the whip to ensure Mr Ross’s proposals became law.Given the Government’s precarious minority, support was always needed from across the House. Sinn Féin’s decision to support the proposals almost from the moment they were announced by Mr Ross in early 2017 –allied with a Fine Gael whip – meant its passage was effectively secure from the outset. Labour and the Social Democrats are also providing support and Fianna Fáil this week announced that it would not oppose the Bill, despite being opposed to the severity of the sanctions within it.The main reason for the delay in its passing through the Oireachtas has been down to parliamentary procedure and management by the Government of the legislation.A group of rural deputies – the Healy-Raes, Mattie McGrath, Michael Collins, Michael Fitzmaurice and Seán Canney – are against the Bill, and some have been accused of filibustering during Dáil debates.Mr Canney, a member of Mr Ross’s Independent Alliance, provoked anger among his colleagues by voting against the Bill at report stage this week, rather than just abstain as he had earlier in the legislative process.The moves by the small group of deputies led Liz O’Donnell, the chair of the Road Safety Authority, to publicly criticise as “disgraceful and self-serving the behaviour and tactics employed by a tiny minority of rural TDs, who are delaying the passage of vital lifesaving road safety legislation”. The fact that Mr Ross has on a number of occasions expanded the Bill by adding amendments has, due to Dáil procedures, allowed the debate to be reopened by those TDs criticised by Ms O’Donnell.The latest is the “Clancy amendment”, which would penalise vehicle owners who allow a learner driver out on the road on their own and will allow gardaí to seize a vehicle driven by an unaccompanied learner driver. McGrath said it provided, once more, the opportunity to object. Against such opposition, governments would usually guillotine a Bill through but the current minority administration does not have the strength to do so.However, even McGrath expects the Bill to pass from the Dáil to the Seanad this week, and the Tipperary deputy accepts it will become law.“It is going to get through but is a ridiculous piece of legislation,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"bertie ahern abruptly ends interview after being questioned on mahon tribunal","story":"  April 21, 2018Former taoiseach \u0026lsquohappy\u0026rsquo he cleared his name after allegations he received payments   April 22, 2018Fianna F\u0026aacuteil leader praises former taoiseach\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquotireless work for peace\u0026rsquo in Northern Ireland "},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"State media says discussions wrapped up with amicable \u0026lsquofeelings of blood relatives\u0026rsquoKim Jong-un and Moon Jae-in pledge formal end to Korean War and peace on peninsula\u0026lsquoJust like a pine tree, I hope our relationship will be forever green,\u0026rsquo says Kim Jong-unMan wielding knife outside school in Shaanxi province also leaves dozen children woundedZagreb also angry over behaviour of Serb war criminal and deputy Vojislav SeseljAfter previous deals fell through, more work lies ahead to achieve real regional stabilitySymbolic walk across demilitarised zone and tree-planting will underpin historical talksReport sheds light on North Korean announcement that it will suspend testingDetails emerge for meeting where peace treaty and denuclearisation to be discussedCrash happened at unmanned railroad crossing in rural Uttar Pradesh stateFriday meeting in truce village of Panmunjom caps startling improvement in relationsTokyo Letter: Finance bureaucrat resigns after journalist leaks recording of encounterAsaram Bapu found guilty in Jodhpur court amid tight security due to fears of violencePolice say they have caught the 32-year-old man suspected of starting the deadly blazeNorth Korean leader visits survivors of bus crash in which 32 Chinese tourists diedFirst time in more than two years that propaganda broadcasts have been turned offChinese diplomats rush to scene of incident in North Hwanghae provinceScepicism over pledge by North Korean leader Kim Jong-un to suspend nuclear testsPyongyang reveals plans to close its nuclear test site ahead of landmark Korean summitLeaders of ruling BJP party reject claims that internet is a modern-day Western invention"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3477894.1524904858!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"north korean media hails candid talks with neighbours in south","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            A man in Seoul, South Korea walks past a newspaper featuring a front page story about the summit between South Korean president Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, on a sidewalk in Seoul on April 28, 2018.

North Korea’s KCNA news agency released the joint statement Mr Kim and South Korean president Moon Jae-in presented on Friday after the first summit in more than a decade between the two countries.Mr Kim and Mr Moon had pledged to work for “complete denuclearisation” of the peninsula and agreed on a common goal of making it “nuclear-free”.“At the talks both sides had a candid and open-hearted exchange of views on the matters of mutual concern including the issues of improving the north-south relations, ensuring peace on the Korean Peninsula and the denuclearisation of the peninsula,” KCNA said, reporting that the night wrapped up with a dinner with an “amicable atmosphere overflowing with feelings of blood relatives”.A day after the meeting produced dramatic images and a sweeping declaration of goodwill, South Korean media were replaying striking scenes of the two leaders and North Korea’s main state newspaper published a multi-page spread with photos from the visit.Most of the specific commitments outlined in the official declaration focused on inter-Korean relations and did not clear up the question of whether Pyongyang is willing to give up its arsenal of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.In their coverage of the summit, North Korean state media made rare mentions of the denuclearisation discussion, but did not go into specifics, instead highlighting the broad themes of peace, prosperity and unity.The declaration earned guarded but optimistic praise from world leaders, including Mr Trump, who said that only time would tell, but that he did not think Mr Kim was “playing.”“It’s never gone this far. This enthusiasm for them wanting to make a deal ... We are going to hopefully make a deal,” he said. Still, Mr Trump told reporters, he would maintain pressure on North Korea and “not repeat the mistakes of past administrations.”Speaking on Saturday at a televised news conference in Sydney, Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull praised Mr Trump’s negotiations on North Korea and said he helped bring the two Korean leaders together.“I have given him that credit because Donald Trump has taken a very, very strong, hard line on the denuclearisation issue and he has been able to bring in the support of the global community and, in particular, China, ” he said. “North Korea’s economic relationship is overwhelmingly with China. And so China’s preparedness to impose those sanctions has been the critical change that has put the economic pressure on North Korea.”Mr Turnbull said the pressure from China and the US had brought Mr Kim to the point of denuclearising the Korean peninsula.“What we’ve now got to do is not relent on the economic pressure until that goal is achieved,” he said.Australia will send a military aircraft to monitor North Korean vessels suspected of transferring illicit goods in defiance of UN sanctions, he said.An editorial in the official China Daily on Saturday said denuclearisation could end hostilities between the two sides and “usher in a new era of development” on the peninsula. However, it noted Friday’s declaration lacked a plan for achieving the goal.“The denuclearisation of the peninsula, written into the Panmunjom Declaration, is only a prospect with no specific plan. That is because such specifics can be reached only between the US and North Korea, and South Korea has only limited authority to bargain,” it said. - Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3468658.1524242996!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"le big mac emmanuel macron s rise and rise","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWinning ways: Emmanuel Macron at his victory rally in Paris after being elected president, in May 2017. Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy.

Photograph: Juan MedinaThe monument known as the Valley of the Fallen, containing the body of the dictator Francisco Franco, has barely been touched since its completion in 1959. But that may be about to change.Last Monday, a group of relatives of men who were also buried at the site gathered at its entrance amid a swarm of TV cameras and photographers. These people have registered requests for the bodies of their loved ones to be dug up in order to be given a decent burial elsewhere.A team of experts entered the site and carried out preliminary checks to see if a search for the bodies in question is feasible.Eduardo Ranz, the young lawyer representing the families, described it as a historic day.“It’s the biggest mass grave in Spain, ” he told The . “This place is outside the bounds of democracy.”Situated in a wooded area 60km north of Madrid, the Valley of the Fallen is Spain’s biggest and most controversial reminder of its 1936-1939 civil war and the four-decade dictatorship that followed. Its construction began after the war ended and republican prisoners who had fought against Franco were used to build it.The monument’s centrepiece is a 150m-high stone cross. Beneath it is a basilica, drilled deep into the mountainside at the end of which lies the tomb of Franco, who died in 1975, just a few steps away from the main altar.On either side of the tomb, the remains of 33,700 people killed in the civil war lie grouped together in boxes in underground crypts, most of them unidentified. It is from these crypts that those gathered on Monday want to find and exhume their relatives.For Rosa Gil, the granddaughter of one of those buried there, the opening-up of the basilica to the team of experts was “a day of hope and happiness”.Her grandfather, Pedro Gil Calonge, died in 1937 in northern Spain, fighting for Franco. But his remains were exhumed from a cemetery in Zaragoza in the early 1960s and transferred to the Valley of the Fallen without his family being informed, as part of an initiative to make the site a cemetery for victims of the civil war.Rosa says that when her father, Silvino Gil, who had been a pro-Franco politician, found out the truth a few years ago, he said: “Why should Franco be able to move my father’s body?”The families of eight men whose bodies were moved to the Valley of the Fallen are now hoping to get them exhumed, although initially only four are being searched for. The fact that the eight are from both sides of the civil war – six were leftist republicans and two fought for Franco’s right-wing nationalists – reflects the potentially groundbreaking nature of this case.It was put in motion in May of 2016, when a court authorised the exhumation from the Valley of the Fallen of two republican brothers, Manuel and Antonio Ramiro Lapeña, at the request of the former’s granddaughter. Other requests followed.However, the prior of the Benedictine monastery at the Valley of the Fallen, Santiago Cantera, refused to open the crypt, blocking the procedure. The families hoping to exhume their relatives filed a legal complaint against Cantera for disobeying a court order. The standoff was resolved last month, when Archbishop Ricardo Blázquez, chairman of the Spanish Episcopal Conference, stepped in.The legacy of the civil war and the ensuing dictatorship has long been a thorny issue. In 2007, the then-Socialist government introduced a historical memory law, which included the removal of public symbols of Franco and his regime. But although statues of the dictator and street signs bearing his name and those of his officials were taken down, many symbols remain and no steps were taken with regard to the Valley of the Fallen, which is today visited by tourists and Franco nostalgists.The bodies of over 100,000 victims of Franco from the war and its aftermath lie in unmarked graves across Spain and volunteers who identify and exhume them do not receive state funding.The issue tends to ide Spaniards along political lines, with those on the left more inclined to favour tackling the historical memory issue and those on the right often warning such an approach risks reopening old wounds.It is still early days and the forensic experts might yet decide that locating the bodies in the Valley of the Fallen will be too difficult. The lawyer, Eduardo Ranz, urged caution, but said he and his clients are prepared to wait.“The work will be completed when the families can give their loved ones a dignified burial,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"ed balls day how the former  shadow chancellor became twitters f","story":"April 28th is the day we celebrate the anniversary of that time Ed Balls, former MP for Morley and Outwood, accidentally tweeted out his own name on Twitter.It was a Thursday, much like any other Thursday - Thursday 28 April 2011, to be precise.

In practice, this means the infection is resistant to all commonly used antibiotics.The figures have emerged as Lord O\u0027Neill, the former Goldman Sachs banker who led a government-commissioned review into superbugs, accuses senior ministers of a lack of leadership on the issue. Lord O’Neill, former commercial secretary to the Treasury, said the Prime Minister, Theresa May, had allowed the issue to fade and that actions promised had not been taken.Lord O\u0026#39Neill has urged senior ministers to do more to tackle the threat of superbugs“It is disappointing to see that the UK government’s global and national efforts to fight AMR seem to have faded, he saidWriting exclusively for the  Lord O’Neill said that the UK was once seen as a leader in the field but that May had allowed the issue to slide.“The government should put this part of \u0027global Britain\u0027 back at the top of its priorities,” he writes. “There has been a lot of talk, but no action.Lord O’Neill’s review warned that if left unchecked antibiotic resistance would kill 10 million people and the world economy could lose up to $100 trillion by 2050.Antibiotic resistance | The true cost in Britain and around the worldOfficial figures suggest antimicrobial resistance claims the lives of 5,000 people a year in the UK, though experts have argued the real figure is at least double that. Getting global figures on the problem is difficult but reliable estimates suggest 700,000 are already dying each year – one person a minute.Lord O’Neill also attacked the major pharmaceutical companies for doing little to counter the problem, despite signing up to the Davos Declaration in 2015, where they pledged to combat the threat.He wrote: “Since then, no major pharmaceutical company has taken any fresh action.”Lord O’Neill said that since investigating the issue the number of reports of antibiotic resistance was rising faster and “in more places than we ever dreamt of.”.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}There has been a lot of talk, but no action.Lord O\u0026#x27NeillIn addition to the ‘super gonorrhoea’ case the PHE figures, obtained under a Freedom of Information request, show 29 people suffered from pan-drug-resistant-infections from Pseudomonas bacteria.Pseudomonas is a bug often found in soil or water (hospital sinks are tested for it) that usually affects people with a weaker immune system such as cancer patients, newborn babies, people with diabetes or patients with severe burns.Up to 11 per cent of Pseudomonas bacteria are now resistant to ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic commonly used in combination with others.A further six patients suffered pan-drug-resistant Klebsiella infections. New antibiotics to treat multi-drug-resistant Klebsiella infections were introduced last year in light of rising resistance, said Professor Peter Hawkey, a public health and bacteriology expert at the University of Birmingham. But they don’t work against every strain, he said.Antibiotic resistance | Global consumption fuels spread of superbugsProf Hawkey added that the cases show antimicrobial resistance is not a hypothetical or future threat but a real one currently affecting patients in British hospitals.These are organisms which are resistant to most antibiotics and then you’re in a tricky place, he said. The threat is very real. These figures are a wake up call,” he said.The pan-resistant infections recorded by PHE were from gram negative bacteria: rod-shaped bugs with thinner cell walls than their gram positive counterparts.Gram negative bacteria, some of which live in the human gut, are fast becoming resistant to antibiotics and are known as an emerging global threat. The government aims to halve the number of healthcare-associated gram-negative bloodstream infections by 2021.Prof Hawkey said pan-drug-resistant-infections are much more common in other areas of the world with lax surveillance and poor infection control, and these will spread to Britain.He said: With huge movement in populations people are coming back to the UK with these bugs in their guts. If you get it and you’re given the wrong antibiotic, you will die.Dr Susan Hopkins, deputy director for AMR and healthcare acquired infections at Public Health England, said: “While there is only a small number of bacteria identified that were resistant to a number of treatments in recent years, they serve as an example of the threat antibiotic resistance poses to public health.Madlen Davies is a reporter with the Bureau of Investigative JournalismProtect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Presenter Simon Thomas to leave Sky Sports following death of his wifeAmber Rudd is victim of \u0026#39partisan campaign\u0026#39, Michael Gove saysWhat will Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u0026#39s titles be after their wedding?Royal wedding guest list: Who did Meghan Markle and Prince Harry invite?Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding 2018: date, details and latest newsPrince Louis Arthur Charles: Royal baby name announced by Duke and Duchess of Cambridge - latest newsPrince Louis Arthur Charles of Cambridge: Everything we know about new Royal babyAlfie Evans dies after long-running legal battle as parents left \u0026#39heartbroken\u0026#39Voter ID scheme to prevent election fraud \u0026#39deeply flawed\u0026#39Mass child sacrifice site in Peru may be largest in historyNorth Korea breaks silence on Kim Jong-un\u0026#39s \u0026#39immortal achievement\u0026#39 as Donald Trump claims credit for summitMan, 35, charged with murdering mother-of-three Hollie KerrellJustice Secretary delays decision on naming Parole Board members in wake of Worboys scandalUK weather: Snow set for Britain this weekend in return to winter days after heatwaveLawyers hit back at \u0026#39prejudicial and inflammatory\u0026#39 criticism from High Court judge over Alfie Evans caseRocket man: How Kim Jong-un emerged from his father\u0026#39s shadow to silence the doubtersComment: Michael Gove is right: we should show our pets who\u0026#39s boss (even if they secretly know they always have the upper hand)Amber Rudd clinging on as Home Secretary as leaked memo appears to show she knew about deportation targets The end of the 68 year conflict between North and South Korea?DVLA hands out millions of car owners\u0026#39 details to private parking firms for just £2.50We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"nature highlights national geographic travel photographer year","story":"A leaping leopard and a crowd of crocodiles are among the stunning photos released from the Nature section of the 2018 National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year contest.

It is also one of the Duke of Cambridge\u0027s own middle names.Kensington Palace said: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are delighted to announce that they have named their son Louis Arthur Charles.The baby will be known as His Royal Highness Prince Louis of Cambridge.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge showing their third child to the world outside the Lindo Wing on MondayThe name is a significant tribute to the Royal Family, with the newborn Prince sharing names in common with his brother Prince George Alexander Louis, his father Prince William Arthur Philip Louis, and his grandfather Prince Charles Philip Arthur George.Kensington Palace announced the name of the Royal couple\u0027s third child, who was born on Monday at 11.01am weighing 8lb 7oz.The Duke and Duchess will have shared the name with the Queen and the rest of their family before making it public.The announcement had been eagerly anticipated since the couple showed off their new son to the world on the steps of the exclusive maternity unit, the Lindo Wing, on Monday evening.Popularity of the boys\u0027 name Louis since 1904Since then, the Duke and Duchess have been kept busy settling in to life as a family of five at Kensington Palace.Born fifth in line, the baby is the Queen and Philip\u0027s sixth great-grandchild and Kensington Palace said the couple, along with the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall, Prince Harry, and the Middletons, were delighted with the news of the new arrival. The Duke of Cambridge joined his brother Prince Harry and soon-to-be sister-in-law Meghan Markle at Westminster Abbey for an Anzac Day service on Wednesday afternoon.But the topic of conversation quickly turned to the new Prince.It\u0027s a boy Celebrating the Royal baby - in picturesAsked how the Duchess and the baby were doing, Prince William said: They\u0027re very well thanks.The now father of three said they are in good form, luckily, and added: Sleeping\u0027s going reasonably well so far, so he\u0027s behaving himself which is good news.Prince William greets his brother Harry\u0026#39s fiancee Meghan Markle as they arrive for an Anzac Day service at Westminster Abbey A delighted Prince of Wales welcomed the birth of his third grandchild, saying it was a “great joy”.Speaking for himself and the Duchess of Cornwall, presumably with a twinkle in his eye, he said: “We are both so pleased at the news.  “It is a great joy to have another grandchild, the only trouble is I don’t know how I am going to keep up with them.”The Prince is now a grandfather to Prince George, four, Princess Charlotte, who will turn three on May 2, and the baby boy.The Prince of Wales already has two grandchildren in Prince George and Princess Charlotte, pictured arriving at the Lindo WingThe Duchess of Cornwall also has five grandchildren who are regular visitors to their home, with the Prince said to delight in reading the youngsters stories.The Prince’s words chimed perfectly with those of his son the Duke, who had held up three fingers - one for each of his children - when departing from hospital and laughed that he had “thrice the worry now”.The Duke of Cambridge holds up three fingers as he tells the media he has \u0026#39thrice the worry now\u0026#39 as he leaves the Lindo Wing Louis was the first name of the Prince of Wales\u0027 beloved great-uncle Earl Mountbatten of Burma.Charles will be touched that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge decided to pay tribute to Lord Mountbatten, who was murdered by the IRA in 1979, by naming their son Prince Louis.The name, also one of Prince George\u0027s middle names, is French and German in origin and means renowned warrior.Louis was the 71st most popular name in England and Wales, according to the latest available figures from the Office for National Statistics.In 2016, just 911 boys were given the name Louis in England and Wales.It was more popular in the early 2000s when it ranked around 39th, but was not popular throughout the 20th century.Louis has been the name of many rulers across the world, including 18 kings of France.Lord Louis Mountbatten pictured in 1977, two years before he was murdered by the IRAFamous people named Louis include pop star Louis Tomlinson from One Direction and jazz trumpeter Louis Armstrong.Lord Louis Mountbatten was also the Duke of Edinburgh\u0027s uncle and the brother of Philip\u0027s mother Princess Alice.He was the last British Viceroy of India before independence in 1947.He was very close to Charles but Uncle Dickie, as he was known in the family, was assassinated by the IRA in August 1979.His boat was blown up on a fishing trip off the coast of County Sligo in the Republic of Ireland.Prince George and Princess Charlotte had already been introduced to the new baby at St Mary’s Hospital and were likely being eased into their new roles as big brother and middle sister in their own home on Tuesday.Pippa Matthews, the first visitor seen driving into the Palace, spent several hours with her sister, the Duchess, and infant nephew before being photographed driving away.Pippa Middleton pictured leaving Kensington Palace on Tuesday afternoonParents Carole and Michael Middleton were unlikely to have been far away, famously supportive of the Duke and Duchess and their growing brood.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, too, could surely not have kept away from joining the first eager visitors, living just next door and both adoring children.The Prince once called George and Charlotte “the most amazing things ever”.The Queen, who was in Windsor, is unlikely to meet her sixth great-grandchild imminently, with further duties at the castle on Wednesday, while the Duke of Edinburgh is recuperating privately from a hip replacement operation.The Queen horse riding at Windsor on Monday before the latest Royal baby was bornThe Prince of Wales, who was on Tuesday travelling to France in time for a dawn service to commemorate the Battle of Villers-Bretonneux on Anzac Day, will pay his first visit to hold the baby on his return from duty.Other family members earlier remained tight-lipped about the baby\u0027s name. The Countess of Wessex, who was conducting a string of engagements near Truro, Cornwall, said during a visit to Tregolls School on Tuesday: “I’m thrilled for them all, it’s lovely - really good news.”Asked about the baby’s name, she added tactfully: “The jury’s out on that one. I don’t know, we’re all just going to have to wait and see.”Sophie, Countess of Wessex meets pupils during a visit to a school in Truro on TuesdayAs the outside world clamoured for details, the Duke and Duchess appeared to simply get on with life: with two older children, even with the help of a nanny, they could hardly do less.The Duke, sporting a light stubble, was seen driving out of Kensington Palace on Tuesday afternoon, on an unidentified errand.Prince William leaves Kensington Palace by car on Tuesday afternoonOfficial celebrations were already under way, with the bells of Westminster Abbey ringing out from 1pm and gun salutes fired in London at 2pm.The soldiers, horses and Guns of The King\u0027s Troop Royal Horse Artillery rode out from Wellington Barracks into Hyde Park for a 41 round salute, and the Honourable Artillery Company (HAC), the City of London\u0027s Army Reserve regiment, fired a 62-round Gun Salute from The Tower of London.Video: Moment royal birth was marked by gun salutesThe baby joy extended not just to the Royal Family and avid monarchists.A young politan Police constable, Tyler O\u0027Hare, who took centre stage during the Royal baby\u0027s first public appearance outside the Lindo Wing was also celebrating.Sharing pictures of himself sternly keeping them safe by standing guard, he wrote on Twitter: “An honour and utter privilege to have been the ‘Door Officer’ for the birth of Their Royal Highnesses new baby boy!“Today was an amazing day and a highlight of my career!”The official commemorative souvenirs marking the birth of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s baby son have gone on sale - before the new prince\u0027s name had been announced.Featuring a lion cub and unicorn inspired by the Royal Arms, the Royal Collection china is decorated with gold ribbons, silver pompoms and a coronet-inspired pattern.The pieces bear the words Welcome to our new royal baby and display William and Kate\u0027s coronet.The range of official commemorative chinaware to celebrate the prince\u0026#39s birth The official range includes a pillbox costing £35, a tankard for £39 and a plate priced at £49.Each item in the range is gilded with 22-carat gold and made in Stoke-on-Trent using traditional methods.There is also a pram-shaped woven decoration, made with glistening threads, delicate pearl detail, and embroidered on the back with Royal Baby 2018, for £14.95.Duchess of CambridgePlease review our commenting policyPresenter Simon Thomas to leave Sky Sports following death of his wifeAmber Rudd is victim of \u0026#39partisan campaign\u0026#39, Michael Gove saysWhat will Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u0026#39s titles be after their wedding?Royal wedding guest list: Who did Meghan Markle and Prince Harry invite?Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding 2018: date, details and latest newsPrince Louis Arthur Charles of Cambridge: Everything we know about new Royal babyAlfie Evans dies after long-running legal battle as parents left \u0026#39heartbroken\u0026#39Voter ID scheme to prevent election fraud \u0026#39deeply flawed\u0026#39Mass child sacrifice site in Peru may be largest in historyNorth Korea breaks silence on Kim Jong-un\u0026#39s \u0026#39immortal achievement\u0026#39 as Donald Trump claims credit for summitMan, 35, charged with murdering mother-of-three Hollie KerrellJustice Secretary delays decision on naming Parole Board members in wake of Worboys scandalUK weather: Snow set for Britain this weekend in return to winter days after heatwaveLawyers hit back at \u0026#39prejudicial and inflammatory\u0026#39 criticism from High Court judge over Alfie Evans caseRocket man: How Kim Jong-un emerged from his father\u0026#39s shadow to silence the doubtersComment: Michael Gove is right: we should show our pets who\u0026#39s boss (even if they secretly know they always have the upper hand)Amber Rudd clinging on as Home Secretary as leaked memo appears to show she knew about deportation targets The end of the 68 year conflict between North and South Korea?DVLA hands out millions of car owners\u0026#39 details to private parking firms for just £2.50Lawyer at Trump Tower meeting reportedly worked with Russian government We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"prince louis named grandfather great grandfathers mentor lord?playlist=structure%3Anews","story":"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge today announced the name of the newest addition to the royal family, Prince Louis Arthur Charles.

Possibly complicating matters was the fact that Denzel Washington was sitting next to him at the table.“When someone says you’re like your idol,” Jordan said, “It’s like: ‘Really? You see that in me?’ I’d only done that one movie. But then I started using it as motivation,” he said. “I wanted to pop up on Denzel’s radar. He’s the OG. If I could get recognition from him, I know I’m going down the right path, you know?”Denzel: We’re only getting further apart in this technological ageFinally, Washington broke in with a booming laugh: “And here we are, Mike! Looks like it’s working out already,” he said.In truth, it would be hard for an actor to choose a better role model than Washington. In a career ning more than 40 years and 50 films – and kicked off by the hit TV drama St Elsewhere – Washington, 63, has been nominated for nine Academy Awards. He won twice: for best actor as a terrifying rogue cop in Training Day and for best supporting actor as a Union soldier in an African-American army unit in Glory. And he was nominated for best actor Oscars in both of the past two years.Jordan (left, with Kevin Durand) in the 2013’s ‘Fruitvale Station’ (Weinstein Company)In the past decade, Washington has ruled the stage, too. He won a Tony Award for best actor in the revival of August Wilson’s Fences in 2010, later directing and starring in an Oscar-nominated film version. He led the acclaimed revival of A Raisin in the Sun in 2014. And today (26 April), he will open again on Broadway in a revival of Eugene O’Neill’s play The Iceman Cometh, a searing and (at four hours long) monumental drama about the lies we tell ourselves to get through life.Like Washington, Jordan, 31, got his big break on television: on HBO’s The Wire, when he was just 15. After his heartbreaking performance in Fruitvale Station, about the last day in the life of a transit-police shooting victim, he starred in the popular Rocky reboot Creed. And this year, he played the villain, Erik Killmonger, in the Marvel juggernaut Black Panther, winning perhaps the best reviews of anyone in the extremely well-reviewed cast.Next month, he stars in Fahrenheit 451 on HBO, a dystopian film based on the novel by Ray Bradbury. Jordan plays a “fireman,” part of a state-sanctioned brigade that hunts down readers and burns books. His company, Outlier Society Productions, is one of the film’s producers and also among the first to adopt inclusion riders, requiring ersity among cast and crew, as called for by Frances McDormand from the stage of this year’s Academy Awards.Over a cocktail hour at the Lambs Club in Manhattan (a Diet Coke for Washington, a sauvignon blanc for Jordan), the actors traded notes about creating characters and the socially minded work that really matters to them. These are excerpts from the conversation.Galanes: If Mike reminds people of a young Denzel, who did young Denzel remind people of?Washington: I never saw it that way. I never even thought about movie stars. My goal was to be on Broadway, to earn $650 a week. My hero was James Earl Jones. And I came to acting green. I was taking pre-law courses, then journalism courses. Then I took an acting class and got bit by the bug. So I came down to Lincoln Centre and saw plays and stage actors.Galanes: But all those things you did – law, journalism, acting – they’re all about getting to the bottom of a story, right?Washington: I like that part: building a character. You start with the material that gives you clues. If you’re playing a boxer, you want to throw out punches. If you’re playing a conductor, you want to get on a train.Galanes: And the script?Washington: Sure, but you don’t know who the character is just by reading the script. I don’t read a script and go, “Now, I get it!” That’s just the beginning. The first thread you pull.Jordan: The script tells you what’s going up on screen. But the biggest part, the fun part, is figuring out what happened to that character before page one of the script. What kind of food does he like? Did he get into fights going to school? That back story determines the choices you make within the confines of the script. And going through that process with the director is a big part of the collaboration. Now I’ve got notebooks and notebooks of back stories. Some directors may want you to add something or change your version. That’s when you try to find common ground.Washington won an Oscar for his role as rogue cop Alonzo in 2001’s ‘Training Day’ (Warner Bros)Galanes: Is that why you’ve both worked with directors repeatedly? Mike with Ryan Coogler Denzel with Spike Lee and Antoine Fuqua. Your common ground?Washington (laughing): Maybe they’re the ones who called. What you’re saying is part of it, but I don’t think it’s just one way.Jordan: Those are the roles I was lucky enough to get. Ryan and I have worked together three times, and I have a really close relationship with him. But I said no to lots of other things with other people in between. They weren’t right. Personally, I think you’re defined by what you say no to.Washington: I say yes to everything!Galanes: Why do I doubt that? Managing a career as big as yours must take a lot of work.Washington: Not now. Maybe early on. Now, I just do what I want to do. And you don’t want to walk down the same road twice. I’m sure after doing Iceman Cometh, I won’t be looking to do another play.Washington: Yeah, not for a while.Galanes: You’re too young to remember this, Mike. But early in his career, Denzel was so beloved for playing good guys – in Glory and Cry Freedom – that we all freaked out when he started playing villains: in Training Day, American Gangster. And he was even better at bad guys! Was that about walking down different roads?Playing Killmonger (right) in ‘Black Panther’ brought rave reviews for Jordan (MarvelDisney)Jordan: So much trickles down from the director. That’s why I try to choose the ones who make the best environments to work in, so we can maybe make something as good as Training Day. You don’t want to go into a project with somebody who won’t be helpful to your process – or vice versa.Galanes: I read this funny thing about you, Mike: you started choosing projects where you wouldn’t die in the end?Jordan: It started with my mom, who’s super emotional. When I shot my death scene in The Wire, she was on set. And the PAs kept coming to me and saying: ‘You may want to check on your mom.’ I go see her, and she’s sitting there bawling. I’m just a kid. I’m going, ‘Come on, Ma. You’re embarrassing me.’ And after Fruitvale Station, I was like, ‘Man, this is really affecting her.’ But there was another thing, too. Look at Denzel’s career. I want people to see me win. I want audiences to see me ending up on top – not dying. I want to be the leading man.Washington: Man, I got underwear older than that.Jordan: That was the real thought process: How do I become a leading man? I know phenomenal actors who can’t open movies overseas. How do you become the guy who can carry a film?Washington: So, you study the game?Galanes Is that why you went down the superhero route?Galanes You probably made up for it with Black Panther. Why no superheroes for you, Denzel?Galanes: Superheroes have changed. When Denzel might have played one, they were dull. The villains were interesting: Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger. Like you in Black Panther, Mike.Washington: When I was a teenager, Shaft and Super Fly, those were our superheroes. I remember watching Super Fly with my boy Carl, and when we got back to the projects, he carved the character’s name – Priest – on the elevator door. And Richard Roundtree in those long leather coats in Shaft.Galanes: Both of your new projects are dark. Iceman Cometh is brutal. And in Fahrenheit 451, competing ideas are so scary that people decide to burn all the books and kill the readers. Why choose them now?27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 Galanes: It’s powerful to watch a black man in your role.Jordan: But it wasn’t all there on the page. I needed to make sure that he was willing to collaborate, to change some things to help me, as a black man, feel more comfortable in that role. And my company’s co-producing it alongside HBO was important to me too. This is my first time working with the director and the network, giving my opinion and hoping that it’s taken seriously.Washington (laughing): Getting your big boy voice.Galanes Like coming back to the stage, Denzel?Washington: Yeah. Then we boiled it down to Iceman and King Lear. And he said: ‘Let’s do Lear five years from now.’ I said: “OK, we’ll do that next – God willing.”Washington: Eugene O’Neill. That simple. The chance to interpret his brilliant material. You know, my first role on stage, when I was a student at Fordham, was in The Emperor Jones. I’ve always loved O’Neill. And here I am, 40 years later, coming back to him in Iceman.Galanes: Your character, Hickey, seems like the life of the party at first, but what a tortured soul he turns out to be. What drew you to him?Washington: His desire to see people happy. Even when he knows he can’t make that happen, that desire is still there in him.Galanes: It’s a mountain of a play – four hours long. Is it hard to maintain that intensity every night?‘Fahrenheit 451’ sees Jordan plays a ‘fireman’, part of a state-sanctioned brigade that hunts down readers and burns books (HBO)Washington: Listen, this is what I love: acting on stage. And I don’t have to do anything else. Just be in this play. So, don’t feel sorry for me compared to most workers in America.Galanes: Is theatre on your radar, Mike?Jordan: Down the line. But right now, I want to take care of my family financially and grow my production company. That’s the big thing I want to do: set my family up.Jordan: As a kid, you don’t see your circumstances. I didn’t. It’s not until you look back and think, ‘Man, we were poor!’ My parents really hid that from me. They kept me safe.Washington: It wasn’t that tough. I was having a good time. A lot of my boys went to prison.Jordan: That’s why I want to take care of my family now. Then let me go and work on my craft, do something to fulfil me on the inside. That’s what I think theatre is going to be for me – when I’m older. What do you love about it, Denzel?Washington: The energy from the audience is immediate. And you get to develop a full life. See, in film, you might shoot the end first, then the middle. But on stage, it’s the full score of the character’s life. And you always get another night.Washington: In film, you don’t get another night to shoot a scene. You can try to fix it in other scenes. But film is a director’s medium. Theatre is for actors. We’re directed, but once the curtain goes up, it belongs to us. And every night’s as different as the audience. Some nights, they cheer the whole way through others, they don’t cheer at all.Galanes: Let me shift gears. We’re living through a time right now where men in power who’ve done ugly things –Washington: No. We’re not ‘living through a time right now’. It’s always been this way, from the beginning of time. Pick one: from Caesar to Caligula. Now, it’s just on the news cycle every 15 seconds.Jordan: And opinion is now fact – because anyone with a Twitter handle can say it.Washington: It doesn’t even have to be true it just has to be first.Galanes: Hang on, I’m asking something different: Based on your years as a powerful figure, why do you think some guys turn to ugly behaviour, and others don’t?Washington: Nobody’s perfect, man. Don’t put me on a pedestal, if that’s what you’re trying to do. I’m just a human being. I made mistakes I’ll make some more. Hopefully, you learn from them. My mother always said, ‘Keep it simple.’ The older I get, the more I understand her: cut away the fat. When you’re younger, you want to see, taste, touch.Washington (laughing): There you have it. But when you get to be my age, you learn you don’t have to. I have a beautiful wife, beautiful children, a great job. What more do I need?Jordan: And people like us, actors of colour, we don’t get a lot of second chances. It’s a different type of scrutiny. Knowing it’s not all fair and equal, you’ve got to make smart decisions in the moment.Washington: I remember going home one time and saying to my mother, ‘Hey, Ma, did you ever think that I...’ And she said: ‘Stop right there! Do you know all the people who’ve been praying for your raggedy butt?’ You don’t get there by yourself.Jordan: That’s crazy! I was just thinking: I’m going to church in the morning – because I know the people there have always prayed for me. Their blessings have protected me from terrible situations. That’s how I think about keeping it simple: remembering where it started – that village, that tribe that kept you safe.Galanes: And it was 38 years between Sidney Poitier’s Oscar for best actor and yours.Galanes: How about opportunities for people of colour?Washington: That’s why I’m here! That’s why I’m still in the race. And I’m passing the baton. What a lot of people don’t know is: when you pass the baton, you keep running behind the other runner, you don’t just stop. I’m like, ‘Make the turn, bring it home!’ I like helping people. I want to see them do well.Black Panther star reveals Denzel Washington paid for his acting classDenzel schools journalist with response to \u0027fake news\u0027 questionHow to stop Denzel Washington stealing your sceneJordan: That’s why I want to produce so much. I like creating opportunities for people.Galanes: You were right out of the gate on inclusion riders, Mike. The first to say, ‘My company guarantees that casts and crews will be erse.’Jordan: That’s super important to me. No matter what community we’re talking about. Everybody should be in a position where they can win.Washington: I’m just wired that way.Jordan: My path is my path. I can’t take nothing away from nobody, and nobody can take nothing away from me. I’m running my race. But we can still encourage each other.Washington: What’s the harm in that? You’ll never see a U-Haul behind a hearse.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship“We are going after the money,” Boris Johnson promised after being questioned on the absence of specific measures to impose sanctions and financial penalties on the UK assets of Russian oligarchs closely aligned to President Putin. But when pressed by MPs on why decisive action was not being taken, the foreign secretary replied: “This is not a country where we in the government can say ‘Oi! We think this so-and-so deserves to have his or her collar felt’. This is not how it works.” While Theresa May may yet impose sanctions against Putin-supporting billionaires in response to the attempted murder of the Russian spy Sergei Skripal, her government’s track record has been marred by procrastination and prevarication.   Privately, the prime minister regards the exploitation of London as a haven for dirty Russian money as a serious problem. She once listened in stunned silence as a senior MI6 officer briefed her on the activities of Russian organised crime and certain oligarchs in the UK. And in 2016 she authorised the National Security Council to review why and how wealthy Russians buy property in London. But she has been nervous about taking action. For the past three years she has dithered on implementing a legally-enforceable register that will force all foreign companies that own UK property to disclose the identity of their owners.Russia claims Skripals poisoned using toxin possessed by UK and USRussia has been spying on the Skripals for at least five years- UKRussia stock market crashes after US imposes sanctions on oligarchsFreezing property assets is the key to inflicting pain on the Russian state and its compliant plutocrats. Since 2004, £190m of UK property has been subject to criminal investigation as suspected proceeds of corruption. The London property market has been skewed by laundered money, as The Independent revealed exclusively in 2014. Prices are being artificially driven up by wealthy, influential, foreign men who want to hide their assets in the UK.Multi-million pound payments are accepted without their origin being questioned. Oligarchs hide ownership behind anonymous shell companies registered in secretive jurisdictions while a London address offers a veneer of legitimacy and prestige that helps launder reputations as well as cash. Transparency International estimates that Russians account for £729m of the £4.4bn acquired in UK property via what it regards as “suspicious wealth”.There is no suggestion that all London property bought by Russian oligarchs is derived from illegal or criminal sources. For some Russian plutocrats buying luxury property in London is a symbol that they have been accepted by the British establishment. This is illustrated by the eleven bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square that Oleg Deripaska, regarded as one of Putin’s favourite oligarchs, snapped up for £17m through an offshore company registered in the British Virgin Islands in 2003 and now worth £45m.Oleg Deripaska’s 11-bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square is seen as a symbol of acceptance by the British establishment (Alamy)Built in the 1820s, it was formerly the home of Sir Henry “Chips” Channon, society host, Conservative MP and notoriously indiscreet diarist. It was designed for entertaining royalty and diplomats with its grand staircase, Madame Récamier sofas and flamboyant decor. When Harold Nicolson arrived at the house for dinner, he exclaimed: “Oh my God, how rich and powerful Lord Channon has become.” The equally grand and historic mansion Beechwood House, set in 11 acres of land in Highgate, north London, was bought by the powerful oligarch Alisher Usmanov in 2008 for £48m from the Emir of Qatar. Usmanov is a major shareholder in Arsenal football club and has amassed a £14bn fortune from metals and commodities and has long been regarded as a pro-Putin figure. And his fellow football-loving oligarch Roman Abramovich owns houses on Kensington Palace Gardens and Chester Square, Belgravia, and apartments on Eaton Square and Manresa Road, Chelsea.  One Hyde Park, one of the wealthiest residencies in the world, was famously bought up by Russian oligarchs (Alamy)It is not just prestigious houses that attract Russian billionaires. The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return for their cash, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship.  Since 2008 iniduals have been able to obtain “golden visas” if they invest as little as £2m in a UK business. And for £5m, they gain the right to become a UK resident on a temporary basis and then, after five years, a British citizen. By 2014, almost 700 rich Russians had paid for entry using this method, with Roman Rotenberg, son of Putin’s former judo partner Boris Rotenberg, being the most prominent example. He owns a mews house on Cadogan Lane in Belgravia.The government is taking some action to stop London becoming what David Cameron described as a haven to hide “dodgy foreign cash”. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is investigating a list of wealthy iniduals, not just oligarchs, to assess if they have used the UK to launder their fortunes.An estimated 149 iniduals are restricted on their travel and ability to conduct business in the UK. And the Unexplained Wealth Orders is now law, whereby the NCA can demand that the oligarch explain the origin of his wealth. But the problem with this order, according to a Russian businessman, is that the inidual in question could too easily lie about his source of wealth and instead produce a document that shows his fortune was based on, for example, share idends. Roman Rotenberg gained entry to the UK using the ‘golden visas’ method (Getty)Boris Johnson protests that the government cannot act directly against the pro-Putin brigade because it cannot interfere in criminal investigations. But it could make specific changes to the law, notably an amendment to the Sanctions and Money Laundering Bill, which would give Magnitsky-type powers to freeze the UK assets of relevant iniduals, including intelligence agents or other officials who have abused human rights.  The government could also implement the register of inidual owners of foreign and offshore companies that own UK property. But that bill has been delayed until 2021 and campaigners smell a cover-up after the government announced that one reason for the delay is that the Business Department has commissioned research on the impact of the register on investment decisions. “This is a crucial moment for the UK’s future trading relationship with the rest of the world, and we must proceed with as good an understanding as possible of the potential impacts on legitimate inward investment,” said foreign office minister Lord Ahmad. Skripal attack aftermath – in picturesSkripal attack aftermath – in picturesInvestigators in protective clothing remove a van from an address in Winterslow near Salisbury in Wiltshire, as police and members of the armed forces continue to investigate the suspected nerve agent attack on Russian double agent Sergei SkripaA police officer on duty near the protective tent which covers the bench where a man and woman were apparently poisoned with what was later identified as a nerve agent, in SalisburyMilitary in protective clothing prior to removing vehicles from a car park in SalisburyPersonnel in protective coveralls and breathing equipment cover an ambulance with a tarpaulin at the Salisbury District HospitalHome Secretary Amber Rudd visits the scene of the nerve agent attack in SalibsuryMembers of the emergency services in hazard suits fix the tent over the bench where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were foundOfficials in protective suits check their equipment before repositioning a forensics tent A poice officer stands guard outside a branch of the Italian chain restaurant ZizziDetective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who assisted the Russian ex-spy targeted with a nerve agent, was also hospitalisedSergei Skripal days before he was exposed to a mystery substance that has left him fighting for lifeSergei Skripal speaks to his lawyer from behind bars seen on a screen of a monitor outside a courtroom in Moscow.Yulia Skripal, who is thought to have been poisoned along with her father, Sergei SkripalProgress to legislation has thus been painfully slow. An insight into why political rhetoric has not resulted in legislative action can be gleaned by the recent flotation on the London stock exchange of the Russian energy company En+, then owned by Deripaska and chaired by former Conservative energy minister Lord Barker. For it revealed a fundamental dispute between MI6 and the financial regulators on how to make oligarchs who park their assets in London more accountable and transparent.MI6 and the prime minister’s national security advisor, Sir Mark Sedwill, were furious with the Stock Exchange and Financial Conduct Authority for failing to consult them and conduct the required due diligence of En+. Their main concern was about whether Rusal, a subsidiary of En+, had been manufacturing aluminium powder used by Russian arms firms for military purposes. Rusal adamantly denied it – yet its own website previously indicated that the defence industry was among the users of the type of aluminium powder it manufactured.Sir Mark Sedwill was furious when the required due diligence of En+ was not carried out ahead of its flotation on the London stock exchange (Getty)The En+ group could be a candidate for new sanctions as the Russian state-owned VTB Bank is a major shareholder with a 4.35 per cent holding, while Deripaska is known for being close to the Russian President. Leaked US diplomatic cables described Deripaska as “among the two to three oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis” and is “a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin’s trips abroad”.Indeed, when the US imposed sanctions on seven oligarchs and the 12 companies they own or control last week, shares tumbled. Deripaska was among those affected, as was Rotenberg.  Still, Britiain cannot follow suit. And the anger of National Security officials and MI6 En+\u0027s flotation last year stemmed precisely from their belief that it typified the complacent approach to Russian money in London, which the infamous oligarch Boris Berezovsky once told me was “70 per cent dirty”. The inability to impose sanctions is similarly emblematic.The London Stock Exchange has long been a vehicle for Russian companies and oligarchs to raise money in shares and bonds – an estimated $200bn (£140bn) since 2004. Last summer, Russia’s largest gold producer Polyus, controlled by Suleyman Kerimov, a Russian senator awarded the Order of Merit by Putin, raised $879m. There are now 57 predominantly-Russian companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, more than anywhere else outside Moscow.   The wealthiest Russian oligarchs who call London homeA little-noticed loophole to avoid sanctions is that Russian sovereign debt is permitted to be sold in London. “We are allowing Russian sovereign debt to be sold in the UK and that debt is being used to reimburse Russians to bring back their money onshore in Moscow terms,” said the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. “As that gold is moving towards Moscow, we are quite extraordinarily enabling those bond and debt auctions...This is one of those areas where sanctions on businesses are being compensated by the Russian state.”Just hours after Theresa May’s retaliation against the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, Gazprom issued a $750m eurobond in London and the following day the Russian government joined in by issuing a $4bn bond in the capital. Within hours, the Russian Embassy issued a revealing tweet: “Business as usual?”Could the nerve-agent attack in Salisbury be the unwitting catalyst for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London? (Getty)But the irony is that it is the attempted assassination of a Russian spy and double agent living in Salisbury and the murder of Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov in Surrey that could be the unwitting catalysts for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London.Mark Hollingsworth is the author of “Londongrad – From Russia with Cash’’ or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Ben Widdicombe visited the Marvel Comics creator at his home and heard him declare: ‘Nobody has more freedom’Stan Lee, the Marvel Comics maestro and co-creator of Spider-Man, X-Men and Black Panther, lives in a world of heroes and villains. But these days, it can be hard to tell which is which.Few creators have left as profound a mark on popular culture. According to The-Numbers, a box office data site, films featuring Lee’s superheroes have grossed more than $24bn (£17.2bn) worldwide. He has a huge Twitter following, and admirers have included Federico Fellini, Ronald Reagan and George RR Martin, the author of Game of Thrones.“Stan is right up there with Walt Disney as one of the great creators of not just one character, but a whole galaxy of characters that have become part of our lives,” Martin said. “Right now, I think he’s probably bigger than Disney.”Stan Lee\u0027s Avengers: Infinity War cameo might be his funniest yetYet at the summit of Lee’s career, storm clouds have gathered.The last year has brought an unsettling mix of tragedy and scandal, including the death in July of Joan Lee, his wife of almost 70 years suspicions that millions of dollars have been siphoned from his accounts even gossip reports that a former business associate stole his blood to sell to fans.Lee with his late wife Joan in 2011. Since she died last year the household has been thrown into disarray (Getty)Earlier this month, The Hollywood Reporter published an investigation that said Lee, 95, is the victim of “elder abuse”, partly at the hands of his 67-year-old daughter, Joan Celia Lee. The Daily Beast reported in March that Lee, who is said to be worth around $50m, was “surrounded by a panoply of Hollywood charlatans and mountebanks” and being “picked apart by vultures”.A radio talk show in Orlando, Florida, even aired a rumour that he is being “held captive” by handlers who “have him basically locked up in the house”.But on a recent visit to Lee’s home in the Bird Streets, a celebrity enclave high in the hills of West Hollywood, California, the man himself said otherwise.True, a 6ft 4in security guard, with a pistol on his hip, opened the front gate. And Lee hasn’t been getting out as much since a bout of pneumonia left him short of breath and looking frail. He also can no longer read because of macular degeneration.Lee pictured in New York in 1978: ‘Lately, I have found out that a lot of the money we made is no longer available for me’ (Getty)Despite all that, Lee seemed relaxed and enthusiastic. Wearing a yellow shirt and beige polyester slacks in his poolside sitting room, its Sherwood-green carpet bleached by 40 years of California sunshine, he welcomed a reporter into his home.So, is he a prisoner in his own house, surrounded by real-life supervillains?“I’m the luckiest guy in the world,” Lee said, chuckling and sounding like a 95-year-old teenager. “Nobody has more freedom.”He also defended his daughter, known as JC, against claims that she has been physically abusive and a financial drain. “My daughter has been a great help to me,” he said. “Life is pretty good.”A house in disarrayFor four decades, Lee has lived in a relatively modest two-storey house in the middle of what has become some of Los Angeles’ most valuable real estate. DrDre is a neighbour, and Leonardo DiCaprio lives down the block, on a street where houses can list for north of $30m.Inside the suburban-style home, a nurse and a maid bustled in the kitchen. Although Lee seemed at ease, the armed guard lent an air of surveillance that made it difficult to entirely relax.The house is a time capsule of late 1970s Hollywood. Decorated by his late wife, it is dotted with ceramic animals, carved figures in African and Asian styles, and large gilt-framed mirrors hung on mirrored walls. Empty hooks surrounded by dusty outlines sit amid prints and original works by noted artists – Joan Miro, Pablo Picasso, Alexander Calder, Salvador Dali and Roy Lichtenstein – suggesting a home being slowly eroded.“My wife, she’s the only person in the world that I would know of who would put a big mirror on top of a big mirror,” Lee said. “And when she was here, she had so many paintings, all over. Most of them have left now. My daughter took a lot of them, and a lot of them have gone elsewhere.”It’s the vagueness about what has “gone elsewhere” that has some of Lee’s friends so worried.Since Lee’s wife died last year, his household has been thrown into disarray, with three factions of once-trusted aides vying for control. Lee’s current gatekeeper is Keya Morgan, who has ousted former staff.Producer Keya Morgan and Joan C Lee – are they real-life supervillains holding Lee hostage? (Getty)A former memorabilia dealer from New York, Morgan moved to Los Angeles as the executive producer of the mobster biopic Gotti and now describes himself as a “producing partner of John Travolta”. Sitting at Lee’s side, he was dressed in a black suit and tie, black bowler hat and dark sunglasses, which he lowered on his nose to see indoors.In February, Morgan called police to the house to physically remove Lee’s longtime road manager, Mac Anderson, known as Max. Anderson was accused of, among other things, attempting to bribe a nurse to make statements that Lee was being held hostage. “He got into a big fight with Stan and Stan’s daughter” and was fired soon afterward, Morgan said.Reached by phone, Anderson declined to comment.Also out was Jerry Olivarez, a Hollywood publicist who briefly obtained power of attorney over Lee’s affairs last year, during which time more than $1m left the Marvel creator’s accounts. That included a $300,000 cheque made out to Hands of Respect, a novelty company owned by Olivarez and Lee that makes a $10 lapel pin advocating racial harmony.In unrelated matters, $1.4m may have vanished in a series of wire transfers, and a Chanel handbag full of cash may be missing from the house, according to Morgan. Also, a trove of Marvel memorabilia, including character sketches and figurines, is the subject of disputed ownership between Anderson and Lee, as reported by The Hollywood Reporter.Lee may be a creative genius, but he isn’t a financial one. “I’ve been very careless with money,” he said.“I had a partner or two who – since I’m not a money counter – I let them take care of keeping track of the money we made,” Lee said, as he sipped a bottle of mineral water to soothe his raspy voice. “Lately, I have found out that a lot of the money we made is no longer available for me. I don’t know where it is, but a guy, and maybe one or two others, have found a way to take it.“So, I feel bad about it, and of course we have a lawyer trying to get it back again,” he said. “But money isn’t worth losing your cool about, you know.”The child of Romanian Jewish immigrants, Stanley Lieber was born in New York City in 1922. He was hired in 1939 as an assistant at Timely Comics, the not-especially-promising ision of a pulp magazine publisher that would eventually be renamed Marvel.Following a staff exodus the next year, the newly rechristened Lee (an alias he adopted to save his real name for the great novels he aspired to write) was appointed its editor. The two great motifs of his life were established: a nagging feeling that his work in comics was cultural schlock and the fact that he would be a lifelong corporate employee, never owning the rights to his creations.His greatest streak of inspiration began in 1961, when Lee was almost 40 and thoroughly disenchanted with his career. With artist Jack Kirby, he created the Fantastic Four, a hit he bested the next year by inventing Spider-Man with artist Steve Ditko.Among the enduring characters he created over the next decade with those artists, and others, are the X-Men, Iron Man, the Hulk, Thor, Doctor Strange and, in 1966, Black Panther: an African warrior-king whose recent film adventure has grossed more than $1.3bn.“I’m sorry I didn’t introduce black characters a little sooner,” Lee said. “I tried to create an Asian superhero, I tried to create a South American superhero. And at that point I also was thinking it’s ridiculous that we don’t have a black superhero.”Asked if contemporary comics and films could be doing a better job of representing women and superheroes of colour, he replied, “yes”, but expanded: “You can’t force anything on the public. But if you do a black hero or heroine and you see that it’s well-received at the newsstand, then you’d be an idiot not to come up with more stories like that. Everything depends on the marketplace.”Evolution of Spider-Man: from the comics to Captain America: Civil WarEvolution of Spider-Man: from the comics to Captain America: Civil WarFirst introduction, art by Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko.First solo series, art by Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko.

While he has made exponentially more money than any of his Marvel co-creators, he only ever collected a salary, and does not receive any continuing royalties from the films based on his characters.In 2005, he received a one-time payment of $10m from Marvel, to settle a provision in his contract that had entitled him to 10 per cent of the profits from television and film adaptations. Four years later, Disney bought Marvel for $4bn it is unclear whether Lee was able to reap any benefit. (As Marvel’s chairman emeritus, he still receives a salary, reported to be $1m.)And while his personal appearances (including charging fans $120 for an autograph) are a lucrative source of income, later-life attempts to create wholly owned superhero properties have foundered.Stan Lee Media, a digital content startup, crashed in 2000 and landed his business partner, Peter F Paul, in prison for securities fraud. And Lee is embroiled in disputes with POW! Entertainment, the company he started in 2001 to create new shows, including Stripperella, a cartoon animation starring Pamela Anderson.POW! was sold last year to Camsing International, a Hong Kong-based company seeking to clone Marvel for the Asian market. Lee says he has not been paid, which the company denies. “Mr Lee has been paid and continues to be paid by the company,” said Shane Duffy, the chief executive of POW! “Statements like this only heighten our concern for Stan’s wellbeing.”Lee and actor Chadwick Boseman at the LA world premiere of ‘Black Panther’ in January (Getty)As part of the escalating fight, Morgan and Lee’s daughter entered the POW! offices on Santa Monica Boulevard on the night of 14 March and removed items they say belong to Lee. They triggered a silent alarm, prompting POW! to file a police report.The Beverly Hills police subsequently dropped the burglary investigation, but the fighting continues. “They’re acting as if they bought the company and everything on the four walls belong to them,” said Lee, sounding downcast. “So, another lawsuit.”An Oscar for Stan Lee?Outside the bubble of legal drama and personal strife, however, Lee’s creative influence remains at an all-time high.“There’s no doubt that Stan, in terms of American popular culture, he’s one of the giants of the 20th century,” Martin said. “Spider-Man and Iron Man the X-Men – they’re still as viable as ever.”From the floral sofa in his sitting room, Lee is a font of highly entertaining stories from the glory days, even if some of them sound taller than his 1962 creation Giant-Man.Like the time Picasso was so taken by Joan Lee’s beauty that he approached the couple in a New York restaurant and sketched her on their tablecloth. “We ran home to tell my father about what happened,” Lee said. But, “in our excitement, we had left the drawing in the restaurant. We never found it!”Stan Lee turns 94: His 25 best cameos in Marvel filmsStan Lee has already filmed cameos for four more Marvel moviesStan Lee has only good things to say about Tom Holland\u0027s Spider-ManOr the time when DiCaprio told Lee that he had written to the president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, lobbying for Lee to receive an honorary Oscar for his numerous cameos over the years. (Lee appears in nearly every Marvel movie, including Black Panther, in which he plays a gambler in a South Korean casino.)DiCaprio also wants to portray Lee in a film about the Marvel creator, according to Morgan, who accompanied Lee on a recent visit to DiCaprio’s house. (A spokesman for DiCaprio would not confirm this account of their conversation.)The thought of a biopic starring DiCaprio gave Lee pause. He looked out over the pool, to the canyon beyond, and pondered being portrayed by an Oscar-winning actor.“I don’t know if he could capture the essence of me,” he said, after a moment. “We have to talk about that.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Others were able to log in but, when they did, some or all of their account details had disappeared.Customers have also reported that they could access other people’s accounts, including account numbers, sort codes and transaction histories.TSB apology after customers complain of online banking ‘data breach’​TSB could not say how many people were still locked out of the service or when the problems would be fully resolved.The ongoing IT disaster began with botched upgrade work on Friday, but has developed into one of the worst technology failures to hit a UK retail bank and has left many of TSB’s 1.9 million customers furious.Some said they were falling behind with bill payments.Others said they were worried their money had simply disappeared.Many customers expressed frustration that the bank was not being clear about what had happened.That came after Paul Pester, CEO of TSB, tweeted on Wednesday morning: “Our mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running. Thank you for your patience and for bearing with us.”Our mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running. Thank you for your patience and for bearing with us.MPs demanded answers from TSB on Tuesday. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury Committee, said: “The reports of unauthorised transactions, access to other customers’ accounts and failures of in-branch services have all the hallmarks of an IT meltdown.“This is yet another addition to the litany of failures of banking IT systems. Potentially, millions of customers could be affected by uncertainty and disruption.“It simply isn’t good enough to expose customers to IT failures, including delays in paying bills and an inability to access their own money.”A spokesperson for the Financial Conduct Authority said on Tuesday that the watchdog was “aware of the issue and liaising with the firm”. A spokesperson for the Information Commissioner’s Office said: “We are aware of a potential data breach in relation to the TSB and are making enquiries.”Mr Pester said on Tuesday that he was “truly sorry” about the problems caused. “We’re still seeing issues with access to our digital services,” he added. “One of the steps we need to take to resolve this is to take our mobile app and online banking down for a few hours.“We did this at around 10.30 this morning and we hope to be back up later this afternoon.”The problems stemmed from a switch to a new online banking system. TSB had rented the technology behind its app and online banking from Lloyds Banking Group since the two companies split. Over the weekend, TSB moved customers to a new platform which experienced some teething problems.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But this will not work. The UK has decided to withdraw from the Union. It wants to be sovereign and be able to set its own rulebook, to have its own supervision and enforcement system.“In doing so, the UK will move away from EU rules. It will not accept common EU supervision and enforcement tools. These are precisely the essential building blocks of our post-crisis financial regulation. They ensure that the internal market can exist and function correctly.‘Everything must change so that everything can stay the same’, to paraphrase Lampedusa. But this will not work.“The EU understands that the UK does not want to become a \u0027rule-taker\u0027. But the UK also needs to understand that the EU cannot accept mutual market access without the common safeguards that underpin it.”Mr Barnier added that relying on Britain to regulate services sold into EU markets was “not something that any country in the world would accept”. He described Brexit as “a lose-lose situation”, telling his audience: “I do not see added value in Brexit and so far, nobody has shown us any.”“Outside of the customs union and the single market, there can be no frictionless trade. Businesses will be faced with non-tariff barriers and border checks that do not exist today,” the chief negotiator warned.Allowing British firms to sell services into the EU is crucial for the UK because around 80 per cent of the British economy comes from providing services, with about 43 per cent of British exports heading to the EU in 2016. The Government has said it want any trade deal with the EU to cover services.Speaking at the same event Mr Barnier said the cost of Brexit “will be substantially higher for the UK than for the EU”, noting that in terms of “trade dependency” the EU27 accounts for around 50 per cent of UK export and imports, while the UK market accounts for 7 per cent of EU exports and 4 per cent of imports. Theresa May has asked for the EU and UK to mutually recognise each others\u0027 rules and regulations as adequate (AP)The Brussels Brexit chief also brushed away claims by British commentators that European businesses desperately needs the City of London for finance. He cited research by the European Central Bank that any problem caused by losing access to London\u0027s banks appears limited and said the claim was not what we hear from market participants, and is not the analysis that we have made ourselves.In her Mansion House speech last month Ms May called for a “comprehensive system of mutual recognition” where both blocs pledged to keep their regulations equivalent to one another to facilitate trade. She said that under such a system “UK law may not necessarily be identical to EU law, but it should achieve the same outcomes”.Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

Mr Barnier has previously said such an approach is only compatible with a free trade agreement similar to that the EU has with Japan, a country on the other side of the world. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In his capacity as head of the CIA, Mr Pompeo travelled to North Korea to lay the groundwork for the high-stakes summit.While Mr Trump has heralded the opportunity for a deal to dismantle North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme, both Mr Bolton and Mr Pompeo have evinced scepticism about the sincerity of North Korea’s motives.In addition to helping prepare the North Korea summit, Mr Pompeo will help the White House navigate a crucial and fast-approaching deadline for the Iran nuclear deal.Mr Trump must decide by mid-May whether to continue lifting sanctions on Iran, as dictated by the pact. Both the president and Mr Pompeo have heaped disdain on the agreement, and Mr Trump said in January that he was agreeing to waive some sanctions “only in order to secure our European allies’ agreement to fix the terrible flaws of the Iran nuclear deal”.“This is a last chance. In the absence of such an agreement, the United States will not again waive sanctions in order to stay in the Iran nuclear deal”, Mr Trump said at the time.During a visit to Washington this week, French president Emmanuel Macron worked to persuade Donald Trump to preserve the deal. But Mr Macron conceded he faced slim odds of succeeding.“My view – I don’t know what your president will decide – is that he will get rid of this deal on his own, for domestic reasons,” Mr Macron told reporters.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

What are the benefits\u0026nbspand can it really work?What is universal basic income?Universal basic income (UBI) is a welfare programme in which all citizens receive an unconditional sum of money from the government.\u0026nbspIt is hailed as a progressive system and its proponents include billionaires\u0026nbspMark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk and Richard Branson.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhy is Finland trialing universal basic income?The experiment was launched in\u0026nbspJanuary 2017 and 2,000 participants have been receiving a €560 (£490) monthly basic income payment, which is independent of any other income they may have and not conditional on undertaking an active search for employment.Researchers will\u0026nbspstudy the effect of increasing cash incentives for work and simplifying the social security system on the employment rate of the study participants.The Finnish centre-right government is austerity focused but is looking to reduce the country’s 8.5 per cent unemployment rate. This trial is being viewed as a method of doing just that.\u0026nbspSupporters of a basic income argue it would help get unemployed people into temporary jobs, rather than forcing them to remain unemployed to qualify for benefits.They say it would provide a safety net, address insecurities associated with workers not having full-time staff contracts, and help boost mobility in the labour market as people would have a source of income between jobs.The study will also look at the well-being of the participants and their experiences when communicating and conducting business with the authorities.Did the trial fail?The quick answer is no. There were a number of reports that the experiment had fallen flat because it had proven to be too costly, but Finland says this is not the case.\u0026nbsp“The experiment is proceeding according to plan and will continue until the end of 2018,”\u0026nbspProfessor\u0026nbspOlli Kangas, the leader of the research team at Kela (Social Insurance Institution of Finland), said.How the trial is going so far is unknown and the employment effects across the whole experiment will not be available until the end of 2019 or at the beginning of 2020.“The effects of the experiment will not be published while the experiment is in progress, because a public discussion of the results could influence the behaviour of the test and control groups. That would lead to skewed results,”\u0026nbspMr Kangas said.What next for Finland\u0027s experiment?The experiment will run through until the end of the year after which a detailed study will be released.\u0026nbspIt will compare the group of 2,000 who received UBI\u0026nbspwith a control group of about 173,000, who are made up of people included in the target population but not included in the study.\u0026nbspOne of the primary objectives is to see if\u0026nbspthere are differences in employment rates between those receiving and those not receiving a basic income.Code of ConductInstall our AppsWe use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

The patent pump touched down on the shingle of history. One short waddle for man. But, perhaps, one giant leap into the international bantersphere.We cannot yet know the course on which the world was set, in that portentous moment under the April sun. The lamp of history never lights the path ahead. But the world is nonetheless a brighter place. A new star shines in the firmament. Two wide bottomed black puddings now bestride the narrow world. And the early indications are clear enough: Kim Jong-un is a massive banter lad.That the North Korean leader should have so terrorised neighbours far and near with wild threats of annihilation, and then nipped over the border for a spot of peace-treaty signing is already troubling the mercury on the bants-o-meter, but it’s clear there’s so more to come.Why presence of Kim\u0027s blushing sister could be so significantWhat pulled history back from the tempest of war to the shallows of peace is already a contested matter. Was it eight years of pressure from Obama to apply meaningful economic sanctions to their out-of-control neighbour? Was it Donald Trump calling him “rocketman” on Twitter? Was it that, in scenes Austin Powers didn’t even dare to dream up, his indoor nuclear testing facility now appears to have accidentally blown up the mountain inside which it was meant to be hidden?These are questions to be pored over by the analysts in the coming months, ideally on live TV, as their wives struggle to keep the children bursting in before bedtime like championship wrestlers.In the meantime, what can we know for certain?Well first of all, if you’re prepared to overlook long years of reports of death camps and public execution by anti-aircraft tank, it’s clear that this, the latest and perhaps the last in line of despotic Kim Jongs likes a laugh almost as much as he likes a snack.It had perhaps been imagined that it would peak with his dragging his South Korean counterpart, Moon Jae-in, back over to the dark side of the 38th parallel, for a handshake on his turf that was definitely not in the script, but the lols kept coming.We should celebrate peace in Korea but remain scepticalWhy presence of Kim\u0027s blushing sister could be so significantOff-script moment and missile jokes at Korean border summitKim Jong-un crosses into South Korea for historic meeting North and South prepare for historic Korea summitThe Korea peace talks wouldn\u0027t be happening without TrumpIn what were among the very first words he had ever been heard to say in public, he apologised to the South Korean president for “interrupting your early morning sleep”. At first this was assumed to mean with the various nuclear bombs he has been detonating inside his nearby mountain, but the truth was more prosaic. It was merely that his renegade actions had forced Moon Jae In to have to convene his own National Security Council every time, to discuss the growing likelihood of their own annihilation.Then there was the early morning jog, Kim Jong-style, which is to say, a short ride in a blacked out Mercedes, surrounded by 12 goons, jogging to keep up. At some point, someone may have to tell him, this is not how Keep Fit works.And then, as if nothing in the past 65 years of war had happened, the two men were sitting at a picnic table, set atop what can only be described as turquoise peace decking, chatting like two old friends who’d just bumped into one another in the park.It may be, in the coming months, the world suddenly doesn’t find it all quite so funny.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It said there were 12,503 enforced returns in 2016-17, which was considered a \u0026ldquosuccess given the particularly damaging impact from the number of late claims for asylum.The memo goes on: \u0026ldquoIE has set a target of achieving 12,800 enforced returns in 2017-18, aided by the redistribution of resources towards this area.\u0026nbspThe memo then turns to \u0026ldquoassisted returns which covers cases such as those where an inidual has left the country voluntarily on a flight paid for by the British Government.\u0026ldquoTypically these will be our most vulnerable returnees.

The couple had been expected to get married but split in October 2006.In a louche past life I was almost a member of the British Royal Family. In the early 2000s I dated Ella Windsor, the daughter of Prince and Princess Michael of Kent, he wrote. For three surreal years Ella and I hung about Kensington Palace. We swam naked in the Queen\u0027s pool in Buckingham Palace, we did MDMA in Windsor Castle.When it first emerged they were dating he recalled that he was nicknamed Captain Condom by the British press because as a student he had been in charge of promoting sexual health.

The cosy crowned heads of small Eastern European countries cooked us lamb chops late at night and told us tales of Nazis and communists. It was a wonderful way to spend one\u0027s 20s, he said.His confessions of skinny dipping and taking MDMA, the drug more commonly known as ecstasy, embarrassed the House of Windsor but there was more when he turned his attentions to attitudes inside the Royal Family towards commoners such as Prince Harry\u0027s fianc\u0026eacutee Meghan Markle and the former Kate Middleton.Princess Michael, he said, was of the firm belief that it was a bad idea for royalty to marry commoners. \u0027It\u0027s all very well Ella marrying Mr Taseer from India or Pakistan. Nobody knows what to do with that,\u0027 he quoted her saying.\u0027But the moment the girl down the road thinks she can be princess or queen, it\u0027s all over.

It stands for Duchess of Windsor, the former Wallis Simpson, whose affair with Edward VIII nearly destroyed the Royal Family.Princess Michael, of course, is never far from controversy. The last time was in December last year when she wore a blackamoor brooch, a depiction of a black man widely considered to be racist, to meet Meghan at her first Royal Family\u0027s pre-Christmas lunch. She was forced to apologise.\u0027I daren\u0027t even say I want my coffee black any more. I say, \u0027Without milk\u0027.\u0027 Taseer has quoted her saying.I would have liked to believe her but I had my doubts, he wrote. It was not that her father had allegedly been an SS officer, albeit a reluctant one. Royals and Nazis go together like blini and caviar. It was that everyone above a certain age in Britain is at least a tiny bit racist.But in spite of all that he seemed to be genuinely fond of Princess Michael. Most everybody thought she was \u0027perfectly ghastly\u0027 but I saw a nice side of her.Aatish Taseer claims he took drugs with Lady Gabriella in Windsor CastleLady Gabriella with Prince and Princess Michael of Kent in 2013She could be funny, intelligent, generous and she was a lot more industrious than the other royals. She wrote books and decorated houses! TASEER, who studied at Amherst College in Massachusetts and worked at Vanity Fair where Ella was an intern, was less impressed with others.He wrote: \u0027The British don\u0027t like foreigners coming over and stealing their princes,\u0027 a friend of Princess Michael\u0027s once said to me.It was an odd thing to say because the Royal Family was not just chock-full of foreigners, it was basically foreign itself. It was why someone like Ella did not have a single English relation between her and Queen Victoria who was herself of German descent and married to a German.The son of Indian journalist Tavleen Singh and the late Pakistani politician and businessman Salmaan Taseer, he said he lived in constant fear of being turfed out of Kensington Palace.Quite why his relationship with Ella ended is hard to fathom although friends believe it was because he wanted to move to India and she had no desire to go with him.A talented novelist, he has written books including The Temple-Goers and The Way Things Were. His journalism has included work for Time magazine and the New York Times.But this latest piece has gone down like a lead balloon at Kensington Palace, Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle. Simon Astaire, spokesman for the Michaels, was not prepared to discuss it yesterday. We\u0027re not saying anything. Let\u0027s just cut the conversation dead there, he said.Taseer too did not respond to an invitation to explain why he wrote the piece.

Just look around you. We’ve had one for a while.And now the Government is trying to do something about it.Trouble is, it’s doing completely the WRONG thing.Acting on the advice of campaigners such as Jamie Oliver it plans to start clamping down on what it calls junk food.Under the proposals, buy one, get one free deals will be outlawed.That will make food a lot dearer for the poorest of us.Officials   may also extend the levy on sugary drinks. That will do the same thing.Another name for junk food is: “stuff middle class people don’t like very much”.And that’s the point. These nanny state initiatives always hurt the working class, not the middle classes.When they tried to stop us getting drunk all the time, they whacked a levy on cheap cider — not a bottle of Chablis.And yet alcoholism is just as bad within the better-off classes — just not as heavily reported.And now they’ve turned their attention to supposed junk food.But putting up the prices simply makes it harder for poor people to make ends meet.They are already suffering through low wages, partly the consequence of uncontrolled immigration.People, no matter how poor they are, know that it is not good to eat pizza every night of the week.Not many people do so. But the truth is that the food we eat today is no more fattening than the food we ate back in the 1970s, when everybody was as thin as a dieting whippet on Benzedrine.The real problem is a lack of exercise.People don’t get out any more. They don’t walk.They stay in their homes or drive their cars.Not so long ago the health lobbyists announced that everyone should do 40 minutes of walking per day because the results are so beneficial.But they had to reduce it to 20 minutes because everyone thought 40 minutes was way too onerous.A bit more education in our schools about the benefits of exercise wouldn’t go amiss.“Start Walking Or You’ll Die” would be a decent slogan.Might capture the interest.At the same time the health lobbyists also oppose what they call “fat-shaming”. And yet “fat-shaming” is a free, non-governmental means of persuading fat people not to be fat.I put on weight a few years back and it was only when my teenage son, in an argument, called me “a fat lardy-faced tosser” that I thought I ought to do something about it.Fat-shaming, you see — it works. If ­people think it’s OK to be fat they will stay fat.But leave our food alone. Don’t price the poorest of us out of the treats we all enjoy once in a while. And now I’m off for a walk because some of that weight has come back.How do I know? I told my wife I had a cut on my chin.And she looked at me and said: “Which one?”A GOVERNMENT ­scientist has been sacked for insulting his ­colleagues. He called one of them a “lardarse” and another a “f**kwit”.One bloke was the “Monster From Zagreb” while he was accused of calling another ­simply a “c**ksucker”. Top abuse! And I bet he had a point. The authorities wittered on about how he contravened their policies on bullying.Oh, spare us. If you can’t abuse your work ­colleagues, what fun is there in life?Another alleged insult was “vinegar t*ts”. I don’t know what it means, but I’m going to use it at every available opportunity.THERE are people out there who can show you racism in a handful of dust. They can ­conjure it up out of the air.They are usually idiots. Take the singer Raye, (nope, me neither) for example. She’s claimed a restaurant in London was “racist”.Her male friend, who is black, was refused entrance because of what he was wearing. Shorts and trainers.Listen love, that isn’t racism. That’s called a dress code. You want to eat in a posh restaurant? Then don’t dress like a toddler on his first trip to a paddling pool.Then there’s the BBC Proms. It’s in trouble for ­having cast a white woman to play the part of Maria in West Side Story.Maria is usually ­Hispanic. But if it’s OK to have a black actor playing ­Hamlet, why isn’t it OK to have a white woman ­playing Maria?The poor bloody actress, Sierra Boggess, has even been forced to apologise for having taken the part.And she’s pulled out.This shrieking obsession with race is divisive and stupid.This is to reflect the state’s “cultural ­identity”.If only the same thing would happen here . . . but don’t hold yer breath.THE Windrush fiasco has been hurtful to a generation of Caribbean people who came here, at our invitation, back between the 1940s and 1970s.It’s a genuine scandal. But look how the Lefties are trying to turn it into an assault on our immigration policies.Saying we must be less “hostile” to immigrants coming here now. Opening the borders.But the British public – including a majority of immigrants – still think there is far too much immigration to this country.And we are right to try to impose controls.As ever, never listen to the liberals.BRITISH students taking A levels were deeply confused by a mysterious object in the examination hall.It was circular, with numbers around the outside, and three hands pointing at the numbers. Teachers tried to explain to them: “It’s called a clock. You can tell the time by it. It will show you how long you have to go on your paper.”No use. The kids couldn’t make head nor tail of it. So it was replaced with a digital clock.Here’s the thing. If they’re so thick they can’t tell the time, why are they doing A levels?THE bookies reckon the most likely name for the new royal baby is “Arthur”.But there’s also heavy betting on James, Albert and Henry. All the usual suspects, then.However, you can get odds of 200-1 on the new prince being called Kanye and 150-1 on Barry, which I think would be good.My own choice, though, is Nobby.I’m CERTAIN that’s what they’re going to call it. Prince Nobby.Either that or Princey McPrinceface.THE reason we haven’t seen any aliens is because the gravity on their planets is too strong to let them get away.That’s the latest verdict from a bunch of scientists. They want to come see us, obvs.It’s just that every time they build a rocket it rises about six inches off the floor then comes crashing down, because of that gravity.Yeah, right.The reason we haven’t seen any aliens is because there aren’t any.None at all. No six-limbed purple-skinned blobs filled with methane and with sharp, serrated teeth. No grey creatures with weird black eyes.Nothing. Not even micro- scopic organisms.It’s a dead, lifeless void out there, a bit like the inside of Prince Andrew’s skull.ARROGANT knob of the week is referee Andre Marriner.He made a number of very puzzling decisions during the first half of the game between Millwall and Fulham.Then at half-time the Millwall boss Neil Harris mentioned them to him. “Oh,” said Marriner, “I thought I was excellent.”No doubt you did, Andre. I assume he says the same thing to his ­missus after sex.While I would guess she feels pretty much the same way as Harris did.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was early evening, and we were at a collective shelter in the outskirts of Damascus, waiting for the long lines of buses bringing these families to safety.There was a palpable sense of relief amongst those who were arriving. Many had spent months living in basements, hiding from constant attacks and only venturing out to get what little water and supplies they could find during lulls in the fighting.  Some of these basements were sheltering up to 200 people in humid, cold conditions with only one toilet to share. “We can finally see the sky,” a mother told me as she walked with her daughter, husband and elderly mother towards the room they had been assigned at the shelter. But for many of the 80,000 evacuees, getting here wasn’t straightforward. Eastern Ghouta is made up of several towns and villages under control of various factions that don’t always agree among themselves. For some families, this meant walking through areas where they were shot at or caught amidst fighting. Many only reached me and my colleagues after a journey that took many long hours – if not days. Our teams have been here since the displaced families started arriving at the shelters, making sure people have the water, sanitation, health and protection services they need. Many of these shelters had been identified just days before they were barely prepared to receive such a large number of people. The first weeks were very chaotic.Emergency toilets were being installed, water tanks hoisted on top of roofs, trucks of water and food were ready to be unloaded. There wasn’t enough space in the eight shelters, and some children got separated from their parents in the rush of fleeing from Eastern Ghouta. Aid workers were overwhelmed and limitations on movements between shelters made it hard to reunify families.But as tired and weary parents tried to figure out what to do next, children revelled in their new freedom. School-age girls and boys ran around the crowded shelters using anything and everything as a playground: bundles of blankets were re-purposed as horses or used as jungle gyms to climb on.  I was deeply relieved to hear happy shouts as they played. Last time I met children from Eastern Ghouta was in June 2016. Eastern Ghouta was still under siege and the UN was only able to access the area through convoys to bring in supplies.No child should ever face what those children were going through – violence, loss, deprivation, hunger.Rather than talking about favourite games and friends they told me about adult concerns: how expensive basic foods like bread had become because of the tightening siege (the years of siege meant that food supplies were hard to come by).In January this year, basic items like bread or rice cost ten times more in Eastern Ghouta than elsewhere in the country. But at the shelter, there was no more talk of hunger: “I had a sandwich this morning,” one boy told me, “Back home my mother would make us a soup out of wheat and sugar and that was the one meal we would have in a day.” Another girl asked me with disbelief whether I had seen the price of biscuits in the little shop in the shelter – five times cheaper than in Eastern Ghouta.During the siege, medical care was a huge challenge as well.In one of the shelters I met the mother of 13-year-old Ahmad. He was lying on a mattress at the corner of the room with his head and arm wrapped in bandages. Days before the humanitarian exits were opened, the building where Ahmad’s family lived was hit and the walls of their living room collapsed. Ahmad was under one of these walls. “If his father didn’t see his hand peeking out of the wall, we wouldn’t have found him at all,” says Ahmad’s mother.“There were no hospitals in East Ghouta,” she adds. “When we heard that we could leave, we carried Ahmad on our backs and he was taken to hospital when we arrived at the shelter.” We noticed that when children first arrived, they wouldn’t talk to other children if they were from different communities or towns years of fear and violence made them very weary of other communities. But now, children now participate in art, music or sports activities – forging new friendships to play, share and learn together. Amid the suffering that I witnessed, one thing that filled me with hope was that most school-aged children had at least learned some basic reading and writing skills.Even during the long months of hiding from the fighting in basements in Eastern Ghouta, mothers had set-up community circles for their children to continue learning.Twelve-year-old Shaima told me that for a while, before the schools closed completely because of the fighting, they would go to school at five in the morning and come back to the basements at eight – before the fighting would start. But now they are safe, mothers wanted to know when a school would open in the shelters, eager to ensure their children wouldn’t miss out on their education. Just last week, a school made up of 16 prefabricated classrooms opened its doors in one of the largest collective shelters. It can accommodate 6,000 children, but seats are filling up so fast and we are working to find more space for additional classrooms. As the weeks went by, half of the families in these shelters left to live with relatives in Damascus or Rural Damascus. But still many remain, either because they don’t have relatives they can live with or they want to wait to return to their own villages in Eastern Ghouta once it is safe to go back. These collective shelters - makeshift refuges which were never designed to be used as living quarters - are their homes for now and that’s why we need to keep supporting them. When I tell people that my job is to get children and families access to the essential services they need for their wellbeing, it’s hard for them to imagine what that really means. But when you’re on the ground with the children, you know that safe play spaces, protection services, good schools and healthcare are lifelines for their very survival.Children are the future of my country, Syria. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We share the same blood.We are living with each other. We are brothers.”The Koreas said they hope the parties will be able to declare an official end to the war by the end of this year.Whats happened so far:He made history as he met with rival South Korean President Moon Jae-in for face-to-face talks on the southern side of the border.President Moon said that the two countries would work to re-unite families who had been separated by the decades long conflict as Kim did what his father and grandfather never managed.The dictator said his heart was throbbing as he became the first North Korean leader to cross the 38th parallel since the Korean War ended 65 years ago.The two heads of state had serious, frank discussions on the topic of denuclearising the peninsula during the first meeting on southern soil in more than six decades.Kim even quipped about his missile tests saying he wouldnt disturb the Souths early morning sleep anymore.Both parties are drawing up a joint statement due to be announced together at the close of the discussions which will be followed by a dinner, which would also be attended by Kims wife, Ri Sol Ju. When they met the smiling leaders, who seemed on the brink of war months ago, shook hands as each stood either side of the military demarcation line that bisects the rivals.As the sworn enemies came face-to-face for the first time in the border truce village of Panmunjom, Moon thanked him for making a very courageous decision to come to the South.In an unplanned move, the dictator then invited Moon to cross briefly north with him before they returned to the southern side - an incredible symbol of peace and unity between the warring nations.Moon then took Kims hand in his and led him along a red carpet into South Korean territory, where they were handed flowers by a boy and girl who live in the village.The pictures of them smiling and holding hands struck a stark contrast to the posturing and aggression of past decades.The two heads of state were then met by a South Korean honour guard in historical costumes, who performed an arirang - a traditional Korean folk song.Kim wore glasses and his trademark black Mao suit, while the rest of the North Korean delegation appeared in military uniforms or Western attire.He stopped to write in a guest book in the Souths Peace House before the two leaders met for a private discussion - aimed at ending their decades-long conflict.Signing and dating the entry, he said: A new history starts now. An age of peace, from the starting point of history.Kim: Im glad to meet you. Im so glad.Moon: Was there any difficulty coming here?Kim: Not at all.Moon: Its a pleasure to meet you.Kim: Indeed, Im so filled with excitement because of the meeting at this historic site. And I was truly moved that you have come all the way to receive me at the Military Demarcation Line at Panmunjom.Moon: It was your bold and courageous decision that has allowed us to come this far.Kim: No, no, not at all.Moon: We have made a historic moment.Kim: I am pleased to meet you.Moon: Would you please stand on this side.Kim steps across the Southern borderMoon: You have come to the south side, when will I be able to come to the North?Kim: Maybe this is the right time for you to enter the North Korean territory.Moon steps into the North before both re-enter South KoreaThe summit is the first between the two countries in over a decade and only third-ever between the sworn enemies - who are separated by a conflict that ended with a truce, not a treaty, meaning they are still technically at war.Minutes before Kim entered Peace House, a North Korean security team conducted a sweep for explosives and listening devices, and sprayed apparent disinfectant in the air, on the chairs, and on the guest book.During the discussion, Jong-un told his southern rival he was ready for heartfelt, sincere and honest talks, adding that he doesnt want repeat of past where we were unable to fulfill our agreements. As the talks began on Friday, the North Korean leader said: “As I walked over here, I thought, why was it so difficult to get here?“The separating line wasn’t even that high to cross. It was too easy to walk over that line and it took us 11 years to get here.”According to the official translation provided by the South Korean government, Jong-un also said during opening remarks, with the media present in the room:The expectations are high and we have learned a lesson from previous times and even if we have good agreements and implementations don’t follow they will disappoint people who had high expectations.I hope the 11 years have lost in the past until this time don’t go to waste, and we can meet more often and put our minds together and the 11 years will not be wasted.I hope to write a new chapter between us.I believe that we are able to make a new beginning, and it is with such commitment I come to this meeting.Moon is reported to have said in opening remarks:Spring (is) spreading in South Korea.I believe our encounter is extremely important for all of us. That of course means there is a huge burden on our shoulders.Comrade Kim, for the first time in our history you crossed the military demarcation line. It is no longer a symbol of division but a symbol of peace.I would like to pay tribute to the courageous and bold decision made by you, Chairman Kim.In parts shown on live TV, Kim joked that he hoped Moon would be able to enjoy North Koreas famous cold noodles, which were being brought to a banquet after the summit.But he could be heard turning to his sister - who was sitting to his left - and saying maybe I shouldnt have said (Pyongyang) was far.His younger sister Kim Yo Jong was the first member of the ruling North Korean family to travel to the South in early February for the Olympics.The Foreign Secretary told reporters at NATO headquarters Friday, I am very encouraged by whats happening.I dont think that anybody looking at the history of North Koreas plans to develop a nuclear weapon would want to be over-optimistic at this point.“But it is clearly good news that the two leaders are meeting.  Absolutely.USAThe White House said in a statement that it is hopeful that talks will achieve progress toward a future of peace and prosperity for the entire Korean Peninsula. ... (and) looks forward to continuing robust discussions in preparation for the planned meeting between President Donald J. Trump and Kim Jong Un in the coming weeks.ChinaForeign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters Beijing wishes that the meeting between the Norths leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in will achieve a positive result.JapanKatsunobu Kato, Japans minister for the abduction issue, says he hopes progress will be made at an upcoming summit that Kim is expected to hold with President Donald Trump.RussiaThe Kremlin on Friday hailed a historic summit between the leaders of North and South Korea as very positive news and said President Vladimir Putin had long advocated direct talks between the two countries.When asked about the prospect of U.S. President Donald Trump also meeting the North Korean leader, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call that Moscow welcomed any steps that would ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula.The only other North Korean official present was former intelligence chief Kim Yong Chol, the top official in charge of relations with the South.Moon in response said there were high expectations surrounding the summit and hoped they produce an agreement that would please the people of Koreas and also every peace-loving person in the world.The discussions also touched on the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong which was targeted by a North Korean artillery attack in 2010, killing four, according to Moon Jae-ins senior spokesman Moon told Kim he wished to travel in North Korea to visit Mount Paektu, near the countrys border with China, but Kim said under current conditions it would be uncomfortable due to the transport network.The pair then discussed high-speed train services, with Kim informing his rival his delegates had been impressed by the Souths bullet trains during their visit for the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in February.A delighted Moon suggested the possibility of connecting the rail networks across borders if relations improve.The discussion went so well that by the time the pair broke for lunch, they had agreed to hold more meetings - with Kim offering to visit Seouls presidential Blue House.In a further show of peace, pine is said to symbolise strength and mindfulness in the Korean martial art of Tae Kwon Do as it grows strong roots below ground and a high above it.The United States is hopeful talks between Kim and Moon will make progress on achieving peace and prosperity, the White House said in a statement as the two men began their summit.The White House also said it looks forward to continuing discussions with South Korea in preparation for the planned meeting of Trump and Kim in the coming weeks.Just months ago, Trump and Kim were trading threats and insults as North Koreas rapid advances in pursuit of nuclear-armed missiles capable of hitting the United States raised fears of a fresh conflict on the Korean peninsula.Earlier on Friday, North Koreas official KCNA news agency said Kim would open-heartedly discuss with Moon Jae-in all the issues arising in improving inter-Korean relations and achieving peace, prosperity and reunification of the Korean peninsula.Just days before the summit, Kim said North Korea would suspend nuclear and long-range missile tests and dismantle its only known nuclear test site.Moon travelled to the meeting in a large motorcade, stopping briefly to greet dozens of summit supporters waving South Korean flags near the Blue House.Hundreds of demonstrators were seen gathering in downtown Seoul from early morning to protest or support the summit.Scepticism has been rampant about whether Kim is ready to abandon the hard-earned nuclear arsenal his country has defended and developed for decades as what it says is a necessary deterrent against US invasion.The two neighbours expect to release a joint statement late on Friday - possibly called the Panmunjom Declaration - that could address denuclearisation and peace, and an improvement in relations, South Korean officials said."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000401986482.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"kim jong un embarrassed about north korea","story":"This frank admission came as the communist dictator became the first leader to step into the capitalist South for 65 years in a bid to prevent war in the peninsula.Details of the historic talks have been emerging after Kim arrived at the truce village of Panmunjom to shake hands with his arch-rival President Moon Jae-in.Moons spokesman Yoon Young-chan says Kims comments over the state of his country came after the South Korean leader expressed a desire to travel North to visit Mount Paektu, which touches the countrys border with China.According Al Jazeera, Kim said: “I’d be honestly worried if you come, it might be embarrassing, the transportation is not good.”The dictator then referred to the South Korean KTX bullet train and said they didn’t have anything like that in North Korea.Kim then suggested if he visited he should probably come by air because the roads were “inconvenient”.But the comments about his countrys duff transport services are unlikely to be reported in North Korea.Citizens cannot view outside media and are bombarded with propaganda trumpeting how life in the hermit kingdom is better than any other on earth.But Moon said in response that North Koreans would be able to enjoy the Souths high-speed trains if the rivals improve relations and reconnect their rail networks across the border.North Korean roads are often bumpy and poorly maintained. Its train network is also way out of date compared to his neighbours state-of-the-art high-speed bullet trains. Kim earlier this month met with Chinas ambassador and visited a hospital where Chinese tourists were being treated after a deadly bus crash killed 32 in North Korea."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict0003814834921.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"real brits porn films majorca","story":"The film makers are setting up shop on Majorca – home to Brit rave capital Magaluf - for the summer and are flooding small ad sites like Craigslist with offers of work.They are looking for women aged 18-40.One ad on Craigslist - placed on a page for East Anglia - said: “We a looking for amateur/first-timers for an adult girl next door style adult shoot this summer.“If youve ever fancied or considered adult work and fancy a few days in the sun in July or August, get in touch with your age, location, any dates in July or Aug youre NOT free, and at least 2 photographs.

They have provided support and provided a home for a child in need.It is therefore right that Government supports them in doing so. That is why today I am extending the existing support for children and families in these circumstances.Universal Credit is currently being rolled out across the country."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000401535806.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"amber rudd home office leak immigration removal targets briefed summer","story":"AMBER Rudd last night made a grovelling apology after a leaked memo cast doubt on her denial that she was briefed on immigration removal targets.The Home Secretary resisted calls to quit, saying she is sorry for not being aware of documents.She had already told a committee of MPs on Wednesday that “we don’t have targets”.

Because expectations are so low for the Tories, they are almost bound to surpass them.Mrs May’s own position is also stronger than it was in January thanks to her handling of the Salisbury attack.At the start of the local election campaign, the talk was of how the Tories were facing a wipe-out in London, how they would do well to end up holding on to even one council.But senior figures involved in the campaign now admit they should do much better than that.Conservative Campaign Headquarters’ biggest worry in London is simply being outgunned on the day.They fear Labour’s return to being a mass membership party under Jeremy Corbyn will enable them to get nearly all their voters out, while the Tories will struggle to get more than 40 per cent of their supporters to the polls.There is, though, still cautious optimism that the Tories will hold at least one of their two flagship London boroughs, Wandsworth and Westminster.Then they could claim the results were respectable for a government in mid-term.This is especially true as results outside London are expected to be quite good for the party.One former Cabinet minister loyal to Theresa May tells me: “Things outside London really aren’t bad.”The Tories are particularly hopeful of making gains in the West Midlands.It will be tempting for the Tories to declare the local elections are further proof the capital and the rest of country are diverging politically, and so their decline in London doesn’t matter much as it will be made up for elsewhere.But this would be a catastrophic mistake.Labour’s rise in London is quite remarkable.They have gone from 37 per cent of the vote in 2010 to 55 per cent in 2017.There are several reasons why the capital is turning red but one of the biggest is the decline in home ownership.Home ownership in London peaked in the 1990s and has been falling since.Homeowners became a minority in London in 2011, the first time that has been the case since Margaret Thatcher’s Right To Buy revolution in the early 1980s.On current trends, 60 per cent of Londoners will be renters in seven years’ time.It is no coincidence that this rise in renting has coincided with Labour’s surge in the capital.For one of the things that makes you most likely to vote Tory is owning your own home.Labour’s surprise success at the last election was largely down to a big increase in turnout among renters who swung heavily to Labour.Labour London offers a preview of what happens to the Tories when homeowners become a minority.If the Tories want to win elections they need to get more homes built — and fast.CABINET Brexiteers are getting increasingly frustrated.They feel that key decisions are not being taken in Cabinet, or even the Cabinet Committee tasked with managing the negotiation, but elsewhere.One senior Brexiteer complains to me that Olly Robbins, the Prime Minister’s chief Europe adviser, is, “Running around telling everyone we have to back down on pretty much everything”.This grumpiness has been exacerbated by this week’s meeting of the Brexit inner Cabinet not discussing the big issue of the moment, customs.One member of it tells me: “When people left, they all felt a greater level of frustration.”There is a sense No10 is not respecting the political process.This all ups the ante ahead of the Brexit inner Cabinet’s meeting next week.This will discuss Theresa May’s plan for a hybrid customs model which would see the UK leave the customs union but collect tariffs on the EU’s behalf.Brexiteer ministers regard this as complicated and as having no chance of being accepted by Brussels. They think persisting with it just wastes valuable time.One tells me Mrs May has been told this hybrid plan is unworkable on eight occasions but doesn’t show any signs of abandoning the idea.Part of the problem is that Mrs May remains deeply worried about whether she has the votes in the Commons to leave the customs union.No10 is extremely concerned about the customs union amendment to the trade bill, which is expected to come to a vote in June.Its hope is the hybrid model is close enough to a customs union to see off a rebellion on this issue but if the model is unworkable, as pretty much everyone thinks, it doesn’t solve anything.Mrs May would be better off making the argument that Brexit won’t mean Brexit if Britain doesn’t regain the ability to run its own trade policy and that she couldn’t continue as Prime Minister in these circumstances.CHRIS GRAYLING wants to make it a criminal offence to cheat on auto emissions tests.This law change, which will be part of Grayling’s road to zero plan to cut exhaust emissions and improve air quality, will enable the Government to prosecute car manufacturers who try to diddle the system.The law won’t apply retrospectively.But the Department for Transport hope it will help prevent a repeat of the Volkswagen scandal.OUR political class needs to remember we are NOT Americans.The question about Donald Trump isn’t whether we would have voted for him or if we think he is the right person to be President of the United States.But how we should deal with the country he leads – which is our most important security ally.No country expelled more Russian diplomats following the Salisbury attack than the United States.Mrs May should make clear that she is delighted, not embarrassed, to welcome Donald Trump to Britain on his “working visit”.Why, because a strong relationship with the United States is in this country’s national interest.French President Emmanuel Macron, on his state visit to Washington this week, didn’t hold back in either cosying up to the president, quite literally at times, or in making clear where he disagreed with him.This is a far more sensible approach than acting all embarrassed about observing the necessary diplomatic niceties.Without Trump, yesterday’s moment of history would not have happened. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.
