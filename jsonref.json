Here, Beth Hale reveals the stories behind some of the iconic frocks on show.The creation fit for a princess   She called it her ‘favourite dress of all’.And in the flesh, the fabulous fairytale gown Princess Margaret wore to mark her 21st birthday — both her birthday party in August 1951 and portraits — is indeed a dress of dreams.While the diaphanous skirt is not quite as voluminous as photographs suggest and the colour an off-white rather than the lighter, brighter colour of the famous Cecil Beaton photographs, the dress is the kind of flouncing, bare-shouldered perfection that little girls imagine when they dream of princesses (although Margaret’s father George VI was rumoured to have disapproved of it).          Royal Portrait of Princess Margaret on her 21st birthday by Cecil Beaton in a dress designed by Christian Dior, part of the Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams exhibition at the London attraction which runs from February 2 to 14 JulyThe differences are not due to any deterioration in fabric, but rather that the colour version of the portrait was actually painted.Even in the Fifties photographers were not averse to a little creative license.With a waist of miniature proportions (no measurement is provided, but it has to be less than 20 inches), the gown shows quite how petite the princess was.Dr Luke says Lady Gaga accused him of rape to win an Oscar...JANET STREET-PORTER: Sorry, Piers but I\u0027m with Will Young -...Could the queen of clean turn me into a domestic god?: MARK...Share this articleMargaret’s son, Lord Snowdon, was at the V\u0026ampA gala dinner to celebrate the exhibition and gave a toast, recalling how surprised he was to find his mother’s dress in the show. He said: ‘I had never seen it before and couldn’t believe that it has survived all these years and been conserved.‘Interestingly, the Cecil Beaton photograph of her shows the dress looking white when in reality it is between cream and beige. It was moving to see the dress that she wore all those years ago with its tiny waist and extraordinary lines, typical of Dior who made such a genius contribution to fashion.’          Princess Diana arrives at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Diana was attending the Museum\u0027s 1996 Costume Insitute gala, a tribute to the achievements of designer Christian DiorLord Snowdon, whose wife Serena was dressed in Dior, added: ‘This is an important exhibition for Britain, with an Anglophile designer who showed such elegance and eloquence in fashion design.’Dior admired Princess Margaret’s style, describing her as ‘so very charming’.‘She was a real fairy princess, delicate, graceful, exquisite,’ he would later write. In 1957, Dior presented the princess with a signed silk scarf in appreciation of her support, while she was a loyal customer for years.Gown almost too daring for Diana It was 1996 and Princess Diana walked into the biggest event on the fashion industry calendar in a dress that was at once ravishing and racy.So racy, in fact, Diana very nearly didn’t wear the dress to New York’s Met Gala for fear Prince William, then 14, wouldn’t like it being so revealing.Brit John Galliano had just been appointed creative director at the fashion house, and designed the dress for Diana before turning his mind to his first collection.A navy silk slip dress, with lace straps and edging, it had more than a hint of the boudoir about it and was a bold choice from Diana, who was then 35.She stopped the fashion crowd dead in their tracks, Liz Tilberis, editor of Harper’s Bazaar, would later write.A statement look for every star  From Margot Fonteyn to Jennifer Lawrence and Emma Watson, the house of Dior has dressed stars in abundance.At the start they were drawn to the designer’s famed Bar suit — part of his 1947 ‘Corolle’ collection. Crafted from shantung silk, crepe wool and taffeta, it has become one of the brand’s most iconic pieces.  Dior’s successors have continued to dress the brightest stars, including Natalie Portman in Hollywood last year (left) and Nicole Kidman in a beaded gown at Cannes (right)Ballet dancer Dame Margot Fonteyn was one of Christian Dior’s early muses and the exhibition features two dresses she wore, including a 1950 evening gown named ‘Debussy’, made of silk satin with hundreds of dragonfly sequins.Dior’s successors have continued to dress the brightest stars, including Natalie Portman in Hollywood last year.           Naomi Campbell pictured in Dior in 1997There’s also the silk confection Jennifer Lawrence wore to a film premiere in September 2017, a beaded gown worn by Nicole Kidman in Cannes  — and many more.Fashion firebrands who kept his name alive   A string of illustrious names followed in Dior’s footsteps.First came a 21-year-old Yves Saint Laurent, whose early designs were so strikingly similar to his illustrious predecessor that when he sent them to French Elle magazine, the then editor thought it was Dior playing tricks.Next came Marc Bohan — he assumed the helm until 1989.Italian Gianfranco Ferré became the first non-French artistic director, until 1996 when controversial Brit John Galliano took over — supermodel Naomi Campbell is pictured in one of his typically flamboyant designs in 1997.His reign came to a rather ignominious end when he was sacked in 2011, paving the way for Raf Simons and finally Maria Grazia Chiuri, the second Italian and first woman, appointed in July 2016.Anglophile and his blue-blooded fans   Christian Dior first visited the UK in 1926 and was something of an Anglophile. He admired the grandeur of Britain’s great stately homes and gardens, as well as British-designed ocean liners, roast beef and Savile Row suits.Dior’s chic little black suits of the 1940s and 1950s were beloved by the British aristocracy, and muses Nancy Mitford and Margot Fonteyn both ordered his 1947 ‘Daisy’ suit.Mitford wrote to her sister Diana Mosley later that year, of Dior’s second collection: ‘Now I’m nearly 50 I’ve decided to choose a style and stick to it and I choose Dior’s present collection. Simply, to my mind, perfect.’          Christian Dior (left) became an Anglophile after visiting Britain in 1926 and his suits were beloved by the British aristocracy           Charlize Theron has been the face of J\u0027Adore by Dior since 2004‘I adore the English,’ Dior wrote in his memoir.‘I love English traditions, English politeness, English architecture, I even love English cooking!\u0027I dote on Yorkshire pudding, mince pies, stuffed chicken, and above all I worship the English breakfast of tea, porridge, eggs and bacon.’Sweet smell of success    A clever marketer, Christian Dior was a fashion pioneer in more than one respect: he launched a perfume line in 1947, the very same year of his first collection.He very quickly created lipsticks, introduced hats, shoes and even stockings — wanting to provide a ‘one-stop’ service for his well-heeled clients.Latterly, Dior’s perfumes have had a gold theme.In 1999, the fashion house launched J’Adore, a perfume celebrating Christian Dior’s love of glimmering gold.Since 2004, the face of J’Adore has been actress Charlize Theron.The Hollywood beauty has appeared on screen and in print in a series of ever-more dazzling gold gowns, several of which are on display at the V\u0026ampA.They include fashion designer John Galliano’s J’Adore dress from 2008, which was adorned with sequins and Swarovski crystals.Duchess of Sussex waves to fans during visit to City Uni LondonCamilla Thurlow blows up landmine in gripping new TV showChildren perform for The Duchess of Sussex at the National TheatreDuchess of Cornwall arrives at Royal Academy for life drawing classMeghan Markle arrives at The ACU with her hair up in a bunDuchess of Sussex leaves National Theatre after official engagementMeghan Markle arrives at the National Theatre for royal patron debutMeghan stuns in an all black outfit as she arrives at City UniversityDuke and Duchess of Cambridge arrive in Dundee to open V\u0026ampA MuseumJess Phillips: \u0027I thought I\u0027d met posh people before I came here\u0027Woman shows how to fold clothes using the KonMari methodMeghan is pretty in peach as she visits the National Theatre"},{"url":null,"title":"How weeks dithering bricks use helped push cost new EastEnders set","story":"    The Carter family outside the Queen Vic pub.

It was the right thing to do.’The bricks must be tinted, moss must be applied, and the peeling paint outside the Queen Vic pub will be recreated to mimic the current set.The soap’s existing set was built in 1984 using steel frames, plywood and plaster brick panels with the intention that it would be used for two years.

It has been reported that one of the new locations will be a mosqueThe poor quality of the Elstree Studios set means high-definition filming is not possible and health and safety concerns can lead to filming delays.Meanwhile, BBC director-general Lord Hall admitted yesterday that the broadcaster forced some of its stars to be paid via ‘personal service companies’ (PSC), leaving them without sick pay or maternity benefits and now facing large tax bills.He said the Corporation accepts ‘full responsibility’ for ‘pushing’ people into the controversial arrangements as a pre-requisite of pursuing careers as presenters.The arrangement saved the Corporation millions in National Insurance payments, and looked like it would help presenters reduce their own tax bills.But it has dramatically backfired after HM Revenue and Customs later ordered some of the stars to pay back-dated tax.One anonymous presenter was told not to come back from maternity leave unless it was under the new employment arrangement.Last year, BBC Radio 4 presenter Kirsty Lang revealed to a Parliamentary committee that she even had to work throughout her cancer treatment because the Corporation would not give her sick pay.Yesterday, Labour MP Caroline Flint said that BBC stars were effectively told, ‘if you want a career in presenting, you are going to have to move onto a PSC. There is no other choice.‘If you want to be a shining star at the BBC, you are going to have to follow this course of action.’Asked whether he accepted this, Lord Hall said: ‘Yes I acknowledge that. People were pushed into these things. We’re saying that we’ve accepted responsibility. That’s full responsibility.’The BBC previously stood by a 2012 report published by Deloitte, which found ‘no evidence of any pressure to move staff to the PSC arrangements’.But yesterday Lord Hall and his deputy director-general, Anne Bulford, accepted that there was pressure regardless.Lord Hall said: ‘Going back and trying to find records of how these PSCs were set up and people’s correspondence with the BBC about them - we can’t find any record which point to one way or the other.‘But the evidence from people I’ve talked to is... that they were asked to take up PSCs’."},{"url":null,"title":"Dirty Duchess Argyll subject TV drama","story":"    Margaret Campbell, the Duchess of Argyll, is pictured outside the law courts in London in 1960 during what became a famous orce caseA British aristocrat known as the \u0027Dirty Duchess\u0027 of Argyll - whose husband accused her of sleeping with up to 88 men including government ministers and royals - will be the subject of a TV drama. The mini-series about Margaret Campbell, whose sex scandal made headlines in 1963, will be a spin-off of the BBC\u0027s award-winning A Very English Scandal. The Duchess\u0027s orce ignited public speculation when a list emerged of more than 80 men she had reportedly slept with, said to include two ministers and three members of the royal family. Executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins said the scandal made her the first woman to be publicly \u0027slut shamed\u0027.  Granting the orce, presiding judge Lord Wheatley said she \u0027was a completely promiscuous woman whose sexual appetite could only be satisfied with a number of men\u0027.The Duchess was the third wife of Ian Campbell, the 11th Duke of Argyll, whose family owned Inveraray Castle in western Scotland. Born Margaret Whigham, she married wealthy American golfer Charles Sweeny in 1933, having three children with him. Sorry ladies, the nation has voted for its greatest icons of...Great British Bake Off star Nadiya opens up about her...Share this articleAfter orcing him in 1947 she married the Duke in 1951 but the marriage fell apart after her suspicious husband hired a locksmith to break open a cupboard at her house in Mayfair. The search allegedly uncovered love letters and polaroid photos of her engaging in sexual acts with her various partners.           First marriage: The Duchess of Argyll on her wedding day after marrying wealthy American golfer Charles Sweeny in 1933           Second marriage: Margaret on the day she became Duchess of Argyll, after marrying Ian Campbell, the 11th Duke of Argyll, at Caxton Hall in London in March 1951  Margaret Campbell is pictured left at Inveraray Castle in Scotland in 1953 and right at a party in 1961.

I had one to the side of me and one behind.\u0027At the time I was quite upset and felt like I didn\u0027t have the right to say anything.\u0027But after they offered me the job, I sort of realised this isn\u0027t okay, this isn\u0027t a company I want to work for and it doesn\u0027t make me feel comfortable.\u0027So the following day, I declined the offer and obviously described my reasons why.\u0027He\u0027s given a public apology, I haven\u0027t heard anything directly, but that\u0027s fine by me.

I was very close to (crying). I cried afterwards. I had a nice cry at the bus stop.\u0027Asked about being offered the job, she added: \u0027That was the conflicting part about it. \u0027Because it makes you think, maybe it\u0027s just a test, or maybe they are just doing it to sort of see how deal with things under pressure.\u0027I can understand the reasons behind that interview technique but to that extend it was a bit far for me.\u0027 Web Applications UK today said it had carried out an investigation and it was satisfied \u0027no bullying or intimidation\u0027 took place in the interview.They said Olivia also accepted the job offer and then changed her mind.  Mr Dean (left) posted on Twitter, writing: \u0027I am so sorry that anyone has been hurt, it is never my intent.\u0027 But Ms Bland (right) dismissed his apology A statement read: \u0027The Board of Directors at Web Applications UK is deeply concerned by the serious allegations made on social media following a recent job interview led by Chief Executive, Craig Dean.  \u0027As always, Web Applications UK conducted a robust, multi-stage interview, which included simulating challenging, work-based scenarios, designed to help identify the best candidate for the role.\u0027This particular candidate excelled during the interview and responded positively to the feedback.\u0027We were delighted to offer her the position of Communications Assistant, by telephone, later that day. \u0027Regrettably, she subsequently changed her mind and declined our offer. In response to the allegations made, and following completion of our investigation, the Board is satisfied that no bullying or intimidation occurred.\u0027Ms Bland worked as a Junior Marketing and E-Commerce Executive from last August to December. "},{"url":null,"title":"Angela Merkel make Britain stare abyss","story":"    Angela Merkel (pictured in Berlin today) will drag Britain to the \u0027edge of the precipice\u0027 and force negotiators to \u0027look into the abyss\u0027 before finalising a deal, it was claimed today          European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker (pictured today in Brussels) has described the Agreement reached after 18 months of negotiation last November as \u0027the best and only deal possible\u0027.Germany yesterday led a rejection of Mrs May\u0027s calls to renegotiate the Brexit orce deal following Tuesday night\u0027s showdown votes in Parliament.  The Prime Minister has promised MPs will get to vote again in two weeks - whether she has a revised deal or not. Diplomatic sources told The Times the new deadline would not move Mrs Merkel intention to \u0027go to the edge of the precipice\u0027. They warned she wants \u0027to look into the abyss before a deal is done at five to midnight — that is how she works\u0027.\u0027This is NOT open for re-negotiation\u0027: Tusk and Macron...\u0027Cowards and facilitators!\u0027 Remainer MPs turn on Labour...Share this articleYesterday, Mrs Merkel\u0027s foreign minister Heiko Maas, said: \u0027Germany and the entire Union are firmly on Ireland\u0027s side.\u0027We will not allow Ireland to be isolated on this issue.\u0027 European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker described the Agreement reached after 18 months of negotiation last November as \u0027the best and only deal possible\u0027.And he told MEPs in the European Parliament: \u0027The debate and votes in the House of Commons yesterday do not change that.\u0027The Withdrawal Agreement will not be renegotiated.\u0027     The Prime Minister (pictured in Parliament yesterday) has promised MPs will get to vote again in two weeks - whether she has a revised deal or notFrench President Emmanuel Macron said the Withdrawal Agreement was \u0027not renegotiable\u0027.   Irish deputy PM Simon Coveney said Mrs May was effectively threatening to \u0027jump out of a window\u0027 unless Brussels bowed to her demands, while French president Emmanuel Macron said the current package was \u0027non-renegotiable\u0027. Meanwhile, the EU\u0027s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said: \u0027The position of the European Union is very clear. \u0027The EU institutions remain united, and we stand by the agreement that we have negotiated with the UK never against the UK\u0027. One Cabinet minister told MailOnline that everyone needed to remain \u0027calm\u0027 as \u0027noise\u0027 from Brussels was only to be expected.\u0027This is just what the EU does.

The officers arrived on the scene to question Fabiana Rosales (above with daughter Miranda)          Guaido declared himself interim president last week in an attempt to oust authoritarian leader Maduro, who has been in power since 2013Neighbors said the officers - who hailed from the Special Action Forces - arrived to the gate of Guaido\u0027s apartment building in a white SUV. Angry neighbors and passerby immediately rushed to the apartment building banging pots and pans until the police officers left. Guaido was named interim president of Venezuela last week winning the support of international leaders like Donald Trump and Canada\u0027s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.While Guaido may now control Venezuela\u0027s National Assembly, Maduro still controls the military.On Thursday Guaido delivered a speech where he presented the opposition\u0027s plan to rescue Venezuela from its economic crisis and the grips of Maduro\u0027s six-year-long dictatorship.  \u0027The dictatorship thinks it can intimidate us,\u0027 he said touching on Maduro\u0027s police showing up to his front door. \u0027I will hold you responsible for any threat to my baby,\u0027 he added. He later held a defiant press conference in front of his apartment building with his wife at his side and his young daughter in his arms and said \u0027they will not intimidate this family\u0027.  Uproarious crowds cheered for Guaido as he faced reporters just hours after the shock troops knocked on his door. Florida Senator Marco Rubio tweeted updates on Thursday\u0027s aggressive attack on the interim president.

He said it showed that even those who are healthy could avoid a potentially deadly attack if they took the drugs, which cost just a few pence a day.The research, published in the Lancet and part-funded by the research arm of the NHS, showed that the benefits of statins were just as effective among the elderly as in younger groups.Findings revealed that for every 10,000 Britons aged 78 who take statins, but have no history of cardiovascular problems, 80 heart attacks or strokes would be prevented every year. For those of the same age who already suffer heart disease, the benefits will be even greater – with 160 heart attacks and strokes prevented a year per 10,000 people.          Much of the row over the drugs has stemmed from the uneasiness doctors feel at the ‘medicalisation’ of otherwise healthy people (stock image)Professor Baigent said prejudice against older people – the idea that there is no point treating them – also played a role in under-using statins. ‘Society is ageist,’ he said. ‘There is an attitude to the elderly that we are all working to try and counter.’Cardiovascular disease kills about 150,000 people a year – more than two thirds of which are aged over 75. ‘So there is potential, since those people simply because of their age are at higher risk of cardiovascular disease, to offer statin therapy to a larger number of people who are elderly,’ said the professor.Professor Naveed Sattar, of the University of Glasgow, said the results were ‘convincing’ despite the ‘many doubters on the benefits of statins’. Professor Martin Marshall, of the Royal College of GPs, added: ‘It’s particularly reassuring to see evidence of benefit in patients over the age of 75 – the age group most likely to need cholesterol medication.’Professor Sir Nilesh Samani, of the British Heart Foundation, added: ‘Age should not be a barrier to prescribing these potentially life-saving drugs to people who are likely to benefit.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"Children exposed quarter gambling adverts 10 years ago study reveals","story":"    Children are exposed to around 25 per cent more adverts for gambling, like this one for Bet365 fronted by Ray Winstone, than they were ten years agoPsychologist who had sexual relationship with a severely...American adults expected to wager $6billion on Super Bowl...Share this articleIt backs this up by stating that children now see fewer adverts relative to the number seen by adults.

For years I’ve been searching for the clues that would explain this weird and wonderful genius. I’ve visited the Tuscan hill town Vinci, where an illegitimate boy called Leonardo was born in 1452, and Amboise in the Loire Valley, where he died on 2 May 1519, looking for traces of his secret self. Yet it was on an icy afternoon in the Welsh capital that I finally found the killer clue to a real Leonardo da Vinci mystery: his sex life.Leonardo’s inky fingerprint has been found – it’s just barely visible with the naked eye – on his drawing The Cardiovascular System and Principal Organs of a Woman, done c.1509-10, yet this is not the revelation. This big, bold graphic dissection of a female body is a window on Leonardo’s emotions. He has drawn a female nude then transposed against her rounded breasts a complex machinery of tubes and pumps, bags and balloons. Her uterus looks like an alien creature. As an image of the female form it isn’t exactly intimate, let alone lustful. At the National Museum Wales, you can look straight from this to a far more sensual portrayal of the human body that he drew in about 1504: a scintillating study of a naked man from behind. Leonardo’s muscular model stands at attention, showing us his curly locks and rippling back. His hands seem to visibly shake with contained energy. His stance is potent. Leonardo uses red chalk to give this nude a carnal warmth: its softness lets him delicately model every bulge and recess of taut skin. The man’s buttocks are ripe ovals of perfection.These drawings shown together truly seem to decode something about the Renaissance artist, scientist, engineer and inventor who died 500 years ago this year. To celebrate Leonardo’s half-millennium, the Royal Collection, which owns the world’s most eye-popping hoard of his graphic works, has scattered traces of his true self across the UK: 12 museums in 12 cities have each got a piece of him. Perhaps, if you could somehow see all the shows, you would know everything there is to know about Leonardo. He would come to life and talk.And there is so much to explain. Looking from Leonardo’s loving, lingering male nude to his vision of what is clearly, for him, the alien entity of womanhood, it’s hard not to share Sigmund Freud’s analysis in his book on him that this Renaissance man loved other men. So is that it? Was Leonardo gay – and is that the key to his inner life?And yet, before you can humanise Leonardo you have to acknowledge the superhuman in him. It hits like a thunderbolt in Bristol Museum and Art Gallery’s gorgeous show of drawings sharply lit against dark blue walls. Every drawing in this exhibition is more than five centuries old. And these medieval masterpieces are incredibly well preserved. Each nuance of chalk, ink and colour wash seems to have been frozen forever. This is one reason why, I believe, you can get much closer to Leonardo in his drawings than in his paintings. His paintings have been restored and repainted over the centuries, or fallen to bits, like The Last Supper. But these sketches are pristine. They are not by his assistants. They are pure clear windows on his mind, many with his notes in his reversed handwriting interspersed among the images.In his drawing of A Storm Over a Valley he uses red chalk again, this time to create what feels more like a modelling of the atmosphere than a mere landscape sketch. Rolling banks of cloud billow above a mountain valley, releasing heavy cascades of rain on the settlements below. But what’s spooky is the point of view. Leonardo seems to be looking down on the little human world of churches and farms from far, far above.Perhaps he’s standing on a mountaintop – he did explore the Alps. Yet there are other landscapes by him that also seem to be seen from the sky. Famously, he tried to make a flying machine. This drawing shows flight is central to his way of thinking about the world: he literally wanted to rise above it all.For Leonardo was not at ease in human society. Why would he be? In one drawing in the Cardiff exhibition he portrays a thuggish face, a huge, fleshy head on a thick neck. In another work, in Bristol, he delineates a savage battle. They are both instances of his bleak feelings about the brutality and violence of our species. Other masterpieces show how, near the end of his life, he became obsessed with deluges tearing the world apart, smashing a mountain, destroying an army like ants under the swirling power of the elements.His curiosity is so insistent, like that of a staring child. Or maybe a serial killer, meticulously drawing the bones of the dead. No one had ever before looked at human anatomy as Leonardo does in drawings based on his own dissections. He finds within us a mysterious architecture. The interior of the heart is laced with fan vaulting like a gothic cathedral. Our bodies are labyrinths of tunnels and cavities, spheres and tree branches.That magic weave of fragile organic stuff links all nature. In his portrait of a woman looking downward, a design for his late painting The Virgin and St Anne, she sports a richly textured lacy headdress. The ruffled silk looks like a jellyfish sac he’s seen washed up on shore: the Virgin is wearing a marine organism in her hair. In a map of the river Arno in Tuscany the blue tendrils of the river look like tentacles, roots, or veins in a human body.The more of these drawings you see the more startling and real Leonardo becomes. But so does his jaundiced view of our species. We’re just part of a bigger picture. Human organs and the Earth, microcosm and macrocosm, all mirror each other. Perhaps that’s why the art of Leonardo leaves you so enraptured. I felt as if I could see my own skeleton and those of Cardiff passersby as I popped into Greggs for a vegan sausage roll. Come to think of it, Leonardo would have approved. He was a vegetarian. If everything is one interwoven fabric, he thought, who are we to act like lords of creation?• Leonardo da Vinci: A Life in Drawing runs 1 February-6 May in in Belfast, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Derby, Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Sheffield, Southampton and Sunderland.

In many areas in the northern half of Australia, the average number of days above 35C could increase by two to three times.Late in the century, towns such as Darwin, Alice Springs and Broome\u0026nbsp may experience days with temperatures above 35C for about a third of the year.These higher temperatures will also result in higher evaporation, which will continue to make drought conditions worse.Port Augusta recorded the country’s highest temperature in January, reaching 49.5C.“We’ve also seen records in many states set including places like Victoria where Swan Hill and Kerang got up over 47.5C,” Watkins said.Menindee in far-west NSW, the site of December and January’s mass fish kills, had four days in a row of temperatures above 47C.In parts of western Queensland and western NSW, there have been long strings of more than 40 days of temperatures above 40C.Cloncurry had 43 days in a row that exceeded 40C.Birdsville in the state’s west had 16 days in January of temperatures higher than 45C and 10 of those days were in a row.Bom said a persistent high-pressure system in the Tasman Sea that blocked cold fronts and cooler air from reaching the country’s south, and a delayed monsoon in the north, contributed to the heatwave.“The warming trend which has seen Australian temperatures increase by more than 1C in the last 100 years also contributed to the unusually warm conditions,” Watkins said.New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, Victoria and the Northern Territory all had their warmest January on record."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9a34e46575dfe9c0ff340cc0230f6ffe1e175ab/0_2_4771_2863/master/4771.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcd713a8f533f092993e14d2b5bd18a3","title":"the best books to understand what is happening in venezuela","story":"From a history of its oil trade to a classic novel by a former president, here’s the books you need to read amid Venezuela’s current political turmoilRiots in the streets, inflation exceeding 1 million percent, two men claiming to be the rightful president and warnings of civil war – Venezuela is making a lot of headlines, none of them good. Six years after the death of Hugo Chávez died, when power passed to his protege Nicolás Maduro, the economy has imploded, democratic trappings have been stripped away, millions have fled the country and Donald Trump is threatening to aid in ousting Maduro and establish the opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, as president.Raul Gallegos’s Crude Nation shows how what was once South America’s most stable, wealthy country swerved towards the abyss. A former economic journalist who lived in Caracas, Gallegos dissects the nationalisations, expropriations, subsidies and controls on prices and currencies that warped the economy during Chávez’s 12-year rule. Petrol became virtually free while milk, sugar, coffee and toilet paper routinely vanished from stores. Gallegos blends analysis with reportage, including a picaresque roadtrip with a Che Guevara lookalike – to show how Maduro inherited a mess and made it worse.Dragon in the Tropics, by the Venezuelan academics Javier Corrales and Michael Penfold, is a scholarly focus on the politics, explaining how Chávez bequeathed a system based on populism, personality cult, electoral success and authoritarianism to a hapless successor. Lacking the comandante’s charisma and his luck with high oil prices, Maduro dialled up the thuggery and militarisation.Fernando Coronil’s The Magical State, published in 1997, is a prophetic, anthropological and at times lyrical meditation on how successive presidents used oil revenues to pose as transcendent figures who could conjure modernity, but in the end delivered dysfunction. “Between the cracks one could fleetingly see that the magic of oil money could no longer sustain the magical state.” After taking power in 1999, Chávez intensified the cycle. He masked the continuity by wearing a red beret and, after surviving a US-backed coup in 2002, raining insults on George Bush, who he said was “more dangerous than a monkey with a razor blade”.Chávez renamed his country the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and called his revolution the “Bolivarian process” in honour of Simón Bolívar, the 19th-century liberator who ended Spanish rule. Marie Arana’s Bolívar gallops through an extraordinary life and a complex political legacy, both progressive and authoritarian, which laid the foundations of Venezuela. A bracing antidote to the Bolívar cult. When Chávez dug up his bones he gushed: “This glorious skeleton must be Bolívar because you can feel his ardour.”Few contemporary novels have been translated, alas – Jonathan Jakubowicz’s rollicking skewering of the “boligarchs” in Las Aventuras de Juan Planchard deserves a wider readership. But for a portrait of an earlier elite there is a translation of Iphigenia, Teresa de la Parra’s sexually charged story of a young woman who seeks to escape stifling patriarchal decorum, which caused a sensation when published in 1924.Rómulo Gallegos’s Doña Bárbara (1929) is Venezuela’s classic novel, the one schoolkids have to read. It depicts a battle of wills between the mercurial, eponymous heroine and a rancher, with lush, prolix descriptions of the great plains – the llanos – cowboys and spirits. Gallegos, Venezuela’s first democratically elected president, gives insight into the man who succeeded him decades later. Chávez was a llanero, a boy from the plains steeped in its lore, and in office commandeered the airwaves to regale the nation with its songs and stories and myths."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc5116c6c7043a72fb7848d4103e9d8e6a04e1e4/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=afaf74612dde839a6b8402a1ebfe6ef8","title":"stress interviews olivia bland recruitment","story":"It sounds like the job interview from hell. Olivia Bland ended up crying at the bus stop, after what the 22-year-old describes as being deliberately torn to shreds over everything from her writing skills to her posture (apparently even “my arms were wrong, and the way I sat was wrong”). Tech company boss Craig Dean, the man on the other side of the desk, ended up posting what he called a “sleep-deprived and anxiety-driven” apology on Twitter after her account of it all went viral.Tell me your gender, age and political leanings and I can probably guess with reasonable certainty whether your sympathies lie with her or with him. But if nothing else, the rejection email she sent, explaining where Web Applications UK could stick the job it eventually offered her, certainly demonstrates the “timely, concise and effective” communications skills stipulated in the job description.It should be said that Dean’s board of directors later put out a statement, insisting it was confident that there had been “no bullying or intimidation”, while promising to reflect on what had happened. But whatever went on inside that interview room, it patently hasn’t ended well for anybody. Bland compares the whole thing to a conversation with an abusive ex, picking apart everything that was supposedly wrong with her social media naming and shaming being what it is, Dean must now be experiencing something very similar. Since she must have wanted the job originally, and he evidently wanted her to have it, it should not have been impossible to put two and two together without making something that sounds like a particularly squirm-inducing episode of The Office. And yet here we are. So much for trendy management theories about “testing the resilience” of prospective employees.For Dean presumably didn’t pluck his unorthodox conversational gambits out of thin air. The so-called “stress interview”, designed to provoke, embarrass and intimidate interviewees to see how they cope in a crisis, has evidently come a long way since apocryphal stories of Oxbridge dons greeting nervous sixth-formers by putting their feet up on the desk and ordering them to “impress me”. A quick Google of US recruitment sites uncovers endless suggested comments for the would-be boss from hell, ranging from, “It doesn’t look like you accomplished much in your last position,” to, “If you were really good, you would have been promoted. Why haven’t you been?” Other techniques include asking the interviewee questions that seem inappropriately personal to put them off their stride (bizarrely, Bland says she was asked about her childhood and whether her parents were still together), or simply being deliberately rude. Sighing and rolling your eyes during answers, interrupting to take phone calls in the middle of the conversation, even turning your back on the interviewee, all come recommended.It’s the employment equivalent of “negging”, or attempting to pick up women by insulting and undermining them so that in theory they’ll be even more desperate for your approval which made for some truly grim dates during its briefly fashionable heyday. In stress interview theory, the candidate is supposed to remain emotionless throughout, thereby demonstrating that they won’t lose their cool with a difficult client and can take criticism. It says a great deal about what’s wrong with management in too many British companies that anyone would think this is how you uncover talent.Yet sadly, not many candidates would have the nerve to fight back in the current job market. Bland is trying to enter a competitive industry at a time when a lot of people aren’t hiring, at least until they know what’s happening with Brexit. She’s far from the only English graduate with an apparently glittering CV being made to jump through ridiculous hoops for jobs that almost certainly weren’t what they dreamed of in college. For those further down the pile it is, if anything, worse.A few years ago, Currys had to apologise after a man applying for a job in one of its stores was asked to do a “robot dance” in the interview. In the pub and restaurant trade, it has become all too common to be asked to work an unpaid shift by way of interview, a tactic seemingly used by some more unscrupulous managers to fill awkward gaps in the rota. The tougher the economic climate gets, the stiffer the competition, and the more brutal the efforts made to weed out a desperately overcrowded field.It’s true that some industries aren’t for shrinking violets, my own included. Newsrooms can be brutal, and so can the places in which young reporters may find themselves in pursuit of a story. But good reporters need empathy and sensitivity to deal with the people whose lives they’re invading, as well as grit. An industry staffed with human battering-rams serves nobody.And while plenty of employers doubtless have their own horror stories of snowflake graduates with ridiculously high expectations and badly spelled CVs, all too often they’re forgetting how much they still had to learn in their 20s and, more importantly, how they learned it.Nobody looks back with gratitude and affection on the bosses who had evidently watched way too many series of The Apprentice. It’s the ones with the patience to explain, and the skill to build up other people’s confidence rather than knocking it down, for whom you end up going the extra mile. Ironically, Craig Dean must have been exposed to something of a stress test himself over the past 24 hours, with half the internet now scoffing at his management techniques. Somehow, I doubt he has emerged from it convinced of the usefulness of ritual humiliation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/331e79ccca96b8a89c2b444f0d1cfcd6cbd7b085/194_206_3087_1852/master/3087.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35628cefbdff04d4eb9e1866e76a1da6","title":"the guardian view on the may corbyn talks make them matter","story":"The first thing to say about this week’s talks between Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn over Brexit is that they are a sign of realism on both sides. The second is that they should have taken place months ago. Both leaders must bear a share of responsibility for the long avoidance of cross-party dialogue about a decision that is so fundamental to the British people’s future. But it is Mrs May, as the head of government and the person in charge of Brexit policy, who must bear the larger share by far.The prime minister has come to these talks at the eleventh hour, whereas she should have begun them before she triggered the article 50 withdrawal process 22 months ago. The danger now is that, although welcome in principle, the talks will have little practical effect. This is in part because there is little established basis for trust between the two sides, in part because time is now so limited before 29 March to achieve anything major, and in part because Mrs May – and perhaps Mr Corbyn too – prefers to see them as a tactical expedient, rather than as a serious national opportunity, even at this late stage.The fact remains that, ever since the 2017 election resulted in a hung parliament, it has always been clear to those who can count that Mrs May would struggle to get a Commons majority for anything approaching a pragmatic Brexit agreement with Conservative and DUP votes alone. Her party contains too many deregulatory and anti-European ideologues for that. She already knew this when she became leader in 2016. Two and a half years on, she still knows it. She is more aware than anyone that the 16-vote majority to reopen talks with the EU on the Northern Ireland backstop may not withstand contact with the real world. If that happens, the pressure for serious dialogue will therefore return with full force.Some people may hope that Mrs May could then pivot decisively towards the kind of soft Brexit that would get Labour backing. This would be a spectacular about-face. It would certainly be less bad than no deal or Mrs May’s November 2018 deal. But all this is the triumph of hope over experience. Mrs May shows no sign of contemplating any such thing. It is not in her character. She has done no groundwork. She seems to be using the talks with Labour for narrow and tactical reasons. In other words she is talking to Mr Corbyn in order to frighten her own party into line behind a reworked version of her existing deal. She is not rolling the pitch for a new and softer Brexit approach that she intends to adopt after her new approach to Brussels goes wrong.Reports on Thursday confirm that there is nothing visionary or heroic about Mrs May’s approach. They suggest she is hoping to pick off inidual Labour MPs with offers of constituency funding and investment rather than look for a larger leader-to-leader agreement on Brexit. There are undoubtedly places in Britain where Labour MPs sit for leave-voting constituencies which are crying out for investment amid industrial and community decline. But the same problems exist in remain-voting constituencies too, and in other places across the UK whose MPs choose, for honourable reasons, not to back Mrs May’s Brexit approach. Politics always has a local dimension and MPs have every reason to press for local investment. But local wounds like hospital or college closures are ultimately national issues. They should be addressed strategically, not through a grubby ide-and-rule auction of the minimum number of votes that Mrs May requires to win a majority for her inadequate and dangerous deal.Yet that does not justify not talking, and Labour should not hide behind it. The task of healing isions and bringing people back together is noble and difficult. Party politics is very imperfectly wired for it. This week has reminded us how politicians tend to put their own tribe above the needs of the nation. But Brexit is too big for this. It cuts across everything. In all the hours of debate very few MPs have risen to the full seriousness of what is at stake economically, socially, politically and constitutionally in the harm this process risks inflicting on our people. Everyone is tired and stressed by Brexit. But if it requires more time and more talking to mitigate that harm in an effective and strategic manner, then so be it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ec0d5521e90a96fa7f261f378dd316592d5fd2e/0_93_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=689ac80f66f13f0fa01a0286718f6e5b","title":"uk not ready brexit no deal tsunami institute government","story":"Shellshocked MPs of the sensible tendency are now seriously alarmed. You find them in a daze around Westminster and its news studio green-rooms stunned by Tuesday night’s failure of the modest Cooper amendment to prevent a no-deal crash-out.The Welsh assembly declared yesterday that if Westminster can’t agree, “the only option which remains is to give the decision back to the people” and “work should begin immediately on preparing for a public vote”. No sign of that sentiment in the Commons – but referendum campaigners always knew it would only be the last option when all else finally fails.Parliament begins to look like it’s on a self-destruct mission which will take the whole country down with it. But outside there are plenty of supporters egging them on waving cheery “No Deal – No Problem” placards. No bad news shifts them or the Brexit fanatics within. Certainly not the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, warning EU leaders yesterday to “prepare for the worst”. Today it looks crystal clear that delaying withdrawal beyond 29 March is utterly unavoidable, as the foreign secretary confirmed on Radio 4’s Today programme.The Institute for Government (IFG) lists six crucial bills that cannot pass in time, let alone more than 500 statutory instruments. Most haven’t begun in the Lords, where the government doesn’t control the timetable and each needs serious scrutiny. Flashing red on the IFG implementation charts is unreadiness at the borders, with 10 out of 12 border computer systems unready. There are red flashes for how farmers and fishers can sell their produce to the EU in eight weeks’ time. Red too for medicines and medical supplies. Red again for security: no swapping fingerprints, data or DNA, so will criminals escape across the channel? A legal vacuum is actual – not metaphorical – anarchy.The housing minister Kit Malthouse brokered talks between Brexiters and former remainers on a possible way out of the Brexit impasse.The resulting \u0027Malthouse compromise\u0027 involves redrafting the backstop arrangement for the Irish border which is so unpopular with Conservative Eurosceptic MPs and the Democratic Unionist party, which props up the government.It would also extend the transition period, set out under the previously negotiated withdrawal agreement, until the end of 2021. The extension is designed to give extra time to agree a new trading relationship.Under the plan, the backstop would be replaced with a free trade agreement with as yet unknown technology to avoid customs checks on the Irish border.If the attempt to renegotiate the backstop fails, the Malthouse compromise proposes what amounts to a managed no deal.The PM would ask the EU to honour the extended transition period, in return for agreeing the £39bn orce bill and its commitments on EU citizens’ rights. This would give both sides time to prepare for departure on WTO terms at the end of 2021 – or to negotiate a different deal.The compromise is backed by the DUP, the European Research Group of hard Brexiters, and former remainers including Nicky Morgan. It is this unlikely coalition that helped secure Commons backing for the Brady amendment, which pledged to replace the backstop with unspecified \u0027alternative arrangements\u0027.Before MPs voted for that amendment and against others, Theresa May praised the Malthouse compromise. She said these were \u0027serious proposals\u0027 and she would engage with them \u0027seriously and positively\u0027.Although Brexit is a Tory’s disease, spread over decades by their newspapers with anti-EU myths, lies and conspiracy nonsense, at this 11th hour Labour MPs have responsibilities too. Tory leaders pandered to Eurosceptic fever – worst of all David Cameron ceding this lethal referendum – and they will be blamed if the sky falls in. They will be blamed for years of continuing Brexit bitterness. Labour need own none of it – it need back no Brexit plan of May’s. But Labour MPs will need clean hands.Some remain-voting MPs in leave-voting seats writhe under their dilemma. Lisa Nandy – who did vote for the Cooper bill – makes a good case for “respecting Brexit” for fear blocking it will lead to democratic disillusion and the rise of the non-democratic far-right. But her case is not good enough. With the country at the crossroads, this is where the mettle of every MP is tested to do what’s right even if unpopular – to lead not follow in rescuing the country from present danger.The likes of Anna Turley in leave-voting Redcar and Bridget Phillipson in Sunderland are among many taking that admirable stand. I hear Labour MPs say that if they lose their seats over this, so be it: they will have done their best to stop a Brexit cataclysm. These are the Edmund Burke-ites – though he was ejected by the voters of Bristol he famously ignored.Those Labour MPs who broke the whip did great damage. Across the floor are unknown numbers of vacillating Tories who voted to let May have one last forlorn chance at renegotiating her plan, but next time might vote to prevent a no-deal result. Richard Harrington, business minister, says he gives her two weeks, but then will vote to stop no deal. Amber Rudd, Greg Clark, Philip Hammond and other ministers might resign to vote against no deal – and others stand on that brink. But they will only break their own whip and take that plunge if they are certain the numbers are there: looking across at those Labour 25 who wrecked the Cooper amendment, they may calculate it’s not worth making a gallant gesture unless certain to succeed. They need another 12 on top of the 16 Tories who rebelled on Tuesday.Despite warnings on all sides that no deal creeps closer, I stay determined to believe it impossible the Commons will let it happen. Enough MPs will summon enough courage. The Dromey-Spelman indicative amendment – though only squeaking in – shows a majority ready to stop the worst. Besides, between gritted teeth, despite May calling Brexit her “sacred duty”, I cannot believe she wants a no-deal disaster. She will return effectively empty-handed from Brussels, needing to tell her party only a softer Norwegian-style deal stands a chance.Delay, rethink, renegotiate – or a final say for the voters – these are all more plausible than the Commons opting for no deal. Though she has badly misjudged every stage of Brexit, even she will surely pull back at the last moment. Why would she want to captain the ship when a no-deal tsunami swamps the decks? Surely not."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ceb6ba74f5a9e64a1a9381c1d567f4938e44e1e4/270_235_2905_1744/master/2905.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dafd8b7091f65d1caea86c64fa7bf161","title":"joel edgerton on boy erased i crave the acceptance of the lgbtq community","story":"The actor-director talks about being under scrutiny as a straight man telling and appearing in a story about gay-conversion therapyAre straight directors qualified to tell gay stories on screen? The Australian actor-director Joel Edgerton didn’t think he was. At least, not when first reading Boy Erased: A Memoir, Garrard Conley’s account of his childhood experiences in gay conversion therapy. He knew it would make a compelling film, but he didn’t believe he was best placed to do it.“I was like: fuck, this would be a great movie and I would love to be the one to do it. But I don’t think I can, simply because I’m not of the LGBTQ community,” he says. “I’d really started to think in the last couple of years a lot about representation – mainly in front of the screen.”He optioned the book anyway, unable to shake it from his mind. He sought out Conley, spoke to survivors of conversion therapy, researched the infrastructure surrounding it, met with Conley’s abuser and then began a screenplay. Directing it became a less distant possibility. “It was like, I feel so passionate about it and I can’t get this out of my head.”The resulting film follows Conley – Jared, played by Lucas Hedges – as he comes out to his mother (Nicole Kidman) and father (Russell Crowe), a Baptist preacher who convinces his son to enroll on a 12-day conversion therapy course. The film is largely set in Memphis at the real-life Love in Action, an “ex-gay” Christian ministry, run on screen by Edgerton as chief therapist Victor Sykes (a portrayal of the ministry’s former director, John Smid).To that end, he showed Conley every draft of the script and cut of the movie, and one of the first versions was sent to Glaad, the US organisation that monitors media coverage of LGBTQ issues. According to Edgerton, the organisation had only “one or two” concerns. One character removed from an early draft was a girl enrolled in the Love in Action programme after her parents caught her having an “indiscretion” with the family pet. “Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction,” says Edgerton. “I don’t want any chance for people to watch this movie and think we’re painting anyone of the LGBTQ community as deviant.”Instead, he swung the other way, writing in Troye Sivan’s character, Gary: a composed, seemingly well-adjusted young gay man, savvy enough to tell the conversion therapists what they want to hear. “Love in Action was trying to make people into deviants,” adds Edgerton, “it was not our job as film-makers to do that.”Another omission was that of a teacher who had assaulted his students. The character was originally included to highlight the institution’s practice of putting sexual abusers in the same group as young people (“I found that a fascinating indictment of the lack of care in the place”), but, on reflection, Edgerton felt time constraints inhibited an adequate exploration of the character.Although you wonder how a gay director would have tackled the same issues, the fact that Edgerton is in some ways sanitising Conley’s memoir – rather than sensationalising it – perhaps demonstrates the increasing sensitivities straight directors have about how they tell queer stories. But by Edgerton’s own admission, his eagerness to avoid feeding into gay tropes or causing offence limited his writing.“I also wish I could have been a smart enough writer to amplify a quality in Garrard that he described in the book: that, even at Love in Action, his way of coping, like many of us, was through humour, and he was a bit of a class clown,” he says. “My fear was that if I had Lucas cracking jokes and doing other stuff, it would give the wrong steer and diminish the tension. But I wonder if a better writer than me would have been able to include that as a builder of tension, rather than a diminisher.”Edgerton’s preparation for the film took him to Texas, where he met Smid, the man he would be portraying. Smid joined the Love in Action leadership in 1986 and eventually became its director. He left in 2008 and publicly apologised three years later for the wounds the programme inflicted on vulnerable young people. At the end of the film – spoiler alert – it is revealed that Smid married another man in 2014.Edgerton says Smid was “brave enough” to come to the film’s premiere in New York, and had originally offered himself up as a consultant during its production. Smid is not entirely sold on the telling of events according to Edgerton (although he has written in the Advocate that the film was “largely an accurate depiction of such programmes”).“Looking back, Smid thinks things weren’t as bad and there wasn’t any shouting and all that,” says Edgerton. “But then it’s a case of ‘he said, she said’, I think. Garrard will tell you one thing. John might tell you another. My point of access is Garrard: he’s the guy I side with. But I appreciate John’s open-heartedness to reflect on something and to put his hand up and acknowledge that he made big mistakes.“It was important from me to hear everybody’s point of view,” he continues, “because we were setting out to have an empathetic approach to everybody.”Born in New South Wales, Edgerton was raised a devout Catholic – a “Ned Flanders kid” – in a town he describes as homophobic. Now agnostic (aside, he says, from some Catholic guilt), he internalised the town’s attitudes and had to learn to accept homosexuality later in life.“I experienced bullying, but I also remember being in a group chastising somebody else and being a bully,” he says. “I’ve played both sides of that coin. And I don’t think anybody, or certainly I, never really knew what homosexuality was and yet we would all use these words, these slurs and these derogatory ways of teasing people. And so I’ve definitely been a part of that. Almost like that culture of behaviour that’s learned.“You just treat anybody who’s different in a way that you single them out,” he continues. “You push them around. You do all that stuff. I was never aware of what any of that meant until I met my first gay man when I was 16.”It wasn’t until he began drama school in Sydney that he developed meaningful relationships with gay men and acquired a “real deeper understanding of seuxality and its spectrum.“I had been living in such a cloistered environment where everything is same-same and everybody’s pretending and nobody is doing anything out of the ordinary because it’s all about safety and not being singled out,” he says. “And I was like, OK, there’s a whole other world out here that I’ve never experienced and I’m getting my crash course in right now.”One sequence in the film has met with disapproval: a graphic depiction of a sexual assault on Garrard by another student at his college. Some were frustrated that the only sexual act between two men in the film involved violence others felt that the trauma of sexual abuse was ignored and the film lacked an adequate trigger warning (Edgerton says there is one in Australia).“Most criticism of the film, I find fair,” he says. “I can appreciate that some people are like, ‘Well, where’s the love and tenderness?’ … but the first sexual experience you see in the film is one of violence. It happened to Garrard, it’s very much part of his story. It was a catalyst for him coming out. I wanted to be unflinching about it.“It sounds trite, but it’s tough to please all of the people all of the time, especially when you’re going out on a limb on something that is extreme, like assault,” he adds.Boy Erased scores points among many, however, for casting in its lead role an actor open about his own sexual fluidity. This at a time when the debate over whether straight actors should portray gay characters rages anew, following Darren Criss’s announcement that he would no longer take on gay roles, and awards acclaim for Rami Malek and Olivia Colman playing LGBTQ characters.Edgerton is clearly aware of the sensitivities around the debate. And he recognises that, as a straight man, he will be under particular scrutiny. But he dances around the topic, referencing the backlash against Scarlett Johansson after it was announced she’d been cast as Dante “Tex” Gill, a trans man, and he refuses to commit to either side of the debate. “Maybe that movie will never get that made,” he says. “Is it better that the movie is made? And I’m not putting my opinion into this.”Regardless, he’s happy with the Boy Erased casting in this regard, and fairly so: Hedges (who has previously stated he’s “not totally straight”) in the main role, while Xavier Dolan and Sivan (both out gay men) are cast in secondary roles as gay men. But does he think there is a still a broader issue with hiring LGBTQ people in Hollywood?“Definitely not behind the scenes,,” says Edgerton. “A massive percentage of my behind-the-camera crew, heads of department, are from the LGBTQ community. And they don’t have any trouble getting employment, as far as I can tell.”He hopes that Sivan’s performance in Boy Erased, as well as his various successes elsewhere, could help to inspire other actors to come out. “Troye has shown by example that, by being out and proud, there’s actually maybe an even bigger audience for you than the assumption that you would diminish your audience,” says Edgerton, who claims to “absolutely” know actors who aren’t out. “Clearly, I wouldn’t out anybody. But just the idea that that is your world – it’s almost like you’d rather take away your fame and just lead a normal life. I just can’t imagine what that would feel like. It shouldn’t exist in the acting community.”Edgerton’s hopes for his own finished film are similarly virtuous: being used as an “icebreaker” between young LGBTQ people and their parents, or as a guide for those considering enrolling their children in conversion therapy. He is certainly keen for it to be wider educational piece: before the end credits, viewers are told that 700,000 LGBTQ Americans have undergone conversion therapy programmes, while only 14 US states have deemed it illegal. Ultimately, his ambition seems to be for the film’s cultural relevance to diminish.“It would be nice if, as soon as possible, the film was really a museum piece so that people can watch it and go: ‘Oh shit, they used to do that kind of thing.’ Of course, it’s very naive to say that the persecution of LGBTQ people could ever just go away because conversion therapy is one thing,” he says, before invoking – ambitiously, but perhaps not unfairly – One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest. “The hope is that there was no point even making the film.”• Boy Erased is released on 8 February in the UK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89d227ad6319e5d898469c45c8a0dbb8f68e37b9/0_128_3760_2256/master/3760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=457bdc5a15672502ad505ba0593a3eaa","title":"the lowdown on british columbia this canadian province is not to be missed","story":"With cosmopolitan cities nudging wide-open wilderness, spectacular wildlife and a superb culinary scene, British Columbia offers a host of amazing adventuresChefs around the world adore BC for its incredible produce, from sweet spot prawns, celebrated in a festival each year at Vancouver’s Fisherman’s Wharf, to the juicy Okanagan cherries and peaches, which locals devour by the crate.Start planning your trip by poring over online menus at stellar Vancouver restaurants such as chef Andrea Carlson’s Burdock \u0026amp Co Gastown go-to, French-influenced L’Abattoir or the upmarket west coast take at Botanist.

But it has emerged that, after an appeal, the two will be able to return to the campus from September.Two of the other men were suspended for just one year, meaning that four of the five who were disciplined could return as students at the start of the next academic year. The fifth student was banned from the campus for life.In an open letter to Warwick, one of the women involved said: “I feel terrified at the prospect of having these boys in my seminars and lectures, as they sit there feeling guilt-free. Knowing that I may have to come face to face with them again just to continue my education is unacceptable.”Saying that she had suffered from depression, anxiety and eating disorders since the group chats were published, the woman said she felt humiliated. “You have failed to protect countless students like myself, and don’t even have an adequate system in place to look after students who are suffering and hurting,” she told the university.The news of the return of the men also provoked a strong reaction among the university’s staff.“Staff and students in my department are united in our shock and disgust at this decision,” Prof Emma Mason, head of Warwick’s English department, said in a letter to the vice-chancellor, Stuart Croft.“We wish to express strong and renewed support for those students harmed by these posts, abhorrence at the contents of the posts, and a deep concern about the decision to reduce the terms of suspension.”The university said in a statement that the behaviour of the men involved in the group chat was “abhorrent and unacceptable”.Prof Christine Ennew, provost of the University of Warwick, said that the appeals panel focussed on the scale of the penalties, with the students accepting culpability.“Privacy considerations mean that we are not able to disclose the specific details on which the decisions were made. However, the panel reached the view that there were clear reasons to require that the punishments imposed should be comparable across all of those iniduals sanctioned,” Ennew said.“The penalties imposed combine direct punishment for the deeply offensive and threatening comments made during the chats, future behavioural restrictions and a requirement to engage in processes to enable them to learn from their past unacceptable behaviour.”The penalties were intended to allow the women affected to complete their studies before the men returned but one woman told The Boar, the Warwick student newspaper: “I wanted to do a master’s here but that’s not an option any more. Other girls who were named and talked about in the chat are still going to be here next year in the same department.”The returning students will have further conditions imposed on them, the university said.Liam Jackson, the president of Warwick students’ union, said there was “considerable unease” around the outcome of the appeals process and he said he wanted to see the university’s disciplinary procedures changed.“We remain shocked by the content of the group chat, and our stance continues to be that sexism, racism and oppression of any kind have no place within our community,” Jackson said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d80f54de1e2859b8b1f86597a44dfe0c39b4bf1/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cdb67273f149cabf55a541c0a901a57c","title":"us academics feel the invisible hand of politicians and big agriculture","story":"As universities rely more on industry for funds, researchers taking a stand on health or environment say they’re sidelinedby Kate Cox and Claire BrownIn a windowless conference room epidemiologist Steve Wing was frantically blacking out chunks of his own research.Wing had been working on a study looking into the impacts of industrial-scale hog operations on health for the University of North Carolina. But the state’s Pork Council had caught wind of the research, and filed a Freedom of Information Act Request (FOIA) to gain access to his findings. “They went after Steve, asking him to turn over any documentation. They went directly to the university and got the lawyers to try and make him hand it over,” says Naeema Muhammad, one of Wing’s community partners.Wing had promised the community members who had spoken to him that he’d protect their privacy. Revealing even a few basic details could have compromised their identities. “Because … if their occupation was a nurse, they lived in a household with three other people, they were aged 35-39 … there’s only one person like that in a rural area,” Wing said in a 2015 interview.The university warned Wing that if he failed to hand over the documents, he could be arrested for theft of state property and even sent to jail. The data didn’t belong to him, it belonged to the state. But handing over the identities put his subjects in jeopardy. It wasn’t unheard of for people to lose their jobs for taking a public stand against the politically powerful pork industry.Wing’s lawyer negotiated heavy redactions in response to the FOIA request. “We did give over the records, and I actually to this day remain regretful that I didn’t resist more,” Wing said in the 2015 interview. In November 2016 Wing died. “He went to his deathbed with them still harassing him to turn over his information,” says Muhammad.Work like Wing’s is exactly the kind research institutions are meant to carry out. And academia writ large is supposed to be independent. Scientists at public universities work for the taxpayers. Their research is supposed to advance the public interest.But over the past 30 years, as public funding for university research has dried up, private industry money has poured in. And with industry money comes industry priorities. Agribusiness has funded research that has advanced its interests and suppressed research that undermines its ability to chase unfettered growth. The levers of power at play can seem anecdotal – a late-night phone call here, a missed professional opportunity there. But interviews with researchers across the US revealed stories of industry pressure on iniduals, university deans and state legislatures to follow an agenda that prioritises business over human health and the environment.Take Iowa, a state that is, in both identity and capacity, American farm country. According to data released by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) in October 2018, the state produces more commodity corn and hogs – and in many years, soybeans – than any other US state. In Iowa, pigs outnumber people by nearly eight to one.For decades, deep relationships have existed between the agriculture industry and the state’s politicians – and increasingly those alliances are catching the state’s universities in their crosshairs. In 1980, when the federal government passed the Bayh-Dole Act, encouraging universities to partner with the private sector on agricultural research, leaders at academic institutions were incentivised to seek money from agribusiness. Two of the state’s universities in particular seem to have felt the reach of this policy: Iowa State, which is a land-grant institution, and the University of Iowa, which doesn’t have an agriculture school but feels the pressure of agribusiness influence. Researchers at both institutions told us they had felt the direct impact of agribusiness dollars on their work. So who’s pulling the strings? Take, for example, the looming presence of the Iowa Farm Bureau – 100 years old, with more than 150,000 members, and sitting on $1.4bn (£1bn) in total assets, having taken in nearly $88 million in revenue in 2015 alone. While the public can’t see the specifics of private-sector funding for universities, we do know that the Iowa Farm Bureau has contributed more than $3m to Iowa State University over the past 30 years.Other industry-specific lobbies – the Iowa Pork Council and other commodity groups – also contribute directly to universities. The Pork Council, for instance, provides scholarship opportunities to Iowa State University students majoring in agriculture-related fields. Additionally, it contributed $200,000 directly to the university, according to tax filings from 2016.And then there are the politically influential businessmen Charles and David Koch, intensely pro-free market billionaires who line the coffers of far-right politicians, and who owe their immense fortunes in part to manufacturing fertiliser. In 2017, the Koch Foundation announced a donation of nearly $1.7m to Iowa State University for an economics programme.That makes the agribusiness industry a powerful special interest in Iowa’s universities.Of course, this money has helped to create world-class courses and opportunities for many students and academics. Nevertheless, some would argue that it has also created an atmosphere in which research that is not directly helpful to the industry can appear to bite the hand that fed it.In 2017, for example, after 30 years of research into alternative methods of agriculture, the Aldo Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture at Iowa State was deprived of funds in the state budget in a bill signed off by former governor Terry Branstad (whose own campaign received $88,000 from the Iowa Farm Bureau, coincidentally). It left the institution alive in name only.Or back a little further, when Jim Merchant, the founding dean of the University of Iowa College of Public Health, retired, he planned to continue analysing an existing data set, the Keokuk County Rural Health Study. (Professors are often allowed to conduct research after they retire.) He’d already published work using the same data set to link industrial-scale hog farms with asthma rates in local children. Still, he thought there were more insights to be gleaned from the information that had been collected.Money wasn’t a problem. Merchant had secured funding to carry out his work. Yet, he says, the administration of the School of Public Health stalled the project in 2014. He was told he couldn’t do research as an emeritus professor, even though it had been permitted in the past.He suspected that the school’s concerns about potential blowback from Iowa’s $7bn livestock agriculture industry had something to do with it. His work was a threat: establishing a link between hog farming and childhood asthma rates could prompt the state legislature to regulate emissions – an expensive proposition for the industry. If Merchant was right, it wouldn’t have been his first encounter with the industry’s invisible reach. In 2002, an entire school of agriculture distanced itself from a seemingly rock-solid, collaborative study – of which he was a part – on air emissions from animal operations. Some two dozen scientists and researchers from the state’s two major universities were involved.Then-governor of Iowa Tom Vilsack had asked them to collaborate on a study of CAFO (concentrated animal feeding operations) impact on air quality. The researchers submitted a 221-page response. At the time, Merchant says the collaborators had reached a consensus on the executive summary. “We agreed on every word,” he says.David Osterberg, professor emeritus in the Department of Occupational and Environmental Health at the University of Iowa, and a fellow member of the study group, remembers it the same way. “After the report came out – immediately afterwards – the Farm Bureau demanded that Iowa State professors come to their headquarters to get beat up,” he says. “It was like, the next morning: ‘You be here tomorrow.’ They were livid.”Shortly after, the public distancing started. A story in National Hog Farmer, an industry-backed publication, quoted several anonymous sources who undermined Merchant’s claim of academic consensus. Then, at a meeting with state legislators, Wendy Wintersteen, the current university president who was then associate dean of the College of Agriculture at Iowa State, said her university was backing away from the report. She declined to comment for this story. “This is inidual work of 12 Iowa State faculty members – not a report of Iowa State University – the work of 12 faculty members, of their inidual research,” Merchant says, still indignant years later.The danger that Merchant was highlighting – compromised academic integrity by way of industry-related golden handcuffs – isn’t limited to Iowa. In the mid-2000s, the Pew Charitable Trusts commissioned a large study on animal agriculture and antibiotics. Bob Martin, director of food system policy at the Johns Hopkins University’s Center for a Livable Future in Baltimore, Maryland, led the project. By most measures, it was unique in its scope and scale. It was one of the first to critically examine the role of antibiotics in meat production, and friends told Martin the findings had a major impact on the Obama administration’s agricultural agenda.But as he got deeper into the work, Martin says he noticed that researchers were afraid to be associated with it. “We were approached every time we went near a land-grant school – Iowa State, NC State, University of Arkansas. Professors would pull us aside and say they’re under enormous pressure when they get industry funding to kind of cater their research to that.”Martin estimates that about half a dozen contributing researchers asked for their names to be withheld from the list of authors in the final draft for fear of retribution.A number of researchers we spoke to across the country echoed similar concerns. Their experiences range from seeing their published work undermined in industry magazines to being discouraged from conducting certain research or feeling undermined by their own deans, and one person was even driven out of the field entirely. Another researcher, who agreed to testify in a lawsuit that threatened to hold industry accountable for pollution, saw his position eliminated just before the court battle began. As soon as the plaintiffs lost, he was re-hired.Of course, it’s not all fear and loathing in academia. Marty Strange, who teaches agriculture history and policy at Green Mountain College in Vermont, says the private sector offers tantalising incentives, too. Industry-backed groups host conferences, pay high speaker fees, and hire academics for lucrative consulting jobs. “Any time you have people who work in the public trust who can freelance and get private-sector money for doing private-sector things, you’re going to get intellectual corruption,” says Strange.And for a university administrator, balancing industry priorities and academic freedom may be more complex than it appears. Incentive structures for school leaders in agriculture states are entirely different from those for independent researchers. Administrators’ success is measured in part by the money they bring in, and the Pew Commission found that they’ve been forced to rely more on industry money to keep their institutions afloat.But the change has not gone unnoticed. In 2013, former Iowa senator Tom Harkin revoked plans to donate his papers from 40 years in the House and Senate to a namesake public policy institute at Iowa State, his alma mater. As Politico reported at the time, Harkin’s reason was startling: “He said he was backing out after it became clear he could not trust university leaders to allow unrestricted academic freedom at the institute.”Academic freedom appears increasingly conditional. But that’s not the premise on which public research universities were founded. They are supposed to prioritise the public interest. Arguably, ag-friendly universities have left that behind in favour of research that benefits their agribusiness benefactors. And for researchers in certain fields, life can be made easier by just sticking to the script.“If you wish to get ahead in academia – particularly in a land-grant university, and we saw this again and again through our Pew Report – Big Ag has a stranglehold over land grant universities,” says Jim Merchant, the former dean of Iowa University’s School of Public Health, who was barred from completing his funded research as an emeritus professor.Ultimately, he says, “agribusiness has tremendous influence on their research … as a result of that, the administrators and the faculty at these land-grant universities are heavily influenced, if not beholden, to agricultural interests.”This article was published with The New Food Economy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42c1bcb522e06b12dbf3032d5aaecea972b80fda/317_806_6124_3674/master/6124.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52e5b17123d76d58d383ecd14f744124","title":"whistleblower christopher wylie joins fashion retailer h m","story":"Canadian who exposed data misuse at Cambridge Analytica hired as research directorChristopher Wylie, the Canadian whistleblower who last year exposed the misuse of data by the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, has been hired by the Swedish fashion retailer H\u0026ampM.The business confirmed that it had signed a consultancy contract with Wylie, who will take the role of research director. His main focus will be “to help H\u0026ampM group improve its capabilities within consumer, product and market insights. Besides that, he also supports our work on sustainable and ethical AI,” said a spokesperson for the retailer.It comes after H\u0026ampM reported its sixth consecutive quarter of falling profits, as well as an announcement in March that it had an increased level of unsold garments, worth more than $4bn (£3.05bn) in total. As a result, the company is stepping up its use of data and artificial intelligence to predict future sales and minimise such costs.Wylie was working towards a PhD in fashion trend forecasting when he joined SCL Elections, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica. He devised a method that used personal information harvested from Facebook accounts to create political and psychological profiles of users. Targeted advertisements could then be used to influence the political opinions and voting habits of those signed up to the social network. The method was found to have been used during the 2016 US presidential election.Wylie also revealed how his research had found that fans of American denim brands such as Wrangler, Hollister and Lee Jeans were found to be more likely to engage with pro-Trump messaging. Fashion labels such as Kenzo or Alexander McQueen were more likely to attract Democratic voters, he said.Wylie had tweeted about trips to Sweden twice in the last month, where H\u0026ampM’s head office is based.

In this sense, chayote is a typical gourd, uncertainly positioned between fruit and vegetable, and confusingly sweet for something most often used in a savoury context. To look at, it’s a fruit if a granny smith and a quince went on a naughty weekend, the chayote might plausibly be the upshot. It has the apple’s lurid green skin, which, unless grated or chopped very finely, is best peeled off its quince-like, quite dry flesh before being added to all manner of dishes.Having peeled, cored and sliced one into large dice, I try some raw, and am reminded of an under-ripe green melon or a flavoursome cucumber – it is crunchy and sweet, but not cloyingly so. I like it … but then I’m about to sauté it with butter, garlic, spring onions and parsley, which seems a bit wrong. But it turns out I am the one that’s wrong, because it works well with our meal of chicken, rice and roasted cauliflower, the garlic offsetting the sweetness and the butter bringing richness.Like the bitter gourd used in Sri Lankan curries, chayote loses its hard edges when cooked, softening and melting into the other ingredients without losing its crispiness. As Miss Fay, from the YouTube channel Cook Like a Jamaican, says: “It’s very bland in itself, but whatever you add it to, it absorbs the flavour.” For this reason, chayote often isn’t the star of the show, instead fleshing out soups, stews and curries. It’s robust enough to be baked with cheese or stuffed with meat, and absorbs pickle liquor or salad dressing like a pro.Chayote won’t be replacing courgette – or other summer squashes, to which it is often compared – in my kitchen any time soon. Although it is clearly versatile, I don’t think it slots into my repertoire seamlessly enough to be worth a special trip to Asda. But I do think that if I were fed (and fell in love with) a dish in which it featured prominently, I would make a point of buying it for that purpose, weaving it into my culinary inventory more as an ingredient for a specific recipe than as a veg drawer novelty.

That will be particularly true if Denis Suárez is ready to start following his arrival from Barcelona, since he has the ingenuity to provide even better service to the clinical Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette, while also being more dynamic than Mesut Özil. Arsenal tend to be dismal on the road, but if they attack with gusto they might just upset City (who could be third in the table at kickoff, depending on Spurs’ result against Newcastle) and take precious points in an increasingly tight battle for fourth spot. PDFor all the focus on the anxiety that hindered Liverpool during their midweek draw with Leicester, perhaps the league leaders would have settled Anfield’s nerves if they one of their right-backs had been available. With Jordan Henderson pressed into an unfamiliar role, Liverpool were unconvincing up and down their right flank. The good news, however, is that James Milner is available again after a one-match ban and Trent Alexander-Arnold could also return from a knee injury in time for Monday’s trip to West Ham. Henderson’s leadership was missed in the middle against Leicester, and Alexander-Arnold’s thrusting runs have become an important part of Liverpool’s attacking play. Signs of nerves at this stage are a concern, but Jürgen Klopp’s side should have a more settled feel if all the pieces of the machine are in the right place against a side who will be vulnerable down their left side if Aaron Cresswell is not fit enough to replace the suspect Arthur Masuaku. JSNewcastle travel to Wembley to take on Tottenham in the Saturday lunchtime kick-off, hoping to end a seven-match losing streak at the stadium that stretches back almost 45 years. They will arrive reasonably well-equipped to do so, having just beaten Manchester City and with their fans eager to get a first glimpse of the club’s new record signing. With supporters threatening not to renew their season tickets and Rafael Benítez remaining non-committal about his future, the arrival of Miguel Almirón from Atlanta can be interpreted as a peace offering from Mike Ashley, but what exactly can fans expect from their new midfielder. According to Tanner McLeod of Atlanta Fan TV, the Paraguay international is diligent, hard-working, lightning fast, has a keen eye for goal and is most comfortable playing behind a striker, although he can also deliver from a deeper position or out on the wing. If he can translate the qualities that helped him captain Atlanta to last season’s MLS Cup to the Premier League, cult status on Tyneside looks assured. BGWhile plenty of Leicester City fans continue to insist that Claude Puel’s brand of football is too anodyne to watch on a regular basis, it was not difficult not to be impressed with the Frenchman’s tactical approach in the midweek draw with Liverpool. Leicester were organised at the back, passed crisply in midfield and were always a threat on the break, with Demarai Gray and James Maddison menacing and inventive behind the speedy Jamie Vardy. The problems tend to arise when Puel’s side have to break down opponents who are happy to sit deep and defend in numbers, especially at home. Yet it is easy to see why they have fared so well against the top sides this season and they are unlikely to be confronted by negativity when they host Manchester United on Sunday. United’s refreshingly open style under Ole Gunnar Solskjær could suit a team with Leicester’s counterattacking potential. JSSoon we will see what messages got through during the hour-long pow-wow between Maurizio Sarri and his players following Wednesday’s 4-0 humiliation at Bournemouth. Might the Italian have finally found a way to motivate the players he says are hard to reach? Might he show flexibility by taking on board concerns that may have been raised by players about tactics? Or might he have alienated some players with intransigence and public criticism? If Sarri has judged things right, Huddersfield could be on the end of a tonking. But if the reaction to the Bournemouth fiasco has aggravated Chelsea’s problems, then Jan Siewert could claim his first points as Huddersfield manager and push Sarri’s reign closer to an early end. PDAs a man who knows a thing or two about pulling off miracles, the importance of Fulham’s game at Crystal Palace on Saturday will not be lost on Claudio Ranieri. A side who are yet to taste consecutive wins in the league this season simply must keep the positive momentum rolling after their dramatic comeback against Brighton \u0026amp Hove Albion. Strange things can happen when relegation-haunted sides start to string a few results together and Fulham should head to Selhurst Park with a spring in their step after their second-half bombardment in midweek, especially as Palace will be without the suspended Wilfried Zaha. Though Zaha was absent when Palace beat Leicester in December, Roy Hodgson’s side tend to struggle without their talismanic winger. Fulham, who are six points below their south London rivals, will be kicking themselves if they pass up this opportunity – they need to keep belief high before hosting United next weekend. JSFollowing a midweek post-match interview in which he insisted “tonight is not about” complaining about various injustices visited upon his team while making sure to list each of those injustices – an offside, a soft penalty and a “mystery five minutes” of added time – in turn, Sean Dyche belittled a journalist for asking him about rumours Sam Vokes was about to leave Burnley. An apology may be due as the striker promptly moved to Stoke City in exchange for the 38-year-old Peter Crouch and cash, but Dyche is to be commended for welcoming the universally popular forward back to the big time for his top-flight swansong. The scorer of the most headed goals in Premier League history, Crouch looks likely to extend his record of 152 substitute appearances now that he is in his dotage. Having scored for each of the six clubs he has represented in the Premier League (only Craig Bellamy has scored for more), his arrival should guarantee at least one goal to go with the two he has already bagged for the Potters this season. BGManuel Pellegrini did not appear to have made any particular plan to curtail Matt Doherty’s runs on Wednesday, which is one of the reasons why Wolves trounced West Ham 3-0. Marco Silva is likely to have taken note, even if Everton’ s persistent vulnerability from set pieces has some fans wondering about his thoroughness. Another manager who is unlikely to overlook the wingback this weekend is Mick McCarthy, who will have an ideal chance to compare the form of Doherty and Séamus Coleman before deciding which of them to make the Republic of Ireland’s first-choice right-back when the Euro 2020 campaign kicks off. Perhaps McCarthy will find a way of including both, but the fact that there is a case for choosing Doherty ahead of Coleman reflects how well Doherty has taken to the Premier League and what a difficult season the previously faultless Coleman has been enduring. PDAs impressive as their midweek demolition of Chelsea at the Vitality Stadium might have been, Bournemouth have been less than impressive on the road this season. They have won just three out of 12 away from home in all competitions, losing nine including their past seven on the trot. They travel to Cardiff City on Saturday, for a match that will be preceded by tributes to Emiliano Sala, the tragic striker who will forever be remembered as the greatest striker the Welsh club never had. While understandably unlikely to eclipse the midweek scenes at the Argentinian striker’s former club of Nantes, the emotion of the occasion might rouse the home side to riff on Bournemouth’s away-day pain. BGThis will be Watford’s sixth away assignment in seven matches, and next week’s match at home to Everton is followed by another three away trips in a row. They have coped pretty well so far with a schedule that would have banjaxed Brighton, who remain woeful on the road. Chris Hughton’s side were particularly bad at Watford in August although they only conceded two goals, both lovely efforts by Roberto Pereyra – one of the best players outside the top six along with Wilfried Zaha and Jamie Vardy. Brighton will have to subdue the Brazilian on Saturday if they are to sustain their strong home form, which is so far keeping them above the relegation zone. For Watford, meanwhile, another success on their travels would heighten the suspicion that Javi Gracia’s side – who finished just above Brighton last season – could reach Europe this term.

A package focused on job creation would make “it very difficult for Labour MPs in leave areas to vote against the deal unless they want a second referendum”.But Anna Turley, who represents Redcar, said the offer amounted to little more than “bribes or sweeteners” to MPs who signed up to a revised Brexit deal “which we know will make those constituencies worse off”.“Given that the government have taken £6bn out of northern constituencies, is it not time that they held a proper debate on fairer funding for the north, instead of offering bribes and pork barrel politics?” Turley added.No 10 is drawing up a package of measures aimed at wooing Labour MPs into supporting a revised Brexit package, in the belief that a hard core of up to 30 Tory Brexiters will never vote for any deal the prime minister can renegotiate.A Downing Street spokesman would not be drawn on the details of the investment fund that Mann hopes the government will announce as part of the package, which is also expected to include legislation to protect workers’ rights after Brexit.The prime minister’s spokesman added “we are determined to lead a programme of national renewal, post-Brexit”, saying that May had a long-term commitment to tackle inequalities, and that “no community should feel that they are left behind”.Downing Street rejected the idea that any plan amounted to “cash for votes”, although any investment package would have to be carefully put together as there will be demands from Conservative MPs for greater investment in shire areas and possibly further demands from the Democratic Unionist party who are currently opposed to May’s Brexit deal.Shortly after the 2017 general election, which cost the Conservatives their overall majority, the governing party agreed to fund £1bn of extra investment in Northern Ireland as part of an agreement with the DUP, in which the minor party would support the government in key votes.Senior Labour figures are ided on how to proceed as May struggles. The party is opposed to no deal, and its leadership is not keen on a second referendum, but Jeremy Corbyn has said he would support a deal based on a post-Brexit customs union, a close single-market relationship and enhanced workers’ rights.Some in the shadow cabinet argue that the logic of Corbyn’s position could see Labour eventually working with the government to get a Brexit deal through if the prime minister is willing to compromise over a customs union.But others such as Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, have in the past warned that Labour voters in remain areas would not understand the party reaching any sort of accommodation with the government.Few in Labour seriously believe that May would compromise or that Corbyn could work with her, but there is a view that MPs in leave-supporting areas may not be punished by the leadership if they were to support a revised Brexit deal.Mann was one of 14 MPs who defied a three-line whip on Tuesday night to vote against Yvette Cooper’s amendment aimed at giving parliament more time to avoid a no-deal Brexit. A further 11 abstained.Labour sources said the MPs have been “spoken to in the usual way, and reminded of their obligations to vote with the whip” but not otherwise punished. Nick Brown, the party’s chief whip, has indicated that he would consider how to deal with MPs voting against the leadership line at the end of the Brexit process.When asked about the idea of extra cash for coalfield communities, Corbyn said: “Clearly, there has to be investment in those communities – but the Brexit plan proposed by Theresa May doesn’t solve that any more than the government’s austerity programme is going to solve any of that.”Senior trade union officials also met with civil servants on Thursday lunchtime to discuss plans to legislate to further safeguard workers’ rights after Brexit. To the surprise of those present, Greg Clark, the business secretary, dropped in for half a hour – even though cabinet ministers normally only meet union chiefs.After the meeting, a TUC spokesperson said they were always willing to engage with government, but added: “Our movement has been clear that working people need a binding guarantee for their rights, now and into the future. We won’t support a Brexit deal which fails this test, and the government has come nowhere close to meeting it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca226f08a38a985a2a688787faa33bb520c14101/97_147_2355_1413/master/2355.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3420bf7f731e217f11bf85db674d37e","title":"judge to review fiona onasanya ruling after leniency objection","story":"Former Labour MP’s three-month jail term to be re-examined after complaintFiona Onasanya, the MP jailed for repeatedly lying about a speeding ticket, is to have her three-month prison sentence reviewed after a complaint that it is unduly lenient.

There cannot be one law for those in positions of power, privilege and responsibility and another for those who are not,” he said.If the attorney general’s office finds the sentence to be unduly lenient, the case will be referred to the court of appeal which will decide whether or not to increase it.Onasanya, 35, who now sits as an independent, is appealing against her conviction.

But in an age of predatory capitalism and rampant inequality, can one man’s modest suggestions really make much difference? By  Daniel CohenEvery Tuesday night, an email newsletter goes out to 13 million subscribers. It’s far more popular than Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop newsletter, which has 8 million, and the New York Times Morning Briefing, with 1.7 million. Its name, Money Saving Expert’s Money Tips, barely hints at the astounding range of tricks and deals contained within. Recent emails have featured “hacks” for cheaper meals at Nando’s and McDonald’s, deals on broadband and savings accounts, codes giving discounted access to airport lounges and an offer for free radiator heat-reflector pads.The newsletter looks like a relic from an earlier age of the internet: thousands of words, with no ads and few images. It began as an email that Martin Lewis – the personal finance journalist now better known as the Money Saving Expert – wrote for his friends. Today, it is the work of dozens of people at MoneySavingExpert, the website Lewis founded in 2003, which has become one of the 100 most popular sites in the UK, with 16 million visitors a month.The business of saving money has made Lewis extremely wealthy. After he sold the site in 2012 to the price-comparison firm MoneySupermarket for £87m, the Financial Times called him “the most successful journalist in the world, ever”. A year later, he was the seventh most Googled celebrity in the UK, nestled between Taylor Swift and Beyoncé.Lewis still worries over every line in the email each week. When I went to meet him on a Tuesday afternoon last July, he was studying the draft of that night’s newsletter, pondering aloud the merits of competing broadband deals. There was a gold piggy bank on his desk. It was the height of the heatwave, and Lewis, who is lean and often tanned, was dressed in the uniform of a sensible dad doing his best to enjoy a long-awaited summer holiday: a short-sleeved, stripy white shirt with a denim collar, denim shorts and the navy Skechers that he wore almost every time I met him.In our age of insecurity, Lewis stands out as a reassuring source of authority. Addressing a country that has never been comfortable talking about money, Lewis takes us by the hand and guides us through the bewildering world of finance. He comes across as a kind of double agent, who goes undercover among the powerful then reports back to the rest of society. It may feel as though banks, corporations and energy companies are lined up against the inidual, with few politicians willing to intervene, but Lewis’s work offers the alluring promise that in the battle between business and consumer, you can, with the right information, emerge the victor.Today, at 46, Lewis is a TV personality as much as anything. He appears weekly on Good Morning Britain and This Morning, while his primetime ITV programme, The Martin Lewis Money Show, regularly attracts around 4 million viewers.Lewis’s success depends on the trust he has built with the public, and he tends to this like an anxious parent. Everything featured on Money Saving Expert has been chosen by its editorial team, but once those recommendations have been decided on, the commercial team then tries to arrange deals with the companies offering the products. The site makes a commission when readers click on affiliated links for such products, which are marked with an asterisk. Still, when I joined Lewis for his meeting about the email, he was cautious. He worried that one description was too “selly”. “We don’t want people to think we’re advertising,” he said. A fidgety presence, he took great care with the recommendations, mindful of the impact they can have: Tesco Bank’s website once crashed when one of its savings accounts appeared in the email.With his fiery rhetoric, his efforts to defend the little guy against vested interests, Lewis may look like a populist. But, at heart, he has a technocratic temperament: he identifies specific problems, and tries to solve them with tweaks. On the rare occasions when he does speak out, it’s because he has decided the system has stopped working properly.Lewis is, in short, a centrist – perhaps the only truly popular centrist in Britain. Instead of seeking structural change, his formula combines educating the public with campaigning for small adjustments to the system. But at a time of growing inequality, with politicians unwilling or unable to hold corporations to account, is this enough? What is needed, the economist John Kay told me, “is not more information from the financial services industry, but actually an industry that is trustworthy and reliable”. The question remains whether Lewis’s approach is the best we can hope for, or a distraction from real change.There’s nothing new about wanting to save money. But now, a decade after the financial crisis, it feels particularly urgent. It’s clear that things will never go back to normal: the days of a secure job for life, with a steadily rising salary and a generous pension pot, are over. You won’t be able to support yourself through old age on your pension alone you might never make enough to afford your own home.You need to be prudent, but how? Since the deregulation and privatisations of the 1980s, we have had to make more and more financial decisions, and they have become dizzyingly complex. There are so many options: Britain has more than 300 banks, dozens of energy companies. Then there are all the credit cards, broadband providers, mobile networks. You know that if make the wrong choice you will get ripped off. It’s easy to panic or to bury your head in the sand.What has made Lewis so popular is that he offers a concrete response to this uncertainty. His work holds out the hope that you can take control of your finances and your life. This isn’t a question of stopping spending. “I don’t think being tight is a particularly sensible thing with money,” he told me. He wants to help people get more from the money they have, and reduce the stress that money can cause. The trick is to “play the system, understand how it works, get the best products” – to turn modern finance’s ersity to your own advantage, rather than being overwhelmed and exploited by it.In this respect, Lewis is less like a doctor, doling out pills for the patient to swallow, than a personal trainer: he promises to make you stronger through your own hard work. And no matter how little you understand at first, you can still judge his advice for yourself by its effect on your bank balance. This is what has saved Lewis from the fate of so many experts, who incur resentment by appearing to lord their expertise over everyone else. Instead of just telling you what to do, Lewis makes you feel as if you, too, can become a money-saving expert.When Lewis was in charge of Money Saving Expert, he worked up to 90 hours a week. Since selling the company, he has continued to play an important role, as executive chairman, and pictures of him wearing a confident expression appear all over the website like a talisman against profligacy. But even though he has cut down, to 50 or 60 hours, his schedule still appears exhausting in its variety and intensity. Rather than prioritising a particular audience, he addresses whoever he can, modulating his message each time like a shrewd ambassador for financial prudence. What matters to him is getting the word out. On a Monday morning last summer, I accompanied Lewis to ITV’s studios in west London for his appearance on This Morning. As he waited to go on set, he asked a member of the crew if she watched Love Island. She didn’t. “I’m thinking of doing Love Island this year,” he said. When his turn on This Morning came, he took questions about student finance from callers, staring intensely at the camera as he listened. As usual, he spoke in rapidfire bursts, slowing down theatrically for emphasis.After that, he got a motorbike taxi to Broadcasting House, the BBC headquarters, for his weekly Radio 5 Live phone-in. The segment was introduced with the song Bills, by the American singer LunchMoney Lewis, and as it played Lewis air drummed, bobbing his head. It was a longer slot than This Morning, with a more leisurely pace the callers seemed canny, and Lewis responded with a level of detail he tends to avoid on TV. That afternoon, he attended a meeting at the Money and Mental Health Policy Institute, a charity that he founded in 2016, to carry out research and campaigns on the connection between mental illness and financial problems.The next day, Lewis met with Matt Hancock, who was then the culture secretary. It was a few weeks after Lewis had announced that he was suing Facebook for defamation, over fake adverts that featured his name and image, and the pair discussed online ads and scams. That evening, Lewis started tweeting about Love Island. “I’ve never watched before – I’m trying it this time – and yes I am intrigued,” he told his 566,000 followers. On Good Morning Britain that week, he referred to a Love Island contestant’s “semi-permanent Russian lashes”. When a presenter asked what made the lashes Russian, Lewis responded, “maybe they need to get them on quickly”. (He was once a finalist in a competition for young Jewish stand-up comedians.) He made a “ba-dum-tish” sound, with a drumming gesture, and walked off the set. Two days later, he wrote a comment piece for the Financial Times, proposing reforms to student finance.Lewis, who has a knack for remembering numbers, is happy to play the role of a financial savant in his TV appearances. “Is there something you don’t know? Anything you don’t know?” Angellica Bell, his co-host on The Martin Lewis Money Show, asked in a recent live special. But his displays of knowledge are mostly for show: their purpose is not so much to convey information as to demonstrate his mastery of the material, his fitness to instruct. His actual advice, on the other hand, is often surprisingly simple.Consider the “Money Mantras”, the cornerstone of the Money Saving Expert philosophy. Before buying anything, you ask yourself two questions. If you’re broke: “Do I need it? Can I afford it?” If you can afford the item: “Will I use it? Is it worth it?” If the answer to any of the questions is “No”, then it’s clear: don’t buy it.If that seems obvious, then Lewis’s prescription for budgeting is a little more technical. You do an audit of your outgoings, to establish how much you can actually afford to spend. Then you single out a few main categories: these might be bills, holidays, Christmas, savings and big purchases. You open a dedicated bank account for each of them, and use standing orders from your main account to ensure you’re setting aside what you need for every category. It’s fairly straightforward, but takes a lot of effort to set up – a day’s work, in Lewis’s estimation. He calls this technique “piggybanking”, with each account a different piggybank.Money Saving Expert has proved to be very effective at making money, yet Lewis considers it a public service above all. “This is a mission,” he says. “It’s a consumer website, but it’s not there to be all wonderful and give people what they want. All they would want is £10-off shopping vouchers, because they’re fun and most people don’t want to deal with their finances. And we have a job to twist their nipples in any way we can.”Lewis was born in Manchester in 1973 and spent most of his childhood in Delamere Forest in Cheshire, where his father ran a Jewish boarding school for pupils with special needs. Three days before Lewis’s 12th birthday, his mother was killed in a road accident. Losing a parent at a young age “gives you a drive,” he said in a talk in 2014. “Nothing is going to be quite as bad as it’s already been, so you can go for it.”After studying at the London School of Economics, Lewis spent two years working in financial PR, then moved into journalism. He got his first job on air when a cable channel devoted to finance, Simply Money, launched in 2000. Angela Rippon, the TV presenter who fronted the channel, told me that it was Lewis’s sketches that made him distinctive. Alongside his regular reporting, he dressed up as different characters – Dracula, a card dealer – in order to illustrate his points. One of Lewis’s strengths as a broadcaster is that he is not afraid to be naff – in fact, he revels in the naff. “It engaged the viewers in a way that financial reporting had never done before,” Rippon said. He has never been bothered by accusations that he is dumbing down. “I know I’m good at what I do,” he said. “For me, the passion is about reaching real people and getting them to be better on their finances.”In his first year at Simply Money, Lewis asked to be known on-screen as “the Money Saving Expert”. After the channel shut down, he kept the name, paid £100 to a web designer in Uzbekistan – his sole capital outlay in the decade that he owned Money Saving Expert – and launched the site in 2003.Back then, Lewis told me, media coverage of personal finance was limited to “investment, protection, and maybe mortgages if you want to be radical”. What he had in mind was something different: a one-stop shop that covered money as it works in everyday life. That meant advice on supermarkets (“eye-level products are where the profit is”) and where to get the cheapest DVD rentals and perfume. “He has taken it into getting a good deal in every single aspect of your life,” says Anne Ashworth, who edits the Times’s Money section. By moving beyond the constraints of traditional personal finance journalism, he became, more and more, a life coach.What was particularly striking about Lewis’s approach was how confrontational it was. Money Saving Expert’s home page used to have a promise for readers: “Companies try to screw us for profits. Money-saving shows you how to screw them back.” Journalists had long singled out firms that shortchanged their customers, but this was undiscriminating – it suggested that consumers couldn’t trust anyone. In The Money Diet, his 2004 guide to saving money, which doubles as a kind of early manifesto, Lewis argued that it was the job of businesses to make money – “nowt wrong with that”. But for that very reason, he wrote, “all companies are the enemy”.The tools offered by the site don’t always match up to this rhetoric. The Money Mantras alone won’t help you screw companies back. It takes real effort you have to exploit the loopholes identified by Money Saving Expert, and mop up one introductory offer after another. In the argot of the website, people who keep doing this by switching banks are approvingly referred to as “tarts”.Money Saving Expert quickly took off: by 2006, it was getting 1m visitors a month. As it expanded, Lewis’s profile grew. He got an ITV series another series, It Pays to Watch!, aired on Five in 2008, the year the global financial crisis inaugurated an era of perpetual insecurity. In 2012, when ITV launched The Martin Lewis Money Show, he finally got what he had spent years working towards: a programme at primetime. It airs on Mondays at 8pm, between episodes of Coronation Street. The show is centred on questions that Lewis takes from members of the public, at roadshows around the country. It’s slicker than his earlier programmes, but features the kind of sketches that he first tried out on Simply Money, giving it something of a variety-show feel.In June, Lewis recorded a live special of the show at Warwick Castle. A Martin Lewis Money Show flag, featuring coins, notes, credit cards and a piggy bank, flew from the tower. Lewis wandered around beforehand, looking a little nervous. He was more smartly dressed than usual, and boasted to the audience that he had bought his blazer in a sale. “We’re going to save millions of people lots of money,” he told them, “which is why I get out of bed in the morning.” During the show, Lewis reminded everyone going away that summer to pack their European Health Insurance Card by the end of the episode, the EHIC website had crashed.Lewis is fond of saying that he has never been interested in money he’s more interested in what having money allows you to do, and the problems that stem from not having it. He considers himself “a politician with a small p”, whose goal is to achieve “financial justice”. He has tried his best to do this while keeping out of the political fray. But over the past few years, that balancing act has become impossible. Reluctantly, Lewis has found himself dragged into politics.Lewis’s first campaign, in 2005, was against bank charges: the fees levied on customers who go beyond their overdraft limit. At the time, even if someone was just a penny over the limit, they usually had to pay their bank about £35. Since Lewis started campaigning against the charges, 7m template letters – which people fill in and send to their bank, in order to request that the charges be repaid – have been downloaded from Money Saving Expert and £1bn reclaimed. The campaign inspired a song, I Fought the Lloyds by Oystar, a comedy-rock band whose singer had used Money Saving Expert to challenge the charges. It charted at #No 25 and Lewis made a cameo in the video.Not long after that campaign, Lewis deployed similar tactics against banks that had missold payment protection insurance (PPI) to customers. This time, Money Saving Expert’s template letters resulted in as much as £5bn in compensation. More recently, Lewis has taken a different approach, by challenging the government itself. In 2011, soon after it was announced that university tuition fees would rise from £3,290 a year to a maximum of £9,000, Lewis was appointed head of the Independent Taskforce on Student Finance Information, which sought to explain what the new fees would involve. At the time, Lewis said he was “no fan of the changes”, but his priority was ensuring that everyone was properly informed about them. “There were people he could communicate with who wouldn’t have trusted politicians,” says David Willetts, the universities minister at the time.Lewis turned on the government when it froze the repayment threshold – the amount graduates need to earn before they start paying off their loans. Having been set at £21,000, this was meant to eventually increase every year, but in 2015 George Osborne backtracked. Lewis was appalled. In articles and TV appearances, he kept making his case he met with Jo Johnson, who was then the universities minister. In 2017, Theresa May finally relented: she announced the threshold would go up after all, to £25,000, and increase thereafter.Lewis’s journalism offers lessons in self-reliance, ways for iniduals to protect themselves. But he acknowledges that this isn’t always enough. “There are people out there who have less income than the basic minimum they need to subsist,” he says. As part of his efforts towards “financial justice”, he has pledged around £20m to charity.Perhaps Lewis’s most high-profile public intervention came last year, when he learned that his image was being used on targeted Facebook adverts without his consent. Many of them claimed he was endorsing bitcoin schemes that were actually fronts for ultra-high-risk investments one woman lost £100,000 as a result. Lewis approached Facebook about the ads but it failed to take any serious action, so he decided to sue.When he announced the lawsuit in April, it struck a nerve. The story made the front pages. Lewis was all over television, but he looked rattled. Unlike his previous campaigns, this one was personal and he didn’t enjoy the attention. “I do not handle stress particularly well. I am a very shy person,” he told me. Lewis is very protective of his privacy. He is married to Lara Lewington, a BBC presenter, with whom he has a six-year-old daughter. When I joined him on his walk to work, we didn’t meet at his home instead, I waited at a hotel nearby. When he eventually called me to arrange a meeting point, his number showed up as “No caller ID”.It’s tempting to see the Facebook lawsuit as a dramatic battle: Lewis, the people’s champion, taking on an unaccountable Silicon Valley behemoth. Even politicians unwilling to challenge the firm wanted him to play that role. “I have had, let’s say, very senior members of government who have pressured me and said: ‘Please don’t settle. Take it to court, set a precedent’,” Lewis said. Yet his aim was, as ever, more modest. “This is not an anti-Facebook campaign,” he told me, when we discussed the lawsuit last year. “This is an anti-scam ads campaign.” Last week, he announced that he was dropping the case because Facebook had agreed to introduce new measures tackling scam ads.There was a time when Lewis wanted to go into politics. At the LSE, he was elected head of the student union. He ran as an independent the union had previously been dominated by the far left, and Lewis promised to deliver “a student union for all”. Outside the LSE, Lewis was affiliated with the Lib Dems, and led the party in the National Union of Students. “I had no doubt he would go on to be a Lib Dem MP,” said Raj Jethwa, who ran against Lewis in the student union elections.It’s easy to imagine Lewis as an MP: he has the verbal tics of a modern politician, often starting his sentences with a “look” or “listen”. Even after setting up Money Saving Expert, Lewis still imagined he would eventually run for parliament. But when he hit his mid-30s, he decided he wasn’t suited to a career in politics. “I know I couldn’t cope with it,” he told me. “I’m nowhere near as a robust as I was when I was younger.”A few years ago, Lewis applied to be a cross-bench member of the House of Lords – a process open to anyone – and was rejected. He is keen to stress that he doesn’t identify as party political, though he has been approached by numerous parties, including United for Change, the new centrist party. He sees himself “somewhere from a wet Tory, a right Labour or a Lib Dem”. That outlook doesn’t always square with his more incendiary rhetoric. Throughout his career, Lewis has railed against the excesses of business, and seen first-hand how they can affect people he has attacked banks and energy companies. But while he seeks to empower inidual consumers, he stops short of calling for radical solutions that might level the playing field altogether: drastic regulation, or even nationalisation. His work seems to add up to a damning critique of the status quo, without seeking to fundamentally change it.Money Saving Expert operates according to the optimistic principle that if someone knows enough, they should be able to make the right decisions. When I went to events where Lewis was filming and spoke to the people in attendance, I was struck by how clued up they were. They had saved thousands through cashback services, or switching between credit cards – tricks they had learned from Lewis. But in their commitment to saving money, they were willing to put in the kind of time that most people just don’t have.Yet there is more to Lewis’s ambitions than simply educating people about money. He wants to change the way they think and talk about it. “If we take the American look at money, which is where money is just something open that you communicate about, I actually think that is healthier than our more British poe-facedness,” he told me.That reticence can have dire consequences. “I think some of the gender pay gap is because we don’t talk about salaries in this country,” Lewis says. Not discussing money also affects how much we spend on things. “If I don’t know how much you paid for your plumber, how do I know what I’m supposed to pay for my plumber?” Through his work, Lewis meets people with crippling debts, and sees the psychological toll that money can take. He can be emotional on screen, and open about his own vulnerabilities. When people are unable to talk about their finances, he says, it means they are unable to talk about the problems that stem from them. “That’s not good for our society.”That may be slowly changing. McFall notes that many younger people are open about the financial difficulties they face: their high student loan debt, the obstacles to buying a first property. “All of those things mean that financial details about how people live are in the public sphere in a way that they weren’t, historically,” she says. But Lewis thinks there is a long way to go. “We have got rid of the taboo of talking about sex and religion. And thankfully, we’re starting to get rid of the taboo of talking about your mental health. But money’s still there.”Lewis is constantly reminded that his work is incomplete. When I joined him on his walk to work, he told me about something he had recently overheard in a restaurant. A group of young professionals had been sitting near him, discussing which cards they use when they go overseas. “They were all getting it so wrong,” he said, as we walked down Oxford Street. “I found them painful.” He sounded personally affronted. I wondered why he cared so much about what other people did with their money. What was it about the conversation that he had found so painful? “Because it’s fact!” he said, his voice rising in exasperation. “It’s not opinion. It’s just a simple fact.” Like many experts, he seemed to feel that if people just listened to him, it would make everyone’s lives so much easier.This is the territory in which Lewis is still most comfortable: the realm of the indisputable, where one figure is higher than another, where there is no politics or emotion to complicate and corrupt. With money, countless things will always remain uncertain: which stocks will go up, say, or when to buy euros for your holiday. That’s not what Lewis is about. “People want to know what to invest in I don’t know,” he said. “But I do know what the best card to spend abroad is. Manifestly, directly, on a spreadsheet, no question. I know the answer.”• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f391f450483f7dc35ad4da1496aa7e0d94d5393/0_0_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1bfcc01a5b6906ad9026dddf9e6d6378","title":"two thirds of british children make music study finds","story":"Youth Music poll shows a massive rise in music-making among young people – especially among those from lower-income backgroundsNew research has found that more than two-thirds of young people are active musicians.The report’s authors argue it is vital “to make music an indispensable part of school life”. But they also acknowledge the potential in mobile video apps like TikTok, saying: “While there may not be a lot of music involved, the app encourages young people to be creative, autonomous and hone their performance skills, often in highly humorous ways.”Writing in the introduction to the report, Youth Music CEO, Matt Griffiths, outlines some of the problems around access to music for young people: “While we might have online access to more music than ever before, we still can’t afford to go to that festival, be a regular gig-goer, rehearse with a band or afford to buy that instrument we’ve always wanted. And if we’re at school, it’s getting increasingly more difficult to access music in the curriculum where its importance is in many cases being downgraded.”The report’s authors recommend that “public music education funds should be targeted towards those who face greatest barriers to access”, and “those involved in supporting young people’s wellbeing should give greater consideration to the role that music can play, and how young people’s passion for listening to music and their everyday creative lives can be interwoven with wider strategies to support good mental health.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c1bf1384fd33cb83fa8f5ddcdaa984b0598962b/0_0_4297_2867/master/4297.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3924c661c95c9fa603190ec0fdf4a65 480w","title":"one three uk firms activate plans move operations abroad no deal brexit iod survey","story":"Survey finds surge of smaller companies activating plans to move operations abroadNearly one in three British businesses are planning to relocate some of their operations abroad or have already shifted them to cope with a hard Brexit, according to a leading lobby group.More than one in 10 had already set up operations outside the UK as the prospect of a no-deal Brexit becomes more likely amid Westminster gridlock. Most firms considering a move were looking to open offices inside the European Union, said the IoD, which represents 30,000 firms.Edwin Morgan, the IoD’s interim director general, said: “We can no more ignore the real consequences of delay and confusion than business leaders can ignore the hard choices that they face in protecting their companies.“Change is a necessary and often positive part of doing business, but the unavoidable disruption and increased trade barriers that no deal would bring are entirely unproductive.”Large companies such as Sony and Panasonic have relocated their European headquarters from the UK to the continent, but the IoD said smaller companies were also enacting plans. Morgan said a surge of smaller firms had activated their plans in the last week.“While the actions of big companies have been making headlines, these figures suggest that smaller enterprises are increasingly considering taking the serious step of moving some operations abroad. For these firms, typically with tighter resources, to be thinking about such a costly course of action makes clear the precarious position they are in.”Business leaders are becoming increasingly concerned over a build-up of uncertainty while the government attempts to negotiate changes to the Irish backstop, which would keep the UK inside the European customs union in advance of a trade deal being reached.At the weekend the British Chamber of Commerce (BCC) said thousands of firms were gearing up to move operations abroad or stockpiling goods to combat the worst effects of Brexit. On Wednesday Carolyn Fairbairn, head of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), Britain’s most powerful business lobby group, warned that businesses were “accelerating” their plans for a no-deal Brexit“I don’t think there will be a single business this morning who is stopping or halting their no-deal planning,” she said, adding: “I fear they may even be accelerating it.”Paul Jones, director of Arquebus Solutions, a Coventry-based security consultancy that tracks the illegal trafficking of firearms, said he moved part of the company to Malta to stay inside the EU.“We work with agencies such as the United Nations and the European commission to support countries that are less advanced in dealing with the threat posed by the criminal use and supply of firearms.”He said: “We are proud to promote ourselves as a UK company and the union flag is an integral part of our logo. However, we have had to make contingency plans to enable us to continue to be eligible for funding from the EU and to trade with EU member states.”Ever since the vote to leave the EU in 2016, business groups including the BCC and the CBI have lobbied ministers, arguing that Britain’s exporters needed access to the customs union, which allows goods to be imported tariff-free. But the prime minister has insisted that the UK must leave both the customs union and single market if the referendum result of 2016 is to be fully respected.Other small-to-medium-sized businesses are now close to executing plans for a partial move. Tim Hardman, managing director of the London-based Niche Science \u0026amp Technology, said he had recently returned from a trip to Vienna to view office space for an offshoot inside the EU, which currently sets the regulations for the UK’s pharmaceutical industry.“Britain has been at the forefront of developing the EU’s regulations. Now we are going to be a backwater with no influence at all,” he said.His business, which employs 18 workers, many of them scientists with PhDs, runs clinical trials and research into medical drugs from its UK base. It has also grown over the last 20 years using EU grant funding, which the firm is reconciled to losing, he said.“Vienna is a nice place, but we didn’t need to do it and setting up an office and employing people is all extra costs to us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/517bc56e21e50ac7350372ace2a59032d496348b/0_515_2614_1568/master/2614.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6cfaad696d7fae96a75e73e16bb3a580","title":"no winter sun for tired mps just cats and dogs in the commons","story":"Andrea Leadsom says half-term recess will be cancelled but she can’t promise any Brexit businessThree years ago almost no one had heard of Andrea Leadsom. Not even her South Northamptonshire constituents. She was the archetypal anonymous MP who’d made a career out of saying little and doing less. But then she came to public attention when she unexpectedly made it to the last two of the Tory leadership election after David Cameron resigned.Leadsom had started her campaign in exemplary fashion by keeping her mouth firmly shut and letting Stephen Crabb, Liam Fox and Michael Gove disqualify themselves by opening theirs. Things started to go wrong only when she began to raise her profile.First she announced she was going to be making a speech on the economy. This proved to be comedy gold, as she managed to talk for all of 20 minutes and didn’t get round to mentioning the economy once. Then she handed out pale blue #RALLY4LEADSOM T-shirts, which she’d just collected from Prontaprint, to the few dozen supporters who had come to hear her die on her feet, and led an Idiots’ Platoon march on Westminster.Joining her on the 400-metre stroll were the Brexiter deadbeats Tim Loughton and Theresa Villiers, who tried to keep spirits up with chants of “Who do we want? Andrea Leadsom! When do we want her? Sometime in September.” Once the unhappy few reached parliament, no one could quite remember what they were meant to be doing there and everyone shuffled away in a state of embarrassment. Days later, Leadsom gave an interview in which she claimed her main qualification to be prime minister was having had children, and her leadership campaign was over.You’d have thought that would have been that for Leadsom’s career. But in the ongoing straight-to-DVD horror movie of the post-Brexit Conservative party, being completely hopeless was more than enough to earn her a place in the cabinet. First as environment secretary, until it became clear that the outdoors was not her natural habitat, and then as leader of the Commons, a post usually earmarked for those being eased gently out of public life.Yet Leadsom has once again defied the odds by rising without trace. The allocation of parliamentary time for Brexit-related business has given the leader’s office unexpected prominence, and Leadsom now roams the Commons chamber with a sense of ownership. This is her time and she is enjoying every minute of it. She has become a role model for people with little ability everywhere. God stand up for mediocrities!In some ways Theresa May is making it easy for her. Since the prime minister really doesn’t know what she’s doing from one day to the next, it is a routine job for Leadsom to keep parliament in the dark about what the government is up to. Just before she got to her feet for her weekly Commons outing, she checked her diary. Completely blank. Perfect. Just as it should be.Everyone was very tired after being called upon to vote seven times on Tuesday, so she was going to make sure MPs had an easy schedule for the following week. On Monday there would be a general debate on sport: whether it was a good idea or not. Tuesday and Wednesday would be largely clear and on Thursday there would be another general debate, this time on antisocial behaviour: was it a good thing or a bad thing? Friday was free time.Having effectively given everyone a week off, Leadsom then proceeded to inform the house that it had been so late in handing in its Brexit homework that the February half-term was likely to be cancelled. All skiing holidays and winter breaks to the Canaries were off. Worried MPs could consult the bursar in regard to refunds, but she wasn’t making any firm promises either way as the house had brought this all on itself.Her Labour shadow, Valerie Vaz, was understandably a bit put out. Why hadn’t she said last week when she’d been asked about it? And why couldn’t they do more Brexit business next week, as there were still 600 statutory instruments to be tabled and debated? How confident on a scale of one to 10 was she that the government would get everything done before 29 March?Leadsom peered over the top of her glasses. It was precisely that kind of snippy attitude that had led her to dispense with half-term. And no, she couldn’t say when the house was going to next have a chance to talk about Brexit. Nor could she promise they would do so during the February detention. Instead, there would be more generic debates. Which make the best pets: dogs or cats? Discuss.Parliament had to learn, and learn fast. The point of the next two months wasn’t for everyone to sit around and do nothing. It was for them to sit around and be seen to be doing nothing. End of lesson. Back to work. Not that anyone had any.

In footage from the scientists’ lab, objects emerge from the light-sensitive fluid fully formed in under two minutes.Christopher Spadaccini, at the US government’s Lawrence Livermore National Lab, said he was surprised at how well the first objects turned out. “We all knew right away we had something pretty exciting.”Traditional 3D printers build structures layer by layer, but this can leave tiny steps running up the sides of the printed objects. Another drawback is that certain shapes, such as arches, need supports to fill the gaps as the structure is built up. The new process, called computed axial lithography, produces objects with smooth surfaces and removes the need for supports.To print an object, the scientists start with a 3D representation either from a scan or a drawing on a computer. This is converted into a sequence of video images that show what the object looks like from different angles. A projector then beams the images one after another on to the rotating container filled with thick, light-sensitive polymer. The images change thousands of times during a single revolution.“As the container rotates, the pattern that’s projected changes, so over time the amount of light that each point receives can be controlled,” said Hayden Taylor at the University of California, Berkeley. Spots that receive a lot of light solidify, while those that do not remain liquid.“The key thing is that the video being projected is perfectly synchronised with the rotation of the container,” said Indrasen Bhattacharya, also at Berkeley. “At every particular angle you choose a particular image to project.”In the lab it took less than a minute for the printer to create a 2cm-high figure of Rodin’s sculpture The Thinker. The largest item they have made is about 10cm with features as small as 0.3mm. The gloop left over from each print run is drained off and reused, said Hossein Heidari, a co-author on the study published in Science. The researchers are now exploring what products they can make and how big. Beyond scale models for designers, dental implants and medical prostheses are on the cards. But the process can also print on top of existing objects, so could add customised ergonomic handles to tools and sports equipment, and in the future, perhaps even print clear, soft hydrogels around tiny electronic circuits to make smart contact lenses.Ian Campbell, who works on computer-aided product design in the Additive Manufacturing Research Group at Loughborough University, said the idea of “volumetric 3D printing” has been around for some time, but this was the first system he had seen that used multi-angle projections to make complex objects.“The key advantages are reduced time and no supports being required. However, the second of these advantages depends on the high viscosity of the resin material used,” he said. If the light-sensitive liquid is not thick enough, parts of the object that solidify first might simply sink to the bottom of the container.The main limitation of the process is that photoreactive polymers can be expensive and are not generally used to manufacture actual products. “Nevertheless, these materials have proved very effective for prototype production and this new system could also fit into this segment of the 3D-printing market,” he said.“The system would need to be scaled up to be of commercial benefit to most companies but could be of immediate use to companies requiring small models, such as in the dental and jewellery industries,” Campbell added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f8fb18a0c748eb1a07710ef4272723b424cd167/0_383_5759_3457/master/5759.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91c7c36d06483573983e41718aab4f05","title":"how greater manchester is taking on rough sleeping pilot social bond wigan","story":"Pilot funded via social bond has had particular success in Wigan, where numbers have almost halvedNumbers of those sleeping rough have stabilised or declined in eight out of 10 Greater Manchester boroughs. There has been particular success in Wigan, where the number has almost halved from 30 to 17, year on year.One of those was Pete Smith, 34, who moved into his own home last summer after six months living in a tent with his dog. A keen angler, he often pitched up by fishing ponds at nightfall, stashing his tent in a bush most days. Amphetamines, crack cocaine and cannabis passed the time, along with alcohol. If there was food, his dog ate first: Smith, a pseudonym, was down to eight stone (51kg) by the time he accepted accommodation last year from the Brick, a homeless charity in Wigan.He is one of 246 entrenched rough sleepers helped into homes over the last 12 months under a payment-by-results pilot in Greater Manchester. It is funded via a “social impact bond” (SIB), whereby social investors provide upfront investment and receive a return dependent on the results achieved.So far just two participants in the SIB are back on the street, according to Sarah Cooke, who runs the project. Many others have had wobbles, Smith included, but the SIB is designed to give people “not just a second chance”, but “third, fourth, fifth chances” when they struggle in their new homes. They do not have to overcome substance use before they are given a roof over their head. First they get the keys, then they are given intensive support to sustain a tenancy and tackle their problems, plus help to access education and training.Smith, who grew up in care, had been homeless on and off since 2007, when his relationship broke down. By the time he engaged with the SIB last summer he had been in prison three times. Jail was sometimes a welcome respite from life on the streets, he said. “Three square meals a day, free gym access … it was more of a detox for me than anything else.”Accepting help from the Brick was daunting. “I struggled at first because I was that used to being on my own. It was just me and the dog. It was frightening, having responsibilities.” But he wanted to sort himself out, primarily because of his 14-year-old daughter. “She’s of an age now where anything I do directly affects her … It weren’t great for her, with her friends. That’s why I had to make some drastic changes in my life. It can’t be nice going to school and people asking: is that your dad there, sleeping in that field?”First he moved into supported accommodation with five other men in the same boat. It took some adjustment. “When I first moved in, I slept on the floor for about the first week. Stupid as it sounds, the bed was too soft,” Smith said. Part of his SIB deal was to go to the Brick’s Wigan hub five days a week, where he learned skills including joinery and did courses in first aid and health and safety.In November he was deemed ready to have his own place: a social home in Leigh. He was given basic furniture and a “personalisation budget” to make it his own, plus vouchers for the supermarket.There are ups and downs: recently Smith stopped engaging with his care workers, who have been working hard to get him back on track. But he said he was determined to stay off the streets, motivated by a speech his daughter gave at a recent family funeral. “She stood up and said: ‘I hope you’re all as proud of my dad as I am.’ It was the best thing I’ve ever heard in my life. If that won’t motivate you, nothing will.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abf1876af4590026b32fc0f38a1eaeaec54288d1/0_183_3830_2298/master/3830.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0693288d076336faa6a068d3d1a8fb24","title":"england ireland six nations manu tuilagi elliot daly rugby union","story":"England have flown into a wintry Dublin firmly believing they can kick off the Six Nations by overpowering Ireland on the opening weekend. With Manu Tuilagi set to start in the championship for the first time in six years, their head coach, Eddie Jones, insists the visitors can upset the defending champions and register a first victory at the Aviva Stadium since 2013.No one in the England setup expects anything but a brutally tough contest on Saturday but Jones, having retained Elliot Daly at full-back and opted for the Saracens lineout specialist George Kruis in the second row, insists his team should not be cast as underdogs in Dublin. “I’d hate to go into a game thinking we weren’t better than the opposition, that we need surprises or tricks to win the game,” said Jones. “We don’t need that. Praise can make you weak but the good teams always expect to win and play well and that’s what we are.”England, nevertheless, are braced for a serious examination at the breakdown and in the air, with Exeter’s Jack Nowell picked on the wing in anticipation of a fiercely physical contest. “He’s a street-fighter, mate,” said Jones. “When you go to Dublin it’s not going to be a nice game. It’s going to be a tough old match. It is well documented no one thinks we can win but I can tell you everyone inside our camp believes we can.”Give or take the unfit Ben Te’o, who would have played had he not suffered a side strain in training, this is definitely not an England side lacking in physical clout. The pack collectively weighs almost 150 stone and never before have England been able to field two Vunipolas, Maro Itoje and Tuilagi in the same XV.With Owen Farrell starting at fly-half and the rumbustious ball-carrying trio of Ellis Genge, Luke Cowan-Dickie and Nathan Hughes on the bench it is a side well equipped for a slugfest but Jones is equally aware of the need for precision in certain key areas, not least beneath the inevitable high balls set to be hoisted into the Dublin sky by Conor Murray and Johnny Sexton.It must have been a tight call but, ultimately, Jones has kept faith in Daly despite a couple of hairy moments in the autumn Tests and omitted Mike Brown from his matchday 23. “We feel that Elliot will do the job for us and he gives us a great attacking game,” said the head coach. “Having dropped a couple of balls is not an indication to me he hasn’t done well. Elliot is a great catcher of the ball and we’ve got every bit of confidence in him.”Nowell’s deceptive strength in and around the tackle area will also come in useful against an Irish side that Jones accepts will be a serious handful around the breakdown. “The number of poaches Ireland have attempted at the tackle almost doubled in the autumn. They’re a much more aggressive side at the tackle contest and that’s going to be a key area.”Kruis will be invited to help neutralise the lineout threat posed by Devin Toner, James Ryan and Peter O’Mahony. If it is tough on Joe Launchbury, omitted from the squad altogether, there is a certain logic in relying on the tried and tested Saracens combination of Kruis, Itoje and thrower Jamie George.Will it all be sufficient to beat last year’s grand slam winners? Amid all the bullish rhetoric it is easy to forget Tuilagi’s last four Test starts for England have all ended in defeat and that he has never started alongside Henry Slade in a competitive fixture. Even those who have argued for the past three or four years that Slade and Tuilagi would make a perfect midfield combo would ideally have preferred their first date to be somewhere other than Dublin against settled, tactically savvy Irish opponents.Slade, even so, can hardly disguise his excitement. “I’ve played most of my best rugby when I’ve had a centre partnership where we complement each other. If you want a big carrier winning collisions in tight traffic then I’m not your man – but those are Manu’s strengths and hopefully my strengths cover his weaknesses as well. It’s a good match. If you run into him you get smoked. His legs are so big … when I play against him and try to tackle him I just grab one of them.”It all makes for an enticing prospect which could shape the entire tournament.With Newcastle’s Mark Wilson moving to blindside flanker, there are a total of six changes and one positional switch from the starting England side that beat Australia 37-18 in November, plus a potential first cap off the bench for the Wasps scrum-half Dan Robson.Jones fully anticipates Ireland being smart and resourceful – “It’s not the old kick-off, distract the referee and then put the boot in … that’s not the sort of rugby it is anymore” – but his heavy-duty England selection will not surrender meekly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f37025e8d64de01a0dbcaf96596f103dc12124cc/121_180_3242_1945/master/3242.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56d89f4b1d2349ac5f29aed3a077616f","title":"st helens derby win wigan super league match report","story":"If this is a sign of things to come for the next nine months, then perhaps this truly is a new beginning for Super League after all. In the end, it was St Helens who claimed the first bragging rights of 2019, ensuring that Wigan remain on minus two points for at least another week following the revelation on the eve of the season that the champions had been found guilty of breaching the salary cap in 2017.Even after just one game, though, it is clear that the introduction of a shot clock – aimed at reducing needless stoppages in a game which prides itself on its pace – is going to go a long way towards having the impact the Super League chief executive, Robert Elstone, craves for the competition. This was about as strong a start to the season as he could have hoped for. “I think it’s the right idea to speed the game up and we’re on the right track,” said the St Helens coach, Justin Holbrook. “Everyone knows what we’ve had to do and it’s great for our game. I’ve said before that the changes will be fantastic for everyone who watches it live this season.”Indeed at half-time it seemed that Super League’s other key new ruling for 2019, the golden point extra-time, was a distinct possibility given that the scores were tied at 12 apiece.Fittingly, it was one of the headline recruits who struck the first blow of the new season. The Fiji captain, Kevin Naiqama, is one of several big names to arrive in Super League and after three minutes he barged his way over the line. Ten minutes later Saints doubled their lead when a fine break from Dom Peyroux was finished by Jonny Lomax.Mark Percival converted both to make it 12-0, but the Warriors soon found their feet. As half-time approached, Ben Flower crashed over on the angle to halve the deficit before Liam Marshall instinctively picked off a Lachlan Coote pass to race the length of the field. Zak Hardaker – who had a quiet night on his competitive return to rugby league – levelled the scores.With defence impressively on top in light of the reduction in interchanges from 10 to eight, the home side went back ahead again when Regan Grace produced an outstanding flying finish in the corner to make it 16-12. There were half-chances for Wigan for the visitors in the closing stages but as the minutes eked away, and the effects of a bruising night began to become visibly apparent on the players, it was the St Helens captain, James Roby, who guaranteed victory, scampering over from dummy half.“As always, it was a massive effort from Robes,” Holbrook said when asked about the impact of his captain post-match. “You sort of get used to that happening all the time these days though, don’t you?” New beginnings for Super League but in terms of Roby’s impact some things, it seems, are destined to remain the same."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1bf54bcbeb62e6a0eff24cc08908863e797a2a3e/0_184_3150_1890/master/3150.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=255dd06284914c1ad9612812974a9bd3","title":"australia v sri lanka second test day one live","story":"The second new ball has been taken. 80th over: Australia 358-4 (Burns 160, Patterson 11) Deary me, a maiden over was on the cards until the latest absymal piece of Sri Lankan fielding gifted Patterson a single. 79th over: Australia 357-4 (Burns 160, Patterson 10) Dilruwan Perera’s back for a whirl but I’m distracted looking for this clip of the Royal It’s a Knockout from 1987. It’s the nearest I could think of to a restoration comedy starring cricketers. Sunil Gavaskar and Viv Richards took part in this low-point of constitutional monarchy. 78th over: Australia 354-4 (Burns 158, Patterson 9) Still a dozen overs or 40 minutes from the close, this day’s play is running out of puff. Like a sparkler that’s still burning long after you’ve spelled out your name and your repertoire of swears in the night sky. 77th over: Australia 351-4 (Burns 157, Patterson 7) Patterson joins in the boundary-hitting fun, standing tall at the crease and timing sweetly off the back foot in a shot reminiscent of Clive Lloyd. “Pshaw!” says Burns, climbing into the most sumptuous front foot cover drive, “call that elegance?”. Lynn, an idea for a new show, live restoration comedy starring Test cricketers... 76th over: Australia 341-4 (Burns 152, Patterson 2) Not much to report. First time this session really. Plus I got distracted by James Brayshaw on TV introducing the concept of Marcus Stoinis’ “rig” like it’s the first time he’d ever mentioned it. I had my ear’s pricked for subsequent mention of “roosters” but none were forthcoming. Only a few weeks until the footy season. 75th over: Australia 339-4 (Burns 151, Patterson 1) Patterson gets off the mark with a single into the offside, a passage of play that betrayed Sri Lanka’s mindset. After his nervous opening delivery there should have been suffocating pressure on the new batsman. Instead he nudges harmlessly into an acre of space. 74th over: Australia 337-4 (Burns 150, Patterson 0) Burns consolidates following the dismissal of Head but he still has the presence of mind to dab a single through the gully region to bring up his 150. Then PATTERSON IS THE LATEST TO BE DROPPED! First ball! The new batsman props forward and lobs a simple bat-pad catch straight to short leg but it’s a shocking attempt, barely anywhere near Thirimanne’s fingers as he snatched at the ball like a hungry hippo. What a torturous day this has been for Sri Lanka’s bowlers. Huge let-off for Patterson after watching Head and Burns make hay. 73rd over: Australia 336-4 (Burns 149, Patterson 0) “Is Jason Gillespie the last South Australian to score a Test century before today?” asks David Busuttil. Yes, he iswas David. I thought you were going to be in a position to ask a similar question but replacing century with double century, but alas Head has now departed. This incredible partnership is finally broken and Head walks off to a rapturous applause for a 204-ball 161. Fernando is the man celebrating, trapping his man plumb in front, angling the ball in from around the wicket enough and beating the attempted swipe across the line. 72nd over: Australia 330-3 (Burns 148, Head 156) Head clubs another four to extend the partnership in excess of 300. Then he checks a firm drive straight back to Dananjaya but, of course, the bowler shells it. A horrible, horrible day for Sri Lanka somehow manages to get even worse. That was very catchable, firmly struck, but straight at the bowler around hip height. 71st over: Australia 324-3 (Burns 147, Head 151) The scoreboard now has one six and 44 boundaries on it. The 44th is the streakiest of the lot after Burns cue-ended one through the slips. They all count, I guess. One for the sniggerers at the back of class from Mr Naylor. 70th over: Australia 317-3 (Burns 142, Head 150) 81 runs from the previous ten overs (before this one) in case you were wondering. An eventful over for Travis Head. First he escapes a flukey dismissal, then he eases beyond 150.Abhijato Sensarma is creatively bored. “With an extended net session going out in the middle I have penned this (admittedly long, and my apologies) question for you!So let me engage myself by asking you, Mr Howcroft - by the time the Aussies are done.Here are Head Burns, they are making the Sri Lankan Heads Burn.There is bounce, and there is the slightest hint of turn.But they negotiate all deliveries, run after run.There is no pink nut this time, all three sessions are under the Sun.They will look to cash in and each might score his double ton.But for a neutral like me, matches like these are no fun.They might think they are good again, but the Sri Lankan team is not (none will argue with that, none!).So will this build false assurance which comes crashing down when they go to England to retain their urn?”.Honest answer - who could possibly know how England or Australia are going to perform later this year after their wildly fluctuating performances of recent weeks? It certainly looks like a bowler’s series, beyond that, it feels a bit of a lottery right now. Not out! The soft signal is clearly wrong. Replays instantly show the ball was chopped down by Head onto the toe of his boot and down onto the pitch before it leapt up and into the hands of slip. The third-umpire takes a belt-and-braces approach to overturning the soft signal but he gets there in the end. Travis Head might be out... Sri Lanka reckon he is after chopping a drive onto his boot and into the hands of slip. The soft signal is out. 69th over: Australia 314-3 (Burns 141, Head 148) Head overtakes Burns in the race to 150. He profits from yet another short and wide medium pace delivery, mercilessly carving it to the boundary like a scimitar-wielding extra from Jason and the Argonauts. 68th over: Australia 306-3 (Burns 141, Head 141) This is now the biggest Australian partnership for any wicket against Sri Lanka, and also the highest first-class partnership at Manuka Oval. Runs, runs, runs, runs, runs...“Re appropriate names, in Sydney grade cricket Manly used to have an opening pair of Bush and Tuckerman (which relates to a 1980s tv show if you’re wondering what I am on about)”. Lovely stuff from David Markham. 67th over: Australia 301-3 (Burns 140, Head 137) Another bowling change, another first-ball boundary, Vishwa Fernando the latest to be treated with contempt by this partnership. Head battered that four through the offside then tried to launch Fernando’s next ball into orbit but didn’t get hold of everything. This is so dispiriting from a Sri Lankan perspective. They can’t find a dot for love nor money and this pair are batting like it’s a competitive dads v lads T20. Nick Jewlachow (61st over) is back with an enlightening clarification, thanks Nick. “My apologies Jonathan, it’s David Colley. He was an all-rounder and a teammate of Border’s at Mosman. So, when Border joined as a pup in the mid 70s, Colley was already a bit of an old dog having played his tests in 1972.” 66th over: Australia 293-3 (Burns 139, Head 131) Dananjaya de Silva has been brought on to stem the bleeding but his opening delivery is something of an anti-coagulant, short wide and calmly put out of its misery by Burns’ ruthless blade. The run-rate is edging up towards 4.5 rpo. This is brutal. 65th over: Australia 285-3 (Burns 132, Head 130) Glorious from Burns, crunching a cover drive off Chamika like a golfer loosening his shoulders with a warm-up swing. Effortless timing. The same length but more width from Chamika looks destined for a similar result but there isn’t the same whipcrack off the bat and Burns has to settle for a single. The runs keep coming though, Head disdainfully ramping a wide delivery up and over the infield and down to the third-man fence. The partnership skips gleefully beyond 250, becoming the highest fourth-wicket stand for Australia against Sri Lanak in the process. 64th over: Australia 273-3 (Burns 126, Head 124) Half a life for Head who doesn’t get everything on a wristy drive that flies just beyond the fingertips of a ing short midwicket. Chastened by the experience the left-hander sashays down the pitch a couple of balls later and absolutely marmalises one into the post that holds up the sightscreen. The first six of the innings is followed up by the 38th four, Perera offering enough width for Head to check his forward intent, rock back and cut powerfully behind square. This is getting ugly now for Sri Lanka. Very very ugly indeed. 63rd over: Australia 258-3 (Burns 125, Head 110) Another over, another gentle half-volley, another boundary. Burns smokes his 20th four through mid-off with classical efficiency. This is very good from OB Jato. “Regarding names which make sense, perhaps the most destructive and reliable ODI partnership of all time, between Rohit and Kohli of India, can be an answer to the question you asked in the 56th over. Virat means ‘momementous or huge’ (two of the word’s meaning in Hindi, anyways), while Sharma means ‘being shy’. Virat Sharma would roughly mean in Hindi - ‘being hugely shy’. Even then, I must say after looking at their assured chases and astonishing chases, they don’t give off that feeling while batting!”. Rohit is currently captaining India in a very entertaining ODI series in NZ, one that recently turned into a Trent Boult special. 62nd over: Australia 252-3 (Burns 120, Head 109) Buns is playing the enforcer now, looking to move down the pitch and disrupt Perera’s length. It works fourth ball when he skips down the track and whips a four through midwicket. 61st over: Australia 247-3 (Burns 115, Head 109) Chamika returns and he begins by floating up a half-volley into Head’s slot and the boundaries just keep on coming, the 33rd between this pair already today at a rate better than one every second over. Chamika almost makes amends when Head makes a mess of a short ball, guiding it off the face of the bat - right in front of his eyes - towards second slip. Fortunately there wasn’t enough pace on the shot to carry on the full and despite a e it arrives in the cordon on the half-volley.“Re Head Burns: in the 1970s for a while the NSW No 5 and 6 batsmen were Border and Collie. Lots of dogged partnerships. They retrieved some the Blues from some ruff situations”. That is splendid Nick Jewlachow. I presume the big dog was Allan Border, who was the pup Collie?60th over: Australia 243-3 (Burns 115, Head 105) Like London buses, you wait all summer for a century and then two come along at once. Considering the match situation neither will have a better opportunity turn their tons into doubles. Travis Head advances down the pitch and drives Perera on the full through extra-cover for four. The boundary brings up a maiden Test century for the South Australian in his eighth Test. Tremendous moment for the 25-year old.59th over: Australia 236-3 (Burns 115, Head 98) Rajitha’s over begins with an incorrect no-ball call, once again highlighting how preposterous it is that on-field umpires retain that responsibility when there are TV umpires better placed to do the job. Head nudges another single closer to his century. He will be on strike at the start of the next over. 58th over: Australia 233-3 (Burns 114, Head 97) A tickled three off Burns’ pads brings up the 200-partnership between this pair, by some margin the coupling of the summer for Australia, and they’re not finished yet. Head in particular is a man on a mission and he cuts his way four runs closer to his ton, feasting on a fraction of width from Perera. 57th over: Australia 226-3 (Burns 111, Head 93) The latest Rajitha over is an interesting one. Head is trying to force his way to a hundred through the offside but the field is well set. Rajitha lands the ball often enough in dangerous areas awaiting a false stroke but despite the left-handed batsman threatening to mistime one on the up he gives nothing away. The result is a maiden. 56th over: Australia 226-3 (Burns 111, Head 93) Dilruwan Perera resumes his spell and after Head nudges a single nearer his century Burns blocks out the remainder of the over. Question: are there many other partnerships that make sense as a combination of names in the manner of Head Burns or Burns Head? 55th over: Australia 225-3 (Burns 111, Head 92) Kasun Rajitha begins the post-Tea action and he’s quickly flayed behind point for four by Burns. It was catchable height through a gully-ish region with Burns throwing his hands at a wide delivery without adjusting his feet.35 more overs are remaining in the day’s play, so not for the first time this summer we will finish after the scheduled close of play. Phillip Lewis is already my favourite reader. If you want to compete for my favouritism, you know what to do. “Usman’s summer has been similar to that of Mitch Starc, emails Phil, the legend. “As a senior player more solidity and consistency was required. Both now legitimately have a question mark beside their name. Very good players but...? I began to have reservations about Harris when he kept getting hit in the head. Openers don’t have the luxury of struggling against the bouncing ball. If he continues hitting easy catches to point the selectors will soon conclude he’s not the man for the job”. Do you all agree? At what point does backing a senior player through a form dip become carrying a deadweight? The standard of OBO chat has been intimidatingly high so far today. Don’t make me look bad by keeping quiet or dropping the ball (like Sri Lanka’s butterfingered fielders). Tweet on Twitter should be directed to @JPHowcroft. Electronic messages can be delivered to the following address: jonathan.howcroft.freelance@the. Thank you very much Geoff. No pithy handover aside today I’m afraid, so here’s Jimi Hendrix, in honour of the long-awaited centurion.It’s one of those days where the batting side could say, “It did a bit early, then settled.”Or more accurately, “We played some horrible shots early, then settled.”Often in these kind of games, the partnership that gets itself settled can run away with the Test match. Burns and Head are doing just that, even if they’ve had their own slices of luck along the way. Sri Lanka was always likely to struggle with a bowling unit tacked together out of parts. Someone among them will have to find a way through this pair, and the catchers will need to support them.It was a lovely moment for Burns, raising the century after finally getting the second chance at Test cricket that he’s craved.That’s enough from me, thanks for your company. For the final session of the day I’ll leave you in the capable grip of Jonathan Planetary Howcroft.54th over: Australia 220-3 (Burns 107, Head 91) Last over before tea. Perera bowling, and Head cashes in on his life by sweeping three runs fine. Burns knocks a couple through cover, though another shoddy piece of running has him in some trouble coming for the second. The luck is with this partnership.Here’s an email note from Sam Casey: “On the ManukaNZ chat, State Circle, which girts Parliament House, has avenues running off it for the capital of each state of Australia. Canberra Avenue, on which you find the oval, was intended to be named Wellington Avenue because there was still some thought that New Zealand may become a state of Australia (section 124 of the Constitution still allows for this).”Top marks for your Constitutional Australiana chat including the word ‘girt’, Sam.53rd over: Australia 215-3 (Burns 105, Head 88) Oh, Travis. As sure as eggs are a bad item to put in your pockets. You just have to keep bowling outside off and eventually he’ll flash a catch somewhere. The cut shot should bring him undone this time, but it’s dropped at gully. A combination of toe end and top edge, lifting but travelling direct. Perera the culprit, and that should have been taken. So they’ve dropped Burns at slip earlier and now Head, who should have been left to rue another shocker. Burns makes the bowler feel even worse by clobbering his own cut shot for four.52nd over: Australia 210-3 (Burns 101, Head 87) Calm can resume. Perera bowling off-spin, a couple of singles taken, proper dull cricket. Perfect.51st over: Australia 208-3 (Burns 100, Head 86) Kasun Rajitha comes back. Two slips, gully, ring field, fine leg. He bowls yet another no-ball, Sri Lanka have been bleeding these today. Burns whips it for two. Misses out on a pie down leg side, but makes up for it by pulling a limp short ball from about waist height for four.He’s on 99! Can he get there? The header already told you that he can. After a couple of dots, he faces the last ball of the over. Taps and runs, towards cover. The crowd is cheering before he’s even halfway down. Makes it, and wheels away towards mid-on, pulling off the helmet as quickly as possible.Australia’s first century of the summer! First since Usman Khawaja’s epic in Dubai back in October. And Joe Burns’ fourth in 16 Tests, which rather tends to suggest he could have played a few more than he has.50th over: Australia 200-3 (Burns 93, Head 86) Hot tip: if you’re bowling to Travis Head you either need someone in the deep on the off side, or you need to not bowl short and wide. Ideally do both. Head smashes four from de Silva to raise Australia’s 200. The partnership is also Australia’s highest of the summer, now at 172 compared to the 166 at the Gabba between Head and Labuschagne. 49th over: Australia 196-3 (Burns 93, Head 82) Just a slip as Burns faces Perera, once Head turns over the strike. A ring field of six with two on the leg-side boundary. Just wanting to deny him runs and make him nervous? They’ll have to bowl more accurately than any of the bowlers have so far today. It works for this over.48th over: Australia 195-3 (Burns 93, Head 81) Double spin with de Silva continuing, so Joe Burns is quick to get the baggy green cap on. Smart move with a century in the offing: those celebration photos look so much better in the vintage headgear. He nearly runs himself out though, stuttering halfway down the wicket after responding to Head’s call, but a misfield means he makes it safely.47th over: Australia 193-3 (Burns 92, Head 80) Perera returns from the Church End. Or the Shops End. Whatever you want to call it. Taking his time setting up his field, taking his time as the right and left handers change over. But when you bowl short as an off-spinner, all the fielder can do is take his time to collect the ball from the fence. Those who are au fait with Canberra watering holes will appreciate this sentiment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d7dc3ca83fe7cd9fe663baf5c44b192c7af77f2/70_318_3846_2308/master/3846.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8440b3a5798bbc4f05587049c49ab29f","title":"the orchestra review jean anouilh","story":"Omnibus theatre, LondonA team of musicians create discord as the neglected playwright’s short, sharp drama is given a stylish revival In 1962 there were six plays by Jean Anouilh running in London. Today he is all but forgotten, so it is good to see a revival of this ertissement about the tensions inside a predominantly female cafe-orchestra pumping out familiar tunes to a French spa audience.Music may have charms to soothe a savage breast but it doesn’t seem to do as much for the players. In Jeremy Sams’s stylish translation, the simmering rows are sexual, social and political.The leader and the cellist fight over the male pianist, who turns out to be a creepy voyeur. A spinsterish violinist and a man-hungry colleague reveal their polarised private lives. Battle is also waged over who did, or did not, collaborate with the Nazis. You could see the play as a mini-portrait of a ided, postwar nation. But the real joke lies in the contrast between the jaunty music – credited to Felix Cross – and the jealousies within the group: even a number called Rapture in Havana, for which they gaily don sombreros, is followed by a serious rupture.Kristine Landon-Smith’s production neatly captures the attempt to cover the crises with a grimly smiling insouciance. My only complaint is that the accents of Teatro Latino’s multinational cast are not always easy to penetrate. There are, however, deft performances from Amanda Osborne as the orchestra’s despairing leader and from Stefania Licari as a temperamental musician who explains she did her bit for the Resistance by playing out of tune to German audiences. It would be good to see this 50-minute piece paired with another play but it reminds us that there is still life in the abandoned Anouilh."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a04d16c43a056075bff6d70f984da817fa2698a/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f64021244dbdf999d67bcefa4f072680","title":"facebook and twitter removed hundreds of accounts linked to iran russia and venezuela","story":"The Facebook accounts had garnered about 2 million followers and researchers say they amplified anti-west viewsFacebook and Twitter both announced on Thursday they had taken down hundreds of accounts believed to have been part of coordinated influence operations from Iran, Russia and Venezuela.Facebook removed 783 pages, groups and accounts that it said posed as local actors in countries across Europe, the Middle East and south Asia and shared content that was largely repurposed from Iranian state media. The accounts, some of which had been active since 2010, had garnered about 2 million followers on Facebook and more than 250,000 followers on Instagram.While Facebook demurred from ascribing a motive to the operation, researchers with the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab who analyzed the accounts said that it appeared designed to amplify views “in line with Iranian government’s international stances”.“The pages posted content with strong bias for the government in Tehran and against the ‘West’ and regional neighbors, such as Saudi Arabia and Israel,” the researchers wrote in a blog post.Several of the accounts focused on sharing pro-Palestinian or anti-Israeli content, in French, English, Spanish and Hebrew. Many advanced pro-Iran, anti-Saudi Arabia messages to a largely Middle Eastern, Arabic-speaking audience. One targeted an English-language audience and posted 911 conspiracy theories.The accounts purchased less than $30,000 in advertising on Facebook and Instagram, the company said. They also promoted eight “events” since May 2014, but Facebook said it could not confirm whether the events had actually taken place.Separately, Twitter announced that it had deleted thousands of “malicious” accounts from Russia, Iran and Venezuela. The accounts had “limited operations” targeting the US midterm elections in November, the company said, and the majority were suspended prior to election day.Twitter identified two operations in Venezuela. The first involved 764 accounts and distributed “spammy content focused on isive political themes”. The platform was not able to “definitively” attribute the activity to a government-backed influence campaign, but said it removed the accounts anyway.The second Venezuelan campaign involved 1,196 accounts, which Twitter said appeared to be part of a state-backed influence campaign targeting Venezuelans.The takedowns were “an encouraging example of the type of collaboration we’re trying to build across industry”, said Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook’s head of cybersecurity policy, on a conference call with reporters.Gleicher said that Facebook had acted in part on information shared with the company by Twitter. Facebook also had its own ongoing investigation into inauthentic behavior from Iran, having previously announced account takedowns in August and October of 2018.Gleicher said that Twitter had shared information about the Venezuelan influence operations, and that Facebook was now “investigating those leads”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d91fe2301f0cf6fbedd305de497e41ea937e4bd/0_0_4708_2826/master/4708.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9fa853a64dad203084aeb1879d08dd5b","title":"send a tip on a living museum in the uk for the chance to win a 200 hotel voucher","story":"Tell us about an immersive museum or historic site you’ve visited in the UK that brings the past to life.

The circular trek peaks three times – each at over 5,000 metres – and is regarded as the highest trek in Peru. I completed the circuit at 16 and while fit, I was hardly a finely tuned athlete. But acclimatising to altitude is essential. You are rewarded with some of the most stunning scenery in the world – with plenty of glaciers and cobalt-blue lakes. It’s a five-night camping trip so it’s handy there are several hot springs en route for bathing. We travelled from Cusco having spent three days acclimatising there, taking a three-hour drive to the start of the trek (4,000 metres) in Tinqui. We went with Outlook Expeditions, who put us in touch with a local guide. FreyaLie back and enjoy the glow-worms, they said, and they were right. Black water rafting in the underground cave system in Waitomo, North Island, is such fun that once won’t feel like enough. We were guided through the caves in provided wetsuits, holding onto our rubber tyres as we zip-wired from one cave system to another. We then plunged into pools to float and glide effortlessly along the subterranean stream. And to top it off, looking up, it’s not stars that you see but hundreds of glow-worms shining brightly on the cave roof. • Tour from NZ$125 (around £65), waitomoPaulLast April, I enjoyed a trek in the central desert in Iran (Dasht-e Kavir) where, with a local guide, I encountered amazing scenery, lots of wild camels, lizards and mindblowingly stark, empty salt flats. I camped and stayed in local hotels in the oases with their pistachio nut shrubs and roses and have never met such friendly people. I finished off the trip with a few days amid the empty beaches, mangroves, salt caves and gorges of Qeshm Island in the Strait of Hormuz. The cost of the trip, through Tehran-based Adventure Iran, was £495pp for six days, food, guide and transfers. I am going back soon, further south, to visit the Lut desert, which has a claim to be the hottest place on Earth, having recorded over 70C. Bernard PhelanLast summer, with my husband, I went on a road trip in the States. We had hoped to do lots of hiking, but we arrived in the middle of a 35C heatwave, so we changed our plans. We contacted Regis Canoe Outfitters, on the Saranac River (New York state), and spent the next three days canoeing around lakes and creeks, interspersed with lengthy dips to cool ourselves down. At night, we listened to the croaking of frogs from one of the many free wild camping spots. The camping sites are free, but designated, and are generally first come, first served. If you get lucky, you can have your own private island for the night, at zero cost. True bliss and so much better than hiking in the stifling heat.• Canoe hire for three days $52, canoeoutfittersBreeLast November, I ran the Extreme West Atlantic Trail race in Flores island in the Azores. The route, on a hard hiking trail, stretches 36km through mountainous terrain. The morning mist lifting in the volcanic crater lakes, the spectacular waterfalls, the dense forest and the old brick walkways and dry-stone walls gave the sense of a place lost in time. I stayed on the west coast of the island (the most western point in Europe), in Casas da Cascata (doubles from €70), a beautiful stone house under a waterfall. Sara Cycling the Four Rivers route from Seoul to Busan is a glorious trip along 600km of generally flat cycle path and quiet country roads covering the length of the country. Accommodation is cheap and plentiful with options from camping to hotels. We found local people to be extremely welcoming, even if you can’t speak Korean. Food was cheap and plentiful and the mountainous scenery was stunning. Taken at your own pace it’s as painful or relaxing as you want it to be, and the best way to see this gem of a country. Summer mosquitos mean autumn and spring are the best times to make the trip, excellent for foliage and wild flowers, too.BenI took a six-night swim trip with Strel in warm turquoise waters taking in the Gulf of Kotor, the stunning Plava Spilja (Blue Grotto) and in Yugoslavian submarine tunnels.

Although Attenborough has worked for other broadcasters before, such as Sky, the financial clout and global reach of Netflix and its move into traditional BBC territory sparked fears last year that he might make the streaming service his main home.However, he has a long association with the BBC ning 60 years, including a spell as BBC2 controller.Fortunately for viewers, there will be no clash between the similar-sounding Our Planet and One Planet, Seven Worlds. The Netflix show is due to be released in April, while its BBC rival is expected to air in the autumn.Announcing the Protecting Our Planet season, Alison Kirkham, BBC’s controller of factual commissioning, pointed out: “Plenty of other broadcasters are now following our lead, but we’re determined to keep moving the conversation forwards.“That’s what makes the BBC special: the desire to anticipate and stimulate the national conversation, not motivated by commercial imperatives or what’s in fashion. The BBC has a unique commitment to factual programming. I don’t believe any other broadcaster in British television has such an extraordinary breadth of output in factual.”Other shows announced by Kirkham ranged from Nadiya on Anxiety, a documentary from Bake Off winner Nadiya Hussain revealing how she suffers from and copes with anxiety, and My Family, the Holocaust and Me, fronted by Robert “Judge” Rinder.In addition, Louis Theroux investigates sexual assault in US colleges, and a groundbreaking documentary executive produced by the  tells the story of a gay transsexual man’s quest to have a child in Seahorse: The Dad Who Gave Birth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dee9739f043aa79ddac7d9a1c506b0ff6ac516eb/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d52f1242615955e873e9e5f4bd17c4d3","title":"polar vortex latest weather news midwest record lows","story":"Number of deaths unclear as Chicago breaks record for cold, with higher temperatures possible for the weekendDangerously cold weather continued to shatter records across the midwest on Thursday, as the polar vortex kept schools, businesses and government offices closed, and hospitals busy.Reports of deaths linked to the weather system steadily rose on Thursday and authorities continued to investigate.At least 21 have died across the country, according to Reuters. Hospitals have reported hundreds of cold-related cases. Chicago shattered all-time low temperatures Thursday morning, earning it the nickname “Chiberia”. There, temperatures dropped to -21F (-29C), nearly 10 degrees colder than the 1985 record.Nearby Rockford, Illinois, set a cold weather record at -30F (-34C). Madison, Wisconsin broke its 1985 record, with lows of -26F (-32C) Thursday morning. In all cases, record-keeping started more than 100 years ago.As temperatures rose in the midwest on Thursday, the storm moved farther east, spreading arctic conditions over an area from Buffalo to Brooklyn. In western New York, the storm dumped up to 20 inches of snow (51 centimeters).The deaths attributed to the weather system include an elderly Illinois man who was found after he fell trying to get into his home, a University of Iowa student found behind an academic hall,a man struck by a snowplow in the Chicago area and nine people in Chicago. Additionally, a young couple’s SUV struck a truck on a snowy road in northern Indiana, and a Milwaukee man froze to death in a garage, authorities said.The extreme cold has also sent dozens of people to hospitals in Minnesota. Hennepin healthcare in Minneapolis says it has treated 22 patients for frostbite since Friday, including 13 admitted to the hospital. At least 144 people in Illinois visited hospital emergency rooms for cold-related injuries over two days.Some areas of the midwest were expected to warm up dramatically by the weekend. Temperatures in Illinois could rise by 80 degrees within days.More people are expected to return to work in Chicago, which resembled a ghost town Wednesday after most offices told employees to stay home.Aside from the safety risks and the physical discomfort, the system’s icy grip also took a heavy toll on infrastructure, halting transportation, knocking out electricity and interrupting water service.Ten diesel train lines in the Metra commuter network kept running, unlike the electric lines, but crews had to heat vital switches with gas flames and watched for cracked rails.In Detroit, more than two dozen water mains froze. Most mains are five to six feet (1.5 to 1.8 meters) underground and beneath the frost line, but that matters little when temperatures drop so dramatically, Peckinpaugh said.Authorities have warned that the warmer temperatures may bring their own set of problems. In Michigan, melting snow and rain and a 17-mile ice jam on the Muskegon river could lead to flooding. Potholes will appear on roads and bridges weakened by the freeze-thaw cycle. The same cycle can crack water mains and homeowners’ pipes.

After two years, press freedom is worse day by day.”Linda Lakhdhir, Asia legal adviser at Human Rights Watch and author of the report, said: “Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy promised a new Myanmar, but the government still prosecutes peaceful speech and protests and has failed to revise old oppressive laws.”The rights group said the new government increasingly used section 66(d) of the Telecommunications Law to stifle critical voices through a catch-all definition of “defamation”.Hunter Marston, a Washington-based independent consultant, agreed with the findings, saying freedom of press had “deteriorated markedly”. In addition to laws being used to suppress criticism, he said the country’s de-facto leader had failed to step up for freedom of expression.“State Councillor Aung San Suu Kyi has refrained from using her authority to reverse the wrongful charges and imprisonment of Reuters reporters Kyaw Soe Oo and Wa Lone,” he said. “This high-profile case has cast a pall over Myanmar’s journalist community, which continues to brave a repressive political environment to present rigorous news coverage, push back against military atrocities in ethnic minority states, and call attention to a lack of political reforms by the NLD.”Independent researcher Kim Jolliffe said the intimidations extended much further, with the jailing of Kyaw Soe Oo and Wa Lone “just the most visible tip of the iceberg”.“Less senior journalists from local publications are regularly being detained without due process or being violently attacked while on the job,” he said. “Numerous journalists, including young women, have been beaten or killed while reporting on commercial ventures or state-linked economic projects in recent years.”He attributed this to only few of them working for global media corporations and not having high-profile lawyers. In total, Jolliffe said the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners had identified 35 political prisoners who were behind bars, in addition to 56 who were awaiting trial in pre-trial detention and more than 200 outside prison.NLD spokesman Myo Nyunt could not be reached for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a7bb0cb2df5a46383a0b7a65e12a722e8ef3897/0_1207_1890_1134/master/1890.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4cffa608c2f5f2406e107336c2e0b73","title":"pioneering bollywood lesbian romance opens in india","story":"Film is first mainstream Indian movie to show family coming to terms with daughter being gayA father tries to marry off his daughter to a handsome bachelor. She resists, insisting her heart lies with someone else. There is singing and dancing. It could be the trailer for any Bollywood romance.Only the barest hint is given that Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga (How I Felt When I Saw that Girl) is a pioneering release for Indian cinema: the first mainstream, star-studded blockbuster about a family coming to terms with their daughter loving another woman.Opening across the country on Friday, Ek Ladki has been the subject of a careful marketing campaign that has avoided explicitly spelling out the novel features of its plot. In part, that is to avoid controversy: Fire, a 1996 film that featured a lesbian relationship, resulted in cinemas being trashed by mobs of fanatical Hindus.It is also part of a strategy to project the film beyond the liberal enclaves of Delhi, Mumbai and other major cities, where arthouse and independent films about same-sex relationships have already screened to small audiences.Last September, after more than a decade of legal campaigning, India scrapped a colonial-era ban on homosexuality. The next step is changing people’s attitudes, says the film’s director, Shelly Chopra Dhar.Earlier Indian mainstream films that addressed homosexuality have framed it as something radical, says Raja Sen, a film critic with the Hindustan Times.In Fire, the female protagonists sleep together out of frustration because their husbands have renounced sex. In  Heroine (2012), the main character “gives into lesbianism as part of her moral decay”, he says.When producers were looking for someone to play a gay character in Kapoor \u0026amp Sons (2016), they were forced to search beyond India, eventually casting the Pakistani actor Fawad Khan. “He was very good, but he got the role largely because a lot of mainstream Bollywood actors said no to that part, fearing what it would do to their image,” Sen says.Films such as Dedh Ishqiya (2014) tried to have it both ways, hinting heavily that two female protagonists were in a relationship, but never quite saying so. “It was very nudge nudge wink wink,” Sen says. “If someone wanted to stubbornly say these are just two friends who are riding off into the sunset together, you could say that.”In contrast, Ek Ladki has the trappings of a classic Bollywood story about forbidden love – that just happens to be between two women. It is also the first time the crossover Hollywood star Anil Kapoor has acted with his daughter Sonam Kapoor, adding to its box office appeal.The film is part of a trend of taboo-breaking Bollywood films in recent years. Veere Di Wedding (2018) featured a gay character in a minor part, but the film was more controversial for being the first to show a woman masturbating.Pad Man (2018) cast the megastar Akshay Kumar in the story of an Indian pioneer of cheap menstrual pads.But ultimately its success will depend on something more traditional: whether the film is entertaining. “The golden rule of cinema is entertainment,” she says “And if you don’t follow that, it’s not cinema.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9bb7caff362af4cb96195c6848c5ed7aaea3dd8/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=811fe9d5de7f84bb9ab8d4ff1f20cb9c","title":"tell us about the issues men face today","story":"From mental health to relationships, we’d like to hear from men of all ages about what they are really thinkingThe debate around modern-day masculinity has intensified in the wake of the #MeToo movement, and we are asking men to tell us what they are really thinking.As the role of men and women in society continue to change, so too do the dynamics from the workplace to the bedroom and everywhere in between.

In a statement the parliament urged the bloc’s 28 governments to follow suit and declare Guaidó “the only legitimate interim president” until there were “new free, transparent and credible presidential elections”.“Parliament has spoken. For us, Mr Guaidó is the president of Venezuela and we do hope that the European Union will find a united position on this,” Jeremy Hunt, the UK foreign secretary, told reporters on arrival at a two-day meeting of EU foreign ministers in Bucharest. The EU has imposed an arms embargo and sanctions on Venezuelan officials, but Hunt wants the bloc to impose further targeted sanctions.On Thursday, the Spanish news agency EFE said three of its journalists – a Spanish reporter, a Colombian photographer and a Colombian TV producer – who had been detained on Wednesday were being released and deported. Two detained French journalists working for television channel TMC were also released on Thursday.“We firmly believe that all journalists should be able to exercise their duties and responsibilities and rights in the exercise of their work,” said Federica Mogherini, the EU foreign policy chief, in Bucharest.Erika Guevara-Rosas, Amnesty International’s Americas director, said: “The detention of journalists is a flagrant and deeply concerning attack on freedom of expression and the right to truth … A free press is fundamental for the defence of human rights in any country in the world.”Speaking on BBC radio, Hunt said a humanitarian catastrophe was unfolding in the country, with citizens struggling to find scraps of food. “We are not considering sanctions against the whole country because there is a humanitarian situation and we wouldn’t want to make the situation even worse,” he said. “But targeted sanctions against the kleptocrats who have enriched themselves on the back of the rest of the population who are very poor, that is something I think can be effective.”Key EU countries are prepared to recognise Guaidó as the legitimate interim president of Venezuela if Maduro refuses to call fresh elections by Sunday. But not every EU state has issued the ultimatum, and Russia is looking to see if these isions can be prised open. Moscow has so far offered full-throated support for Maduro. It is estimated to have invested £13bn in Venezuela through refinancing of the country’s debt and through oil and arms deals.Members of Maduro’s administration have rejected and ridiculed the EU countries’ ultimatum, the end of which will be marked by a day of pro-opposition protests on Saturday.“These men from the EU who think Venezuela is a colony have given us eight days to call elections and the deadline runs out on Saturday,” the powerful socialist party leader Diosdado Cabello told a rally in the northern city of Coro on Wednesday.“How scary. How terribly scary!” Cabello added mockingly. “Is the US going to get involved in an attack against Venezuela?”Maduro has accused Donald Trump and a “group of extremists around him” of plotting to topple him in order to seize Venezuela’s oil, and said he risked transforming the country into a new Vietnam.Venezuela’s supreme court has imposed a travel ban and financial restrictions on Guaidó, including freezing his bank accounts.Guaidó, 35, a former student leader and head of Venezuela’s opposition-run national assembly, has been at the forefront of a renewed attempt to force Maduro from power.He said in an opinion piece for the New York Times on Wednesday that he had held “clandestine” meetings with the military to try to persuade them to withdraw their support for Maduro. Protesters marched in Caracas on Wednesday calling for Maduro to stand down.In an interview to Spain’s El País newspaper, Guaidó repeated an appeal to Venezuela’s armed forces to take his side. “I am convinced that at a certain moment ... the army will end up manifesting its discontent, and take this opportunity to stand on the side of the constitution. And not only because we propose an amnesty,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbb9e34fb343adf4b0153176ecc951ed3faf913e/0_117_3504_2102/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e415c131b167cbf3ecca3e8a4168d5c9","title":"how do trees survive in winter","story":"Some shed their leaves others rely on antifreeze in their veins (or pine needles) to survive the colder months. But trees couldn’t survive winter without the special relationship they have with birdsAside from the music of the westerlies playing through those skeletal canopies, British woods, when stripped of their leaves, tend to have an atmosphere of expectant quietude. Winter is a time of frugality, and the two major tree types, deciduous and evergreen, adopt very different strategies to cope with the double challenge of little sunlight and low temperatures.A deciduous tree operates by shedding all its leaves. This means that it lacks the means to photosynthesise and, thus, to generate fresh energy for five to six months of the year. However, there’s an upside to losing foliage, because it has ended the loss of moisture that occurs through leaves.This endless recycling of water from the trees to the atmosphere, known as transpiration, is costly. A single large mature oak may possess up to 200,000 leaves, and lose as much as 150,000 litres of water over the course of a year. A summer wood in full foliage conceals thousands of rising columns of tree-borne moisture, which is why it often feels so warm and humid within woods, when the surrounding countryside can be cool and breezy.Conifer trees reduce the stress of water loss by possessing fine needle-like leaves with minimum surface area and thick, waxy water-retaining cuticles. The adaptations slow down the process of transpiration. While the structure of evergreen foliage doesn’t have the energy-producing efficiency of a flat plate-like deciduous leaf, the fact that conifers can continue to photosynthesise year-round compensates for this. Some pines even have antifreeze in their needles, to enable them to work in icy conditions.The dormancy of winter trees means that this is the best time for planting or transferring them around our gardens. Choose a warm winter’s day so the earth is soft, dig a hole deep enough so the soil fully protects the roots from frost, then water well once planted. Observing how that new tree slowly grows and flourishes is one of the most satisfying processes in gardening.Trees also make use of the winter to do some self-propagation of their own. Much of the work for this process begins in the autumn, with the production of seeds and fruit. British oaks are a perfect example. From September onwards they leave a great larder of sugar- and protein-rich food for hungry birds or mammals, in the form of acorns. Squirrels, rodents and several species of crow store these nuts away to consume during the colder months. Yet, no species has more of a capacity to plan ahead than the creature that William Henry Hudson called the “British bird of paradise”: the European jay.In late autumn, this glorious pink-and-blue bird can be seen making repeat journeys to and from acorn-producing oak trees. The jay then buries them, sometimes flying several miles from the original source tree. Over the course of autumn, the average bird hides about 5,000 acorns. Across Britain and Ireland, the entire jay population stores somewhere in the region of 1.7bn acorns.The birds possess extraordinary memories for where they have hidden their stores, and yet – here is the clever part – they can’t remember them all. Not only do those forgotten acorns stand a strong chance of growing into oak saplings the following spring, but jays show a preference for open ground between tree cover in their choice of burial sites. In other words, they plant their acorns precisely where they might grow best.This acorn storage system thus benefits the jay twice over. Not only does it provide itself with food for the winter, but by forgetting some of its larder it also creates fresh habitat for future generations of jays. These birds are truly s of our oak woods. But it works both ways: by taking care of the birds, the trees ensure they prosper themselves.The dispersal of seed is, in fact, a major part of the woodland scene in winter. Hawthorn, holly, yew, mountain ash, crab apple, blackthorn and sea buckthorn – not to forget woodland shrubs, such as mistletoe and ivy, or garden favourites including cotoneaster and pyracantha – all produce fruit that birds love.Thrushes are especially drawn to these trees and consume vast quantities of their fruits. In return for this generosity, the thrushes then fly to their roosts in some hedge or tall tree at dusk and do what comes naturally. They poop out seeds during the night and leave each one in its own little store of fertiliser.So woods and birds are truly partners in reproduction. You can see how they interact on any winter’s day and in any wood, from John O’Groats to Land’s End, and from the mountain tops to the seashore. Because we legally “own” it, people like to imagine that they control the land, but the British woodlands have ways of shaping their own destinies.Yorkshire Tea and treesYorkshire Tea is planting a million trees over five years – with a bit of help from the Woodland Trust, UK schoolchildren and Kenyan tea farmers.

Photograph: Nick Bradshaw The family of a prisoner in Mountjoy Prison was refused details about why he had been locked in a “padded cell” due to GDPR constraints, lawyers for the man have claimed.Court papers filed as part of a judicial review of the prison’s decision show that the prisoner’s family was informed just before Christmas that he had been placed in special observation cell – colloquially known as a padded cell.However, the prisoner’s mother told his solicitor that after being informed of this, the prison refused to disclose the reasons why he had been put there. In an affidavit, the prisoner’s solicitor, Tony Collier, stated that he was also told when he contacted the prison that the reasons for his client being moved to the cell could not be given “due to ‘GDPR’ constraints”.GDPR, or the General Data Protection Regulation, is a strict set of rules on the data protection and privacy introduced in the European Union last year. In an email sent later that day, Mr Collier warned that the prison’s position “is a misinterpretation of GDPR and that a family member and a prisoner’s solicitor are absolutely entitled to information concerning a prisoner’s personal welfare”.In response, an Irish Prison Service officer said that “non-disclosure of sensitive information due to an inability to confirm an inidual over the phone enforces the GDPR process so to protect the named prisoner”.“The prisoner’s safety and family members worries are of great concern to the Prison Service,” the officer wrote. In a later phone call, another prison officer informed the solicitor that he “would not give him any information due to GDPR”. The Irish Penal Reform Trust (IPRT) said that people held in isolation were more vulnerable to potential human rights breaches, “and therefore the highest level of safeguards and protections must apply”. Deirdre Malone, executive director of the IPRT, said: “The Irish Prison Service must have systems in place for recording consent and for verification of callers so that solicitors and concerned family can be reassured about their family member’s safety and health behind prison walls.”The trust has previously called for a mandatory notification to a legal representative in cases of placement in safety observation cells or close supervision cells. “The prisoner should be informed that they have the right to contact their solicitor, and should be given an opportunity to do so as soon as practicable,” Ms Malone said, adding that the prison service should publish details about how long iniduals are held in cells and whether any of the placements are continuous or repeated placements of the same prisoner.“Currently, there is no transparency on this and it is a big concern,” she said.In a replying affidavit, Mountjoy Prison assistant governor Paul Flynn said that the prisoner, Brandon Crosbie, had been placed in close supervision cell between December 18th and 23rd following an incident in the prison, to prevent him “from causing imminent injury to himself or others”. The Irish Prison Service said it had no comment on the case as it is before the courts."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3777866.1548954897!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"forest service suspends tree felling in co cork native woodland area","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTed Cook of Macroom District Environmental Group and ecologist Laura McCarthy at the woodland in the Toon Valley between Macroom and Inchigeelagh, Co. Cork. Photograph:  Daragh McSweeneyProvisionThe Forest Service has halted the felling of trees in a wood in Co Cork, described by one expert as “the finest undesignated native woodland in the country”, following complaints by a number of environmentalists that the work is in breach of the owner’s felling licence.The Department of Agriculture this week confirmed to The  that the Forest Service had suspended the two-year felling licence granted to landowners Lorraine and James Costello in April 2017 for the old-growth oak woodland on their holding at Silvergrove in the Toon Valley near Inchigeelagh in mid-Cork.“The felling licence for the site is currently suspended. As the matter is under review the department is not in a position to comment further,” said the Department of Agriculture in a statement issued in response to a series of questions about the felling work posed by The .The Macroom District Environmental Group was one of a number of parties to raise the issue of felling with the Forest Service after the Costellos and their environmental adviser, Ecoplan, began felling trees on the Costellos’ holding which is part of a 150-hectare woodland complex in the remote rural valley.According to Ted Cook of the Macroom District Environmental Group, the felling licence for the 13-hectare site is simply for thinning, but he said the work carried out by the contractors hired by the Costellos and Ecoplan constituted more expansive clear-felling, without any replanting taking place. “What has happened in late December and early January is that a large area of woodland was essentially clear-felled with some trees left... Many of the remaining trees are unlikely to remain standing as they are now vulnerable to wind-throw due to a drastic change in tree density and structure.“The Costellos have a thinning licence, but what’s taken place at Silvergrove is not thinning – that’s why the Forest Service ordered machines off the site two weeks ago – the trees have been grubbed – cut down and the stumps ploughed up and pulled out by JCBs,” said Mr Cook.“They are only licensed to thin ‘undesirable trees’ under the terms of the licence, but they have cut down hundreds of trees, and all that is left are some birch, a scatter of young ash and a couple of very shook oaks.”Mr Cook said the clearance work was destroying what woodland expert and co-author of Management Guidelines for Ireland’s Native Woodlands, Dr John Cross, had described as “the finest undesignated native woodland in the entire country”.Fellow environmentalist Tom Jordan alleged that the Costellos had also breached the terms of their licence by converting some of the cleared land to agriculture through replanting it with grass in the spaces between a few straggling trees and allowing animals to graze it last summer.Mr Jordan pointed to correspondence from the Forest Service to another local in which it confirmed that it had advised the Costellos, following a site inspection in October 2017, that grazing animals were not allowed on the site at any time. However, forestry consultant Sean McGinnis of Ecoplan, who advised and assisted the Costellos with their licence application, has disputed that what has taken place at Silvergrove is clear-felling, and insisted it was simply thinning in keeping with the licence terms.Mr McGinnis pointed out that the area was not designated as a Special Area of Conservation, a National Heritage Area, a proposed National Heritage Area or a Special Protection Area for birds, so the owners were free to carry out thinning work under licence, which they have done.“The landowner didn’t do anything wrong – we applied for a licence three years ago and it was referred to the National Parks and Wildlife, who had no issue with what we were proposing,” said Mr McGinnis, who insisted the work was no more than thinning, and as such did not require the area to be replanted.He also disputed claims that his client was prevented from grazing the land, saying that “wood pasture or silvo pasture” was a traditional land-management practice, and there was no prohibition on farmers allowing animals to graze in a forest where the owner has not obtained grant aid from the State.He said felling work had previously been suspended in September 2018 when local Forest Service inspectors visited the site on foot of complaints, but the suspension was lifted at the end of October 2018 following an assessment by the manager of the Forest Service felling section, and work resumed.He expressed confidence that the issue regarding the current suspension of felling would be resolved shortly."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3776099.1548859240!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"how brexit could impact on immigration rules and the common travel area","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Common Travel Area is based on a collection of legal provisions rather than on an international treaty or concrete agreement. Photograph: Oli ScarffGetty ImagesDuring the Spanish Civil War, sympathetic guides took volunteers wishing to fight for the republic over mountain passes from France, which only goats might have been expected to cross.Decades later, a heavily-militarised German Democratic Republic (the DDR or Communist East Germany) prevented its citizens from leaving by a 1,400 km long wall of concrete, barbed wire and guns stretching from the Baltic Sea to Czechoslovakia.Even in today’s times of modern surveillance it is difficult fully to control the crossing of borders by those who are sufficiently motivated to attempt to do so, whether they are desperate refugees, smugglers and criminals, or fighters in some cause.The complex and sometimes bloody history of Ireland’s porous own borderlands has been documented more than once, most recently in writer and mapmaker Garrett Carr’s fascinating book The Rule of the Land.Carr traversed every kilometre of the contested territory, illustrating how notoriously difficult they are to seal and to police – a reality that was too visible for too long to Border communities.For two years, the movement of goods has dominated the Brexit negotiations. The movement of people, by contrast, appears on the face of it to be a far simpler matter, but this is not the whole story.Even if ways and means can be found to regulate the movement of goods, or if it proves possible to do away with the need for such controls, this will not be the case for the movement of people. The implications of this have not been fully considered.The 1921 Anglo Irish Treaty was silent on matters of migration and settlement, including cross-Border movement. By default, it was assumed that the new Free State would, for all practical purposes, continue to function in the same manner as before.Irish and British people continued to have reciprocal immigration and settlement rights in one another’s jurisdictions. It also meant that border controls were concerned primarily with goods and not people.The free movement regime between the two jurisdictions changed during the second World War. Travel from Ireland to Britain, usually for employment purposes, was subject to permission from both sides.Travel from the Free State to Northern Ireland required an identity document a residence permit was necessary if a longer stay was intended. Interestingly, Northern Ireland travellers faced control checks if they sought to enter Britain.In itself, this is an indication of how impracticable it was considered to seek a hard land border within the island, even though Northern Unionists resented being placed on a different footing from people in other parts of the UK.Such anger was frequently ventilated by Unionist MPs in the House of Commons. The British requirement for a travel permit for those coming from any part of the island of Ireland did not lapse until the end of 1947.The UK view was that travel controls would only be fully abolished if and when a similar immigration policy was established between the two governments. Such a policy was agreed by the Department of Justice in Dublin and the UK home office in London in 1952.It formed the basis for what is now known as the Common Travel Area (CTA), a term first used in 1953. Irish officials went to some lengths to conceal the background to the negotiation, telling London the rules would be “entirely informal”.Consequently, the terms of the 1952 agreement were not made public at the time - a deal that lay at the heart of UKIrish immigration arrangements for decades was effectively kept secret for decades, at Dublin’s behest.The CTA is an unusual arrangement, as may be judged by the Ireland Act passed by Westminster. Within this, “the Republic of Ireland is not a foreign country for the purposes of any law in force in any part of the United Kingdom”.British prime minster Theresa May has insisted it will remain in place after Brexit. So, too, has the Irish Government. Under it, Irish and British citizens have free movement rights, the right to work, settle, claim benefits, even vote.There was, nevertheless, an obvious downside. The CTA has meant that Dublin remained subservient to London in all key matters regarding immigration policy. Moreover, when the UK changed its policies, Ireland followed suit.Sometimes, the co-operation jarred notably Dublin’s willingness to follow the diktats of the home office’s ‘blackbook’. If a person on that list applied for a visa to enter Ireland, a refusal was automatic.The CTA was premised on the assumption that both countries showed, as it were, an identical face, and applied more or less identical policies, to the outside world and its citizens. Such a stance was unsavoury and unpalatable but arguably sustainable, where one of those countries was one with very limited immigration - the loss of autonomy it implied for Ireland was small.However, the immigrant population of Ireland today is 17 per cent, albeit mostly from the European Union. The entire question of humanitarian migration - asylum seekers and refugees - is more important today than it was for the Ireland of the 1950s.What if, for instance, the UK was to lurch further towards a xenophobically anti-immigrant stance, or even to contemplate a radical rejection of the terms of the 1951 Refugee Convention? Would Ireland’s hands be tied as well?For Ireland, the CTA has guaranteed ready access for generations of Irish emigrants to a nearby labour market with a shared language and a strong demand for Irish workers. From a UK point of view, such labour has been readily available and affordable.Often, the UK was a\u0026nbspsafety valve for Ireland’s social problems. It accepted Ireland’s pregnant, unmarried women those seeking abortions, the poor, or simply those who did not feel at home in an often intolerant State.The CTA has also constituted a key element in the management of a complex set of close relations and tensions between the two jurisdictions. It withstood even the most difficult and fractious period of the Troubles without substantial modification.The Belfast Agreement of 1998 spurred the dismantling of day-to-day barriers between the two parts of Ireland and between the two islands, including any requirement for the inspection of documents or other Border controls.Brexit will give rise to a situation where the freedom of movement enshrined in European Union policy and law will no longer apply in the UK, but the CTA will remain in force.Now, however, a question will arise as to the viability and adequacy of the CTA in the regulation of travel between the UK and Ireland when one of these remains in the EU and the other leaves.It now seems likely that post-Brexit Britain will move to restrict and regulate the movement of all third-party nationals into the UK, including those coming from the European Union - with the exception of Irish nationals.The changes will bring consequences. Regarding the movement of non-EU immigrants, we may expect to see strengthened co-operation between the Irish and British authorities to make the two jurisdictions a common jurisdiction in all but name.Citizens from other EU member states will have an unimpeded right of movement to Ireland, but no right of onward travel to the UK. The UK is now suggesting that national insurance checks, or other such inspections can prevent illegal immigration from Ireland.However, the creation of such a back-door seems logically and practically incompatible with the regulation of movements into Britain at ports, airports or by train. In all such cases, the UK has been insistent on the need for tight controls and reinforced borders.For instance, this is why the UK would not join the Schengen zone in the 1990s. It would be no exaggeration to say that “taking back control of our borders” was a key element in the Brexit platform.Why should it be different for IrelandUK movements and what might happen, say, to the putative 10,000 Spanish or Romanian migrants who might legally come to Ireland and proceed to attempt to cross the Border, if there are no border controls in place?Indeed, would the Irish authorities themselves be comfortable with potential flows in the other direction in an unstable post-Brexit situation? Electronic surveillance will not address these issues.The initial removal of Border controls in the 1990s was accompanied by a number of “soft control” measures to\u0026nbspensure that people not entitled to take advantage of the new freedoms did not seek to do so.This led to regular inspections on ferries between Scotland and Northern Ireland, for instance, in order to ascertain whether people who were not Irish or British might have crossed, or intended to cross the Irish border.It also led to Garda checks on buses and trains. Sometimes, ethnic profiling was used, as one black west Belfast man found out to his cost. Such checks now could see people carrying documents to prove that they had the right to circulate without carrying documents.More generally, it must give rise to the fear that the British and Irish authorities will in effect operate a shared zone of control between the two islands - one that might affect Ireland’s place in the European Union.For the UK authorities, the Common Travel Policy survived because Irish and UK immigration policies were strongly aligned. It is equally clear that neither the UK nor Ireland regard the notion of a “hard” land border as practicable or desirable.But jointly-imposed Anglo-Irish controls are very much on the horizon now after the UK leaves the European Union, involving cross-Border surveillance of asylum seekers, refugees and EU migrants - even if no hard border in the conventional sense returns.Piaras Mac Éinrí, is a lecturer in geography and European studies in the Department of Geography, University College Cork Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Mushrooms are grown quickly, harvested immediately and, if they are to be sold fresh, must be packaged and transported to market without delay.The “best before” date is about five-seven days after harvesting, the Irish Farmers’ Association mushroom chairman Gerry Reilly told TDs in September 2016.In recent decades, the Irish mushroom industry – whether in Northern Ireland or the Republic – has rooted itself close to either side of the Border but for producers, suppliers, processors and marketers, the Border simply does not exist.Growers work together on a cross-border basis, buying supplies anywhere within the European Union, which generally means either from the UK or the Republic, and then transporting, packaging and selling their produce on the same, invisible-border basis.In the Republic, Monaghan Mushrooms has grown since its foundation some 30 years ago to be one of the largest mushroom companies in the world. Based in Tyholland, Co Monaghan, it employs about 3,500 people and has operations in the UK, the Netherlands, Germany and Canada.Irish growers produce 70,000 tonnes of mushrooms a year, 80 per cent of which is sold in the UK, mainly through the big supermarket chains. The business is worth about €120 million a year and equates to 7 per cent of the total EU mushroom harvest.Near Cabragh in Co Tyrone, about 16km north of the Border, a £25 million investment is nearing completion. It is a huge mushroom composting facility owned by Northway Mushrooms, Northern Ireland’s largest grower company which is run along co-operative lines.“Our aim is to grow mushrooms as efficiently as possible,” says Northway’s operations manager, Elaine Shaw, as she shows off the emerging facility.Northway began in 2000 with about 65 growers between the North and the South. At the time, it had a turnover of £10 million. Today, the number of growers has shrunk to 20 but output has shot up and turnover is now around £55 million.The transformation is down to technology, specifically the introduction of Dutch shelving inside growing tunnels. This is layers of stacked shelving that allows the tunnels to massively increase their output.Northway has 11 growers in Northern Ireland and nine in the Republic, the southern growers producing about 75 per cent of Northway’s output. The 20 growers together employ about 1,000 people (picking is by hand so the sector is labour intensive). They produce 32,500 tonnes of mushrooms a year or 625 tonnes a week.The new composting facility is vast – seven acres of concrete buildings on aeroplane hangar scale, and is sufficient in size to produce about half of Northway’s grower’s requirements. Several thousand large bales of straw are stacked alongside the site, the essential raw material for creating mushroom compost.Eighteen people will be employed here full-time when the facility goes live at the end of next month.It is one of the ironies of Brexit that part of the cost of building the plant is coming from the EU’s Common Agriculture Policy (Cap), of which Northway is a beneficiary to the tune of over £2 million a year.Seventy-five per cent of the construction cost is being met by a bank loan, which has to be repaid in 11 years. The rest will come from the Cap money and a levy on growers, who will be supplied compost at production cost.The compost has a life of about six weeks after which it is recycled as farm or garden compost.If the plant is successful Northway’s growers will have a guaranteed supply of compost – the essential component for growing mushrooms – and be well placed to weather some of the unknowns that Brexit will present, even though some of them will be outside the EU.The £2 million a year Northway growers get from the Cap has been guaranteed by the UK government until 2022, according to Shaw.In preparation for Brexit, Northway is to set up a southern production organisation as a hedge against the unknown and, because that arm of the business will be based in the EU after the UK leaves, will be able to access EU funding through that route.Right now, most of what Northway’s growers produce is sold to Hughes Mushrooms in Northern Ireland and Monaghan Mushrooms in the South. To the extent that selling is done cross-border, it is simply unknown if that will be possible in the event of a no deal Brexit – but it would seem legally doubtful.“The general consensus is that free movement around the Border will continue but the change will be . . . Well, will it be electronic surveillance or done through paperwork? We just don’t know,” says Shaw.In recent years, Polish mushroom growers have made inroads to the UK market. If they are ultimately prevented from selling in the UK, because of the absence of a trade deal and the tariffs that will therefore be levied under World Trade Organisation rules (strictures that would apply also to Republic of Ireland producers and marketers such as Monaghan Mushrooms), there is an opportunity for Northway to increase output to meet demand within the rest of the UK.Having a guaranteed source of compost from the new plant will be critical to that. And if southern producers are shut out of the UK market because WTO rules destroy the viability of their business (the sector margins are 4-6 per cent and the fall in sterling has already inflicted huge damage), Northway’s growers have a great opportunity to expand.“The opportunity is there if it is more difficult for Polish producers to come into England, they will go elsewhere and that will allow us to expand,” says Shaw.But Brexit is also likely to curtail severely access to labour. Monaghan Mushrooms employ people from 41 different countries, a profile typical of labour intensive, minimum wage agri-businesses.“It is very important that we continue to have access to labour,” says Shaw.She cites the Republic’s “rest of the world permit scheme” which she says allowed non-EU nationals to obtain work visas in specific sectors. But because the Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn Féin cannot agree to restore the Executive, industry lobbyists are left floundering.But with Stormont mothballed, problems in search of practical solutions remain unsolved. As to what happens on March 30th and thereafter, the mushroom sector remains, like its product, somewhat in the dark.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

He said a recent event in Belfast drew a crowd of 250 people, with 200 at another in Limerick. He estimated a similar crowd would attend at meeting in Derry on Thursday.He also said about 200 people are joining the party every week, adding: “Well over a third of them would be former Fianna Fáil supporters. There is a large number of people who think Micheál Martin is giving them two fingers.”He also distanced himself from adverts in parish newsletters.A newsletter from Drumgoon, Co Cavan, on January 13th said: “New Pro Life Party: Peadar Tóibín TD invites parishioners to a general meeting in the Hotel Kilmore Thurs 17 January at 7.30pm. Pro Life supporters especially are asked to attend and show support for this initiative.”It appeared alongside other notices on planned pilgrimages to Medjugorje and classes on ICT skills for the unemployed.The Meath West TD said this was not an initiative of anyone senior in his party, but was rather due to the enthusiasm of an inidual who received one of his leaflets.“Someone got a leaflet in the door and rang up and asked for it to be put in the newsletter,” he said. “Obviously the party has a pro-life policy but it has a range of other policies too,” adding that Labour, for example, was “pro-abortion” but had polices on a range of different issues. “But nobody in the media would call the Labour Party a pro-abortion party.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3778047.1548968553!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tetrarch capital in talks with us investor starwood","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTetrarch owns or manages some of Ireland’s best-known hotels, including the five-star Marker, above,  in Dublin’s Grand Canal Dock. Photograph: Cyril ByrneInvestment group Tetrarch Capital is in talks with US investor Starwood about a joint venture partnership that would be worth several hundred million euro, and replace the Irish-owned hotelier’s plan for a public flotation.Tetrarch, which was founded by Irish businessman Michael McElligott, delayed plans for its initial public offering (IPO) last year amid ongoing market turmoil that had driven down the share prices of several Irish property companies.Market sources told The  the the company began working on alternative arrangements to the flotation before Christmas. That has led to the ongoing talks with Starwood. Any deal between the two would likely be for a significant sum, as it would have the same commercial objectives as the IPO, which had been mooted at the €400 million level.A partnership with Starwood would achieve many of the same goals, allowing early investors in Tetrarch to take cash off the table in an exit, as well as providing extra capital for investment in the future. Tetrarch refused to comment.Sources said that public markets effectively remain closed to new Irish property entrants. Tetrarch was one of several companies to stall plans for stock market listings after last year’s “Red October”, which saw share prices pummelled. US investor Lone Star temporarily delayed for a publicly quoted homebuilder called D-Res, while earlier in the year, plans to float specialist industrial property and retail were also shelved by their backers. Paddy McKillen jnr also abandoned the public floatation of his Press Up entertainment group.While this deal would be at a significantly larger scale, it is not the first time Tetrarch and Starwood have done business. The Connecticut headquartered investor financed Tetrarch purchase of Citywest, the largest hotel in the state, via a €60 million loan advanced by its European real estate arm last year.The US investor, which has $51 billion in assets under management, is an experienced player in hospitality markets. It built up a stake in the Principal Hotel Company in Britain before selling up last year to French property investor Foncière des Regions, and it is a significant investor in the Yotel chain, which it sank $250 million into in 2017.It has also provided financing for, or purchased, several office investments in Ireland. In 2015 it was behind the purchase of the Watermarque building in Dublin’s Ringsend, where short-term letting site Airbnb has its Irish offices. It is partnering the State’s main investment platform, the Irish Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF), to develop a €1 billion build-to-rent platform here called Urbeo.Tetrarch, which was founded as Brehon Capital in 2011, owns or manages some of Ireland’s best-known hotels, including the Powerscourt Hotel in Enniskerry and the five-star Marker in Dublin’s Grand Canal Dock. It also purchased the Mount Juliet hotel and golf resort in Kilkenny.It is planning to develop hotel projects in the city centre, including an expansion of its Dawson Hotel in Dublin into the neighbouring Royal Automobile Club, and a 158-bedroom hotel at Sackville Place in the north inner city.

Photograph: Charles McQuillanGettyWhy is the Irish Border such a big deal with Brexit? The 499-kilometre border running from Carlingford Lough to Lough Foyle will become the only land border between the UK and the European Union after Brexit.The 1998 Belfast Agreement brought peace to Northern Ireland and removed the need for border checks.It also established North-South rules and institutions that helped solidify the Peace Process. The border is currently invisible and neither side wants the return of infrastructure along the border or the creation of a hard border.So what exactly is a hard border? It is a frontier monitored and protected by customs officials and border inspectors, and potentially police or military personnel if there are security issues around the border.That could in turn lead to a police or military presence along the Border to protect check points. Customs and security posts along the Border were regular targets of republican paramilitaries during the 30-year Troubles.Why would there be a need for border checks? Different customs rules, regulations and standards will apply in Northern Ireland and the Republic if the UK is leaving the EU so the different rules could have to be enforced at a border.What do the EU and UK want along the Border? Neither party to the Brexit negotiations wants to see the return of a hard border but they cannot agree a plan on how to achieve this.So have they come up with anything to solve this problem? The EU and UK agreed in a political deal in December 2017 that a “backstop” was required in the withdrawal agreement – the orce deal – that would guarantee an invisible border in the event of no other solution to achieve this being found in a Brexit deal, either in a specific solution for Northern Ireland or in a broader EU-UK trade deal.The December 2017 agreement also aims to protect North-South co-operation, support the all-island economy and safeguards the 1998 Belfast Agreement. In March 2018 the two sides agreed that there had to be a legal text – not just a political declaration – around how this option would work in practice should no better option be found.What exactly is the backstop? It is an insurance policy written into the withdrawal agreement, or Brexit treaty, guaranteeing no harder border on the island of Ireland.It would only be used as a last resort or the default option if the EU and UK could not reach an overarching free trade deal that would make trade so frictionless that there would be no border between the EU and the UK, including on the frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic.How have the backstop talks developed? Brussels believed a hard border could be avoided and the Belfast Agreement upheld if Northern Ireland remains fully aligned with the EU’s customs union and parts of the single market after Brexit.This would mean matching the rules north and south of the Border for customs, energy, environmental regulations and laws covering agriculture and fisheries,.Northern Ireland would stick to EU rules covering state aid and would fall under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in applying those rules. The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier initially insisted that this backstop can only apply to Northern Ireland.London argued that if the backstop only applies to Northern Ireland, it would effectively create a customs and regulatory border in the Irish Sea. The Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which keeps May’s minority Conservative government in power,\u0026nbspalso objected. They oppose any checks between Ireland and Britain and what they see as a border in the Irish Sea.So what finally appeared in the withdrawal agreement on the backstop? The UK government suggested a backstop that would keep the whole of the UK aligned with EU customs union \u0026nbspafter the post-Brexit transition period.\u0026nbsp The transition is\u0026nbspa standstill period when current EU economic rules continue to apply over the UK. Under the agreement it is due to\u0026nbspexpire\u0026nbspat the end of 2020 but it could be extended to 2022.\u0026nbspThe backstop would be triggered if the two sides\u0026nbspfail to agree\u0026nbspa new trade deal by that time\u0026nbspthat is far-reaching enough to avoid Irish border checks. Under the backstop, the North would also follow EU regulatory rules set down by the single market for goods. This would be enough to avoid a hard Irish Border, but would still involve some regulatory checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea.But there are still problems?Yes, while the UK government signed off on the withdrawal agreement, Theresa May faced fierce opposition to it in the House of Commons and the backstop was one of the reasons why the House of Commons rejected the withdrawal agreement by 230 votes on January 15th, inflicting the heaviest parliamentary defeat ever on a British government. Many Conservatives fear that once the backstop is triggered, there will be no way out of it for the UK. The DUP objects to the fact that regulatory checks would be needed on goods crossing from Britain to the North and that the North would have to follow some rules set down in Brussels.\u0026nbspIs there a way around this? It is difficult. The EU has\u0026nbspgiven the UK assurances that it will make every effort to negotiate a new trade deal to make the backstop unnecessary, or – if it is introduced – to ensure that it is in force for as short a time as possible. However, crucially, the EU insists that the withdrawal agreement itself must remain untouched. This says that the backstop remains in place “unless and until” another way is found to avoid a hard Irish Border.\u0026nbspMany Conservative MPs and the DUP are not satisfied by non-binding assurances, fearing that the legal withdrawal agreement is the key document.\u0026nbspWhat if\u0026nbspthere is no agreement?If there is no backstop, there will be no orce deal and no transition period. In other words, there would be a disorderly Brexit and the UK would crash out of the EU in March 2019. It is anyone’s guess how goods passing over the Irish Border would be treated in such a scenario but the UK’s chaotic departure from the EU could create all sorts of difficulties for cross-border trade and beyond. It is also \u0026nbspopen to the UK to ask for an extension of the article 50 process – its departure date. The other 27 EU members would all have to agree. So far Theresa May has said she will not do this. She has also set her face against a second referendum vote. Under a recent ECJ ruling, the UK could withdraw its article 50 notification unilaterally. In other words if it decided to stay, it must be allowed to do so.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Jessica TaylorPA WireTheresa May was allowed to savour her triumph in the House of Commons on Tuesday for only a few hours before European leaders lined up to pour cold water over it.European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, chief negotiator Michel Barnier, French president Emmanuel Macron and Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz made public statements ruling out any renegotiation of the Brexit withdrawal agreement.In separate phone calls with the prime minister on Wednesday evening, Leo Varadkar and Donald Tusk told her that the MPs’ call to replace the backstop with alternative measures was unacceptable.When May asked the Taoiseach to negotiate directly with London about alternatives to the Northern Ireland backstop, he told her that Ireland would negotiate only through Barnier’s taskforce.Dublin is always alert to cracks in the European alliance of support for the backstop but few have appeared since Tuesday’s vote.Poland called for a more flexible approach towards Britain to avoid a hard Brexit but senior officials in London acknowledge privately that Warsaw’s endorsement carries little weight.Most EU governments are exasperated by May’s call for her MPs to vote against the agreement she signed off on last November.A few weeks ago, the prime minister was telling parliament that the agreement was not only the best deal but the only deal that would allow Britain to leave the EU in an orderly fashion.Now she was not only calling for the agreement to be reopened so that the backstop could be replaced with alternative measures but was indulging the wild fantasies of the so-called Malthouse compromise, a compendium of rejected and discredited proposals for how to keep the Border open.When May outlines her proposals to the EU next week, she is likely to call for a time limit or a unilateral exit mechanism for the backstop as well as alternative measures for the Border based on Brexiteer proposals for technological and administrative methods to minimise friction.The EU will almost certainly reject them and is unlikely to engage in any meaningful negotiations until after a series of votes in the House of Commons on February 14th.Last Tuesday, the prime minister promised MPs tempted to vote for an amendment to block a no-deal Brexit that they would have another chance to do so in a fortnight. The amendment, which would oblige the government to seek an extension to the article 50 negotiating period if no deal is approved by parliament by the end of February, did not pass. That could change when the amendment is next put to the vote on February 14th.After that, emboldened perhaps by a Commons vote shutting off the option of a no-deal Brexit, the EU could be more open to addressing Westminster’s difficulty with the backstop.Some officials in Brussels have long argued that giving Britain a unilateral exit mechanism from the backstop is a low-risk option because no rational government in London would exercise the option.Leaving the backstop unilaterally would mean abandoning any trade agreement with the EU, a move that would cause unconscionable damage to the British economy.The backstop has become toxic for some at Westminster but the EU is unwilling to cut Ireland adrift by abandoning it. One idea floating around the Berlaymont in recent days would extend the article 50 deadline not just for a few months but for two years to allow Britain to negotiate a free-trade agreement with the EU.The withdrawal agreement would not be abandoned but would be placed in a quiet corner while Britain and the EU negotiated their future economic relationship.Advocates of the proposal acknowledge that it creates problems for both sides but argue that most can be resolved. Instead of having European Parliament elections in May, Britain would appoint its MEPs. And EU lawyers would find a way around the fact that no trade deal can be negotiated legally until Britain is no longer a member state.Despite the genuine outrage in European capitals at May’s assault against her own agreement, she could still secure changes that could satisfy MPs.To have any chance of doing so, however, she must resist the temptation to appease her wilder backbenchers by proposing solutions for the Border that nobody takes seriously but themselves.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

offences rise following introduction 200 threshold","story":"Shoplifting rates have soared in recent years Shoplifting offences are on the rise following the introduction a £200 threshold before criminals are pursued.Figures obtained from 25 police forces across England and Wales suggest there has been at least a seven per cent increase in the number of offences reported by supermarkets over the past four years.Officers were called to investigate more than 78,000 shoplifting incidents in 2017, up from just over 72,000 in 2014.The figures also suggested a rise in the number of pick-pocketing incidents at supermarkets, where shoppers have their purses and wallets stolen by opportunistic thieves.But the true scale of the problem is thought to be hidden because many smaller stores do not bother to report shoplifting offences because they have no faith that anything will be done.Last year the  reported how retailers were angry at the introduction of a £200 threshold for shoplifting offences.Shoplifting costs the retail industry millions of pounds each yearMost hard pressed police forces will only now dispatch an officer to investigate if there has been a threat of violence against a member of staff.The £200 threshold was introduced as part of the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 and means anyone accused of low value shoplifting no longer has to attend court and can plead guilty by post in the same way as a speeding motorist.It was hoped the threshold would save the courts time and money on cases, but it is feared that it has led to the effective decriminalisation of shoplifting.Organised gangs of shoplifters are thought to be exploiting the system by travelling around the country and hitting multiple stores, while always remaining careful to stay under the £200 threshold.But the cost to the businesses is often passed onto shoppers in the form of rising prices.James Martin, crime and security adviser to the British Retail Consortium, said: These figures indicate that, despite the best efforts of our members, criminals are increasingly targeting supermarkets.Ultimately, the costs are borne by everyday shoppers and those who rely on retail for their livelihoods.We acknowledge the difficult resourcing and prioritisation decisions which police forces face, but it is clearly time that every police force gives retail crime the strategic priority it deserves.A £200 threshold was introduced on shoplifting offencesAssociation of Convenience Stores chief executive James Lowman said: “The numbers of reported thefts pale in comparison to the reality of retail crime. In total, we estimated over 950,000 incidents of theft in convenience stores last year.“In the convenience sector, more than half of thefts are now not reported due to frustration with police forces not investigating or prosecuting thieves. Some police forces have introduced arbitrary thresholds below which they no longer investigate thefts, ranging from £100 to £200. Adopting these thresholds effectively prices small stores out of receiving any response to thefts against them, and publicising these policies encourages more theft and gives the impression of these offences being decriminalised.   “Challenging offenders in store often leads to violent incidents which have a huge personal impact on retailers and shopworkers. Only Government action can break the cycle of more theft, violence, inadequate police response and ineffective sanctions.”John Apter, chairman of the Police Federation acknowledged that shoplifting was not a priority crime for stretched forces.He said: These figures mirror the increase seen in many other types of crime. And, although they may not be considered the most serious of offences, it is important those responsible are not allowed to do as they wish without the fear of being caught.The reality is that officers can be tied up, sometimes for hours dealing with shoplifters, preventing them from answering other 999 calls which may be more urgent. It\u0027s all about priorities.He went on: The sad fact is that as forces struggle to meet 999-call demand, incidents such as these are increasingly likely not to be attended by officers at all which, as a serving police constable with 26 years\u0027 service, I find quite shocking.New Brexit party has more than £1m in pledges and slate of over 200 candidates including Nigel FarageUK may not be able to buy new fleet of F-35 fighter jets unless black hole in Defence budget is plugged, MPs warnComment: We\u0026#39ve escaped a global recession – but only by the skin of our teethUK weather: Motorists abandon vehicles amid snow chaos on UK\u0026#39s coldest day for seven yearsNewborn baby abandoned in park amid freezing temperatures UK weather: 100 cars stuck on A30, as flights cancelled due to snowDuchess of Sussex \u0026#39exclaimed in dismay\u0026#39 after learning about lack of black professors at UK universitiesSmear results for 150,000 women left in backlog amid NHS failingsDefinition of treasure to be redefined to include artifacts worth more than £10,000 to stop items being lost, government announces All over 75s should be offered statins but \u0026#39ageism\u0026#39 is failing patientsCamping, review: Lena Dunham\u0026#39s remake fails to live up to Julia Davis\u0026#39s perfect originalGPs earning more than £150,000 will be named in new \u0026#39transparency drive\u0026#39 Fill your garden with Mediterranean plants to beat future droughts, new RHS guidance saysStopping Jack Shepherd\u0026#39s legal aid could see other criminals evade justice and flee country says David GaukeSajid Javid admits Brexit may be delayed as clock ticks for MayComment: If Theresa May is robust with Brussels now, she may finally be able to get Brexit rightITV cancel Rose and Fred West documentary hours before it was due to airPensioners cut risk of falling by almost a fifth if they take up Tai Chi, Oxford University study findsMale volunteers wanted to trial groundbreaking contraceptive gelAssaults on prison staff pass 10,000 in a year for first time as violence and self-harm hit record highInstagram failed to stop our daughter, 12, self-harming, say parents We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/28/18/facebook.jpg","title":"apple facebook iphone internal app enterprise developer","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

To get around that restriction, Facebook relied on a special exemption that is part of Apple\u0027s enterprise programme, allowing it to push apps onto phones without going through the App Store.Normally, that program is intended to allow companies to distribute internal builds of unreleased software. Facebook is able to load early versions of Instagram updates onto its own phones, for instance, allowing developers to ensure they work before they are pushed out into public.Created with Sketch.How to stop Facebook from revealing everything about you Show all 9Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.19 Lock your profile downIf you haven’t done this already, do it now.

Finally, less than 5 percent of the people who chose to participate in this market research program were teens. All of them with signed parental consent forms.Apple and Facebook have found themselves arguing over user privacy and the protection of personal data in recent months. Tim Cook criticised Facebook over its handling of the Cambridge Analytica crisis and suggested it was different because it chose not to make its customers its products – which Mark Zuckerberg said was extremely glib and did not represent how Facebook thinks about its customers.Despite those fallouts, Facebook and Apple rely heavily on each other. That arrangement is said to have led to problems in the past, with Apple unable to punish Facebook without threatening many of the biggest apps on its platform.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightNow, the events have been updated to match this greater sense of inclusivity. Ahrendts said, “I always say that the stores are Apple’s biggest product. I think that the architecture of the stores, that’s our hardware and what we do inside is the software. This is an updated software release of the in-store experience. We have over 50 new sessions. Altogether there are 18,000 sessions a week worldwide.”She went on to say that when the Apple Stores were created by Steve Jobs, that the staff were not there to sell. “You know, Steve built Apple Retail. And he told the teams when he hired them that they\u0027re not allowed to sell. He said they have no commission, no quotas. He told them, ‘Your job is to enrich their lives and you have to do it through the lens of education.’ He also said that Apple is the crossroads between liberal arts and technology. Well, we were brilliant in the stores at technology. But how do we unlock that liberal arts piece?”“Being a creative all my life, it\u0027s kind of a dream job for me to help communities be more creative,” Karl Heiselman, a former CEO of brand consultants Wolff Olins, explained. Apple employs staffers in its stores called Creative Pros, who are as heavily trained as the people in the Genius Bars. “We have 3,400 Creative Pros organised by passion or theme –\u0026nbspso photography, music, art and design, coding and app development. They go deep on each one of those, and these people are amazing. Some of them are Emmy winners, celebrated artists and musicians.”Ahrendts added:\u0026nbsp“If you’re a photographer and that’s your passion, we’ll help make you a better photographer, we’ll demo a lens for you. That whole experience of what you do with your iPhone, we want to give you a rich physical experience as well.” The Creative Pros were key to developing the new sessions.Heiselman also made clear that these people are not there just to talk at you. “The thing that defines Today at Apple is it’s not just sharing your story, everyone gets a hands-on. That participatory piece is very important. Because we always say you don\u0027t want to create a session which is like something you can do on the Internet. So maybe an illustrator might share their story and their work and then we hand out iPads and say it’s your turn. We try to, as much as we can, have the audience give it a go.”So, give it a go I did, at previews of the new schedule.New Apple handset to feature three cameras for 3D imagesThe world’s tech giants are about the feel the pinchApple blocks Facebook from installing its internal apps on iPhonesThere are three kinds of sessions in Today at Apple: Skills, Walks and Labs – though the basic sessions introducing customers to Apple products and the ones aimed at explaining accessibility features will continue as before.Skills are the sessions which focus on a particular feature, such as the one I attended on GarageBand, Apple’s deceptively complex music creation app: it looks simple from the outside but is extensive and feature-rich.\u0026nbspI’ve used it but hadn’t been aware of the seemingly endless range of drums available in it. As with all Today at Apple events, you don’t need to bring your own Apple product, or even own one. They’re supplied when you get there, including – to the relief of the other customers in the Apple Store – Beats headphones to keep my attempts at music private. The purpose of the session was pretty specific, to create a beat using the beat sequencer.There are three sections to each event, inspiration, participation and celebration. This means introducing the topic in enough detail to get people wanting to try it and then let them loose on doing it. The final section involved participants sharing their newly created beats. Of course, sharing what you’ve done is voluntary.The Walks events begin inside an Apple Store and then move outdoors. Photography walks have been a staple of Today at Apple for a while, often showing locals parts of their towns they’ve never really seen before. I went to an Art Walk using the amazingly detailed digital illustration app, Procreate. Armed with an iPad Pro, we strolled the area around the store taking photos of colours that took our eye, from a pale green leaf to an eye-searingly bright yellow fire hydrant. These colours were incorporated into the app’s palette and from there we were encouraged to create our own art. My effort, which a psychiatrist might call a cry for help, is below.Walks are the most popular type of session, Heiselman said.And then there are the Labs. These are the most indepth of the events, lasting up to 90 minutes. I tried out \u0027Video Lab: Small Screen Magic, co-created with Zach King\u0027,\u0026nbspwhich concentrated on how to use a jump-cut technique in Apple’s short video app, Clips. The huge video wall was the focus here, where a specially recorded video introduction\u0026nbspfrom King, a YouTube star known for his “digital sleight of hand” was screened.This screen, by the way, has become so central to these stores that the staff jokingly refer to them as being powered by “Wall OS”. And it’s a magnet: once the session started, scores of people who happened to be in the store stopped to hover and watch.The participation section here was particularly fun and the Apple Store was momentarily taken over by the simulation of vanishing and reappearing chairs while attendees performed precipitous prat falls. When edited together, the final cut movies were shown on the wall.All these sessions are free, with materials provided and no selling involved, though the Creative Pros are knowledgeable about the company’s products as well, so can advise you if you’re interested.\u0026nbspAnd those Pros are pretty remarkable. Ahrendts said they’d been training for months, and it shows. They are professional, unflappable and relaxed performers, eager to share their knowledge and their passion.When Apple’s iPhone sales have dipped, as revealed in the latest figures, it’s interesting to see a company make a considerable investment in staffing sessions like this.\u0026nbspBut it’s a cool way to tempt people through its doors.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

After months of speculation, Ben Affleck has officially stepped down from the role of Batman, having appeared\u0026nbspin both Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) and Justice League (2017).Although the two DC universe outings didn’t fare so well with critics, with Justice League turning out to be an all-out box office bomb, Affleck’s weary, cynical take on the Caped Crusader still had plenty of fans, meaning his successor won’t have such an easy time stepping into his shoes.As it stands, the character is set to return for Matt Reeves’s noir-tinged standalone The Batman, scheduled for release on 25 June, 2021.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialProducers now face a lengthy search to find DC’s new Bruce Wayne, with sources stating they’re on the lookout for a younger star – although how much younger is unclear. Affleck is 46, so it seems, at this point, anyone in the 20s and 30s is fair game.With that in mind, we’ve chosen seven actors that could fit the bill, and including that all-important trait of a powerful chin.Created with Sketch.7 actors who could star in the new Batman film Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The 32-year-old actor is so perfect for the role of the suave and brooding billionaire that he’s already had the honour of being cast as Batman. Unfortunately, that was back in 2008 when George Miller was set to direct Justice League: Mortal, where he would have been joined by the likes of Adam Brody’s The Flash, Common’s Green Lantern, and Megan Gale’s Wonder Woman. After development went south, the project was indefinitely shelved and the studio instead focused on Christopher Nolan’s Batman trilogy. This could be the opportunity to finally make some lost dreams come true. Isaac has already had one rather ill-fated venture in the world of comic books, when he was truly wasted under mountains of blue prosthetics as X-Men: Apocalypse’s chief villain. Batman is a far better fit for the star his role as Poe Dameron in the Star Wars franchise has proven he’s certainly got the charm and it could help loosen up the character a little, recapturing some of the more cavalier attitude that Michael Keaton brought to the role. Yet, his work in critically acclaimed indies like Inside Llewyn Davis and Annihilation proves he’s also got the presence to continue Affleck’s more jaded take. In short, he’s got the range. At 39 years old, Isaac might be too old for the character producers are currently envisioning, but he’s a big enough household name that Warner Bros might overlook it in this case. Sheridan seems like the most likely candidate if Warner Bros are truly after a fresh-faced take on Batman. At 22, he’s the youngest on this list, but has already made his mark on the Hollywood blockbuster, fronting last year’s epic Ready Player One and starring as Cyclops in the current X-Men series. While Fox hasn’t officially declared that this year’s Dark Phoenix will be the last of the current iteration of the X-Men, with Disney’s takeover of the studio currently looming, it’s doubtful that the franchise has much of a future as it is. This frees up Sheridan to take on a far bigger, heftier comic book character. Plus, his breakout role in 2012’s Mud proved he excels when it comes to delivering gritty drama, which likely fits the tone Reeves is after for his film. Although there’s an impulse to look towards A-list stars when it comes to casting a character as iconic as the Caped Crusader, what DC might actually benefit the most from is an actor who’s not quite a household name yet, but still has the credentials to bring the right level of gravitas to the part. An actor like Rhodes would be perfect in this case. The 28-year-old still technically something of an up-and-comer, but his role in Moonlight proved he has a formidable screen presence, while Bird Box and The Predator showed he’s equally at home in genre fare. Rhodes is also particularly good finding vulnerability in his characters, which could prove to be a great strength if Reeves is after a weightier take on Batman, more in the vein of 2017’s Logan. The Batman has been pitched as a noir-flavoured take on the character, which could mean that producers are after an actor with a little bit of an Old Hollywood flair to him. If that’s the case, Golding fits the bill perfectly. His roles in last year’s Crazy Rich Asians and A Simple Favour showed that he\u0027s not only one of the hottest rising stars of the moment, but also has charm to spare in a way that could play well for a smooth-talking detective spin on Bruce Wayne. The only unknown factor here is whether the 31-year-old actor, who’s British-Malaysian, could nail the American accent, which he’s yet to do on film. It’s hard to imagine that would be much of a hurdle for him, however, as he’s already proven himself as a major talent.  The actor might be a little hesitant about returning to the world of comic book movies, considering he’s already starred in both Kick-Ass (the less said about its much maligned sequel, the better) and Avengers: Age of Ultron. Yet, neither of those films really gave the actor an opportunity to test his mettle as a box office champ, so an appearance in The Batman could be just what’s needed to boost his star power to the next level. What the 28-year-old actor really has in his corner, however, is range. Between the likes of Godzilla, Anna Karenina, and Nocturnal Animals, he’s demonstrated a chameleon-like ability to morph into whatever the project demands. It’d be exciting to see what exactly he’d do with Batman, considering the character’s been interpreted in so many different ways in the past. Despite Affleck’s departure, it does seem likely that Warner Bros won’t be keen to take Batman in too radical of a new direction. It might confuse audiences if we’re suddenly delivered with a sillier George Clooney-type (nevermind the fact Batman \u0026amp Robin crashed and burned) or, say, even an Adam West-esque iteration. We’ve been with a gritty Batman for too long for him to suddenly get the Thor: Ragnarok treatment. In that light, if the studio wants a direct successor to Affleck, then they can’t go wrong with O’Connell. The 28-year-old is a go-to if you want a leading man with the right level of edge and grit to him, thanks to his roles the likes of ‘71 and Starred Up. He’s yet to be really tempted into the world of franchises, outside of a role in 300: Rise of an Empire, which means he also doesn’t have the baggage of already being associated with a particular character.

Part of the experience was the need to change from one money into another. Now both the thrill and the nuisance have vanished.\u0026nbspA single currency prevails over most of the continent west of the old Iron Curtain with the notable exception of Norway.For some unthinking\u0026nbsppro-Europeans this has been a triumph. For Professor Ashoka Mody, distinguished US economics professor, who has held very senior positions at the IMF, it has at least been a profound mistake. Exchange rate changes enable countries with very different economic structures, histories and habits to trade peacefully with each other.\u0026nbspIf exchange rates remain stuck for whatever reason, disaster may await.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialEurotragedy by Ashoka Mody, reviewHelmut Kohl, who died only in 2017, believed\u0026nbspa single European currency was God’s gift to mankind. He frequently promoted expansionary monetary and fiscal policies which he knew were not in Germany’s interests but which he thought would be his legacy for Europe and mankind.Mody’s study takes us in more detail than most readers would want to know about the events leading up to and following the launch of the euro at the beginning of 1999. Meeting followed meeting and conference followed conference. During most of this time I was mainly concerned with the parochial problems of the British economy.\u0026nbspBut I did go to a notorious conference in Bonn at which the German minister Franz-Josef Strauss announced a devaluation of the French franc, only to have this rescinded from Paris within a few hours.Mody argues convincingly that the French economy was held back by the struggle to create and maintain the euro. But its misfortunes fade into insignificance compared with the experiences of Greece, which only joined the euro at the beginning of 2001. Despite its glorious history, Greece was now a small misgoverned Balkan state and was made to pay heavily for its decision. By 2017, Greek GDP was down by 25 per cent since the EU bailouts began and unemployment remained stuck at 20 per cent. Since then the Greek tragedy has worsened rather than improved.What lessons can we draw from two decades of the euro?What is the moral for the British reader? A tribute is in order for those who kept Britain out of the euro. The pound was devalued in 1947 and after a bitter internal wrangle in 1967.\u0026nbspBy the time the next run on the pound developed in the early 1980s the attempt to fix an official rate was abandoned and the British currency was mercifully allowed to float. There was a final attempt to fix a rate for the pound in the crisis of the early 1980s but since then market forces have partially prevailed and there has been no official rate for sterling, despite various attempts first to “shadow the D-mark” and later the euro.There are still many unanswered questions in the whole debate.\u0026nbspAs the late Canadian economist Harry Johnson once remarked, the discussion assumes that “a country is a country is a country”. It is not obvious why the French town of Strasbourg should be more clearly bound\u0026nbspto Paris than to Kehl on the other side of the Rhine.Meanwhile let us be thankful for small mercies and the lack of courage of successive British governments in not going the whole hog after the euro. It is far too early to provide the credits for this narrow escape. But we shall know soon enough – probably well before the 30-year rule allows the relevant documents to be published.Sir Samuel Brittan is a former economics editor of the Financial TimesOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This follows a subdued December, when price growth slowed to 0.5 per cent.“Indicators of housing market activity, such as the number of property transactions and the number of mortgages approved for house purchase, have remained broadly stable in recent months, but forward-looking indicators had suggested some softening was likely.Brexit uncertainty will push rents up faster than house prices by 2023The big Brexit forecast: what will happen to house prices in 2019?UK house prices growing at slowest pace in five years“In particular, measures of consumer confidence weakened in December and surveyors reported a further fall in new buyer inquiries towards the end of 2018.“While the number of properties coming on to the market also slowed, this doesn’t appear to have been enough to prevent a modest shift in the balance of demand and supply in favour of buyers in recent months.”Mr Gardner said the uncertain economy is likely to be acting as a drag on the housing market, despite strong\u0026nbspemployment figures,\u0026nbspwage growth and low interest rates.He continued: “Near-term prospects will be heavily dependent on how quickly this uncertainty lifts, but ultimately the outlook for the housing market and house prices will be determined by the performance of the wider economy – especially the labour market.Howard Archer, of the EY Item Club said: “If Brexit is delayed, ongoing uncertainty is likely to weigh down on the housing market and could well see house prices stagnate or fall slightly.”Samuel Tombs,\u0026nbsp chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: “The uncertainty created by Brexit largely is responsible for the further decline in year-over-year growth in house prices to near-zero, from a broadly stable rate of about 2 per cent\u0026nbspin the 18 months before November.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There is no compromise where the welfare of pupils is concerned.”They added: “Whilst we celebrate the good outcome for Steiner Academy Hereford, we are disappointed that six schools have been judged as inadequate and have taken immediate action to ensure that standards rapidly improve as per Ms Spielman’s recommendations.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Facebook development teams would do well to look at this precedent and prioritise user privacy,” Mr MacKey told\u0026nbspThe Independent.“With the integration project currently expected to take a year to complete, and with end-to-end encryption as part of the plan, we should expect the Facebook engineering teams to focus attention on uniform data security both in their platform and in the apps themselves.”In response to such privacy concerns, Facebook said in a statement: “We’re working on making more of our messaging products end-to-end encrypted and considering ways to make it easier to reach friends and family across networks. As you would expect, there is a lot of discussion and debate as we begin the long process of figuring out all the details of how this will work.”Ireland’s Data Protection Commission, which regulates the social network in the EU, has since called for an urgent briefing on the matter in order to assess the how the proposals will fit with GDPR rules.\u0026nbsp“Previous proposals to share data between Facebook companies have given rise to significant data protection concerns and the Irish DPC will be seeking early assurances that all such concerns will be fully taken into account by Facebook\u0026nbspin further developing this proposal,” the commission said in a statement.\u0026nbsp“It must be emphasised that ultimately the proposed integration can only occur in the EU if it is capable of meeting all of the requirements of the GDPR.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In the same year, the company\u0027s shares dropped 30 per cent.\u0026nbspJosie Cox\u0026nbspexplains how\u0026nbspit got there and where it\u0027s going nextClick to followThe IndependentApple Park, the new headquarters in Cupertino designed by Lord Norman Foster, cost roughly $5bn, and will house 13,000 employees when everyone has moved inFor an interview published in the\u0026nbspFinancial Times\u0026nbspback in 2006, journalist Richard Waters hauled himself to a nondescript corner of the Californian city of San Jose to meet with a corpulent computer scientist called Steve. As Richard walked into a vinyl-clad diner called The Hickory Pit, Steve sat –\u0026nbspbearded and burly – hunched over some sort of hand-held device, engrossed in a game of Tetris.The setting of the interview was unusual for the FT. The salmon pink daily is more widely known for its profiles of the buffed and manicured business elite, lounging in grand villas, chalets and penthouse pads, preferably in Davos or Cannes. But Steve – eating cherry pie in a washed-out T-shirt – had certainly earned his column inches: 30\u0026nbspyears earlier, together with another Steve and an electronics industry worker called Ronald, the Hickory Pit’s favourite tech geek created what would later become the world’s largest publicly traded company. For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialHis unremarkable appearance and the profoundly mundane setting of his encounter with the FT, convey a banality neatly reflected in the origins of the very firm he was instrumental in founding: An experimental three-man band (the original start-up, if you will) that took a crazy punt on a simple motherboard and now has more cash than the vast majority of countries.Apple was founded on 1 April 1976 by the late Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne in Cupertino. It wormed its way on to the tech scene with a creation named the Apple I, a computer designed and built by Tetris-loving Wozniak, and sold for the ominous sum of $666.66 – or about $2,900 in today’s inflation-adjusted money. Unremarkably, the name reportedly stems from Jobs’ fondness of the humble fruit.Less than a year later, the company was incorporated. Wayne had already jumped ship, having sold his stake in the group for the paltry sum of $800, but –\u0026nbspunhampered by the exit of a third of its staff –\u0026nbspApple’s operational revenues were heading north. According to media reports, they almost doubled every four months during the first five years of the company operating. Between September 1977 and the same month in 1980, sales increased by more than 500 per cent, on average annually.Apple’s mysterious new charger might be about to arriveThe Apple II and Apple III followed, and the company’s success grew with every launch. On 12 December 12 1980 it listed on the stock exchange, publicly floating around 4.6 million shares at $22 apiece. The offering turned scores of Apple’s early employees into instant millionaires. Shares in the company ended the day at $29 each, giving Jobs a net worth of well over $200 million. He was 25 at the time.In 1984, Apple launched the Macintosh. Its debut was marked with a high-budget neo-noir dystopian commercial, aired during that year’s Super Bowl and directed by Bladerunner’s Ridley Scott. The release was hailed a watershed moment not just for the tech world, but also for the advertising industry. Already then Apple was inventing itself as a generation-defining, industry straddling brand a firm that challenged the status quo and confronted the norm ruthlessly.Though Jobs and Wozniak both left the company in the mid-1980s amid disputes with management, predominantly over strategy, Apple’s success initially continued untarnished.In 1991 the company created the PowerBook, presenting a blueprint for all modern laptops. That same year it launched System 7, adding colour to the interface. But not all its products proved a hit. The company was struggling to tap into its client base and it was failing to gain traction with its strategy of marketing high-end products with a high price – dubbed the High-Right Policy – while simultaneously battling heavyweight rivals, like Microsoft, which in many cases were offering similar technology at a vastly smaller price.By 1997, marred by constant leadership change, an unclear approach to the market and a series of painful restructuring exercises, Apple was forced to choose between sticking to its poorly performing guns or risking a dramatic high-stakes turnaround. It chose the latter. It snapped up NeXT, – Jobs’ new venture – for $429 million and scrapped the High-Right Policy. Shortly after, it launched the iMac G3, an affordable machine with a quirky, futuristic look that jarred with Apple’s previous designs, but spoke to a new generation of tech-savvy, progressive professionals. The move proved a lifeline for the financially bruised group and catapulted it into a new era. Apple computers were no longer just the tools of businessmen and accountants, but the product of choice for students, designers and artists. It had won over the creative elite and would continue to claim there support for many years to come.Jobs, who had returned to Apple as an adviser in early 1997, assumed the position of interim CEO when Gilbert Frank Amelio, the company’s boss since February 1996, was pushed out for overseeing several quarters of lacklustre earnings. And it was at this time too that Jonathan Ive joined the upper echelons of management, injecting fresh energy into the brand and later designing the decade-defining iPod and iPad.\u0026nbspThe 2000s were a period of revival for Apple, which the company kicked off with a wild buying spree. It snapped up a portfolio of corporations, including a DVD authoring platform and a music software group. In May 2001, doors to its first retail stores opened and it debuted the iPod, of which more than 100 million were sold over the subsequent six years. The iTunes Store launched in 2003. Within just two years it was the world’s largest music retailer. The MacPro, MacBook, and MacBook Pro hit the market with resounding success, marking the dawn of Apple’s gradual shift away from computers and towards the future of portable consumer electronics.At the Macworld Expo on January 9 2007, Jobs announced the launch of the iPhone of which hundreds of thousands were sold within hours. A year later the App Store was introduced, allowing users to buy third-party applications for their devices and generating millions of dollars of revenue within its own right.\u0026nbspIn 2010, shortly after Jobs took his first medical leave of absence, Apple introduced the iPad which was met with massive demand globally, helping the company’s market capitalisation eclipse that of arch rival Microsoft for the first time in over two decades. The iPhone 4 was released in June of that year, offering a range of new features, including video calling, and sporting a now iconic stainless steel design. The iPod Nano, iPod Touch and iPod Shuffle were also relaunched and the MacBook Air was updated, powering Apple to the top of the list of the world’s most valuable consumer brands.In dire contrast to his professional success though, Jobs’ health was deteriorating. In January 2011 he announced to staff that he would be taking another period of leave of indefinite length, handing the reigns to chief operating officer Tim Cook.\u0026nbspIn August 2011 he officially resigned as CEO. He passed away in October in Palo Alto, succumbing to a rare and aggressive form of pancreatic cancer. Jobs was 56 years old.In many ways, Apple’s post-Jobs years were an era of superlatives. Thanks largely to the launch of the iPhone4S and iPhone 5, and later the iPad mini, Apple’s market value in 2012 soared to an unprecedented $624bn, beating the previous record set by Microsoft. It used that financial momentum to further its quest to ersify into newfangled fields like augmented reality and artificial intelligence. It also remained fiercely committed to design and in 2013 recruited the former CEO of Yves Saint Laurent, as well as former Burberry executive Angela Ahrendts to oversee its digital strategy.Why Apple plans to stop putting a number on iPhone salesApple boss says data is being ‘weaponised with military efficiency’Tim Cook responds after Apple becomes first trillion-dollar companyThe company became a staple on lists of the world’s most valuable, best-known and influential brands. By January 2016 a billion Apple devices were reported to be in active use around the world. It moved into smart home technology and ride-sharing, through its investment in Chinese Uber rival Didi Chuxing. It bought Shazam, a music recognition service, launched its own video unit and signed a content partnership with Oprah Winfrey. Several series are reportedly in development as well as a film. Elsewhere collaborations with Hermes and Nike spurred sales of the Apple Watch, and in October 2018 it launched the twelfth generation of the iPhone. Its slogan? “Brilliant. In every way”.In\u0026nbsp2018, Apple became the first company in history to have a market value in excess of $1 trillion, an amount greater than the gross domestic product of most countries in the world, including TurkeyIn late summer 2018, Apple became the first company in history to have a market value in excess of $1 trillion, an amount greater than the gross domestic product of most countries in the world, including Turkey, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia and Sweden.\u0026nbspEmployment hit more than\u0026nbsp90,000 and, according to some reports, the company has more readily deployable cash than the US Treasury. The combined wealth of the world’s 10\u0026nbsprichest people – a list that includes Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, financier Warren Buffett, and Facebook founder Mark Zuckergerg – doesn’t even come close to the size of Apple’s market capitalisation.The “too big to fail” economic theory prescribes that some organisations, particularly banks, are so large and influential, that their failure would be catastrophic for the broader economy. Apple is undoubtedly one of those organisations, and in the last few months of 2018 markets were offered a taste of what that could actually mean.Shares peaked around the launch of the latest iPhone, and started trending lower shortly thereafter. Between early October and the end of the year, Apple’s shares lost more than 30 per cent of their value, taking them to below $160 from a peak of over $230 just a week earlier, and dragging swathes of the broader stock market with them.Analysts said that investors were falling out of love with the name for a slew of reasons. Product sales were slowing and consumers were becoming more sensitive to prices amid fears of an impending economic downturn. After reporting a set of quarterly results on 1 November\u0026nbspthat reflected a weakening in crucial emerging markets, Apple’s shares fell by 7 per cent in a single day wiping an estimated $70 billion off the group’s value.Executives at the time said that they would stop providing quarterly updates for the number of iPhones, iPads and Mac computers sold, unnerving investors further. The cost of new products also spawned worries, with the average selling price of iPhones climbing to $793 during the final quarter of 2018.After reporting quarterly results that reflected a weakening in emerging markets, Apple’s shares fell by 7 per cent, wiping $70 billuon off the group’s value“Our worry is there must be a limit to Apple’s pricing power,” George Salmon, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, told Reuters at the time. “The group is now charging close to $800 per phone, and while that’s helping revenues climb despite flat sales volumes, one has to wonder how the strategy to shimmy up the price ladder fares in a downturn. If consumers start feeling the pinch, those price tags could put the punters off.”Analyst Chaim Siegel at Elazar Advisors told the agency that trade issues between China and the US are also threatening to throw a ner in the works if they make it hard for Apple to get the supplies it needs. “As for emerging markets slowing, that’s also contagion from China. Both trade war issues coming to reality,” he said.Elsewhere analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch slashed their recommendation on the stock to “neutral” from “buy”, explaining that they are “incrementally concerned that not all the weakness is captured in the near-term” and that there are likely to be “further negative estimate revisions” to Apple’s financials. Analysts at Goldman Sachs cut their share price target on the stock repeatedly.Others have shown concern about the company’s emphasis on its services business: ApplePay, Apple Music and the App store. Potential for growth is undoubtedly there, but the company has yet to share concrete plans about its strategy going forward and how it intends to keep growing.\u0026nbspNot helping the situation, Tim Cook in early January wrote a letter to shareholders in which he announced that Apple’s results for the quarter that ended on 29 December\u0026nbsp2018 were likely to be worse than previously anticipated. Cook cited the unforeseen “magnitude” of the economic slowdown in markets such as\u0026nbspChina. The profit warning was Apple’s first since 2002 and dealt a fresh hefty blow to the share price, as well as the performance of dozens of smaller suppliers and competitors whose fate is closely linked to that of Apple. It also sent shockwaves through broader financial markets, sending stocks – which are generally considered a fairly risky asset – sharply lower in most regions and driving demand for perceived safe havens, like gold and Japan’s yen. The sell-off was a dramatic reminder of the sheer scale of the Apple ecosystem. If Apple sneezes many parts of the financial system will most certainly catch a cold.Since then Apple shares have continued to trade sideways, keeping the company’s market capitalisation well below that psychologically significant $1\u0026nbsptrillion\u0026nbspmark and raising questions about how much more correcting still needs to be done, before – or if – the trajectory can turn.So what will 2019 hold for the company which is no longer quite the world’s largest (having\u0026nbsprelinquished that role to Microsoft and Amazon)? Opinions are ided. While many experts who have been tracking the stock for years predict this to be a turning point, others consider it more of a blip.“When we get into these situations where the current product may not be moving as well as investors expected, some get scared and then the fear compounds itself,” Jason Benowitz, a senior portfolio manager at Roosevelt Investors, told Bloomberg. “We’re not really too concerned. Some of this is probably just noise like it always is.”Also speaking to the news agency, Ross Gerber, co-founder of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth \u0026amp Investment Management, described the climate of fear around Apple as “absurd”. “It doesn’t make any sense. It’s a solid business even if it’s not going to grow as much as it did,” he said.Apple is still hugely profitable. It’s sitting on well over $200 billion of cash, and shares – despite their recent brutal tumble – have roughly doubled in the past five years. The omnipresence of Apple devices across the planet also suggests that if the company’s heyday really is over, then its decline would likely be glacial rather than sudden. It simply has too many dependents, both in the corporate world and the consumer world, to swiftly fizzle out.As for Wozniak, the smiley 68-year old with a penchant for pie and Tetris, is unperturbed the ultimate bull, in market parlance. In an interview with CNBC at the end of last year, he said that Jobs would be proud of what Apple had become. Speaking of rivals, like Samsung, Wozniak said that they don’t present a real threat. They’re not innovating, he explained. They’re simply creating “fun features”. Apple, meanwhile, is concentrating on innovations that “literally affect everything we do all the time in life”.If Wozniak is right, then Apple’s dominance is far from over. Technology famously knows no limits and it’s increasingly evident that consumer appetite hardly does either. We want lives that are interconnected, homes that are smarter than us, phones that manage our whole existence and privacy that is safeguarded unconditionally.Amid all this, the most serious challenge for Apple will be to keep up with contracting attention s.

That meant the scientists could take all of those different pieces of data – related to 700 different places in all – and combine them to understand the gravity on the surface.As the rover started to climb up a hill on the surface, the amount of gravity went up. But it did not go up as much as expected.The lower levels of Mount Sharp are surprisingly porous, says lead author Kevin Lewis of Johns Hopkins University. We know the bottom layers of the mountain were buried over time. That compacts them, making them denser. But this finding suggests they weren\u0027t buried by as much material as we thought.Scientists could use the findings to help understand where places like Mount Sharp came from, and how the Martian surface developed.There are still many questions about how Mount Sharp developed, but this paper adds an important piece to the puzzle, said Ashwin Vasavada, Curiosity\u0027s project scientist at NASA\u0027s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, which manages the mission.

That will help Apple\u0027s push into augmented reality, which has seen it release a range of tools to allow people to overlay virtual objects onto the real world.iPhone price to be reduced in many countries, Apple saysThe extra sensing capabilities could also improve traditional photos, allowing for images that capture better depth, according to the Bloomberg report.The technologies could be a trial run for Apple\u0027s plans for an augmented reality headset or glasses, which it has been repeatedly rumoured to be working on\u0026nbsp– and which the company has not explicitly denied.Apple\u0027s 2019 phone will also have a range of improvements to its camera technologies, according to the same report. They will include three cameras to allow for improved photo capabilities, which could allow for the phone to take a larger field of view, better zoom, and potentially allowing the phone to automatically improve photos or videos after they are taken.The 3D cameras were being worked on for this year\u0027s phones but were not ready in time, the Bloomberg report claimed. Instead, they will come to next year\u0027s line on the the 2020 version of the\u0026nbspiPhone XS Max, though they might not make it onto the upgraded versions of the XS and XR.As well as new camera technologies, Apple plans to improve the software used to take photos. That will include changes to the Live Photos feature – which captures video either side of a photo to allow people to see them in context – so that they take six seconds of video rather than three.The new phones will also have improved chips and an updated Face ID sensor so the phones unlock more quickly. Otherwise, they are expected to look largely similae to this year\u0027s models, with more dramatic changes coming in 2020.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

While experiencing visions of her daughter, who we learn died from cancer in her teens, Louise attempts to communicate with the race in a bid to discern the purpose of their visit.The twist: Louise deciphers the language, which gives her the ability to see into the future. What we thought were flashbacks are, in fact, flash-forwards – her daughter is yet to be born.The set-up: Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) falsely accuses the housekeeper’s son (James McAvoy) of raping her cousin when she becomes jealous of his relationship with her older sister (Keira Knightley). He’s sent to prison, but is eventually freed to enlist in World War II – and the audience is told that he eventually rekindled his romance with Cecilia and lived happily ever after.The twist: Only, they didn’t. We learn that this is another lie from an older Briony – both Robbie and Cecilia died in the war.The set-up: Having been hired by Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) to investigate her husband’s death, JJ Gittes (Jack Nicholson) discovers the existence of someone crucial to the case: Evelyn’s sister, Katherine. The twist: After being confronted by Gittes, Evelyn reveals that Katherine is also her daughter – and the result of being raped by her father when she was 15.The set-up: IRA member Fergus (Stephen Rea) promises to protect Dil (Jaye Davidson), the girlfriend of a soldier his group has imprisoned, and soon begins an unexpected relationship with her. The twist: Dil is transgender, and was born male. Fergus\u0027s love for her sees him take the fall for a shooting she commits.The set-up: Having awoken in a bathtub, and discovering he has telekinetic abilities, John Murdoch attempts to find the truth behind a dystopian world that’s inhabited by an evil group who can stop time and implant memories.The twist: His search for meaning sees him reach the end of the city. With nowhere left to go, he breaks through a wall and finds the city is actually an island floating through outer space.The set-up: Cop Frank Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) infiltrates the organisation of gang chief Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) at the same time that criminal Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) infiltrates the police force – and both soon suspect they have spies in their midst.The twist: Both end up dead. A shocking sequence sees Sullivan kill Costigan who believes he\u0027s got away with it. Sergeant Sean Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) sees to that in an equally as shocking climactic scene.The set-up: A woman named Christina is enlisted into murdering her husband by his mistress. However, once the deed is done, his body disappears.The twist: Her husband faked his death with the help of his mistress. The pair wanted to make Christina believe she committed the murder in an attempt to destroy her.The set-up: Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is trained by Obi Wan Kenobi and Jedi master Yoda to defeat the evil Darth Vader, leading to the showdown of all showdowns.The twist: Skywalker’s delivered a blow after making a pretty huge discovery: the villain is his father. Cue shock and awe.The set-up: The world of the film’s insomniac narrator (Edward Norton) collides with that of Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) as they start an underground club that permits ordinary people to have fistfights with one another.The twist: The narrator and Tyler are dissociated personalties – AKA they are the same person.The set-up: Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) flees after agreeing to participate in a twisted game that sees him – among other things – buried alive and contemplating suicide after accidentally murdering his brother. The twist: It really was just a game the entire time, set up by his brother who wasn\u0027t killed at all.The set-up: Rose (Allison Williams), a white woman, brings her black boyfriend Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) home to meet her family. Chris soon becomes convinced they bury a dark secret and attempts to convince his girlfriend they should leave. The twist: He’s not wrong – only Rose is in on the conspiracy. After uncovering photos of black men she’s had prior relationships with, Chris is abducted, realising that he’s been lured to her cult-like family who want to implant their loved ones’s brains into the body of younger black bodies.  The set-up: When Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) goes missing, her husband Nick (Ben Affleck) becomes the prime suspect behind her disappearance.The twist: Mid-way through the film, all becomes clear – Amy faked her abduction and spent months framing her husband in revenge for his extra-marital digressions.The set-up: Brothers Elias and Lukas (played by real-life siblings Elias and Lukas Schwarz) believe their mother to be an imposter after she returns home having had her face reconstructed due to a car crash. They take (rather disturbing) matters into their own hands. The twist: One of the twins actually died in the crash. The other, unable to accept his brother\u0027s death, has merely imagined him to be alive the whole time and exacts revenge, blaming their mother for his death.The set-up: As a convict awaits execution for several murders, 10 strangers find themselves stranded in a rainstorm at a remote Nevada hotel. Soon, they start getting killed off one by one.The twist: The strangers comprise the split personalities of the convict. The motel is a fabricated reality via which doctors are attempting to find out which one is causing his murderous tendencies. They zone in on limo driver Ed (John Cusack) without realising they\u0027ve selected the wrong one: the murderous personality is a nine-year-old kid named Timmy.The set-up: Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) must track down and stop a terrorist known as the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) who has launched a series of attacks on the world.The twist: He succeeds – but learns that the Mandarin is actually a British actor called Trevor Slattery who has been hired by the actual people responsible.  The set-up: Two contract killers are given a list of people to dispatch of. Their journey leads them to a cult ceremony where one of the men, Jay (Neil Maskell), must kill one final victim known as The Hunchback.The twist: The Hunchback is actually his imprisoned wife with their son strapped to her back. After he kills them, he is crowned by the cultists.The set-up: Leonard (Guy Pearce) is tracking down the man who raped and murdered his wife. However, his search is stunted by his short-term memory loss. Throughout the film, he tells the story of Sammy Jankis, a man who accidentally killed his diabetic wife she kept requesting more insulin as she didn\u0027t believe he had memory loss.The twist: The man responsible only raped his wife and Leonard killed him years ago – he just can\u0027t remember it. His wife\u0027s actual killer is... himself. His real name? Sammy Jankis.The set-up: A grizzled boxing trainer seeks atonement by helping Hilary Swank\u0027s underdog amateur boxer, Maggie, achieve her dream of becoming a professional.The twist: Mid-way through the film, Maggie breaks her neck after being sucker punched during a fight. What was a feel-good underdog story swiftly turns into a hard-hitting drama about euthanasia.The set-up: Helping several others dodge the monsters lurking in the mist, David Drayton (Thomas Jane) leads the escape from the supermarket they’ve been holed up in. They reach a car and drive away, but soon run out of gas and realise there’s no hope. David loads a gun and, as the camera cuts away, shoots the survivors, including his young son. The twist: As he’s gearing up to put the gun to his own head, shadowy figures roll toward him. He’s devastated to learn it’s actually the military who have combatted the mist creatures. He killed his son for no reason. Talk about awful timing.The set-up: Oh Dae-Su (Choi Min-sik) is kidnapped and held in captivity for 15 years. When he\u0027s finally released, he exacts revenge with the help of a young girl named Mi-Do (Kang Hye-jung) whom he falls in love with.The twist: The girl is actually his daughter. His captors orchestrated their meeting.The set-up: The plot centres on a couple who, after the death of their unborn child, adopt a mysterious nine-year-old girl named Esther (Isabelle Furhman) who starts displaying some disturbing behaviour. The twist: Esther is actually a 33-year old murderer who has a condition stunting her physical growth. The set-up: Nicole Kidman stars as Grace, a mother who tries to protect her two children from supernatural forces in their Victorian mansion.The twist: In a spin on the ghost story, it turns out it\u0027s Grace and her children who are the ghosts: she killed them – before turning the gun on herself – in despair over the presumed death of her husband in World War II.The set-up: The film tracks the rivalry of two magicians, Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman), who go to extreme lengths to outsmart one another, each pulling off tricks the other considers impossible.The twist: It emerges that Fallon, the bearded carer of Borden’s children, is actually his twin (he’s also played by Bale) while Angier’s technique is far more disturbing: each night, using Tesla’s technology, he sends his clone plummeting into a water tank.2437 Planet of the Apes (1968)The set-up: Three scientists wake up hundreds of years after being launched into space to discover they’ve landed on a planet where primates rule over humans, who are their prisoners.The twist: As Charlton Heston’s character escapes his cell, he eventually finds the Statue of Liberty protruding from sand. Turns out it’s not just any planet – it’s Earth.The set-up: A defence attorney (Richard Gere) has a strong belief that his stuttering altar boy client (Edward Norton) is not guilty of murdering an influential Catholic Archbishop. He\u0027s later found not guilty by reason of insanity after being diagnosed with multiple personality disorder.The twist: He faked the  disorder. The film\u0027s closing moments see him drop the stutter and reveal his guilt as his attorney looks on, disturbed.The set-up: What viewers initially think is a film about a theft committed by Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) turns out to be something far more darker. On the run, she arrives at a motel owned by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and is swiftly murdered by his mother.The twist: Only, it\u0027s not his mother – it’s Norman. He killed his mother years before and has since developed a split personality.The set-up: Having been chained up by the Jigsaw killer in a dilapidated bathroom – which has a corpse lying  in the middle of the room – photographer Adam (Leigh Whannell) overpowers and kills his captor. He rummages through his pockets, looking for the key that will unlock the chain around his leg, convinced the nightmare is finally over.The twist: Instead, he finds a cassette recorder that reveals his supposed captor was, in fact, another victim of the Jigsaw killer who was merely following his rules in order to obtain an antidote for a poison in his body. Cue a corpse in the middle of the room rising to reveal himself as the real Jigsaw killer. He was there the whole time.The set-up: David Mills (Brad Pitt) and retired PI William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) have closed in on serial killer, John Doe (Kevin Spacey), who has been using the seven deadly sins as inspiration for his murders.The twist: He has one final murder left to commit – only he’s already committed it. We discover Doe has killed Mills’s wife (Gwyneth Paltrow), which prompts him to complete Doe’s plan by murdering him out of wrath.The set-up: US Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner (Mark Ruffalo) arrive at a centre for the criminally insane to find an escaped killer who drowned her three children.The twist: Teddy is actually a patient, and his partner is his doctor. He killed his wife after she murdered their three children and the elaborate  ruse is an attempt to bring his repressed memories to the surface.The set-up: A young boy who can see dead people encounters a child psychologist named Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and attempts to discover the reason behind his disturbing ability.The twist: Crowe is, in fact, dead all along. He got killed during a robbery that we see in the film’s opening scene.The set-up: The introverted Angela (Felissa Rose) becomes terrified when a murderer wreaks destruction at the same campsite where her brother Peter was killed eight years before.The twist: Angela is the killer. She\u0027s also not Angela at all, but her presumed dead brother Peter, who was raised as a girl by her aunt following Angela\u0027s death.3237 The Skin I Live In (2011)The twist: The Vera we\u0027re seeing is not wis wife, but a young man whom Robert abducted and subjected to a vaginoplasty six years before.The set-up: Peter Parker (Tom Holland) takes a break from trying to stop the film\u0027s villain, the Vulture (Michael Keaton), to go to his school\u0027s Homecoming dance.

His life soon collides with comic book store owner Elijah (Samuel L Jackson), who has a rare bone disorder, and helps David discover he has the ability to see the criminal acts of those he comes into contact with.

All is going well until the kids become somewhat weirded out by their strange behaviour.The twist: Their mother becomes disturbed when she sees her parents while Skyping her children - it’s not them. It emerges that these imposters are mental home patients who murdered the couple, and have now taken up residence in their house. The twist: The girl was never missing – it was just an elaborate hoax to lure an out-of-towner so the island\u0027s residents could sacrifice him to their Sun God.The set-up: The services of linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) are called upon when aliens arrive on Earth. While experiencing visions of her daughter, who we learn died from cancer in her teens, Louise attempts to communicate with the race in a bid to discern the purpose of their visit.The twist: Louise deciphers the language, which gives her the ability to see into the future. What we thought were flashbacks are, in fact, flash-forwards – her daughter is yet to be born.The set-up: Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) falsely accuses the housekeeper’s son (James McAvoy) of raping her cousin when she becomes jealous of his relationship with her older sister (Keira Knightley). He’s sent to prison, but is eventually freed to enlist in World War II – and the audience is told that he eventually rekindled his romance with Cecilia and lived happily ever after.The twist: Only, they didn’t.

The twist: After being confronted by Gittes, Evelyn reveals that Katherine is also her daughter – and the result of being raped by her father when she was 15.The set-up: IRA member Fergus (Stephen Rea) promises to protect Dil (Jaye Davidson), the girlfriend of a soldier his group has imprisoned, and soon begins an unexpected relationship with her.

A shocking sequence sees Sullivan kill Costigan who believes he\u0027s got away with it. Sergeant Sean Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) sees to that in an equally as shocking climactic scene.The set-up: A woman named Christina is enlisted into murdering her husband by his mistress. However, once the deed is done, his body disappears.The twist: Her husband faked his death with the help of his mistress. The pair wanted to make Christina believe she committed the murder in an attempt to destroy her.The set-up: Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is trained by Obi Wan Kenobi and Jedi master Yoda to defeat the evil Darth Vader, leading to the showdown of all showdowns.The twist: Skywalker’s delivered a blow after making a pretty huge discovery: the villain is his father. Cue shock and awe.The set-up: The world of the film’s insomniac narrator (Edward Norton) collides with that of Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) as they start an underground club that permits ordinary people to have fistfights with one another.The twist: The narrator and Tyler are dissociated personalties – AKA they are the same person.The set-up: Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) flees after agreeing to participate in a twisted game that sees him – among other things – buried alive and contemplating suicide after accidentally murdering his brother. The twist: It really was just a game the entire time, set up by his brother who wasn\u0027t killed at all.The set-up: Rose (Allison Williams), a white woman, brings her black boyfriend Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) home to meet her family. Chris soon becomes convinced they bury a dark secret and attempts to convince his girlfriend they should leave. The twist: He’s not wrong – only Rose is in on the conspiracy. After uncovering photos of black men she’s had prior relationships with, Chris is abducted, realising that he’s been lured to her cult-like family who want to implant their loved ones’s brains into the body of younger black bodies.  The set-up: When Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) goes missing, her husband Nick (Ben Affleck) becomes the prime suspect behind her disappearance.The twist: Mid-way through the film, all becomes clear – Amy faked her abduction and spent months framing her husband in revenge for his extra-marital digressions.The set-up: Brothers Elias and Lukas (played by real-life siblings Elias and Lukas Schwarz) believe their mother to be an imposter after she returns home having had her face reconstructed due to a car crash. They take (rather disturbing) matters into their own hands. The twist: One of the twins actually died in the crash. The other, unable to accept his brother\u0027s death, has merely imagined him to be alive the whole time and exacts revenge, blaming their mother for his death.The set-up: As a convict awaits execution for several murders, 10 strangers find themselves stranded in a rainstorm at a remote Nevada hotel. Soon, they start getting killed off one by one.The twist: The strangers comprise the split personalities of the convict. The motel is a fabricated reality via which doctors are attempting to find out which one is causing his murderous tendencies. They zone in on limo driver Ed (John Cusack) without realising they\u0027ve selected the wrong one: the murderous personality is a nine-year-old kid named Timmy.The set-up: Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) must track down and stop a terrorist known as the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) who has launched a series of attacks on the world.The twist: He succeeds – but learns that the Mandarin is actually a British actor called Trevor Slattery who has been hired by the actual people responsible.  The set-up: Two contract killers are given a list of people to dispatch of. Their journey leads them to a cult ceremony where one of the men, Jay (Neil Maskell), must kill one final victim known as The Hunchback.The twist: The Hunchback is actually his imprisoned wife with their son strapped to her back. After he kills them, he is crowned by the cultists.The set-up: Leonard (Guy Pearce) is tracking down the man who raped and murdered his wife. However, his search is stunted by his short-term memory loss. Throughout the film, he tells the story of Sammy Jankis, a man who accidentally killed his diabetic wife she kept requesting more insulin as she didn\u0027t believe he had memory loss.The twist: The man responsible only raped his wife and Leonard killed him years ago – he just can\u0027t remember it. His wife\u0027s actual killer is... himself. His real name? Sammy Jankis.The set-up: A grizzled boxing trainer seeks atonement by helping Hilary Swank\u0027s underdog amateur boxer, Maggie, achieve her dream of becoming a professional.The twist: Mid-way through the film, Maggie breaks her neck after being sucker punched during a fight. What was a feel-good underdog story swiftly turns into a hard-hitting drama about euthanasia.The set-up: Helping several others dodge the monsters lurking in the mist, David Drayton (Thomas Jane) leads the escape from the supermarket they’ve been holed up in. They reach a car and drive away, but soon run out of gas and realise there’s no hope. David loads a gun and, as the camera cuts away, shoots the survivors, including his young son. The twist: As he’s gearing up to put the gun to his own head, shadowy figures roll toward him. He’s devastated to learn it’s actually the military who have combatted the mist creatures. He killed his son for no reason. Talk about awful timing.The set-up: Oh Dae-Su (Choi Min-sik) is kidnapped and held in captivity for 15 years. When he\u0027s finally released, he exacts revenge with the help of a young girl named Mi-Do (Kang Hye-jung) whom he falls in love with.The twist: The girl is actually his daughter. His captors orchestrated their meeting.The set-up: The plot centres on a couple who, after the death of their unborn child, adopt a mysterious nine-year-old girl named Esther (Isabelle Furhman) who starts displaying some disturbing behaviour. The twist: Esther is actually a 33-year old murderer who has a condition stunting her physical growth. The set-up: Nicole Kidman stars as Grace, a mother who tries to protect her two children from supernatural forces in their Victorian mansion.The twist: In a spin on the ghost story, it turns out it\u0027s Grace and her children who are the ghosts: she killed them – before turning the gun on herself – in despair over the presumed death of her husband in World War II.The set-up: The film tracks the rivalry of two magicians, Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman), who go to extreme lengths to outsmart one another, each pulling off tricks the other considers impossible.The twist: It emerges that Fallon, the bearded carer of Borden’s children, is actually his twin (he’s also played by Bale) while Angier’s technique is far more disturbing: each night, using Tesla’s technology, he sends his clone plummeting into a water tank.2437 Planet of the Apes (1968)The set-up: Three scientists wake up hundreds of years after being launched into space to discover they’ve landed on a planet where primates rule over humans, who are their prisoners.The twist: As Charlton Heston’s character escapes his cell, he eventually finds the Statue of Liberty protruding from sand. Turns out it’s not just any planet – it’s Earth.The set-up: A defence attorney (Richard Gere) has a strong belief that his stuttering altar boy client (Edward Norton) is not guilty of murdering an influential Catholic Archbishop. He\u0027s later found not guilty by reason of insanity after being diagnosed with multiple personality disorder.The twist: He faked the  disorder. The film\u0027s closing moments see him drop the stutter and reveal his guilt as his attorney looks on, disturbed.The set-up: What viewers initially think is a film about a theft committed by Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) turns out to be something far more darker. On the run, she arrives at a motel owned by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and is swiftly murdered by his mother.The twist: Only, it\u0027s not his mother – it’s Norman. He killed his mother years before and has since developed a split personality.The set-up: Having been chained up by the Jigsaw killer in a dilapidated bathroom – which has a corpse lying  in the middle of the room – photographer Adam (Leigh Whannell) overpowers and kills his captor. He rummages through his pockets, looking for the key that will unlock the chain around his leg, convinced the nightmare is finally over.The twist: Instead, he finds a cassette recorder that reveals his supposed captor was, in fact, another victim of the Jigsaw killer who was merely following his rules in order to obtain an antidote for a poison in his body. Cue a corpse in the middle of the room rising to reveal himself as the real Jigsaw killer. He was there the whole time.The set-up: David Mills (Brad Pitt) and retired PI William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) have closed in on serial killer, John Doe (Kevin Spacey), who has been using the seven deadly sins as inspiration for his murders.The twist: He has one final murder left to commit – only he’s already committed it.

Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers  – 2008No frills, just good old-fashioned rock and roll. Tom Petty’s performance is often omitted from rankings of the best Super Bowl halftime shows, but we’re including it here because he absolutely crushed it. Kicking things off with “American Girl”, he followed it up with “Won’t Back Down”, “Full Moon Fever” and the emotional “Free Fallin’”, rounding off with a stirring rendition of “Runnin’ Down a Dream”.U2 had the unenviable task of trying to raise everyone’s spirits just six months after the 911 attacks, but they did an admirable job, with performances of uplifting tracks like “Beautiful Day”.McCartney preceded the pop stars trying to outdo one another with extravagant stage designs and lavish costumes. Instead, he offered four beautifully played songs, of which the final one, “Hey Jude”, prompted an epic singalong with the crowd at Jacksonville’s EverBank Field Stadium.One of the few to outdo Katy Perry’s 2015 entrance was Madonna, three years earlier, who appeared on a giant golden chariot led by about a hundred buff men dressed as Roman soldiers. She brought out Nicki Minaj and MIA for “Give Me All Your Luvin’” and also performed hits “Like a Prayer”, “Music” and “Express Yourself”.There are few entrances as grand as standing on top of a giant golden lion with glowing eyes. Katy Perry went all out for her halftime show in 2015 with performances of “Roar”, “Dark Horse”, “California Gurls”, “Firework” and “Teenage Dream”. And who can forget the notorious Left Shark and his poor coordination?“Put the chicken fingers down and turn your television all the way up,” the Boss ordered. Springsteen’s 12-minute set started out with “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out” and also included “Born to Run”, “Glory Days” and “Working on a Dream”.710 Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake – 2004Janet Jackson delivered a blistering, brilliantly choreographed show that ended with “Rock Your Body”. But the moment Justin Timberlake ripped away her costume, and exposed her breast for approximately half a second, overshadowed all of that. The incident, dubbed “nipplegate”, even inspired the creation of YouTube. Jackson was turned into a scapegoat for the ensuing controversy, while Timberlake didn’t receive anywhere near as much scrutiny.One of the most outlandish halftime shows in recent memory, Lady Gaga began her performance by hurtling herself from the top of the stadium (attached to a harness, of course) – sparking a thousand memes. Once safely on the ground, she thrilled audiences with her biggest hits: “Poker Face”, “Born This Way”, “Telephone”, “Just Dance”, “Million Reasons” and “Bad Romance”.Beyonce basically ties with Prince for the greatest all-time Super Bowl performance. It was bold, it was fierce, it was virtually flawless. Bursting onto the stage with “Crazy in Love” after an a capella “Love on Top”, she threw down some of her best dance moves, before moving on to other hits including “End of Time” and “Baby Boy”. Lastly, there was a hysteria-inducing Destiny’s Child reunion with Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland – a performance so powerful, the lights at the stadium cut out when it ended.The greatest. Of course, the Purple One wasn’t responsible for the rain that began to pour during his hair-raising 12-minute performance, which included covers of “We Will Rock You” and “All Along the Watchtower”. But the timing was so perfect, you wanted to believe he was. Following renditions of “1999Baby I’m a Star”, Prince closed on “Purple Rain” in what has to be ranked among one of his greatest live performances of that song.110 Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers  – 2008No frills, just good old-fashioned rock and roll.

Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO242 The Wings of the Dove (1997)Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u0027s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HOYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history.

But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HO742 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PSWes Anderson\u0027s meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO942 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles – notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HOA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1542 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2742 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2842 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2942 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3342 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3442 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. Toy Story revolutionised animation Up and Wall-E vie for the best opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter’s head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure through the mind itself. What’s dazzling here is that two completely separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on a quest adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think and feel. It’s wonderful.Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called The Open Road – the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born Killers – Tony Scott\u0027s True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on the lam, chased by Christopher Walken\u0027s suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash – and totally brilliant. 142 Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)With this update and upgrade of the 1930s serial adventure, Steven Spielberg turns what could have been pastiche into a practically perfect film. Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores.

The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2742 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2842 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2942 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3342 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3442 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. Toy Story revolutionised animation Up and Wall-E vie for the best opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter’s head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure through the mind itself. What’s dazzling here is that two completely separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on a quest adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think and feel. It’s wonderful.Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called The Open Road – the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born Killers – Tony Scott\u0027s True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on the lam, chased by Christopher Walken\u0027s suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash – and totally brilliant. Hanks has voiced Woody in each of the four films.The rest of the voice cast of\u0026nbspToy Story 4\u0026nbspincludes Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear, Joan Cusack as Jessie, and Annie Potts as Bo Peep (returning to the franchise after an absence from\u0026nbspToy Story 3).Tony Hale, Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peel are joining as new characters, and actor Keanu Reeves has a small part in the movie.Allen has previously described the final scene of\u0026nbspToy Story 4\u0026nbspas highly emotional, telling\u0026nbspThe Talk\u0026nbsphe couldn\u0027t get through it at first.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But does one exist? Ben Chu looks at the evidenceClick to followThe IndependentIs the prime minister looking for something that isn’t actually there?Theresa May is returning to Brussels to try to renegotiate the European Union withdrawal agreement to make it acceptable to a majority of MPs in the House of Commons.But what will she ask for?On Tuesday night almost all of her party’s MPs and\u0026nbspa majority of the Commons voted in favour of an amendment put forward by the senior Tory backbencher Sir Graham Brady calling for the Irish backstop (the insurance clause that says the entire UK will remain in an EU customs union if there is no EU free trade deal struck that manages to avoid a hard border in Ireland) in the withdrawal agreement to be replaced with unspecified “alternative arrangements”.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialDowning Street’s logic is that, if the EU agrees\u0026nbspto this, the agreement she brings back will finally make it through the Commons.But what might these alternative arrangements be? Even if the EU was prepared to reopen the withdrawal agreement, do they really exist?How badly could Brexit disrupt farming exports from Northern Ireland?The “Malthouse Compromise”, a proposal put together by Tory MPs from both wings of the party, refers to a “protocol” to replace the backstop in a document put out last month called “A better deal”. This was written by Shanker Singham of the Institute of Economic Affairs, a think tank with opaque funding.This protocol offers various technological and procedural measures – including, among other things, customs checks away from the border and a new regime of regulatory equivalence between the UK and EU – which would supposedly eliminate any new frictions on the Irish border as a result of the UK leaving the EU customs union and single market.But how credible is it?Dr Katy Hayward of Queen’s University Belfast says its provisions for policing standards and preventing smuggling would not be secure.Sam Lowe of the Centre for European Reform agrees that the document is not\u0026nbspcredible in terms of policing.“Can you do it without physical infrastructure? Maybe. Can you do it without a significant uptick in ‘associated checks’? I don’t think so. Would it still constitute a border in many peoples’ minds and be disruptive? I think yes,” he says.In other words, if the Singham\u0026nbspplan is the only alternative to the Irish backstop that Theresa May can offer to Brussels her renegotiation effort looks likely to be short and unsuccessful.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

But if we are able to make progress sooner, then that might not be necessary.“We can’t know at this stage exactly which of those scenarios would happen.”There is\u0026nbspgrowing concern\u0026nbspamong ministers that there is not enough time to pass the necessary legislation before exit day,\u0026nbspamid reports that the February recess could be cancelled to give Ms May more time to win over the EU.Mr Hunt said a solution had “not been properly worked up” to replace the\u0026nbspIrish backstop – which aims to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland.\u0026nbspMPs backed a bid to\u0026nbspreplace it\u0026nbspwith “alternative arrangements” in a series of crunch votes on Tuesday.He said it was “difficult to know” if negotiations would run to the end of March, but added: “Whereas a week ago none of us really knew whether this was going to be possible, we are now in a situation where it clearly is possible.“There are lots and lots of hurdles –\u0026nbspno one is saying this isn’t going to be very challenging –\u0026nbspbut we do now have a consensus in parliament.“Providing we can do that, which I think we can, then I think there is a way through.”However his Austrian counterpart, Karin Kneissl, said it would be “very difficult” for the Brexit timeframe to be extended and warned that Britain could be heading for a no-deal exit.She said: “According to the Article 50 procedures, the deadline is 29 March,\u0026nbspso there is a time pressure because what couldn’t be reached by negotiation over the last years, it’s very difficult to imagine that there can be a tremendous breakthrough – a magic solution – in the next few days in order also to have this ratified in due time for the remaining EU members.”Created with Sketch.

It’s tiny and anonymous, but noticeable and affectingThree elements of the city: a flapping pigeon an austere grey tower block purchasable sexBank of England governor Mark Carney told MPs in September that a disorderly Brexit could cause house prices to plummet as much as 35 per cent amid spiralling interest rates and falling demand.Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist, said the housing market has improved slightly for buyers.He said: “Annual house price growth almost ground to a complete halt in January, with prices just 0.1 per cent\u0026nbsphigher than the same time last year. This follows a subdued December, when price growth slowed to 0.5 per cent.“Indicators of housing market activity, such as the number of property transactions and the number of mortgages approved for house purchase, have remained broadly stable in recent months, but forward-looking indicators had suggested some softening was likely.Brexit uncertainty will push rents up faster than house prices by 2023The big Brexit forecast: what will happen to house prices in 2019?UK house prices growing at slowest pace in five years“In particular, measures of consumer confidence weakened in December and surveyors reported a further fall in new buyer inquiries towards the end of 2018.“While the number of properties coming on to the market also slowed, this doesn’t appear to have been enough to prevent a modest shift in the balance of demand and supply in favour of buyers in recent months.”Mr Gardner said the uncertain economy is likely to be acting as a drag on the housing market, despite strong\u0026nbspemployment figures,\u0026nbspwage growth and low interest rates.He continued: “Near-term prospects will be heavily dependent on how quickly this uncertainty lifts, but ultimately the outlook for the housing market and house prices will be determined by the performance of the wider economy – especially the labour market.Howard Archer, of the EY Item Club said: “If Brexit is delayed, ongoing uncertainty is likely to weigh down on the housing market and could well see house prices stagnate or fall slightly.”Samuel Tombs,\u0026nbsp chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: “The uncertainty created by Brexit largely is responsible for the further decline in year-over-year growth in house prices to near-zero, from a broadly stable rate of about 2 per cent\u0026nbspin the 18 months before November.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

looser arrangements so we are outside the single market and customs union but keeping close ties so cross-border trade is easy.Negotiations are ongoing under Article  of the Lisbon Treaty ahead of the

will result in a second referendum,  per cent the deal will pass and  per cent said a better deal could be negotiated.Mrs May is fighting back against opponents of her blueprint for Brexit, saying Parliament will have to choose between her proposal and crashing out of the European Union without a deal.It would mean scrapping a -month transition period lasting until the end of , and the exit

would be hurt by a clf edge Brexit as trade is held up by new border checks and tarfs and more red tape for businesses.Doom-monger Bank of England governor Mark Carney has warned house prices could crash by a third in a worst-case scenario.Customs checks on cross-Channel freight could cause havoc at ports, hitting food supplies and other goods such a motor parts.The Border Force is also planning for a possible No Deal Brexit as they fear there will be signicant outbound queues at the Eurostar and a degradation of border security, Sky News reported.In a pure No Deal Brexit scenario, businesses would lose their passporting rights, which allow them to sell their services across the EU without having to obtain licences in each inidual country.The  mile border between Northern Ireland and the Republic could become a hard border, according to the Eurocrats in Brussels.The EUs rules may require Ireland to impose customs and other checks to protect the bloc’s border – which some say would

data to undermine the British economy.I will simply wish him well in retirement at the earliest possible moment.Anna Soubry is a bit of a challenge too, but I will ­eventually find something nice to say.As for EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier, even Her ­Eurosceptic Majesty would find little common ground with the man who vowed to punish her United Kingdom for daring to leave.But it will be cult-like Remainers who find it hardest to kiss and make up.Their hatred of Leavers has reached sectarian proportions.Astonishingly a poll found many would ban marriage outside the EU faith.Indeed, my

Along with the likes of megabucks Remainers Tony Blair, Peter Mandelson and PR guru Roland Rudd, he seems to think Brexiters are basically pond le.That theory should be buried forever after this weekend’s passionate plea from leading academic Sir Noel Malcolm for MPs to stop wrecking Brexit.Writing in the devoutly pro-EU Financial Times, this distinguished Fellow of All Souls, Oxford, spells out the essence of the Leave case: “Brexit is about sovereignty — and parliament must respect that.”“If the UK is now on the brink of a constitutional crisis,” he adds, “one major reason is that a signicant number of MPs still oppose any version of Brexit, and seek a second ­referendum solely for the sake of reversing the decision of the last one.”Sir Noel does not believe people voted Out because they were racist.“The most important reason was democracy,” he says.“They wanted to live under laws made by the people they elected. Immigration came second.What they objected to was a supranational government ­making some of their laws and lting all immigration controls on the inhabitants of  other countries.”Another Remainer fiction is that Brexiters are narrow-minded Little Englanders.Yet the Daily Mail found space for a German view that Brussels should stop “insulting Britain” and honour us as champions of peace in Europe.“Such blinkered and sour responses are wrong-headed,” says Alexander von Schoenburg, a senior editor of Germany’s biggest newspaper, Bild.“They ignore the great debt Germany and the whole ­Continent owes our friends across the Channel.“We must always remember that throughout your history, independence and sovereignty have been paramount.“Germany in particular should tread lightly when it comes to dealing with your proud nation. It was Great Britain that first stood up to Hitler in .And it was Britain that opened its doors to thousands of ­Jewish refugees fleeing certain death during the Holocaust.“Put simply, there would be no free Europe without you and the bloody sacrice you made to rescue the Continent.”This remarkable tribute ­follows a recent love letter to the UK from Germany’s next Chancellor calling for a friendly Brexit orce and an end to bitterness.It is now clear hardline Remainers have over-reached themselves. The worm has turned.Talk of a second referendum is dead and voters are on the warpath against MPs plotting to scupper Brexit in tomorrow’s Commons showdown.Brussels is in chaos over the Northern Ireland backstop.Michel Barnier has started muttering about new tech- nology to police post-Brexit ­frontiers — a UK idea initially dismissed as “magical thinking”.EU allies are breaking ranks to demand a decent deal — for their sake as much as ours.It is way past time now for Theresa May to scrap the backstop and tell Brussels exactly what she needs to get her deal through Parliament.“There is absolutely no truth in speculation that ­passengers are being advised not to book,” stormed Brittany Ferries as it announced plans to INCREASE services.Meanwhile, mischief-making aviation giant Airbus admits it was asked by Downing Street to warn – incredibly – that it would shut up shopBritain left without a deal.Project Fear is shameless.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We are useless. Have a trophy.”And it’s a depressing cycle that will continue for as long as there are National Television Awards, live from The O.A ceremony where the categories may chop and change every year, but the stupidity remains ritualised.As well as getting all the usual winners though, viewers also had to endure a technical nightmare on Tuesday, where things went wrong — from the shambolic opening scenes right through to the unedited version of the closing credits: “With thanks to — Television Centre White City or just Television Centretoo long.”It’s always a case of fine margins, of course, at the NTAs, and the evening might have strayed into so-bad-it’s-good territorythe cameras had just focused on one of the Love Island gang when host Dermot O’Leary said: “Danny DeVito will be in Dumbo next year.”They didn’t, though. So a night bedevilled by sound issues, rotten acceptance speeches and foul Danny Dyer language was crowned by Special Recognition winner David Dimbleby eulogising the BBC and ordering us to be nicer to politicians, in a speech that could hardly be descri- bed as “mood capturing”.It’s the awards themselves though, that I know get viewers’ goats the most, starting, painful as it is to admit, with the fact perennial winners This Morning absolutely robbed Piers Morgan’s Good Morning Britain operation in the Daytime category.Given that Jack Whitehall’s Travels With My Father managed to scrape on to the Comedy shortlist, there’s also an argument that says Chunk, Charlotte Hawkins, Richard Arnold and Susanna Reid — who was styled quite magnicently on the night as Waitrose’s answer to Vicky Pattison — should have made that final five as well.Because almost no show made me laugh as loud or as regularly as Good Morning Britain did in .A glaring omission too in the TV Judge section — always won by David Walliams — which included X Factor’s Robbie Williams on the shortlist, but not Craig Revel Horwood, who didn’t take a two-week sabbatical in the middle of Strictly, cost the BBC £million or throw in his other half as part of the deal.The award that made a nonsense of the whole occasion though was Ant  Dec winning Best Presenters for the th time in a row, despite the presence of Bradley Walsh and Graham Norton on the shortlist, and the fact Ant spent far more weeks in rehab than he did in a TV studio.The mutual affection is touching in one way, of course, but it ultimately does neither them nor the NTAs any good at all and has robbed both of a glorious moment of redemption when they win the  award.Before that foregone conclusion takes place, please stay tuned to This Morning and sit tight until mid-March, when Dr Chris will be along with part II of his bottom-wiping masterclass: Flushing, FLU-SHING.Practially the only programme I watched at the weekend that wasn’t punctuated by uncontrollable sobbing fits from the participants was BBC’s landmark Holocaust documentary The Last Survivors.Men and women who are all in their late eighties and nineties now and understand that time is precious.When you’re a living part of history you also know facts are far more precious than tears.So in the words of the remarkable Anita Lasker-Wallfisch, who avoided the Auschwitz gas chamber purely because she could play the cello: “I won’t give people the pleasure of seeing my emotions.”The very least we owe all of them is an audience. The Last Survivors is available on the BBC iPlayer and will probably be the most unforgettable  minutes of television you’ll watch all year.At approximately : hours, Sunday, Gemma Collins stumbled over while Dancing On Ice.The tectonic plates groaned a little on impact, the front row scattered like ten pins and there was a surge on the national grid as several million viewers went “click, rewind, play,” then “click, rewind, play,” again.In fact, by the time I’d stopped rewinding and playing, Gemma had “bounced back,”and Piers Morgan, no doubt angling for a Le Stories interview, had claimed it was “the gutsiest thing I’ve seen on a talent show” – probably since the days Piers himself was wedged in behind the judges’ desk on Britain’s Got Talent.It was an undeniably great television moment, though.A proper face plant, with a full Klinsmann snow plough to finish.The downside, obviously, is that it’s guaranteed she’ll be back next week, when Melody, Wes, James and the others will be performing to a Fairytale theme and Gemma will be clearing the B Fettercairn to Banchory road,ITV want to find a proper use for her.Click, rewind, play.Things remain cheerful as hell on EastEnders.Alfie Moon’s car has been discovered near some clfs and a policeman has the job of breaking the most awful news imaginable to Kat and the Slaters.“Considering the location and the evidence at hand, we would suggest you prepare yourself for the worst.”Big Mo: “You understand what they’re saying ”Yes, bloody Redwater’s getting a second series.

But she also says Britain will not leave the EU without a deal.And her deal — the only one on the table at this late stage — was defeated in the House of Commons by a record majority just two weeks ago.Tonight’s Brexit votes are not quite the final shoot-out between the dferent factions in Parliament. The Government has promised that MPs will vote soon on a new plan.Remainers and soft Brexit supporters in government are pushing to hold that vote as soon as possible.And MPs — backed by a Speaker who will rewrite any Commons rules to soften or stop Brexit — will force more votes on what happens next.Nevertheless, tonight’s votes do matter.One proposal comes from Yvette Cooper, a Labour MP.Her Yorkshire constituents voted to leave the EU by more than two to one and, during the election, she promised them she would “not vote to block Brexit.”Yet that is what her plan does:     MPs vote for her   amendment, they will be able to stop Brexit happening this year.Cooper has the support of several rebel Tories, soJeremy Corbyn whips his MPs to vote for it, she stands a good chance of getting her way.Caroline Spelman and Jack Dromey, Conservative and Labour, have an amendment that calls on the Government to avoid a no-deal Brexit.Dominic Grieve wants MPs to control the Commons timetable, allowing Parliament to vote on dferent ways of watering Brexit down.Labour want to present MPs with options that include, predictably, a second referendum.Despite drafting a manesto saying “Labour accepts the referendum result”, the Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer says in a second referendum he would campaign to overturn the result of the first.It is possible that none of these amendments might pass.Remainers and soft Brexiteers are ided about what should happen.Some want to delay Brexit, some want to tie us to European rules and regulations, and others want another referendum to stop it altogether.Evenno proposal wins a Commons majority, the votes cast by MPs will probably demonstrate that there is a majority to water down Brexit one way or another.For Brexit supporters, this is very dangerous indeed.Some believe they simply need to run down the clock and, in  days, we can leave without a deal.For Leavers who want a negotiated departure, this feels like a serious risk.But Leavers who favour no deal need to ask themselves, can they really be so sure they will get what they want With several Cabinet ministers, many more junior ministers and a Commons majority against no deal, it seems increasingly likely that MPs will ultimately find a way of stopping no deal.When they do, Brexit will only get softer and softer.This is why the amendment proposed by Graham Brady, a senior Conservative, is so important.His idea is to approve the Prime Minister’s original Brexit deal, but with the “backstop” removed.The backstop is hated by unionists, because to prevent barriers to trade between Ireland and Northern Ireland, it creates new barriers to trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.And it is hated by Leavers, because it ties the UK to the EU’s customs union, and Northern Ireland to EU single market rules.Brady wants MPs to vote simply for “alternative arrangements” to the backstop.By avoiding a specic proposal, he hopes the amendment can win a Commons majority and, in doing so, demonstrate to Brussels that the deal they struck with Theresa May can be ratied — but only without the backstop.Critics, largely Remainers, say this is impossible.But in the past week or so, Angela Merkel has questioned whether the backstop is such a good idea after all.The Polish foreign minister has suggested it should expire after five years. And the European Commission effectively conceded that in the event of no deal, they would use policy and technology to prevent a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.In other words, they proposed solutions they once dismissed as “unicorns” and “magical thinking” when they were suggested by the British — and which could render the backstop unnecessary.But this is not all. Some European officials have floated, in private, a more inventive solution: that the UK and Ireland should form a British Isles customs zone, with Britain compensating Ireland for any new friction in their trade with Europe.So it is clear: whatever Remainers claim, alternatives to the backstop are technically and politically feasible.Recognising this, the Brady amendment would give the Government one last chance to negotiate something better.Yet Tory Brexiteers say they might not vote for it. They fear the ambiguity of “alternative arrangements” could allow ministers to negotiate an even worse deal, perhaps tying the whole of the UK to the EU’s customs union and single market rules for good.They do not trust May, her advisers, or most of her Cabinet and demand a specic time limit on the backstop.Butthey vote down the Brady amendment, they will not get what they want, and are more likely to get what they fear.As the clock ticks on and bottoms get even squeakier, MPs will coalesce around a plan to stop a no-deal Brexit.The EU will have no reason to compromise, and Parliament will soften our departure by aligning us with more and more European laws.If Leavers vote against Brady, they will be shooting themselves not in one foot, and not even in both feet, but in the head.As the Commons debates the proposals today, Leavers need to start compromising with reality. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Both are powered by an inexorable sense of self-righteousness. And both have an awful lot of experience of saying sorry.The most recent example came when Sir Nick appeared on the BBC in the wake of the furore over the death of -year-old Molly Russell.It turned out, after she was found dead in her bedroom in December , that she had been viewing material online relating to depression, self-harm and suicide — material which was shockingly easy to find.As her father Ian Russell put it bluntly: “Instagram helped kill my daughter.”Sir Nick, to his credit, said all the right things about how the firm was determined to do more. But he also made the striking claim that it is sometimes better for Facebook and Instagram to keep suicide images online, because it helps other vulnerable young people get support.This after The Sun, on Saturday, found and flagged up multiple images appearing to normalise and even romanticise suicide, all within a few clicks. Many remained published for days, and a Facebook spokesman claimed they could be beneficial to users battling mental health issues.Sir Nick says the firm is following the advice from leading experts and charities. And it may well be doing the right thing. But this is the latest example of Facebook — and other social media giants in general — only acting to tackle a problem once it becomes impossible not to.Over the past decade, social media has come to dominate our lives. The latest research from Ofcom shows internet use rocketing among children and teenagers, with friendships and social lives increasingly run through screens and phones.And it is now clear that this great move online has been accompanied, for our children, by a staggering increase in mental health problems.The situation is particularly alarming when it comes to young women. The latest NHS data found that one in four of those aged  to  report having a mental health disorder — twice the rate among boys.In  alone, one in five US girls aged between  and  suffered a major depressive episode — one in five! Suicide rates for teenage girls, according to academic Jonathan Haidt, have risen by  per cent in the US and  per cent in the UK in a decade.This isn’t just about what happens on the internet. Those having problems online often tend to be experiencing problems offline too, such as bullying, harassment or broken families.More broadly, Haidt believes the “snowflake” phenomenon reflects that “helicopter parenting” leaves children less prepared to cope with shocks and dficulty. But the internet, and social media, are very clearly intensying those problems. And the big tech firms are still playing catch-up.The traditional argument from Silicon Valley is that it’s not their job to regulate human behaviour. They add that eventhey wanted to, there is simply too much out there.They are doing their best to crack down on inappropriate content, but it’s like trying to stem the tide. Behind the scenes — they insist — thousands of people are working day and night to detect and delete messages promoting terrorism, hatred, Holocaust denial and self-harm.But this argument just doesn’t wash. It’s very clear that, in the interests of their bottom lines, many of the big social media firms have long failed to put enough resources into detecting damaging content.Researchers have shown, for example, how following the recommended links from reputable YouTube content can lead to a carnival of horrors. News reports that segue into crackpot conspiracy theories and videos for toddlers that give way to horrendous scenes of a bloodied Minnie Mouse trapped in an escalator.Every day brings new horror stories, such as rival fans of royals Kate and Meghan using the Kensington Palace Instagram to send death threats to each other. Increasingly, online hate is triggering real-le violence. The slaughter of the Rohingya Muslims in Burma was, The New York Times said, “a genocide incited on Facebook”.Part of the reason that Zuckerberg has hired Clegg is to put his house in order. Clegg has talked the right talk about changing Facebook’s culture, and in particular doing more to tackle self-harm.He even says they might start paying more tax. ButZuckerberg’s answer to “how to fix the internet” is “hire Nick Clegg”, we have still got an awfully long way to go.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was ­particularly silly to discuss Ireland before the main trade talks, since the obvious way to prevent a hard border on the island is through a deep and ­comprehensive trade agreement between the UK and the EU as a whole.That, though, would have given Ireland a strong incentive to get the best possible terms for the UK, and for itself.So instead, at the end of , the EU suddenly came up with the idea of an “Irish backstop”.It wanted Britain to promise that, unless it came up with a long-term ­trading ­relationship that satisfied ­Brussels, it would stay in the customs union and leave Northern Ireland under EU regulations.Stupidly, British negotiators accepted the backstop. Wisely, our MPs did not.The backstop would mean Brussels continued to control Britain’s trade deals with non-European countries after we left.It would mean placing part of our country under permanent EU jurisdiction.MPs threw the deal out. Then something sensible happened.Leavers and Remainers began to talk directly to each other and hammered out a deal that both sides could live with.There were lots of aspects of the ­withdrawal agreement that Eurosceptics resented.They didn’t like being non- voting members for another  months.They didn’t like Euro judges continuing to rule here even after we had left.They didn’t like forking out more than billion quid in exchange for the better part of bugger all.But they were ready to make ­compromises. If the Irish ­backstop were removed, they’d swallow the rest of the withdrawal terms.On Tuesday, the House of Commons adopted this position. The EU responded with a theatrical snort of indignation.“We stand by the agreement that we have negotiated,” said Michel Barnier, the European Commission’s negotiator.“The withdrawal agreement is not ­renegotiable,” said Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission.But hang on. Juncker is simultaneously telling us thatwe alter our red lines — by, for example, agreeing to a ­permanent customs union — then the agreement could indeed be reopened.So there is plainly no technical or legal reason why the backstop could not be removed or at least time-limited.Nor, by the way, is anyone still ­pretending that, without the backstop, there will be checkpoints in Londonderry and Crossmaglen.The Irish government has confirmed that,there is no deal, it will not place any infrastructure at the border.The British Government has been saying the same all along.Barnier says there would be ways to carry out necessary checks away from the frontier.In other words, the whole row is about a border that no one is going to build anyway.It’s ­surreal. There is plainly no way the House of Commons is going to accept the backstop.It also became clear on ­Tuesday there is no majority for a ­second ­referendum, because the last thing Jeremy Corbyn wants is to have to come down on one side or the other.That leaves only two options. Either the backstop is dropped but everything  is agreed, or the backstop is lost and so is everything .From the EU’s point of view, it must surely be preferable to agree the bulk of the Withdrawal Agreement, including reciprocal citizens’ rights and the ­£billion payment, while finding an alternative way to guarantee the Irish border stays open.From Dublin’s point of view, the logic is even stronger.Insisting on the backstop risks,not a hard border, certainly more dislocation between the Republic of Ireland and the UK — the very thing the backstop is ­supposed to prevent.The EU has calculated the cost will be worse for Britain than for ­Continental states, since cross-Channel trade is ­proportionately more important for us.But, by that measure, it is more ­important still for Ireland.In private, some Continental politicians are pushing for a pragmatic outcome — one that minimises disruption and ­preserves the long-term alliance between the UK and its neighbours.You especially hear these arguments in countries that trade heavily with Britain, such as Denmark and the Netherlands.You also hear them from governments that want to ensure the rights of their citizens in Britain are guaranteed.But for Eurocrats, in particular the anti-British Martin Selmayr who has seized control of negotiations, this isn’t about finding an outcome that works.If it were, the EU could have signed a continuity deal with Britain easily.The truth is many Euro-fanatics are happy to inflict pain on the EU  ­provided they inflict even more on us.If their view prevails over that of the pragmatists, then Britain has no option but to leave without an agreement. It is never sensible to give into blackmail.If the choice is between No Deal and surrendering part of our country, we will choose No Deal.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The people who can’t get beds in our hospitals, or a place for their kids in the local school. All the while that £billion is being spent on fabulously berserk ­projects in the developing world.To her total credit, Mordaunt has said that our current level of spending on overseas aid is unsustainable. It’s been rising every year. Due to a law passed by the coalition government, we have to spend . per cent of our income on aid to the Third World each year.So right now we spend just under £billion. And where does this money go  No less than  per cent of it is siphoned off to global outfits like that most useless of organisations, the United Nations.This is the body which sent out some dimbo Australian envoy to tick off our Government about economic policy. An organisation which elected Saudi Arabia on to its Women’s Rights Commission. An anti-Western and rabidly anti-Israeli convocation of leftie Third World thugs with chips on their shoulders.The world would be enormously improvedthe UN was shut down tomorrow. And the rest of it  Some of the stuff you wouldn’t believe. A total of £, went to a project investigating Tibetan verbs. Nope, not kidding.I would assume that “climb” was one of the verbs they were investigating. They use that a lot, over there. Thanks to our overseas aid, someone, ­somewhere is now able to say in Tibetan: “F*** me, is that a yeti  Run away!”Then there’s the £, spent on a scheme to stop Indian schoolchildren imbibing sugary drinks. India itself gives overseas aid and has an income rather bigger than our own. Where is the point Another six-figure sum was spent ­persuading Chinese people not to smoke too much — China! The second richest country in the world.Another one was to help Indian workers cool their work­stations down — this in a country which has its own space programme, for Chrissakes. So much of our money is swallowed up by useless leftie quangos and charities to keep themselves in jobs.Still more is pocketed by despots in the horrible countries they run. It is a source of corruption and dependency. It makes things worse. And when we tried to ert our overseas aid to some of the Caribbean countries stricken by hurricanes we were told we couldn’t — they were too rich!It’s a nonsense and a racket. If I thought our overseas aid, in its current form, really alleviated misery and suffering I’d be all for it. That’s why I agreed with the last secretary of state, Priti Patel, who wanted to give a decent chunk to the Israel Defence Forces, which saves a lot of lives in Syria.So my recommendation would be to end it all NOW. Divert the money into our beleaguered and creaking infrastructure. And when a tragedy occurs overseas — sure, splash the cash.Anyway, Penny — hope I’ve helped by starting the conversation. Over to you, babes.SCOTTISH politician Ross Greer has already been called a “ginger turd” by Piers Morgan, and I don’t think I can improve on that. But it’s his ignorance and stupidity that staggers – rather than his hatred for Great Britain, which is something we’re used to from north of the border.Greer described Winston Churchill as a white supremacist, a mass murderer and a racist, and likened him to Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. He says he is simply challenging the “myth” of Churchill. No, Ross, you’re not.You’re just pig ignorant, with a very poor grasp of history. Of course Churchill was racist. Just about everybody was of his age at that time.If you can’t see the importance of Churchill to winning the Second World War – against REAL racists, REAL mass murderers – when Britain stood alone, then you lack all sense of context and proportion.The more I think about it, the more I reckon “ginger turd” was an understatement.HERO of the week is the excellent Rachel Riley, who has been speaking out against anti-Semitism. As a consequence, she now needs greater security when she’s doing TV’s ­Countdown. The left-wing Jew-hating trolls have been after her.Rachel,  said: “The more I speak, the more abuse I get, and the more abuse I get, the more I speak. It’s got to the point where I can’t look at my Twitter feed any more. It’s just a constant stream.”She’s pretty clear who is behind it, too.  A lot of the abuse comes from people who sign off with the hashtag JCPM.SO, Labour MP Fiona Onasanya is off to prison. Found guilty in court of lying through her teeth.But the remarkable thing is she’s still going to be paid as an MP while she’s inside. She has refused to resign her seat and so her £, salary will continue to be paid by the rest of us.If you got sent to the nick, do you think your employers would continue to pay your wages  You’d be out on your ear. It’s kind of ­outrageous, no THIS cultural appropriation business is getting out of hand. Marks  Spencer has been slammed by leftie nutters with nothing better to do with their time. For selling a biryani wrap.They say it’s not authentic. Well of course it’s not bleedin’ authentic.  This is the UK, not Mumbai. Singer Katy Perry was attacked for wearing a kimono because she isn’t Japanese.White people in the US get criticised for wearing training shoes or sporting afros – that’s appropriating black culture, apparently. Though I think it was white folks who invented training shoes. Thing is, cultural appropriation is brilliant.It’s the way we have of sharing our respective cultures.  think it’s wonderful that countries outside Europe and the US have “culturally appropriated” democracy, sanitisation, railways, computers and so on. I wish more would do the same.SOMALIA is the most corrupt country in the world, according to a list compiled by a group called Transparency International.Not a great surprise, is it  Nor to see most of the rest of Africa hogging the bottom quarter of the world table.It’s bad governance and corruption that is keeping Africa poor – not colonialism. You can tell that the compilers of the report are lefties, though. Asked what countries were becoming more corrupt recently, they named the US, Hungary and Brazil. All three have elected right-wing governments.A NEW study says that women who wear short skirts are more likely to be ­promoted.The lesson I’d take from this,I were a women, is to wear a short skirt to work. But I don’t think that’s the lesson they mean us to take.I wonderwomen who wear short skirts but have the legs of an obese ­elephant also are more likely to get ­promoted I think that’s the next study for those researchers at the ­University of Surrey.I TOLD you last week that the reason we haven’t had a proper winter yet is that the people who run winter couldn’t agree on stuff.Such as whether it should be a hard winter, with lots of snow, no winter at all or a compromise deal with a backstop of some sleet for a bit.But I understand that on Tuesday the President of ­Winter won an astonishing ­victory and was able to push her deal through.Which was why it immediately snowed like hell.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

One, John Mann from Leave-voting Bassetlaw in Notts, yesterday outraged rival backbenchers by quipping: “Show me the money”.David Lammy, a Labour People’s Vote supporter, said any colleagues who took the money would be “cowards and facilitators” and said “history will be brutal”.Wes Streeting – another second referendum backer – said their actions would “never be forgiven”.But Tories in seaside towns such as Clacton, Great Yarmouth, Hastings and Skegness are also set to benefit. One insider said the money could prove critical in helping the PM win a majority when her Meaningful Vote comes back to the Commons.Separately No. is drawing up new primary legislation on workers’ rights and environmental protection to try and win over more Labour backbenchers.Details of the new ‘Bill’ are expected next week after another meeting between Business Secretary Greg Clark and Unite chief Len McCluskey. The pair met earlier this week to thrash out details.One source said: “Len McCluskey is a dealmaker is being very useful behind the scenes. There’s talk he convinced Jeremy Corbyn to finally meet the PM.”Another told The Sun: “The Government needs to underpin the commitments they have made to the unions. This won’t just be an amendment to something but a new Bill.”A number of union officials met Whitehall teams in the Cabinet Office yesterday.A TUC spokesman signalled the unions would not settle for “warm words or half measures” from Government.THE day after the referendum, The Sun called for billions to be pumped into ­working-class communities ignored by London’s politicians.So Theresa May’s pledges to do just that in rundown coastal towns and Labour’s former mining heartlands are very welcome.Eventhey are decades late and a ploy to win votes for her deal.New infrastructure, NHS upgrades and skills training are just what’s needed.But we would go further, with radical regional tax breaks to lure employers.Rebalancing our economy towards Leave-voting areas and away from comfortably off Remain ones is what any Government should be doing.Labour’s “people’s vote” bores are hysterical about it, of course.The status quo suits them fine and Mrs May’s tactic could — shock, horror — secure Brexit.The fact they are crying foul, and would rather get their way than see hard-up towns bailed out by a Tory Government, shows how warped their priorities now are.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Heres the latest on Britains departure from the EU.Brexit comes from merging the words Britain and exit.The term has been widely used ever since the idea of a referendum on leaving the EU was put forward.More than million people voted in the June  referendum with a turnout of . per cent. Leave won by  per cent to  per cent.People now talk about “soft” and “hard” Brexit in reference to how close the UK will be to the EU post separation.The road to triggering Article  — which saw Britain officially start the process of leaving the EU — was paved with complications for the PM, including a Supreme Court case ruling MPs needed to vote on Brexit negotiations.But it was finally triggered on March , , meaning the official departure date and move into the transition phase is due to take place on March , .The European Union is an economic and political partnership. There are currently  members states including the United Kingdom.It began as a trade group of six nations in the s.The UK first applied to join what was then the European Economic Community in  and finally became a member in .Now called the European Union, it has grown to include former Soviet bloc states and has at its heart a “single market” allowing goods and people to move freely.It has its own parliament, central bank and the euro currency used by  countries, with some members including Britain opting to keep their own money.Eurocrats have been pushing for ever closer political and financial union, which could include a European Army separate from the Nato alliance.Those in favour of leaving said Britain was being held back by EU red tape with too many rules on business.They also campaigned on the issue of sovereignty and said they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders.Beyond the question of ceasing to be a member of the EU, what Brexit actually means in practice has been the subject of intense debate ever since.Theresa May officially triggered Article  on March ,  after which there was a two-year time limit set for negotiations to hammer out the details.The UK is therefore bound to leave the EU by March , , although there is a -month transition period.Negotiations began on June , with the two chief negotiators, Michel Barnier of the EU and former Brexit Secretary David Davis, immediately setting off to find common ground.Some of the “uncertainties” being discussed include citizens living in each others territory, border arrangements between Ireland and the UK and the amount Britain stands to pay to honour its existing EU commitments.This is a bridging agreement between the current situation – where we are members of the EU – and our long-term relationship outside the bloc.Also known as an implementation phase, it allows for the UK to keep some of the same arrangements with Brussels on trade and other matters until a new comprehensive trade agreement is sealed.In March , Britain secured a transition deal that will also allow ministers to seek trade agreements around the globe.The UK will also be free to set its own foreign policy as soon as Brexit happens, as well as negotiate and sign new trade deals anywhere in the world – to implement them in .However EU chiefs made it clear the period, which allows the UK to stay in the Single Market and Customs Union, will only come into forcethe Irish border is sorted.Former Brexit Secretary David Davis and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier unveiled terms for the  month interim period.The UK will not be fully out of the EU until December ,  – four and a half years after the historic referendum decision.But EU leaders have suggested they could extend the transition period further.Theresa May finally struck a Brexit deal with Brussels on November ,, after days of round-the-clock talks in Brussels.But this has proved just the beginning of a long drawn-out, painful process.The opposition centred predominantly on the backstop agreement which ensures there is never a border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.The backstop will see Britain remain in the customs union for as long as necessary until an alternative way of keeping the border open is found.In a dramatic night at Westminster on January , the Prime Minister succeeded in uniting her party behind a plan to rewrite the deal to address concerns about the Irish backstop.But senior figures in Brussels, Berlin, Paris and Dublin warned that the demand only made a no-deal Brexit more likely as the clock ticks down to the UKs scheduled departure from the European Union on March .European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker described the Agreement reached after  months of negotiation last November as the best and only deal possible.And he told MEPs in the European Parliament in Brussels: The debate and votes in the House of Commons yesterday do not change that.The Withdrawal Agreement will not be renegotiated.May is set to go back to the EU and demand it ditches the hated Northern Ireland backstop in a last ditch plan to save Brexit.It came after the UK parliament backed an amendment instructing the Prime Minister to demand that Brussels replace the backstop — which aims to avoid customs checks on the island of Ireland after Brexit  — with alternative arrangements."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000451746018.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"second eu referendum second brexit vote","story":"The humiliating defeat raised questions over the possibility of a second referendum.

It is building up a few weeks of extra stock in Britain in case of any border delays. Likewise, several of its European deodorants, including Axe, Dove and Rexona are made in Britain and transported to the continent. A few weeks of extra inventory is one of the important steps we are taking to make sure that we minimise any disruption to our customers and consumers, said Alan Jope, Unilevers new chief executive.   He said weeks of inventory, not months and not days was the right amount for consumer packaged goods. One of the lessons we learn over and over again is when you do build inventory, it very often ends up being not exactly the right mix of products. With Britain at risk of leaving the European Union without a deal, Unilever is the latest consumer and retail firm to take such measures to keep imports and exports smooth. Unilever makes other British staples, such as Marmite spread, in Britain. Unilever is also increasing stocks of raw materials such as aluminium cans and cardboard. Such logistical costs are among those the Anglo-Dutch company has incurred this year to prepare for Brexit. The others are artwork changes to labels to prepare for dferent regulations and the hiring of customs experts. In very round numbers these are roughly equal and not material to total Unilever at the moment, Jope said.

Kirstie says: “He found an apple in my school bag that had gone soft and he was really angry. He made me scrub out the bag and I had to stand in the naughty corner from pm until am –  hours. “He went to bed, but kept checking I was still standing.”   It is just one example of the abuse Kirstie, now , and her two siblings endured at the hands of the salesman before he killed their mum in the sitting room as they slept upstairs. Natalie Hemming was beaten and dumped in woods in . The investigation into the -year-old’s death was shown in heartbreaking detail in the documentary Catching a Killer. Kirstie is telling her story in a moving follow-up, Behind Closed Doors: Through the Eyes of the Child on BBC. For  years up to her murder, Natalie endured horrendous physical and emotional abuse, bullied by a man now described as a Jekyll and Hyde character. Kirstie and the two children Natalie had with Hemming – a son, eight, and daughter, six, who cannot be named – saw everything. They also bore the brunt of Hemming’s anger.   Until Natalie went missing Kirstie suffered in silence, like the one-in-five children in England and Wales who witness and experience domestic abuse. “I thought it was normal,” she says. “There were naughty corners all over the house I had to stand inI did something wrong. Anything could set him off.” Talking for the first time about her stepfather, jailed for le, Kirstie continues: “If I hadn’t hung my clothes up properly, orI got a bad grade at school... he got angry on a daily basis, mostlythings were untidy. “I wasn’t allowed out to play with friends or to bring them home. I was sent to bed without food for things like forgetting a piece of homework.” The only person who really knew the extent of her suffering was her mum, and she was powerless to help. “Mum would try and sneak food to me, but she wasn’t always able to. If she got found out, Paul would go mad.  “I once told a teacher that Daddy wasn’t being very nice. She did the right thing and told the head. It was reported to social services but they called Mum, who said everything was fine. “The file was closed the same day.” The abuse started in  after Natalie, then a -year-old single mum, moved in with Hemming,  years older. Natalie’s relationship with Kirstie’s dad Matthew, a naval officer, had broken down and she had postnatal depression. Things quickly deteriorated. Kirstie recalls: “When I was about four I got stuck in between Mum and Paul, who were shouting at each other. I was shyterried and went to my bedroom. “After that, when the fighting started, I’d go to my room and play with my toys. I had a rabbit called Thumper, I’d act out what was happenshyshying with him.” The incidents were never talked about as the family were so terried. Kirstie tells her story in the documentary along with three other victims of abusive and controlling fathers.To the outshy-side world, Hemming was a charmer attheir home inMilton Keynes,he was a monster. He was moody, sullen, controlled Natalie’s money and constantly checked up on her. When she wanted a job, Hemming told her he would pay her to stay home. Natalie’s sister Joanne Beverley, , says: “Natalie always said Paul had two faces – the face she and the children lived with and the face everyone  saw. “Natalie hinted that things were off, saying he was very obsessive. “Then she would defend him, saying he’d got obsessive compulsive disorder but was getting help for it. “She never told me too much as she knew I’d insist she left.” Jo lives in Wakefield, West Yorks, with her husband Stephen, , and four children, Lauren, , Morgan, , Charlie, five, and Isabelle, three. After the murder, she took in Kirstie and her half-sister. Jo’s other sister Kerry Hammond, , who has two sons, took in Natalie’s little boy. Jo, Kerry and their brothers Stephen, , and Sean, , all wish they could have done more to help Natalie. Jo says: “Once, we nearly managed to get her away from him. But Paul kept turning up, he wore her down in the end and she decided to go home.” Finally, Natalie planned to leave him after finding love with a colleague at the Mercedes dealership she worked at. Hemming, then , found out.  On May , , he beat Natalie to death, wrapped her body in a blanket, shoved her into his car boot and dumped her naked body in woodlands in shyChandlers Cross, Herts. Their son, then six, had heard the murder. He told police: “I heard a noise. I looked downstairs and peeked through the little door. Mum was lying down on the floor.” The children were traumatised. Jo says: “Kirstie was completely shut down when she came to live with me, she was almost robotic. Her sister didn’t speak for two months. She’s only just found the confidence to speak outside the home. “The day we heard Natalie’s body had been found, three weeks after she went missing, I told [the children]. “Kirstie sat showing no emotion. She was like a rabbit caught in the headlights. She only started talking about it after Hemming was sentenced.” Kirstie vividly recalls the last time she saw Natalie. “Mum was cuddled up on the sofa with a blanket on the Sunday night and I gave her a kiss.” When Natalie was not downstairs on Monday morning, Hemming lied to Kirstie and said that her mum was out with friends. After Natalie’s body was found, his web of lies began to unravel. He was charged with her murder and sentenced to a minimum of  years’ jail.  Though Kirstie says: “I was too frightened to talk. I didn’t even want to tell the police what I knew in case they told Paul. I knew he’d be really angry.” Jo has nurtured both girls back to good health. Kirstie has started her GCSEs and joined the Sea Cadets. She thinks she will join the Navy, like her mum did before having her, and her real dad is back in her le. She also wants to help other shyyoungsters suffering domestic violence. In a school of , children, statistics say  will experience it. Kirstie says: “I’m a patron of Operation Encompass, which supports children suffering abuse. If police are called to a house for domshyshyestic violence, they have to let the school know. Teachers can then talk to the children and ask themthey’re OK. “It’s really hard to go up to a teacher and tell them what’s happening, butsomeone comes to you it’s much easier to speak out.” Remembering her mum, she adds: “Mum loved sparkly shoes. We asked everyone to wear party shoes to her funeral. Mum was bubbly and fun.” Jo says: “Natalie was a great mum and a strong character. If domestic violence can happen to her, it can to anyone.” Behind Closed Doors: Through the Eyes of the Child, BBC at pm on Wednesday, February .

In the note – written after the Sunday Mirror revealed he had notbeen in touch with victim Emma Fairweather – the Duke, , said he was “shaken” by the collision. The typed -word message arrived six days after the smash near Sandringham and was signed “Yours sincerely, Philip” – in blue pen.Forensic handwriting expert Ruth Myers has now analysed the letter to decipher the hidden meanings behind his writing and what it reveals about his personality. Following the crash, many called for Prince Philip to give up driving but the defiant prince was back at the wheel just days later in a brand new Range Rover. And Ms Myers says this is of no surprise as his handwriting shows hes unlikely to change an opinion or decision even in the face of logic or reason.  Ms Myers believes that behind the royal facade, the great-grandfather has a desire for approval. She exclusively told the Mirror: Prince Philip’s handwriting indicates a writer with a good intellect who tries to exercise numerous built-in controls over his strong depth of feelings to keep him compatible. The angular writing denotes a critical and somewhat forceful personality, having strong likes and dislikes. He likes a challenge and can inspire others with his initiative, high standards and enthusiasm, his creative ability with artistic leanings helps him to accomplish and achieve goals with zeal and fervour. However, he has a short fuse and when provoked can retort with caustic comments.   Anxious to maintain a good image he appreciates the importance of his role in le having a desire for approval. An inidual personality he may show indference to conventional commitments and is unlikely to change an opinion or decision even in the face of logic or reason. Ms Myers added: He does not always face up to problems and will find excuses for his actions by denying dficulties and rationalising by avoiding them and thereby his conscience is clear. Sensitive to criticism although hurt will go his own way. It is dficult for him to forgive past injustices.   Prince Philip can relate readily to others but in reality he can enjoy working alone and is happy in his own company selective in his choice of friendship. Lover of good living he enjoys luxury and quality appreciating and enjoying deeply all that influences the senses. Although he is communicative he keeps his own counsel and his conversation will be guarded as he is able to conceal pertinent facts he will be secretive and thus able to skirt issues. Emma, , a care support worker, was left in crippling pain after the crash.   She has been signed off for two months and has instructed solicitors to pursue a compensation claim. The Kia that was in collision with the Dukes x was driven by her friend Ellie Townsend, . Ellie’s nine-month-old son was also in the car. Although Prince Philip refers to it being sunny, Emma recalls the day being overcast. She said: “He’s tried to give an explanation so I appreciate that, whether I agree with it or not.

The child, who cannot be identied for legal reasons, suffered serious burns to his face and arm. His -year-old father is charged with being involved in the attack, which happened at a Home Bargains store in Worcester on July  last year. The dad was involved in a parental custody dispute, jurors heard. A trial jury at Worcester Crown Court was told how the injured child screamed I hurt, over and over again, after being struck.  On Thursday, jurors were shown the stores CCTV video capturing the moment the incident took place. The attack happened in a matter of seconds while the child was standing with his brother looking at toy footballs. The boys dad is accused of conspiring to unlawfully or maliciously cast or throw sulphuric acid on or at the boy, with intent to burn, maim, disfigure or disable the minor, or do grievous bodily harm. Prosecutors allege the father, stung by his we walking out on him and taking the children in April , enlisted others to attack the youngster in a bid to win more contact with the child by painting her as an unfit mother. As the clip was played, the boys father, sat in the dock, held a tissue to his face. Facing the same charge are Adam Cech, , of Farnham Road, Birmingham Jan Dudi, , of Cranbrook Road, Birmingham Norbert Pulko, , of Sutherland Road, London Martina Badiova, , of Newcombe Road, Handsworth, Birmingham Saied Hussini, , of Wrottesley Road, London and Jabar Paktia, , of Newhampton Road, Wolverhampton.  They all deny the allegation. In his opening last week, Jonathan Rees QC, for the Crown, said the boys mother had driven to the store with her children at about pm to buy a party gt. Roadside CCTV played in court showed her being followed by a silver Vauxhall Vectra, allegedly containing Cech, Dudi and Pulko. At .pm she and the children went inside the store, followed shortly after by the three men, with shop CCTV showing Cech approaching the victim. Both youngsters were gazing at a brightly coloured display of footballs at the end of an aisle. The victim could then be seen pointing up at the balls, with his sibling doing practice kicks, as a man in a white T-shirt, identied without dispute in court as Cech, walked past the victim with his arm extended and an object in his hand.  As Cech exited the frame, the victim could be seen looking quickly back towards him before running to his mother nearby. Mr Rees told jurors: What you have just seen is that person in a white T-shirt - you can just catch the moment where the arm is extended. That really is the hub of this case. That is the acid attack. It is over in a split second. You have, in shot, Mr Cech - theres no dispute of that - extending his arm, out towards the child. Mr Rees added: His mother was a short distance away as the attack is carried out, and the sister heard the victim scream out, I hurt, I hurt, I hurt. The boy suffered a cm burn to his left forearm, and a cm burn on his forehead, which needed specialist hospital treatment.  The Crown have also claimed that Hussini, Pulko and Badiova were involved in an aborted attempt near a school, eight days prior to the shop attack. Witnesses were so concerned about the trios suspicious activity they took photos, which have formed part of the prosecutions case. On Wednesday, jurors also heard for the first time how the father sent an image with the text Nailed It! to an alleged co-conspirator, hours after his son had been injured. Running through details of contact alleged between the accused, Mr Rees said cell-siting of mobile phones showed Dudi, Cech and Pulko leaving the area near Home Bargains, immediately following the incident. Phone call log evidence is alleged to have shown that Pulko called Paktia, before Paktia then rang the boys father - some  minutes after the attack.  It is alleged that Pulko then met up with Paktia somewhere in the Birmingham area at about .pm. About an hour later, cell-siting showed Paktia and the fathers phones were back in the Wolverhampton area, Mr Rees told jurors. The Crowns QC then drew the jurys attention to what he described as some stickers being sent with mots and images, from the victims father to Paktia, later that evening. The first showed a cartoon image of what appeared to be a deer, leaning over and comforting a tearful fox.  Mr Rees said: At .pm, hesends Paktia a sticker. One animal comforting a fox which has its head in its hands. And then, the second is sent, a minute after that first one, again to Paktia. It is a sticker which features a young lady in it with the mot Nailed It!. The trial continues.

Scientists are looking for couples in Edinburgh and Manchester to take part in a groundbreaking study. Called NES T, it suppresses sperm production in menused daily, with the product applied to their upper arms and shoulders. As many women can experience uncomfortable side effects from traditional contraceptives such as the pill, researchers have been looking for alternatives. The gel has been developed as part of an international project funded by the US National Institute of Health and led by the Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute and the University of Washington School of Medicine. In the UK, work is being done by Saint Marys Hospital, which is part of Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, and the University of Edinburgh. Professor Richard Anderson, of the University of Edinburghs MRC Centre for Reproductive Health, said: Previous trials have shown that hormonal contraception for men can be safe and effective.   This trial allows men to self-administer a gel, which may be much more convenient and acceptable than needing repeated injections, as was the case with previous trials. Dr Cheryl Fitzgerald, consultant gynaecologist at Saint Marys Hospital, who is leading the study in Manchester, said: Currently the contraceptive options for men are limited to condoms and vasectomies. We believe this preparation will allow men to control their fertility in a safe and simple way. Men aged between  and  who are in a stable relationship with a woman aged between  and  are invited to be part of the trial by calling   or    . The two-year trial will require them to use the gel as their sole method of birth control, with the men taking part attending at monthly clinics to monitor sperm production.

The stories from the Barnsley leg of our Wigan Pier Project – the final stop on our and George Orwell’s  journey – are some of the most moving of all. Antonia Robson, , holding her eight-month-old son Hunter, saying that “hard-working families” like hers “get nothing”, and that “everyone I know is in debt”. Jessica Fox, , a mother of two young children with no income, and no support because her family has just been transferred onto Universal Credit .  Peter Robertshaw, , an unemployed father-of-two collecting food via a charity voucher scheme at the market for his two young children, one of whom giggles as she stuffs a banana hungrily into her mouth. What’s harder to understand is how any government could take a town struggling with losing its traditional industries to the zero-hour economy, and slash its budgets by an shyeye-watering %. But this is exactly what the Tories have done over the last eight years, according to research from the Centre for Cities. It’s a figure around four times the average reduction faced by councils in the South East, and has led to hugely damaging cuts to public services. It seems we weren’t “in it all together” after all. Barnsley – which once defied Margaret Thatcher during the Miners’ Strike – is used to being attacked by the Tories. So, news that Theresa May now plans to bribe the MPs of Leave-voting “coalfield” constituencies like theirs with cash will be seen for exactly what it is. The desperate act of a Prime Minister whose plan has simply unravelled.  The Government has had almost three years since the referendum to loosen the screws in austerity-stricken areas. If it had done so, the country could have been in a totally dferent place by now. Instead, Theresa May is left waving tawdry pound notes at a shycommunity that’s already only surviving – like in the Miners’ Strike days – through local shysolidarity. And all the while she plans to engineer a hard Brexit from which that community can only lose. Let’s hope this bribery goes better than the great DUP bribe, which has proceeded with all the aplomb and dignity of a kid trying to buy off the school bully with sweets – only to find, they want paying again and again and again. At least May’s offer is also an admission that there is a link between austerity cuts and Brexit, that the Tories usually firmly deny. If you cross-reference the new Centre for Cities research with Brexit vote figures, a pattern starts to emerge. Barnsley, which leads the austerity cuts league table by a long chalk, voted .% to Leave the EU. Oxford – where budgets have actually gone up .% over the last eight years – voted % Remain.  On the list, only shyLiverpool – second in the cuts league table – bucks the trend. Assailed by austerity cuts so deep they are reminiscent of Thatcher’s ‘managed decline’ plan for the city in the s, Liverpool – which has been regenerated by EU money – voted .% to stay, but much of the rest of Merseyside voted to come out. One factor given by some experts was the city’s lack of exposure to the Sun newspaper, due to the mass boycott that remains since shythat paper’s Hillsborough coverage. Next on the list, Doncaster, third worst hit , voted % out. Wakefield, in fourth place , voted .% leave. In fth place, shyBlackburnvoted by .% to Leave. The scale of these cuts – deliberately devolved by a Tory government shyoverwhelmingly to Labour councils – are not accidental but were embedded in the very architecture of George Osborne’s austerity plan. He knew the councils with the highest social burden would not only struggle to raise extra revenue, but would also need more money to support the poor, disabled and elderly.  The result has been devastating. It’s worth remembering this every time the former Chancellor pops up on TV documentaries with a sad shake of his head, trying to look like the sensible one who failed to persuade his mate Dave Cameron not to hold the shyreferendum. These were Osborne’s vicious cuts, aided and abetted by the wild-eyed ideologue Iain Duncan Smith. And to me, when the day of reckoning comes, this remains not just Cameron’s but Osborne’s Brexit. In the meantime, what Barnsley needs is to be treated like the Tories treat their own heartlands – with a bit of respect and fairness. It needs an end to this punishing, disproportionate, bitter austerity and a crackdown on employment agencies exploiting zero-hour workers. It needs new jobs and fresh hope. It doesn’t need a bung of cash – just a bit of old-fashioned social and economic justice. Imagine what a town with the grit, spirit and solidarity of Barnsley could do with some support, instead of constant assault.Wiganpierproject"},{"url":null,"title":"six year old boy removed","story":"NewsSix-year-old boy removed from primary school after bringing kne to playgroundConcerned parents believe that the incident at Westborough Primary School in Southend, Essex has been \"swept under the carpet\"ShareCommentsByIsaac Crowson:,  JAN NewsThe six-year-old was removed from Westborough Primary School\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A six-year boy has been taken out of school after he brought a kne to the playground. The pupil took the kne to the school and showed it to a fellow classmate.The incident is said to have taken place at Westborough Primary School in Southend, Essex. Parents have been left feeling worried and believe the discovery was swept under the carpet. One mother, who was made aware by another worried parent on the playground, said she feels everyone should have been made aware.   The woman, who does not want to be named, told the Southend Echo: Its absolutely shocking that a six-year-old is bringing a kne to school. I was horried. My initial reaction was one of anger and fear for my child because you do worry about your children going there and you dont expect a six-year-old to bring a kne to school. I understand there is scaremongering but with an incident as serious as this, I do think all parents should have been made aware so that we could decide what measures to put in place for our children. It feels like it was swept under the carpet. I just hope the school would deal with something like this robustly to make sure it doesnt happen again.   The discovery was made in September. Headteacher Tonya Brook said: This was an isolated incident where a six-year-old brought a small paring kne into school in his book bag. He showed it to another child. It did not come out of the bag. A member of Senior Management was on the playground to deal with the issue immediately. The child was subsequently removed from the school. All relevant parties were informed. Other members of the public were also concerned at the news on social media.   One woman said: How the hell does a six-year-old manage to take a kne to school without their parents knowing ! Another said: I talked to my son about this - it’s awful isn’t it. Hopefully us parents who are parents will steer our children in the right direction.One woman said: It’s a bit worrying that as a parent I’m finding all of this out on Facebook and that a statement wasn’t issued to parents about it.A spokeswoman for the school said no further comment would be made.

Lawyers for the state of Kentucky have urged Kim Davis to take financial responsibility and pay ,in legal fees to the four couples who sued her to combat the controversy. When the US Supreme Court legalised same sex marriage in , Davis still refused to issue licenses. Justying her decision on the grounds of her Christian beliefs, Davis’ actions spurred several protests and even landed her five days in Jail for ignoring the courts orders.   “Only Davis refused to comply with the law as was her obligation and as required by the oath of office she took,” Palmer Vance, an attorney of Kentucky State said. In , a federal judge ruled that taxpayers should pay legal fees for the attorneys of the American Civil Liberties Union , who represented the couples. ACLU argued that Davis had acted on behalf of the state but the lawsuit was dismissed. The Rowan County clerk still hasnt taken responsibility for her failing to do her job over three years ago,” said ACLU senior staff attorney Ria Tobacco Mar. Davis was defeated last autumn in her bid for reelection as county clerk. The  of judges has not indicated when it will issue a decision.   A spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign, an advocacy group for LGBT+ rights, said in an email that Davis should pay. Kim Davis used her office to discriminate against LGBTQ people and push a personal, bigoted agenda - all on the governments dime, it said. Although lawyers for Kentucky are arguing that Davis should pay, state Governor Matt Bevin has been publicly supportive of the former clerk, calling her an inspiration to children.

The gaffer will get us ready for it and we need to make sure we go and do the business.”The performance at Somerset Park was a bitter disappointment for the  United fans who made the long trip on a Friday night.And Clark admits it wasn’t good enough from the Tangerines.He added: “We went down to Ayr with full intentions of winning the game.“We gave ourselves a chance a couple of weeks ago against Dunfermline when we won and got ourselves up the league but we let ourselves and the fans down on Friday.“The weather meant it was never going to be a pretty game and they got a chance early on and took it.“I think we only had one real chance with Aidan towards the end where the goalie was out quick and made a good save.“All in all it was a very frustrating night and we were very disappointed.”Strong winds made le dficult for all the players but it was clear Ian McCall’s men coped far better with the conditions than United.The home side dominated the opening period and got their goal through Craig Moore early on but the expected response from the Tangerines with the wind in their favour in the second half never really materialised.Clark added: “It was dficult conditions but we’ve all played in wind like that before, we all know what it’s like.“We had a game plan – I don’t knowwe didn’t stick to it but it never happened for us.“We’re disappointed because that’s nine points we’ve given Ayr this season and we’re making it very hard for ourselves.”It’s been a stop-start first season at the club for Clark with a series of injuries curtailing his first-team opportunities.Now, though, he says he’s back to % and ready to help United get back on track.“It’s been very frustrating for me, I’ve missed a lot of games with daft wee injuries here and there where you can’t actually treat them, you just have to leave them until they get better.“It’s been frustrating but I’m back and feeling good now so, hopefully, I can kick on now and help the team get where we want to be.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/07/image.jpg@1.239911.jpg ","title":"dundee university wants to install 280 solar panels at one of its buildings","story":"Dundee University is seeking planning permission to install solar  at one of its buildings. vw, px\"  The university has applied to Dundee City Council to fit the  on the roof of the Dundee University Students’ Associationbuilding at the campus on Airlie Place.A spokesman said: “The University of Dundee has a policy to increase, wherever possible, the use of renewable energies within the campus.“The DUSA building provides an ideal location for the installation of solar  as there are large areas of uninterrupted flat roof.“The  will be installed on a frame angled towards the sun.“However, they will not be visible from surrounding footpaths and roadways.”The spokesman added: “It is intended to install a total of   with the potential of producing , kwh of electricity per annum.”"},{"url":null,"title":"former dundee united man one of two new arrivals at dundee","story":"Dundee have completed a double transfer swoop today.The club have secured the loan signings of former Dundee United defender Ryan McGowan and Sunderland midfielder Ethan Robson on loan until the end of the season.The -year-old Australia international McGowan joins up from Bradford City and had a previous spell across Tannadice Street at United in  .He has played at both right-back and centre-half throughout his senior career, which started at Hearts, but is also adept in central midfield.Midfielder Robson moves north to Dens Park from Jack Ross’ Sunderland.The -year-old has found first-team opportunities limited at the Black Cats this season and will instead try to help the Dee stave off the threat of relegation."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/5c52f4e184b300.92448614.jpg ","title":"he can have a seizure any day dundee boy thomas praised for caring for severely epileptic dad","story":"While most -year-olds worry about homework and football, Thomas Fleming often has other things on his mind.For more than six years, he has been caring for his dad James, , who has severe epilepsy.To celebrate Young Carers Awareness Day, Thomas spoke to the Tele about le looking after a loved one, as well as his role as Baldragon Academy’s young carers’ ambassador.Thomas, from Kirkton, said: “It does impact on my school le because I worry about my dad quite a lot.“He can have a seizure any day of the week.

They’ve two games to come against County and one final crack at Ayr and, of those showdowns, two are at Tannadice.Yes, the two heaviest defeats of the season came there against County and Ayr but under Neilson that second defeat was the only one he’s suffered in seven home games so far.And last time he sent out a team to face County he did mastermind what was without doubt the best win of the campaign to date, a gritty - success on their patch, in November.If the manager can mould his rebuilt team over the next few weeks, wins like that one can be repeated.They’ll have to be, or United’s big-game failures will see them negotiating even more vital outings in the play-offs."},{"url":null,"title":"well that was easy fans respond as queen of the south taunt wee dundee","story":"Dundee fans have responded to taunts from Queen of the South before and after yesterday#s Scottish Cup clash.A hat-trick by Stephen Dobbie gave the Doonhammers a - win over Dundee in last night#s Fourth Round replay.Even before proceedings got under way at Palmerston Park, the home side stuck the boot in to the Dark Blues by tweeting: #Good evening and welcome to tonight’s Scottish Cup replay against Dundee’s wee team.#After a - draw at Dens Park  days ago, a cup tie away to Aberdeen or Stenhousemuir awaits…#mdash Queen of the SouthJanuary , The message was warmly received by Arabs but some Dundee fans were less than complimentary.Peter Sayers wrote: #Hope we pump you tinpot lot now.Kevin Steele tweeted: #Really and you can#t play on grass.#After the Dumfries side swept to victory Queens rubbed salt into the wounds with another inflammatory tweet.#Well that was easy.

It was written for Count Friedrich Wilhelm, supposedly simplied for amateurs to play. However, Jamal and Jâms being master musicians showed the power of this often disregarded piece, to be immense. One of the first works to make piano and cello equal musical partners, it is full of ingenious dialogue between the instruments. The structure is unusual, but with such expert performers it delighted the audience who were moved by every turn and twist of this deeply emotional work.Jâms, from North Wales, after remarking on the three ferry crossings required to get to Ardrishaig via Bute, introduced the next piece, Ernest Bloch’s work ‘From Jewish Le’. In a style close to Jamal’s heart and heritage, having been born in Baku Azerbaijan, its three elements, ‘Prayer’, ‘Supplication’ and ‘Jewish Song’, are full of the pathos and sorrow felt by the Jewish nation and also full of the signature augmented intervals and minor key tonality of much of middle eastern musics. How beautully these pieces demonstrated the lyrical qualities of the cello. Jamal’s bow searched for all possible nuances of tone and dynamic as his instrument sang from its lowest notes to a seductive soprano register.The concert continued after the interval with a second Beethoven work. The audience may have noticed a minor kerfuffle at the piano as many pages were rapidly turned before starting. Would it be the ‘Seven Variations’ for cello and piano or the ‘Twelve’, both based on themes from Mozart’s Magic Flute  The ‘Seven Variations’ won, being on the theme from the ‘Pamina’ and ‘Papageno’ duet entitled ‘In men, who know the feeling of love’. This work exhibits Beethoven’s practised ingenuity in the iation form and brought a lighter mood to the programme.Jâms Coleman introduced the final work, Frank Bridge’s Cello Sonata. He told of the four years of torment for the composer as he struggled to express his feelings about the First World War, finally finishing the composition in . The adagio in the piece caused the composer the most dficulty as he struggled with ambivalence about his own pacist views. Jâms and Jamal dealt with the challenges of this complex work which tracks huge changes in the world of music composition that were under way at that time. Again, the lyrical powers of the cello came to the fore as did the virtuosic requirements heaped on the pianist. Despite its undoubted innovations, this piece generously reaches out to its audience. Bridge uses the new musical freedoms only when justied, being happy toto more traditional tonal stability in the lyrical sections.Fulfilled, but not overburdened by the weightiness of the final piece, the audience applauded Jamal and Jâms back to the concert room to perform the ‘Swan’ from Saint-Saens ‘Carnival of the Animals’ as encore. This piece so beautully confirmed the excellence of Jamal’s playing and the superb quality of his quite special instrument.PIC:Jamal Aliyev and Jâms Coleman. no_aJamalandJam"},{"url":null,"title":"inveraray carpet bowling club festive pairs competition","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Inveraray Carpet Bowling Club held its annual festive pairs competition.The first prize of turkeys was won by George Morrison and Alan Cameron.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.

Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13926204.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18355078.jpg","title":"ayr united 2 inverness 3","story":"NewsAyr United  Inverness : John Roberston hails Somerset Park among best grounds in worldThe Inverness gaffer was full of praise for the old fashioned surroundings as his side clung on in the face of a stirring fightback.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsNathan Austin puts Caley - up \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJohn Robertson hailed Somerset Park as one of the best grounds in the WORLD after Caley held off a storming Ayr fightback.

Somerset Park is one of these grounds that sucks you inyou give them a snf. Its a good throwback and their fans make it intimidating and a good atmosphere for teams when you lose a goal. Its brilliant...one of the best grounds in the world to come and play your football. In the past we might have lost a game like this so Im delighted.  Ayr knew a win here would take them top of the Championship and started well with Robbie Crawford missing a good chance in the first minute. But they soon hit the self destruct button as their defence went AWOL to allow Nathan Austin in for a double before Liam Polworth rammed home a third. The game looked over with barely  minutes on the clock and shellshocked Ayr took time to regroup. Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide. He set up Declan McDaid to haul Ayr back into the contest with a close range finish eight minutes after the restart. And a resurgent Ayr thought they had a penalty when Carl Tremarco appeared to handle in the box but ref Nick Walsh waved away loud protests. United continued to pour forward as the clock ticked down and Shankland set up a grandstand finish when slamming home a  yard free kick with five minutes left.  But their comeback proved too little too late as Inverness clung on. Ayr boss McCall said: Im just gutted. Weve conceded three goals and at least two of them were gted with just crazy defending.

A senior source said: “The UK Government’s contribution to the Ayrshire Growth Deal will be in the region of pound million. “It’s clear from the growth deal process that a lot of very exciting projects have been put forward. We are confident the deal can deliver a massive boost to the local economy.” The Ayrshire Growth Deal will provide signicant investment in the key sectors of aerospace and space at Prestwick, le sciences, manufacturing and tourism. It has been talked about for years as a poundm fund but the Scottish Government and three Ayrshire councils have all failed to reveal their financial input. The aim is to make key investments that will grow the economy and lead to , new jobs.  To do that the poundm public sector finance will have to trigger poundbillion of private investment. It is widely accepted Ayrshire has missed out on big investment deals as it has three councils scrapping for superiority, rather than a single strategic voice. Growth money is expected to be spent on luring a medicines manufacturing innovation centre, developing brownfield sites for industry, improving the Bellfield Interchange, upgrading digital infrastructure and free port status at Prestwick , the Port of Ayr and Falkland Rail Yard in Ayr and a renewable energy hub in Cumnock. It is expected the signing of heads of terms - the stage when all the ious partners get together and announce which projects will receive funding - will be reached within several months.

Danielle Smith, , used a metal pole to shatter windows of a home on Ness Glen Road, Dalmellington on November , . But she didn’t act alone as Smith was spotted alongside a male when the pair terried their targets inside. Ayr Sherf Court heard he appeared to be carrying a black air rle. But Smith, of Castle Croft, Dalmellington, admitted shoving the barrel of the rle into the home. And the victims inside cowered in fear as they could hear Smith shouting “Get out here, get our here.” CCTV footage captured the pair on their threatening violent spree. Almost every window in the home had been smashed and holes in the windows were consistent with shots of the rle. Blood smears were spotted on the living room window. Police were called and discovered the metal pole used by Smith the following morning. A search warrant in Smith’s home uncovered pellets for an air rle in a box within her bedroom. But she told officers that the other person had been carrying the gun and she had never seen the gun before. She also stated that she threw the metal pole away as she believed the other person would have used it. Solicitor Steven Maxwell told the court he had viewed the footage. The lawyer commented: “It’s quite clear that she was quite literally in his stead and following him. “She cannot provide the court any reasonable explanation of how she managed to get herself in this situation but she was using and abusing drink and illegal substances. “At the time she would have followed this man where-ever he went. “If you fly with the crows, you get shot with them.

He added: “The young woman who appears before you is a very dferent woman. “She understands the seriousness of this.” Sherf Scott Pattison told Smith: “My first thought was to send you to jail for this shameful behaviour and very serious nature. “However I’m going to draw back from that because of your current progress in the community payback order. “I’m told by the social work department that you’re doing well. “You’re currently free from substance and alcohol misuse which is the big thing. “Butyou transgress, you’ll go straight to jail and it’ll be for a signicant period.” Smith admitted behaving in a threatening or abusive manner and, whilst acting with another, shouted, did kick and strike the door with a metal pole, point the barrel of an air rle into the home and smash windows.

Last year, members took the decision to pay staff ndash I would hopeit happened again we would consider making similar commitments.South of Scotland list MSP Michelle Ballantynecondemned the policy, saying: ldquoIt is completely unacceptable for East Lothian Council to tell their employees to save their holiday time in case of bad weather.

I will be writing to Willie Innes about how deeply unfair his cabinet have been to hardworking council staff.A statement issued on Wednesday by Ms Leitch, the councilrsquos chief executive, said: ldquoThe policy has been refreshed following last yearrsquos severe wintry weather.ldquoThe updated policy reflects feedback following staff consultation, and is consistent with the approach taken by many other public sector organisations.ldquoIt reflects the councilrsquos commitment to protecting the health and safety of all employees, while minimising disruption and maintaining key public services where possible.ldquoIt recognises that employees may periodically face dficulties in attending work during periods of severe weather, or some other adverse event.

It was a cold day but my friend, who is skilled in bushcraft, had brought his portable fire pit with him.We searched for drtwood and sat by the fire, roasting marshmallows and warming our hands. It was a short walk but dramatic rock formations loomed above us, making it feel like a real adventure. The kids climbed them and explored the rocky beach, where once there had been an open-air bathing pool.On our , we went through a small tunnel-like arch. I stopped for a moment, suddenly taken by the view. The ruins of Dunbar Castle were beautully framed by the archway. Locals call this archway the keyhole and I reflected that the term is a perfect name.When we look through a keyhole, our vision is narrowly focussed. Such was the effect here. It cast a visual spotlight on what is left of what was once a mighty fortress.The kids trundled on before me, noticing smaller wonders: a frozen worm on the path, a sea shell and interesting-looking stones. But I stood for some moments, taking in the view beyond and thinking of what stories those old stones of the castle could tell.Many people pass this way every day, both locals and visitors. Itrsquos a section of the John Muir Way. I have often been with my family to Dunbar Leisure Pool and the harbour and town. But somehow I had missed this short but spectacular nearby walk until this day.Dunbar Castle is now but a fallen-down ruin. Indeed, itrsquos dficult to imagine what it once was. But the weathered sandstone castles on the shoreline built by nature still stand defiant, somehow reminding us of their greater permanence in the face of human transience. But as I stood looking at the ruins, the keyhole focussed my thoughts as well as my vision.History is also viewed through a keyhole, a very narrow one. The lives and events of the castle were lived in most part unrecorded by it. The spotlight of history has illuminated only brief moments, and even then the characters have been only those deemed lsquoimportantrsquo.There are moments where the view through the narrow keyhole of history has included insights to untold stories. The bravery of Black Agnes, as she defied the siege in , is one of those. With her husband away, she was in charge of this important fortress during war with England. She refused to give up the castle, even in the face of bombardment and attempts to starve her small garrison into submission. Her mocking of her besiegers by dusting down the battlements with her maids after a bombardment is an image seared in legend.But itrsquos a chink of light on a huge untold story we are led to believe by historyrsquos silence that women were insignicant players in events. For sure they were oppressed and put down by a system that centred on male power, but they are half of humanity and at least half the story.As the actions of Black Agnes reveal, even with such constraints put on them, women were there, part of events and often refusing to accept their assigned role.The le of Mary Queen of Scots has always been for me an example of this. Yes, she was privileged and powerful by birth, but because of this history took notice of her.Despite all the political and religious challenges she faced, it was her womanhood which men deemed her main failing. And so she was judged by dferent standards. Had she behaved with the morals of her father she would not have lasted five minutes in power. But no one raised an eyebrow because he was a man.But more than this, even though Mary was the monarch, her royal authority was deemed diluted and even less legitimate merely because she was a woman.So she understood she needed to find a husband to bring her royal authority to full strength in a country full of powerful and bullying misogynist men.She chose the dashing young Darnley, and the fact that he turned out to be dross was not, in my opinion, Maryrsquos fault. How easy it is to blame a woman for a manrsquos failings. She was taken in by him it was he who was the failure, not her.Thatrsquos what Irsquove always maintained, despite the protestations of my tutors at university. And her third husband Bothwell, well he was a disappointment as well.It is the stones of Dunbar,they could speak, who could tell us of the truth of his forced union with Mary. She had been taken there by him in April . The circumstances of this still remain debated. Was she abducted by him as later claimed, or did she go willingly It was also claimed she was raped and forced to marry Bothwell soon afterwards to save her honour . This idea has been disputed by some because Mary is said to have miscarried with twins while imprisoned at Lochleven Castle some months after, suggesting a relationship with Bothwell even before Darnleyrsquos murder. So a woman cannot be abused by a man she has had a relationship with  Really If they could talk, the stones of Dunbar would whisper the truths of those events in , and the despair and desperation of a strong and clever woman whose destiny was stolen mainly because of her sex.These were my thoughts as I stood looking through the keyhole towards Dunbar Castle. Suddenly, my daughter Manja broke my trance by wiggling the frozen worm in front of me. I smiled and thought to myself that thankfully times have changed since the days when the castle was a fortress.But sometimes, I fear, not as much as we think they have."},{"url":null,"title":"new-fidra-gin-hoping-for-east-lothian-base","story":"Fidra Gin is the brainchild of Emma Bouglet and Jo Brydie and is currently based at Ballencrieff and Aviemore.The duo came together to create the juniper berry-based drink and have already enjoyed immediate success, with the product already available in a number of Edinburgh restaurants.Now they are hoping to make it  per cent based in the county, with plans under way to find suitable premises.Emma said: ldquoWe pick all the botanicals in East Lothian and, at the moment, we use a still in Aviemore.ldquoA friend has lent us his still for the time being so we can get enough momentum behind us and bring the whole operation to East Lothian.ldquoWe have potentially secured a premise in East Lothian.

I still have many of the books I bought with pocket money when I was young, carried through le like a lucky charm. TS Eliotrsquos Prufrock may have measured out his le with coffee spoons I have measured out mine with Puffins and King Penguins, Peregrines and Pelicans. If pressed, I could tell where I found each one.Like radio, the demise of the book has been often foretold. Books, we were unreliably informed, were yesterdayrsquos technology, so th century, so redundant in a digital age. I well recall the gleeful obituaries. The internet would sweep them away with tsunami-like ferocity. Kindles, apparently, were the future, and even I owned one once. Who knows where it lies unloved now. And who cares Similar prophesies of doom were made about bookshops, for what need was there for themno one wanted books  And for a while things did look a bit glum. With the demise of the Net Book Agreement, which determined that books must be sold at their cover price, many privately-owned bookshops found they couldnrsquot compete with the discounts offered by supermarkets and chain stores. Inevitably, sadly, some went to the wall or sold out to more voracious competitors.Of late, however, in what has been the bleakest of midwinters for the high street, there are signs that reports of the death of the bookshop were premature. In the last couple of weeks, I have heard of two new bookshops opening in Edinburgh. And last Saturday evening, I attended a mini book festival in Linlithgow, organised by the local independent, Far From the Madding Crowd, which was very well-attended, a testimony to the loyalty and warmth the shop engenders.The best bookshops are like that. When one of them is threatened it is a cause for mourning and resentment and the raising of petitions. For me, a town without a bookshop is unworthy of the name, a place where civilisation is yet to reach, where culture must surely fail to thrive. I have been in such outposts and nothing would drag me back.Where there is at least one bookshop there is hope. A year ago, I visited Christchurch in New Zealand, which is still struggling to recover from the devastating earthquakes of  and . The centre of the city was preternaturally quiet and the shopping mall was bereft of customers. But the one shop that was buzzing was Scorpio Books, also independently owned, which against all odds had managed to resurrect itself. Would the same, brave decision have been made by the fund managers who control chain stores  Perhaps. Then again, perhaps not.One of the new Edinburgh shops will be Toppingrsquos, which has a wonderful branch in St Andrews. The companyrsquos founder is Robert Topping, formerly of Waterstonersquos in Manchester, which he left after being told to limit the size of the stock. The story is told in a new memoir by Glasgow-born Sir Tim Waterstone, of whom I was briefly an employee ndash the least said about which the better. ldquoThe Waterstonersquos model, recalls Sir Tim, ldquowas simply this: the highest class of heavily stocked literary bookselling run on a national scale by an unusually enthusiastic and highly knowledgeable young staff.Waterstonersquos was born in  when the book trade was in dire of need of modernisation. Complacent, rival shops kept short hours and unsatisfying stock, and their staff were more inclined to turn custom away than welcome it. Waterstonersquos ndash which was in the vanguard of Sunday opening ndash initiated a bookselling revolution and played an intrinsic role in making the literary novel cool. In the store in which I worked, on any given night you might catch a reading by Gore Vidal, Richard Ford, Raymond Carver or Edna OrsquoBrien. It was like a club of which anyone could become a member.Scratch any writer and they will regale you with tales of their favourite bookshops. I have one ndash Main Street Trading in St Boswells ndash a handful of miles from where I live in the Borders. Some prefer charity shops, others, such as my biblioholic husband, emporia like the Strand in New York with its eight miles of books. In Browse: The World in Bookshops, Ali Smith hymns Leakeyrsquos second-hand bookshop in Inverness in which I always try and spend an hour or two when Irsquom in the vicinity.

As well as managing Josef K, the future TV producer had picked up Article  for his Rational Records label. This was after Alan Horne, who co-produced the record with Josef K guitarist Malcolm Ross, passed on the band in favour of signing Aztec Camera.ldquoAllan said to me, the future lies in the past, MacIntyre beams as he prepares to celebrate  years of running the conceptual ideas factory that is the Creeping Bent Organisation. ldquoThat period in Edinburgh was really exciting. It felt like people were having great ideas every week. Hearing the Scars record the first time, walking into the Tap OrsquoLauriston and seeing Josef K and Fire Engines sitting there, for a kid from Strathaven that was really exciting. There was something in the air at that time. It wasnrsquot just the music, it was about literature and art as well. When John Peel played Article , the excitement of that is something Irsquove been chasing ever since.Campbellrsquos pearl of possibly appropriated Proustian wisdom bears long-term fruit this coming weekend at a very special one-night extravaganza programmed as part of Celtic Connections. Things Are Tough, We Can Still Picnic takes place at Glasgow arts lab, the CCA, and features the world premieres of two very special musical troupes. Not for nothing, it seems, was Article rsquos three-minute opus titled Event to Come.First up, MacIntyre will unveil his own Port Sulphur project, a Creeping Bent house band of sorts, whose live incarnation features a pan-generational pedigree of artists including former Orange Juice guitarist James Kirk and ex Aztec Camera bassist Campbell Owens. MacIntyre likens it to ldquoa post-modern version of Booker T and The MGs.Port Sulphurrsquos first foray into the world was with the motorik strains of the knowingly named Fast Boys and Factory Girls single. This featured on full- follow-up, Paranoic Critical, while the live set will also feature excerpts from Valentinorsquos, a collection of musical sense memories named after Campbellrsquos Rational era club and available for one day only on February th.ldquoPort Sulphur is effectively my indulgence, MacIntyre says of what began as a solo project excavating half-formed recordings and reconstructing them using chance elements drawn from Luke Rhinehartrsquos novel, The Dice Man, and Brian Enorsquos oblique strategies. ldquoThe initial idea was to have no collaborators, and taking any notions of authenticity out of the project was really liberating for me.Things changed, however, and MacIntyre started seeking musical responses to what already existed from a pantheon of fellow travellers.ldquoOnce you have Vic Godard or Davy Henderson from the Sexual Objects on a song it becomes amazing, says MacIntyre, ldquoand you let them sculpt those songs the way they would rather than how Irsquod do it. The best example of that was when I gave James Kirk a really electronic track, and it came back sounding like Orange Juice.Sharing joint headline status is Pop Group guitarist Gareth Sager and the new beat combo he styles as The Hungry Ghosts. Sagerrsquos musical eclecticism has seen him move from the incendiary ferocity of The Pop Group, through the free jazz playfulness of Rip, Rig and Panic, the punk-funk of Head and even a Debussy and Satie influenced solo piano record recorded at Abbey Road.The Hungry Ghosts, however, strip things down to what Sager styles as ldquostomp-glam-funk. Irsquove made about  albums, and Irsquove never put any limits on what I do, but it felt like the right time to do something just with guitar, bass and drums and nothing . Irsquove never written in a purely rock and roll context before, and I wanted to seethe songs would stand up without me being tempted to put strings or a Hammond organ on them.The results of this back to basics approach can be heard on Juicy Rivers, which forms the third part of Sagerrsquos Creeping Bent triptych begun with The Last Second of Normal Time, first released in , with the second part, rsquos Slack Slack Music, just released in a new CD edition.Sager also appears on Paranoic Critical, providing loops and fuzz clarinet on constructions based around the vocals of poet and sometime collaborator, the late Jock Scot on one track, and the also departed Suicide vocalist Alan Vega on the other.ldquoItrsquos not everyone whorsquod phone me up and ask to put music to this recording by Alan Vega, says Sager, ldquobut Douglas is a maverick, and I think itrsquos important as we become an older generation not to just curl up in front of the TV, but to get out there and do what you want to do whatever age you are.Friday nightrsquos extravaganza will be presented under the guise of Everything Flows, a happening new lsquocultural events organisationrsquo which has already hosted German record label Marinarsquos similarly styled quarter-century shindig. This weekendrsquos event, which also features support from nouveau indie janglers The Plastic Youth, looks set to be even more conceptual. Itrsquos attitude dates back to A Leap into the Void, the Yves Klein referencing multi-media extravaganza that launched Creeping Bent at Tramway in Glasgow back in .ldquoTo me, Creeping Bent isnrsquot a record label, says MacIntyre. ldquoItrsquos an art project.

Or maybe it just does not seem fair to have a fight in which thousands, including a Cabinet Minister , line up against one -year-old.Mr Greerrsquos  minutes began last week after the Conservative Party sent a tweet to mark the anniversary of the death of Sir Winston Churchill, who died in  at the age of .ldquoFor many, the party noted, ldquothe greatest Briton to have ever lived. Mr Greer reckoned this deserved a response, as stated previously, and lo there poured forth upon his head much outrage, the stickiest of it coming from Mr Morgan, the host of ITVrsquos Good Morning Britain.The Scottish Parliamentrsquos youngest MSP went on GMB to defend his view. Rather brave of him, I thought. No sign of the Scottish cringe in this one. He acquitted himself well enough, with an answer for every point put to him.As Piers went into full Tasmanian Devil mode, Mr Greer, getting his retaliation in first, accused him of being a snowflake. Cheeky. When the MSP called a comment Mr Morgan made ldquowildly ahistorical, the host clearly did not know what the word meant.It was such a drubbing for Piers that his co-host Susanna Reid had to step in and save the interview, telling the MSP: ldquoNo one is denying that every historical hero should be scrutinised, but the use of the language is so offensive.Cometh the woman, cometh the point. While it is reasonable to appeal for some perspective on Churchillrsquos career, Mr Greer could have chosen his words, and his medium, more carefully.Just as children are told that there are outdoor voices and indoor ones, so there is language you might use in, say, a student union bar, or among friends. His Twitter summary was brutal, over the top, and yes, designed to provoke a response.Such is the way points are made on social media. Twitter is no place for reasoned debate. Twitter is where nuance goes to die. The fact that so many politicians, from Mr Greer to the US President, see it as a primary vehicle for communication with the public, is deeply worrying, and indicative of these populist times.So much for what he said. What should not be in doubt is his right to say it. Nothing he tweeted was against the law. As for Piers Morgan telling Mr Greer thatldquoit wasnrsquot for Winston Churchill you would be speaking German and goose-stepping your way to Holyrood, it is a rum do to praise Churchillrsquos part in the fight for freedom at the same time as condemning someone for exercising their right to free speech.Even the most cursory look at Churchillrsquos history, pre-Second World War in particular, would find him a knotty, dficult character with a long, sometimes chequered career. He was a product of his era, his class, his prejudices. This was well known to people at the time.By the s Churchill was considered a busted flush. Then along came another world war. People could appreciate his blood, toil, tears and sweat because they had provided no little measure of these things themselves.While they valued the role Churchill had played, perhaps even thought him a military genius, they were not above seeing him in the round. By wars end they did not regard him as the man to lead them into the future. Hence Labourrsquos landslide victory at the polls in . That voters re-elected him in  is simply proof that times change and opinions with them.The further away we have come from the Second World War the more perspective on Churchill has been lost. There has grown up an almost infantile desire to portray him as a saintly figure who should never be criticised. No serious historian has taken such a tack, but others have. Take the  film, Darkest Hour. Won two Oscars Gary Oldman, brilliant. Fine movie, right up to the scene where Churchill takes a ride on the Tube and is urged by men and women of all classes and colours to stand up to Hitler, to fight, fight, fight and never surrender.From there, the audience is led to believe it was a straight journey to Churchillrsquos ldquofight them on the beaches speech. What a great story. Except it never happened. The filmrsquos director, Joe Wright, said the scenes were ldquoa fictionalisation of an emotional truth, a way to show that Churchill could read the mood of the British people better than his peers.The trouble with history is not, as one character said in Alan Bennettrsquos The History Boys, that it is ldquoone ******* thing after another. That is a statement of fact. The problem with history comes when we accept only one version of an event or person, usually from the victors side, as the truth and nothing but the truth.History is a deeply political, and politicised, pursuit. How it is told,it is even told in the first place, says much about the times and where power lies.How is it the case, for example, that I spent all my school years in Scotland yet was never taught a thing about my own countryrsquos history The American Civil War. The Peterloo Massacre. The Russian Revolution. All of this, but not a word about the Clearances, the Act of Union, anything to do with Scottish history. Anyone would think there was a conspiracy at work. Perhaps Mr Greer, given how keen he is on history, might like to look into that.Read more: Piers Morgan clashes with Ross Greer"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9179752.jpg?type=article-full","title":"scotland-weather-coldest-night-of-2019-as-temperatures-dip-to-136c","story":"Loch Glascarnoch in the Highlandstook the top spot for chilly conditions and reached a low of -.C in the early hours of Thursday.The Met Office issued severe weather warnings for ice, snow and fog, which are set to remain in place throughout Thursday and Friday.#Cold this morning  Last night was the UKs and also all four of the home nations coldest night of the winter so far -. degC at Loch Glascarnoch was the lowest temperature recorded ### pic zycTcvjEZNorthern Ireland, Wales and Englandalso recorded their coldest night, withKatesbridge in Northern Ireland falling to minus .C, Sennybridge, Powys, dropping to minus .C, and Redesdale Camp, Northumberland, experiencing low temperatures of minus .C.The cold weather is not set to leave anytime soon - snow and ice is expected across much of Scotland on Thursday evening, with developing showers causingrain, sleet andsnowto fall on Friday morning.Read more:Scotland set for days of ice and snow as weather warnings issuedMotorists are warned to be cautious on the roads, as ice is likely to fall on untreated areas.The warning comes after a gritter overturned on Wednesday while on duty near Appin.The driver was taken to hospital after the vehicle crashed down an embankment at around .am."},{"url":null,"title":"dundee-graduate-recognised-as-rising-star-in-comics-industry","story":"Anna Morozova left her studies in November, where she graduated with MDes in Comics and Graphic Novels.She was commissioned by one of Britains most successful comics,  AD, to draw for Future Shock, a section dedicated to the best up-and-coming writers and artists.She has provided the art for a story entitled Juncture, written by Andi Ewington, which will appear in the comic later this year.Read more:Dundee le scientist working to eliminate disease knightedAnna said:\"Illustrating a story for  AD is an honour and I am very excited to join the list of creators who contributed to this legendary title.\"It is a fantastic professional starting point which was possible thanks to such a unique programme here in Dundee.\"I hope that the readers will enjoy my art on the pages of the forthcoming Future Shock.\"Finding the right style and approach was probably the most challenging part but I had a job to complete so I tried not to overthink the process.

While they might not appear an obvious concern, the height and movement of wind turbines can have a disruptive impact on aircraft.They can be detected on traditional radar screens, mimicking real aircraft so readily that they have to be avoided by other planes, and can distract air traffic controllers. As a result, the airport says, wind farms can have a detrimental impact on the safety, efficiency and capacity of its local airspace.But the airportrsquos new radar system, Terma SCANTER , mitigates this effect from turbines, and as a result will allow the development of the  turbine Kype Muir Wind Farm to go ahead near Strathaven, Lanarkshire. By law the airport must be consulted on any wind farm development plans within a  kilometre radius.Britainrsquos largest onshore windfarm, Whitelee, south of Glasgow is nearer to the airport, and while the airport has measures mitigate its impact, the equipment is limited and was installed nearly two decades ago.However a spokesman said the more advanced radar system could eliminate concerns about turbines, effectively ldquoremoving them from the air traffic control picture on an inidual basis. He said the airport must be sure that any proposed wind farm development did not pose a risk to the nine million-plus passengers using the airport every year, but the new system should allow it to support both Kype Muir and other future proposals.Glasgow Airport Managing Director Mark Johnston said: ldquoFor the last three years, the Airportrsquos planning team has been worked extremely hard to develop this wind turbine mitigation solution in what is a very complex and safety critical environment. As well as resolving the issue with Kype Muir, the mitigation may also have the potential to resolve issues with other future wind farm proposals.The development was welcomed by Cabinet Secretary for Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity Michael Matheson who described it as ldquoa signicant development for aviation safety.Meanwhile Paul Beat, General Manager for air traffic control company NATS at Glasgow Airport, said: ldquoWersquore delighted to have worked with Glasgow Airport, Banks Renewables and TERMA to deliver a solution that both supports safe and efficient air traffic services, while also allowing this important wind farm development to be built.Glasgow was one of the first airports in the world to deploy large scale wind turbine mitigation in the form of infill radar, a spokesman said.As a result, it has approved % of the  wind turbine applications it received between October  and August .

When he was Prime Minister, James Callaghan ndash as his then son-in-law Peter Jay injudiciously revealed ndash saw himself as Moses, leading his people through the wilderness. Theresa May is even less likely casting in that role, but yoursquoll remember that Exodus had  chapters, and wersquore still quite near the beginning, perhaps round about the stage in the story where people threaten to smite the borders with frogs. Lamentations will come later on.Unfortunately, while Exodus had the most reliable author possible, wersquore getting a narrative on which no one ndash even its authors ndash agrees. The votes this week, for example, were hailed by politicians and commentators as killing off the withdrawal agreement, giving it another stab, fatally undermining it, showing a way to fix it, making no deal less likely, making no deal almost certain, improving the chances of the EU offering concessions, encouraging the EU not to sht an inch, and anything  you can imagine.It would have been a good deal more honest to say, we donrsquot know. Which is, alas, what we ought to say to most of the suggestions for how Brexit might play out. Still, some aspects of the story are possibly a little clearer, and some future developments in the plot more likely than others.I have no idea, and nor does anyone , whether the EU will make any signicant changes to the withdrawal agreement, which it says cannot be renegotiated. But it is the EU which said at the beginning that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, and who voiced approval when Parliament insisted on having its say in the deal. Bearing that in mind, the fact is that the shape of a possible deal on an orderly ndash as opposed to a ldquono deal ndash exit, is very slightly clearer.Or, at least, there is a clear mandate from the Commons for what they donrsquot want: they donrsquot want to remain, they donrsquot want to extend Article  , they donrsquot want a second referendum, they donrsquot want ldquono deal, but they may be prepared to vote for Mrs Mayrsquos dealshe can secure changes to the Irish backstop.A lot of sceptics describe this set of priorities as a unicorn, meaning no such thing can exist in reality. That, I think, is to mistake what reality is. Reality includes a lot of things, including unicorns, which people imagined and then wrote down. Treaties and trade agreements ndash though this is, letrsquos not forget, not a deal about our future relationship with the EU, merely about how we leave ndash are not fixed natural features of the landscape, theyrsquore things people invent and bring into being. If it comes to that, even physical features like national borders are articially created.Those who imagined that a second vote, or simply remaining, could happen should now concede that the parliamentary arithmetic makes that a more fancul idea than some amended version of the withdrawal agreement going through. The prospect of some sane Norwegian or Swiss-style Brexit, unfortunately for those of us who hoped for that, also looks much less likely now.The same is not true of the vote disapproving of no deal in principle, however, and not just because it was advisory, and has no legal force. Itrsquos theoretically possible that ndashno adjustments are forthcoming on the backstop ndash Parliament will try to vote to call the whole thing off, or at least to delay. But given the dficulty of finding any mechanism to avoid no deal so far, itrsquos hard to see how, especially given that there are enough MPs ndash including Labour rebels, judging by the majority this week ndash who think that the political fallout of not leaving will be even worse than any disruption a no-deal Brexit might bring.Parliament, whatever inidual MPs may want or think, is clearly not prepared to imagine a hard border in Ireland. Buttheyrsquore insisting there shouldnrsquot be one, it should make it obvious that the only group arguing for this horrible prospect are the EU.The strangest aspect of the argument over the border is how seldom anyone points out that it already exists, with restrictions on goods and dferences in taxation on either side, and that there was free movement of people across it long before either Ireland or the UK joined the EU. If it becomes a more dficult border in future, it will be for one reason only: the preservation of the EUrsquos single market. Thatrsquos also, by the way, an indication that the single market is not some idealistic free trade area, but a protectionist tarf arrangement for the benefit of EU member states.The question is which of the two stories told by the Commons votes the EU chooses to listen to. One is that there is, potentially, a Commons majority for the withdrawal agreement ndash which, I should point out, is a truly terrible deal for all sorts of reasons which have nothing to do with the backstop, and probably worse than either staying in the EU or leaving without any exit deal ndash but onlythey will drop their claims to enforce and police a section of the UK indefinitely. The other message is that therersquos a narrow majority against no deal at all.That second declaration doesnrsquot strengthen the EUrsquos position in resisting any changes in what has so far been put down as much as it might like, however. There was a much bigger majority against the Cooper amendment that is, against any delay in leaving.

The centre could also help save other threatened species, such as insects and birds.The charity, which already looks after wildcats at its existing Highland Wildle Park in the Cairngorms National Park, has now launched an appeal for donations from the public to help turn the plans in to reality.A charity spokeswoman said: ldquoMost of us yearn to catch a glimpse of the glorious Scottish wildcat, yet never do. If we donrsquot act immediately, we never will.ldquoThe wildcat is teetering on the edge. Though revered, wildcats in Scotland have been persecuted for centuries. Add to that habitat fragmentation, and interbreeding with domestic cats, and it is doubtful that their numbers in the wild now reach three figures.ldquoThe wildcatrsquos survival now hangs tenuously on a dramatic plan to create a National Wildle Reintroductions Centre, in the Cairngorms National Park.ldquoThis state-of-the-art breeding facility will bring together wildcat experts, a dedicated veterinary unit, and a specialised pre-release training programme, focusing initially on wildcats, yet with the flexibility to help other priority species in the future.The mammal is the only wild member of the cat family to survive in Britain. Although they were once found throughout mainland Britain, they have only managed to survive in Scotland. They are the same subspecies of wildcat found in continental Europe, but has been separate since the end of the last ice age around , years ago.Besides hybridisation, other threats to the population include historical and accidental persecution, disease and collisions with vehicles on roads.Although it bears a striking relationship to the tabby cat with regard to its markings, the wildcat can be recognized by its distinctive bushy tail which features black rings, a thick blunt tip, and no stripe down the middle. It also never has white feet.A breeding programme, which is co-ordinated by Scottish Wildcat Action, has been working to restore viable populations of the mammal. The last wildcat to be born in captivity was born at Chester Zoo in August. RZSS is one of multiple partners in the programme.As part of RZSSrsquos appeal, Scottish wildle filmmaker Gordon Buchanan narrated a video where he described the wildcat as ldquoBritainrsquos most threatened mammal... a totemic creature that is equally revered in Scottish culture as it is a precious part of our fauna.Mr Buchanan said: ldquoAs a matter of urgency, ambitious plans are under way to build a national wildle reintroduction centre in the Cairngorms National Park. The Royal Zoological Society of Scotland will run this state-of-the-art facility.ldquoIt will provide the perfect environment for breeding wildcats with the aim of releasing them to re-establish viable populations in key locations.ldquoThe Royal Zoological Society and their partners will use the innovative centre with its expert veterinary provision long in to the future.ldquoOver time, this could help to save other threatened mammals, birds and insects.Appealing for donations, Mr Buchanan added: ldquoScotlandrsquos wildcats are but a whisker away from extinction. Current estimates suggest there could be less than  remaining in the wild.ldquoIf we do not take immediate action, it will be too late. If we donrsquot, the fierce green fire in the eyes of the Highland tiger will be extinguished forever.To donate, visit the RZSS website."},{"url":null,"title":"buddy-bench-scheme-helping-pupils-make-playground-friends","story":"The Buddy Benches scheme encourages youngsters to be kind to their primary-age peers who want someone to play with.Lyne Souter, parent council member, at Warddykes Primary, Arbroath, Angus said: ldquoIf a child feels lonely, they can go to the bench as a signal that they need someone to play with.More than  pupils came up with designs for the benches in a competition and the winning entries were crafted into real benches by Tom Harris-ward, a local chainsaw craftsman.The parent council raised pound, at a Christmas fair for the benches, which have already been popular in schools in America, Ireland and England.Parent council member Julie Hartley thought the idea would work well in her school and decided to hold a competition for children to make their own designs.The competition attracted more than  entries which were judged by councillor Lois Speed.Mrs Hartley said: ldquoIrsquom excited to see an idea turned into something amazing.ldquoThis is the type of thing the parent council love being involved in and itrsquos so positive for the children with a very important message behind them ndash be kind to others.Ms Speed said she was overwhelmed by the quality of entries for what she described as ldquoa heartwarming project.She added: ldquoI absolutely love this project and all that it stands for.

The only problem for the Tory leader would be trying to hold a fractured party together. Nothing new there. Of course people may have failed to vote for many reasons. Among them being that they did not feel that they had the information to make an informed decision of such magnitude.Personally, I believe that the \"golf club rule\" should apply to a ballot on any major change. A mere voting majority is not enough,so, apathy could rule the day. For any major change, people must actively fall in behind it. In most clubs, at least two-thirds of membersmust vote in favour of the change. So please, would Members of Parliament please try to remember what they are there for: to represent the best interests of the British people as a whole, not those in Parliament with the loudest voices.Ken Johnson,Alves, West Gates Avenue,Lochwinnoch.DUNCAN McFarlanesuggests that a second referendum would not be undemocratic, but his point that anti-Brexit leaders have tarnished their argument because their motive is for the UK to remain as part of the EU is surely wrong. He seems to be implying that Brexit is a done deal and no one should oppose it. Assuming that democracy means the will of the people, asking them to have their say on such an important decision as this is essential before stepping into the dark.To call this process a second referendum is a misnomer. The question that it would be asking would be confirmation from the electorate that its intentions for the UK to leave the EU are as they were in June . Leave yes no and If yes to Leave do you want Leave with deal no deal. Should Theresa Mays deal be taken off the table and only No Deal remains, it would be a very brave government which leads us down that road without getting confirmation of it from the people it represents.Mr McFarlane suggests that further questions such as a Norway-style deal or just staying in the single market could be added to the ballot paper. This would only serve to muddy the waters as neither is currently on the table. A confirmation of a decision such as this will only work by asking simple yes no questions that are not open to interpretation.Bill Hendry, Blackwood Road, Milngavie.OUR local MP recently insisted to me that their role is not as delegates, representing sectional interests, but to promote the national interest. His subsequent voting behaviour showed the precise opposite of this, but at least he is right in principle. The appalling self-seeking and tribalism that is evidenced by recent events in Westminster show how far Parliament has abandoned the tenets of Parliamentary democracy.It is now self-evident that there will be only two classes of beneficiaries from whatever form of Brexit occurs. The first will be the cadre of billionaire capitalists, desperate to avoid any controls from Brussels on their tax evasion, dubious financial dealings and exploitation of their workers. The other is the racists and xenophobes who, fed a diet of lies and half-truths by elements of the press, believe that anyone of a dferent skin colour or culture should be prevented from entering this hallowed isle, orthey live here, be sent away. For the rest of us, there is a future of economic problems, reduced opportunities and a retreat from liberal ideals hard won over decades.Yet MPs shamefully continue to hide behind claims about ldquothe will of the people to promote the interests of those two minorities, and to make use of the first-past-the-post election system to keep their place on the gravy train. This trumps any idea of Parliament representing the interests of the country.Dr RM Morris,Veslehaug, Polesburn, Methlick, Ellon.HAVING regard to the present dficulties about the possibility of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in the event of a No Deal Brexit, would these same dficulties not arise should the SNP ever achieve its double target of Scotland leaving the UK and joining the EU  In that situation would there not have to be one hard border between Scotland and Northern Ireland and another between Scotland and England, for the same reasons of on the one hand protecting the purity of the EU single market whilst on the other hand ensuring the freedom of rUK to negotiate its own terms in trade deals with countries outwith the EU On a separate border matter of more pressing concern, as regards the possibility of delays in manual checking of cross-Channel trucks post a No Deal Brexit, could nothing be done to mitigate those delays by checking some or all of the trucks whilst they are in transit on the ferries, or do safety considerations preclude that Alan Fitzpatrick, Solomonrsquos View, Dunlop.I AGREE with Alison Rowat that Inside Europewas an elegant, thorough and balanced look at how the UK, whose relationship with Europe was always fraught and isive, voted to leave the EU in the  referendum .Brook Lapping, the production company, gained access to almost all the key players in the troubled road to that apocalyptic vote. Despite the absence of David Cameron and Theresa May, it was an excellent analysis.Donald Tusk was impressive but it was Nicolas Sarkozy who cut to the heart of the matter, observing the British had always believed that alone they have more influence than working with Europe: ldquoTheyrsquore wrong.For those who thought ordinary people were led astray and a second referendum might save the day it was revelatory.

A shortage, and in some cases an excess of minerals can have a negative effect on production. Supply from pasture can also y through the season, as can livestock requirements.She added: “Fiona and Peter are both enthusiastic and engaging presenters with a great reputation of being able to communicate complex issues in an easily understandable way.

We are also very aware there needs to be some internal structural alterations.Given the urgency, the board is using its capital reserves to order the new air handling unit which is should be installed in March.ldquoIf the equipment breaks down between now and then, the pool will have to close, Mrs Manson said. ldquoSome people attend the pool on a weekly basis and that is what keeps them going. If it has to close for a number of weeks, it can make a real dference to their mobility and pain control.Retired GP Helen Charley, board chairman, said:ldquoHaving been a GP in Cromarty for  years, and having needed both hips and knees replaced, I am all too aware of how vital the Puffin Pool is to the good health and wellbeing of so many patients like me, she said.Established in  by Dr Malcolm Stevens, the pool has provided an average , sessions each year over the past four years.

Publicly, the government has stated that it is focused on getting its spending plans passed and is confident of reaching a compromise.In , when an SNP minority government had its budget defeated by the Scottish Parliament, then-First Minister Alex Salmond threatened a snap election before the deadlock was broken.The current SNP minority has struck a more conciliatory tone and sought to calm speculation about an election, with Finance Secretary Derek Mackay last night appealing for MSPs to “act responsibly”.Last ditch talks are set to continue today in the final hours before a vote, with the Green Party holding out for concessions on local government spending and council tax reform.Mr Mackay must secure the support of the six Green MSPs to pass his budget, with all other opposition parties committed to voting against it.Green Party co-convener Patrick Harvie has dismissed suggestions his party could bring down the government by rejecting the SNP’s budget as a “myth”.But senior Nationalist figures were openly speculating about the possibility of an election earlier in the week, with SNP committee convener Gillian Martin warning Green MSP Andy Wightman on social media that voting down the budget could force an election and put a second Scottish independence referendum at risk.“You’ve seen the way the other parties coalesce against us to try and bring down the government,” Ms Martin posted on Twitter. “Since  everything for them is about defeating the pro-Indy Parliament.”She added: “We are at risk of an election that might see pro Indy parties lose seats and put us in a weaker position.”Polls show the SNP remains in the lead in Scottish Parliament voting intention, but that the nationalists have lost ground compared with their performance in the  Holyrood election where they narrowly lost their majority.Scottish Conservative shadow finance secretary Murdo Fraser claimed uncertainty around the budget showed the SNP were “unfit” for government.“The SNP has neglected the day job so badly that it’s now struggling to get the single-biggest responsibility taken care of. Nicola Sturgeon is so resigned to the weakness of her own administration, she’s been forced to rally the troops for another election.“Hers would be the first government in the history of the Scottish Parliament to call an election because it couldn’t pass a budget.“That would be a shameful legacy, and shows just how unfit the Nationalists are for government of any kind.”Scottish Liberal Democrat campaign chair Alex Cole-Hamilton MSP said: “We’ve made clear to the SNP that we want a budget that focuses on education, mental health and local government funding.“If their inability to get a budget through necessitates a new Scottish Parliament election then I have every hope that people in Scotland will want to use that to eject the Nationalists.”A Labour spokesman said “no credible anti-austerity party would propose” the draft budget put forward by the SNP.With no deal last night, Mr Mackay said: “Our spending plans for the coming year contain additional money for schools and hospitals, protecting vital public services and investing in our economy, while also providing stability amid the ongoing uncertainty caused by Brexit. “With that backdrop in mind, there has never been more need for MSPs, of all parties, to act responsibly and not add to that uncertainty.”Mr Mackay added: “We are open to compromise in order to ensure we deliver the Budget that the country expects.” ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4862285.1548404780!/image/image.jpg","title":"alex salmond unique case is not unprecedented says advocate","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Many people are asking whether Alex Salmond, with his major public profile, could possibly get a fair trial in Scotlandany charges proceed.Many people are asking whether Alex Salmond, with his major public profile, could possibly get a fair trial in Scotlandany charges proceed.If challenged, the court’s answer will be considered in the context of the publicity around the allegations.

Two examples are the trial of William Beggs for what became known as the “Limbs in the Loch” murder, and that of Nat Fraser, who was accused of killing his we, Arlene. There had been a great deal of reporting about the cases and the courts had to decide whether fair trials could be achieved. In both situations, the courts decided the cases could proceed fairly, referring to the safeguards of the passage of time between any publicity and a trial the focusing effect for a jury of listening to the evidence and the strong directions given to a jury in such cases to decide only based on evidence they hear in court.Those representing Salmond may argue that he is uniquely well-known and that some allegations against him have, to an extent, been canvassed in the media. They may say that it will be almost impossible to find jurors who have never heard of him. But that doesn’t matter – more to the point is whether it will be possible to find jurors that are untainted by prejudicial knowledge about the allegations.The Crown will say Contempt of Court rules apply and no-one can now publish anything that might prejudice the trial. There is now signicant protection in place and the media can only really report on procedural aspects such as the fact he has been charged.Very senior people at the Crown Office will be involved in decisions about possible proceedings once they have seen all statements and reports. Meantime, everyone on social and all other media must observe our strict rules about reporting live cases.John Scott is a QC Solicitor Advocate and president of the Society of Solicitor Advocates©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4865749.1548961690!/image/image.jpg","title":"uk to benefit from 31bn eu japan trade deal for just 57 days","story":"A deal expected to boost trade between Europe and Japan by almost  billion eurosa year and save EU companies up to one billion eurosa year in duties comes into effect on Friday.The UK will participate in the EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreementfor just  days before its scheduled departure from the European Union on March .Campaigners for a second Brexit referendum said the EPA highlighted the advantages to the UK of remaining in the EU and the need for the public to be asked again whether they want to leave.International Trade Secretary Liam Fox predicted in  the UK would be able to replicate up to  EU free trade deals for “a second after midnight” on Brexit day.So far none are believed to have been formally signed.Former business secretary Sir Vince Cable, a leading supporter of the People’s Vote campaign, said: “The EU’s trade deal with Japan took years to negotiate and runs to thousands of pages but British business will worry that they might only enjoy the benefits for a few weekswe crash out of the European Union in March.”The Liberal Democrat leader added: “We were told it would be the easiest thing ever to leave the European Union but this deal shows that there is no form of Brexit that fulfils the promises made for Brexit.“Losing access to this trade deal will leave the UK with a worse deal than we already have inside the EU.“For Britain to sign its own trade deal with Japan will take Liam Fox years, and meanwhile the uncertainty will go on and on for British business, costing this country jobs, skills and investment.”Labour MP Jo Stevens, a supporter of the Best for Britain campaign for a second referendum, said: “The EU and Japan between them make up one-third of the world’s GDP.“We’re about to lose access to all this. We are sleepwalking towards a disaster and the Prime Minister needs to wake up and step up.“The advantages of remaining in the EU are growing, not diminishing. It’s time to end the nightmare that is Brexit.”After years of negotiations, the EPA was finalised in  and signed last July, creating the world’s largest bilateral free trade zone, covering  million people.It removes the majority of the one billion eurosof duties paid annually by EU companies exporting to Japan and eliminates a number of non-tarf barriers to trade.Japanese duties of .% on European cheeses, such as Cheddar, will be scrapped and the EU will be able to increase beef exports to Japan “substantially” and sell processed pork products duty-free, the European Commission said.The agreement also opens services markets in the areas of finance, e-commerce, telecommunications and transport and facilitates EU companies’ access to procurement markets in  large Japanese cities.In addition, the protection of geographical indication status will be extended to hundreds of speciality EU agricultural products for sale on the Japanese market.European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said the deal would “turbo-boost” trade and give customers in both markets greater choice and cheaper prices, while providing “gold standard” protections for workers and the environment.“Europe and Japan are sending a message to the world about the future of open and fair trade,” said Mr Juncker.“We are opening a new marketplace, home to  million people and almost a third of the world’s Gross Domestic Product, bringing the people of Europe and Japan closer together than ever before.”Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited Downing Street on January  for talks in which Theresa May said both sides had expressed their hopes for an “ambitious bilateral arrangement, building on the deal already agreed between Japan and the EU”.Shuichi Akamatsu, minister for economic affairs at the Japanese Embassy in the UK, said: “We intend to steadily implement the EPA and further deepen the collaborative relationship between Japan and the EU.“With regard to Brexit, the Japanese government continues to urge both the UK and the EU to secure predictability and legal stability in the process of Brexit, and is watching with great interest in order that the impact on Japanese businesses, as well as the world economy, should be minimised.“When Prime Minister Abe visited the UK last month, he himself earnestly told Prime Minister May that Japan would like a no-deal Brexit to be avoided.“As reconfirmed during the bilateral meeting between the leaders of Japan and the UK, after the UK’s departure from the EU, Japan intends to build swtly on a new economic partnership with the UK using the Japan-EU EPA as a basis.”A Downing Street spokeswoman said “good progress” was being made on a number of trading arrangements to replace the free trade deals that will be lost when the UK leaves the EU.The spokeswoman said there were “strong elementswhich we think could be replicated in our own deal with Japan.”Japanese companies employ around , people in the UK and trade between the two countries totalled £ billion in the past year.Major employers such as Nissan and Honda, which invested in the UK as a gateway to the European market, have voiced concern about the potential impact of Brexit.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"kalfordhame sandness shetland","story":"Offers over £,- bed bungalow for sale in Sandness.

find made in Kingussie","story":"EXPERTS have said there is still much in the pipeline when it comes to telling the story of Kingussies forgotten friary uncovered during recent work by Scottish Water.The firm has just completed the project that will help to safeguard the future of supply of the water network in Mill Road and the High Street.But progress was briefly interrupted in early December, last year, by the discovery of the foundations of a long forgotten Carmelite friary, together with human remains believed to date back to the Middle Ages.In consultation with Highland Council, a specialist archaeological consultant working for Scottish Water recorded the finds.A full report on the discovery will be published later in the year once post-excavation analysis is completed.Scottish Waters project manager Ailsa Shaw said: \"At Highland Councils request, we had an archaeologist on site to monitor the work close to the old burial ground, but the discovery of such a fascinating part of Kingussies past was a surprise.\"Its exciting that our work will help an important part of the communitys story to be told ndash and we look forward to seeing the results of the archaeological follow-up work later in the year.\"Steven Birch of West Coast Archaeology is carrying out the archaeological work on Scottish Waters behalf.He commented: \"The story of this site is still emerging and will continue to do so as the results of post-excavation analysis are ed over the months ahead.\"What we found was the foundations of an early church, with fragmentary burials placed within its walls, as was once common practice.\"Its likely this was associated with the Carmelite friary that we believe was established in the area over  years ago.\"However, some records suggest the presence of an earlier chapel at the site with Columban foundations, which may date to the Early Medieval period.\"Radiocarbon dating of the human remains will be crucial in establishing an overall chronology for the remains of the church and the human remains it contains.\"The continuing work should allow us to confirm this and provide an insight to le in the area during that period.\"Friday  Feb  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/KEEP-TO-THE-LEFT-SHARON-ANSLOW-1-Copy.jpg","title":"skye womans keep left campaign gathers","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineStickers in hired cars, improved signage and leaflets in tourist accommodation have all been suggested as practical moves to encourage visitors to the Highlands to remember to drive on the left.An awareness campaign on the issue has gathered recent momentum thanks to the efforts of a Skye woman who was involved in an accident near Sligachan at the end of last month.Sharon Anslow was injured in the crash on the th of December – an incident which she says happened after she moved to avoid an oncoming car on the same side of the road.In the wake of the incident Sharon, from Carbost, launched a ‘keep left’ petition and her work has been backed by local politicians.Last weekend Sharon met with MSP Kate Forbes, Skye Councillor John Finlayson and Skye police Sergeant Bruce Crawford to discuss ways to bolster the awareness campaign.Calls have been made for Transport Scotland to install extra signs and paint new road markings, while Visit Scotland are being asked to support a leafleting campaign.Dashboard stickers are also being organised for local car-hire companies, with the target being to pressure national firms to follow suit and install similar notices inside all their vehicles.Police plan to aid support to the campaign by stopping and issuing advice to drivers as they cross the bridge.Kate Forbes MSP said: “It was a very constructive meeting with Councillor John Finlayson, Sergeant Bruce Crawford and Sharon Anslow.“We had a robust conversation about road safety in Skye and Lochalsh and what further actions we could take to change this.“Sharon is a remarkable woman as it’s only a few weeks since she was in a traumatic accident and already she’s campaigning and working to ensure there are fewer accidents.“Her ‘Keep Left’ campaign has galvanised people across the world, some of whom have been to Skye on holiday.“I will be organising the next meeting with Transport Scotland to discuss signage, road markings and other things.“In the meantime, I’ll be writing to VisitScotland and all the car hire companies to ask them to ensure there is information for visiting drivers.“There’s a lot we can do and I’m delighted to be working with Sharon as well as John and Bruce.”Councillor John Finlayson added: “It was very useful to meet up with Sharon, Kate and Bruce to exchange ideas and plan how we can move forward support for Sharon’s Keep Left campaign and hopefully improve road safety on Skye and across the Highlands generally.“We will continue to liaise to move forward the actions we agreed and organise a meeting with Transport

If anything, it should be amplied.It turned into a trilogy. There was a Great Book of Skye Two in , and now we have the #Great Book of Skye Three#.That was perhaps predictable. In the first volume, Cailean Maclean commented that he had two problems in persuading Norman Macdonald to prepare the book. The first problem was to get him to start the second was to get him to stop.Three books and , pages later, the prof has stopped — or so he says.The three volumes comprise a Dictionary of Skye Biography. The lives of almost , people are profiled and illustrated inside their pages. They have all #been Skye born or bred or are people who have had an intimate connection with the island. They have all been noteworthy in one way or another… #There has never been more than , people living in Skye at any one time, and for much of history — particularly recent, recorded history — its population has been much smaller than that.Nobody, however, will be too surprised that Norman and Cailean uncovered and portrayed over a thousand eminent Sgiathanaich. Without wishing to kickstart Norman once again, the miracle is that they enumerated so few. The island, like almost all Hebridean islands, has been a breeding ground of talent and character.The only other qualication for entry in the Great Books of Skye is that you must be dead. You, dear reader, however, accomplished you might be, will not be able to read your entry unless metaphysics permits you access from your celestial cloud. These are obituaries, not panegyrics.That lends a sombre tone to certain pages of the Great Book of Skye Three. There are people featured here who, we are sharply reminded, were alive when volume one was in preparation.Here, for instance, is the smiling face of Dr Vicky Ann Galbraith, who was born in Portree in  and who died at home in Aird Bernisdale of brain cancer in .Vicky Ann was achievement personied. A leading scientist for Roche Pharmaceuticals, she also played for Scotland#s national women#s rugby union team on  occasions. Following her fatal diagnosis, she raised thousands of pounds for cancer research by leading sponsored walks from Portree to Glasgow, up the West Highland Way and where.Here is Thomas William Mackenzie. You may have known him as Tommy. He was born in  and he died last March. He was, in the GBS abbreviated subheading, a #printmaker, etcher and gallery owner, Chieftain of Skye Highland Games, boat race devotee, tug-of-war revivalist, shinty enthusiast, and half-marathon runner.#That just about covers it, as a dictionary of biography is forbidden to indulge itself and cannot add that for very many people, Tommy Mackenzie was the face and personality of modern Portree.These volumes, these hefty Great Books of Skye, are a leisurely parade along Wentworth Street and then out to the peninsulas, pausing to wave at or pass the time of day with Victorian land reformers, clan chiefs, bards, teachers, surgeons, fishermen, and climbers. It#s a verbal Skye equivalent of the cover of #Sergeant Pepper#s Lonely Hearts Club Band#.Sir Harold Boulton was not a Sgiathanach. He came from Hertfordshire and was educated at Harrow and Oxford.In  he married into the Highland quality via a Dingwall military family. Boulton already had an interest in Gaelic song and music.He enters the Great Book of Skye because, in the late th century, Boulton seems to have heard a Gaelic rowing song and put his own, English, words to the tune.Those lyrics and that tune have become internationally known as #The Skye Boat Song#. Norman Macdonald digresses wonderfully on Boulton#s creation of a supposed Jacobite anthem.We are still left with the dilemma of the bonnie boat#s journey. The original Gaelic version may have celebrated a voyage from Torrin to Loch Coruisk. For most of the th century, it was assumed to refer to Charles Edward Stuart#s post-Culloden flight by sea from the mainland to Skye.As Charles never made such a journey directly by sea, pedants have more recently suggested that Boulton must have been referring to the Pretender#s actual sea voyage It really, really, does not matter. We are in the realms of mythology. Charles may as well have been sailing from Papua New Guinea. Harold Boulton invented the whole damn thing — the misty isle#s most famous song is a Victorian concoction — and in recognition of that, he deserves his entry in the Great Book of Skye Three.And finally, here we are back in Portree. William Cowie was born in Kiltarlity in  and became an agricultural advisor in Skye in the s. The brother of a professional footballer, Cowie devoted himself to shinty and became one of the greatest players of his era.Fittingly, he married in  a grand-daughter of the captain of the Skye shinty team which had won the inaugural MacTavish Cup in .William and Margaret Cowie had two sons, Ross and William. He died too young, at the age of  years, while playing badminton in Portree Drill Hall.William Cowie would, therefore, have been shy of his th birthday had he led his natural course to June  and a day in Fort William which would have caused him, more even than the rest of Skye, unimaginable pride.It is tempting to say of all three Great Books of Skye that they are for dipping in and out rather than reading as a single narrative. The trouble with that suggestion is that once you#ve dipped in, it is very hard to dip out again.As a trilogy, they are a phenomenal publishing achievement. They should take their place, alongside the inevitable Tommy Mackenzie print, in every home in Skye."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/INDOOR-SHINTY-19-P4-7-FINAL-2.jpg","title":"skye schools indoor shinty competition all the action in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineYoung shinty players fromthroughout Skye gathered to take part in two indoor tournaments for primary school teams last weekend.Portree High’s Fingal Centre hosted competitions for P-P and for P-and-under teams.On a fast and furious day of excellent shinty action teams fromBun-sgoil Ghàidhlig Phort Rìgh won both competitions.Broadford were runners up in the P- competition, with North West taking second spot in the P-under tournament following an epic final."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/web-subs-3.jpg","title":"skye charities work to be showcased at skeabost","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA multi-charity event will be held in Skeabost on Saturdayto highlight the work of several good causes across Skye.The event will be held at Skeabost Memorial Hall from  am until  pm and will provide information on the work carried out by a iety of charities in the area, as well as insight into the costs and challenges they face.to raise awareness of the event, which will support Skye and Lochalsh Young Carers the Skye and Lochalsh Foodbank Crossroads Care # Skye and Lochalsh Macmillan Cancer Support Skye Dance Bloodwise, and Rotjanas Hands, which Mr Williams set up with his we nearly  years ago.He said: “I have been an independent fundraiser for many years – I am a trustee of Rotjanas Hands – formally known as Hands Across the Water – which I set up alongside my we following the Indonesian Tsunami .”He added: “For me, it has always been important to share particularly when we are so fortunate and others not so.

Before his Patriots took the field to play the Chargers in the AFC Quarter finals two weeks ago, hetold his players this would be his last home game.His team came out fired up, and played a perfect first half of football and the game was never in doubt.Last week, he was non-committal on his future again, and heading to Kansas City to play the favoured Chiefs, his teammates came out fired up.His buddy and favourite target Julian Edelman printed up t-shirts that said #Bet Against Us# and no doubt, which had his team feeling like they were true underdogs, and they were finished # the dynasty over.If you bet against Tom Brady # you lose. You usually lose. However, Brady was asked yesterday what was the chance that Sundays final would be his last game. #Zero.#He should have led us and everyone to believe that he would retire after the Superbowl, Surely at  years old, he can#t go on anymore. Chiefs, Steelers, Ravens and basically fans of the other  teams would be happy to see him retire, and stop hogging all the rings.Why retire, when you can basically take the regular season off, play the terrible teams in your own ision twice a year, make sure the referees don#t let anyone knock you down, and play two playoff games before taking the stage in another Super Bowl  He says he wants to play  more years. His playoff stats are ridiculous. Nine Super Bowl appearances.  AFC Championship games.  straight ision titles.I suppose I should mention the other team playing in the Superbowl # the LA Rams. Yes they spent big money to get here, yes they have Aaron Donald, and wonder-coach Sean McVay. And even though I was born in Los Angeles, I have a hard time taking this team serious. They looked finished in the beginning of the Saints game, only to find their composure, and with the help of the referees, they won in New Orleans. But this game is something dferent.The Patriots have a whole dferent playbook for the Superbowl. They#ve been there before, again and again.

Squinter’s been running his eye over the top-performing personalities as we hurtle towards the ration book, conscription, petrol riots and raffling oranges. Jacob Rees Mogg’s rocky road to DublinArch remainer Lord Snooty has made a fortune from providing financial services through his company, Somerset Capital Management . Thoughhe will be luxuriously insulated from the worst effects of a no-deal Brexit evenhe never worked another day in his le, he is a leading light in the fanatically anti-EU European Research Group , which makes UKIP look like the Alliance Party and which sees a Brexit crash-out as pretty much an ideal scenario. But as the Brexit negotiations descended into chaos and then high comedy, SMG decided that it was time to open two new funds in, ah, Ireland. Although Jacob is a co-founder of the company and is paid £, a month for doing eight hours work a week for the company , he said the decision to set up business in Irelandwas nothing to do with him. Asthat’s not bad enough, the company’s prospectus for the coming financial identies among the key ‘risks’ facing the business in the coming financial year is ‘Brexit’. Simply spfing, old bean.Boris and his zig-zag BrexitBack in  when Boris Johnson was still considering what outcome in the Brexit referendum would be best for him – sorry, for the country – his close pal Sir Nicholas Soamestweeted this: “Whatever my great friend Boris decides to do I know that he is NOT an outer.” But regardless of where his heart and or his head is, Boris is certainly shoulder-to-shoulder with Jacob in the vanguard of the hard Brexit storm troops. ’Twas not always thus, truth to tell. Pre-referendum Boris famously came out for Brexit in his Dailycolumn. But what people didn’t know until some time later was that Boris had written two columns that week for the : one pro-Brexit and one pro-Remain. In the pro-Remain column, which was never published in the paper, he wrote: “Shut your eyes. Hold your breath. Think of Britain. Think of the rest of the EU. Think of the future. Think of the desire of your children and your grandchildren to live and work in other European countries to sell things there, to make friends and perhaps to find partners there.” Cue soaring violins. Boris’s most recent comment on the single market was that it is “useless” In  he said in Paris: “Personally, I would like to stay in the single market. We need to stay in the council of ministers of the internal market. In my view, the British have done good things for Europe.” Google Boris’s stunned reaction when the referendum vote was announced and then remember what Nick Soames tweeted.Nigel glad to be rid of the EU Former UKIP leader and Brexit poster boy Nigel Farage has two children by his German we, Kirsten Mehr. He has told journalists that both of them support England at the football, so that’s alright then. Except they both have German passports and so, thrillingly, unlike their English neighbours, will continue to enjoy free movement throughout the EU post-Brexit. And, of course, Nigel will continue to draw his £, per year EU pension – no-one hates the EU that much, not even our Nige. Squinter was particularly moved by Nigel’s claim in the weeks leading up to the referendum that staying in Europe would “spell the end of the steel industry in this country”. But Nige and his UKIP colleagues were in  among a tiny number of MEPs to vote against a move to tighten up rules on the import of cheap non-EU steel. Business, as they say, is business. The Man from the Daily MailFormer Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre was the man responsible for all those headlines that frightened the horses during the referendum campaign and, subsequently, the attacks on Parliament and the judiciary as the political and legal implications were fought out. So he’s the Brexiter’s Brexiter. But it’s estimated that as a landowner Dacre benefited to the tune of around £, a year in EU subsidies. The veteran journalist was on over £m a year towards the end of his time with the Mail, so he’ll not be begging outside the Red Lion in his local villagethe UK leaves the EU. Brexit-voting and Mail-reading Farmer Browns, however, may be left sucking thoughtfully on a wheat stalk as they contemplate their own looming subsidy deficit, which may not be so lightly borne.Bordering on the ridiculousThe DUP’s singular focus as we hurtle towards Brexit D-Day is to block any deal that involves regulatory ergence with the mother ship – in other words: we must be treated exactly the same as Britain by the EU. Whether that’s a gentle wave goodbye with best wishes, or a massive, eye-watering boot in the ging-gangs matters not. We’re all in this together . The DUP’s insistence on alignment with the ‘mainland’ may be extremely touching, but it is an entirely new concept, for this little corner of empire long ago gave up any pretence of a claim to be as British as Finchley. Presumably, the party will continue to lobby for a dferent VAT and Passenger Duty regime post-Brexit, for they were white-hot on those ideas before the EU balloon went up. They’ll continue to block defamation law reform, keeping loyal Ulster as a magnet for libel tourists . Most famously, the DUP remains the bulwark against the equal marriage and abortion rights that are accorded to every other part of these two islands. Luckily, the party stood firm and insisted that Are Wee Country has to have exactly the same RHI regime as across the water, avoiding the possibility of widespread and catastrophically expensive abuse of the boiler scheme*Sub-editors: please check this last line for accuracy. Thanks, SquintPapers, pleaseAndrew Bridgen, Tory MP for West Leicestershireis another European Research Group charmer, without the profile of Jacob Rees Mogg but with the same level of warmth and likeability. Andy’s most notable brush with fame before Brexit thrust him into the public eye alongside Boris and Jacob was his posting of a raunchy video on a WhatsApp group composed of Tory MPs, some of them ministers. Suffice to say that the video included a scantily clad woman, a man and a sports car. A suitably repentant Andy explained to colleagues that it had been a terrible error caused by “fat fingers”. In October past he said in a radio interview that all English people are entitled to an Irish passport, a claim that nearly caused Twitter to explode and was the impetus for more jokes than Ian Paisley’s summer holidays.In response to a question on free movement between Britain and Ireland post-Brexit, Andy said: “As an English person, I do have the right to go over to Ireland and I believe that I can ask for a passport. Can’t I ” No, Andy, mate, you can’t. We’ve enough West Brits on this island, ta very much.Doctor Jekyll and Mr SnideThat Michael Gove’s a reasonable bloke, ain’t he  There he’s been for the past few months, urging cool heads and common sense, quietly and assiduously working to help Prime Minister Theresa may with a withdrawal agreement that’s harder to sell than a Northern Ireland shirt in O’Neills. While those nasty Brexit nutjobs in the ERG snarl and threaten, Michael’s been a model of loyalty and stf upper-lipped British discretion. But wait. Wasn’t it a bloke who looked exactly like him who said during the campaign that Turkey was about to join the EU, opening the gates to allow five million-plus Turks to come cascading into the UK.Yes, indeed: it was Michael Gove who made that claim.

An SDLP conference is scheduled to take place on February  in Newry where the party membership is set to vote on the plans.Speaking exclusively to the Andersonstown News. West Belfast Councillor Tim Attwood said he was “not an advocate of the SDLP and Fianna Fáil partnership”. It’s known that South Belfast MLA Claire Hanna is also at odds with the party leadership over its move to link up with Fianna Fáil.“I recognise that the political landscape of this island has been changed utterly given the failure of the DUP and Sinn Féin to bring back the power-sharing Executive, the catastrophic consequences of Brexit and the emerging debate about Irish unity,” said Cllr Attwood.Cllr Attwood continued: “I have the greatest respect for the leadership of the SDLP and recognise that in a post-conflict situation there is a natural and wider debate about political realignment on this island,” he said. “The reality is my politics is steadfastly rooted in the social democratic and labour traditions embodied by the SDLP and parties of the Party of European Socialists.”Mr Attwood, who has served as a West Belfast councillor these past  years, said that over the coming days he would be speaking to his family and SDLP members in his constituency area about the proposal for a new partnership between the SDLP and Fianna Fáil. “I will make a further statement after these discussions,” he added.Meanwhile, SDLP Lagan Valley MLA Pat Catney is supporting the party leadership in entering into a partnership with Fianna Fáil.Mr Catney said: “Northern Ireland is crying out for a response to the fast changing and signicant challenges across these islands as a result of Brexit. “Twenty years after the Good Friday Agreement, people here must be offered something new, credible and forward-looking in its approach.”The Lagan Valley MLA added: “Brexit has shted the political sands dramatically. It poses many challenges that sit outside the boundaries of local devolution. Our politics in the past two years, a politics of ision, of deadlock and of repetition is frighteningly at odds with the vast challenges that now face us. Old solutions to new challenges can no longer cut it.“It has always been the SDLP’s vision to unite our people. To seek an Ireland, befitting of the st century, where opportunity and prosperity are more than slogans on a placard but a way of le whether you are Catholic, Protestant or Dissenter. That will never change.“I am all too aware of the uneasiness some of my unionist neighbours may feel about this new partnership. Neighbours who have put their trust in me in countless elections. But let me be crystal clear a new Ireland, one without the full inclusivity of unionism is not one I want to be part of let alone build. You are part of the fabric of this island, woven into history every bit as much as any nationalist and you are a critical part of its future.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"its good to talk media take note","story":"“You are trying to achieve Irish Unity by stealth.” The woman spoke accusingly.I was sitting in Dublin. In the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs’ building. It was a meeting to discuss women, peace and security. It was like being thrust back into the early s when words like Irish unity were considered “succour to terrorism”. In some ways I felt a little sorry for this  counties-born woman. She clearly had been influenced by the Section  RTÉ psyche and hasn’t kept up since the Good Friday Agreement. But maybe that’s patronising. Maybe she feels sorry for me.The accusation was made as I and my colleague explained how Irish citizens, particularly women, are having their rights denied to them in the north east of our country, and how under the terms of citizenship and responsibility in the Good Friday Agreement the Irish government need to step up and ensure they defend those citizens’ rights and not hide. The woman, who lives near the north-south border, is challenged by challenging self-imposed borders. It set the tone for the week.On Saturday, Queen’s University human rights Professor Colin Harvey, a very quietly spoken, humble inidual, took to the stage in the Waterfront at the first-of-its-kind nationalist conference. I was lucky enough to introduce him and take a seat next to him. The stage was shaking as he forcefully and loudly proclaimed: “We will not be seeking permission from anyone to talk about the unity of our country” “we apologise to no-one for being here today and having the conversation about the rights of Irish citizens.”Yep, it was that kind of week. The content of the Beyond Brexit conference, despite its wealth, was almost lost as the issue became about whether Irish citizens have the legitimate right to talk to each other about Irish unity or Brexit or both. Some unionists and media outlets felt that they should have a veto on how Irish nationalists will frame their own conversations. The manufactured ‘controversy’ was a modern-day version of those old laws which forbade Catholics congregating in numbers of more than five for fear they might engage in sedition. Indeed, the post-conference coverage has continued to focus on nationalists daring to hold such a professional well-attended conference as a spectacle, rather than these citizens raising issues that need to be engaged with.And of course, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have played the game too by telling us when it is appropriate to talk about a border poll. Their words would have far more meaningthey were calling on working groups in the Oireachtas to draw up policies and plans that might form part of a conversation on unity – like they did in addressing the referendum on the th Amendment, when they were actually trying to address violations of human rights and not just assuage them. Their tones of moderation feed the narrative that us northern nationalists are just too hot-headed or maybe even dangerous when we push at constitutional obligations. That feeds the concept of us being a people apart and tells us something about their complicity in the problem.I was reminded of the words of Parnell, written on his statue in Dublin:“No man has the right to say to his country, ‘Thus far shalt thou go and no further.’” "},{"url":null,"title":"bbcs nolan defends northern ireland is not in ireland comment if you want to bury your head in sand i cant do anything about that","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But when her former employer paid her wages into her bank account a day late, Orlagh claimed she couldnt access the £ December payment she was legally entitled to.Two months on - and currently thousands of pounds in debt - the -year-old from Dunmurry still hasnt received a penny and revealed that shes getting more and more desperate.\"Im living on money borrowed from my mother and my friends,\" she said. \"Its very stressful. Im trapped in this world now.\" Despite no longer being able to afford to eat or heat her home, Orlagh said shes been desperately trying to get other reception work, although the odds are stacked against her.\"Ive been sitting for days on end with no gas and empty cupboards,\" she said. \"Ive been for interviews but my confidence and self-esteem are gone. In my job, grooming and presentation are important youre expected to have your nails painted, your make-up on and no grey roots showing.\"I have no money to get my hair done. Im having trouble with a tooth, but I cant afford to see a dentist. Who is going to employ a toothless receptionist with grey roots \" She added: \"I havent kept my spirits up. Ive turned off people on social media to avoid upsetting myself over what theyre doing and what theyve got.\"The Department for Communities said that while it cannot comment on inidual cases, it is \"looking into the concerns raised in this case\".Orlagh said her money problems first began on August , , when her working tax credits stopped after her son Oisin turned  and left full-time education.\"That basically plunged me into financial chaos,\" she said.\"I was on a -hour contract at my previous job and when I asked my employer for at least  hours they couldnt offer me anything extra, so I had to leave.\"I was frantic. I was in real financial trouble so in a blind panic of desperation I left a job I really loved for another offering more hours.\"Prior to switching employers, Orlagh, whose only luxury is her television, said she really tried to make ends meet.\"From August  until October I lived on a part-time wagewith no benefit help and it wasnt enough - I was hungry,\" she said. \"Thats why I took a job offering more hours. But, after a one-month trial period, it didnt work out.\"With a monthly rent bill of £, and a weekly spend of £ on electricity and £ on gasand £ on work transport, Orlagh found that it all soon adds up.\"I dont have a mobile phone or extravagant expenses. I dont go on holiday,\" she said.The new job lasted from October  until November . When she phoned to claim Universal Credit the next day, she was initially told to register online.But she couldnt register online because she didnt have the right technology. Therefore, she physically had to visit the job centre and was told to expect a five-week wait for payment.\"I hadnt been paid since October, when I left the previous job, so by that stage I was in minus figures,\" she said.\"I was supposed to receive £ on January  for the month of December - and that includes my rent - but I didnt get anything because my last employer paid me a day late, on November .\"I have repeatedly explained that the wages paid into my account on November  represent earnings from October  to November , .\"But they refuse to accept this. According to their computer, those wages were earned between November  and December , . \"Therefore nothing can be done to help me.\"Orlagh raised a complaint on January . But, three weeks later, there is still no news and she is yet to receive a payment. Meanwhile, she revealed that her financial situation is likely to get even worse as she struggles to repay two government loans.\"There was no Universal Credit payment in December and goodness knows when Ill get something,\" she said.\"I wouldnt have a penny to my nameI hadnt borrowed around £ from the Social Fund to see me through. \"But because Im also paying back another Social Fund loan from a previous time, it means that £ a week will be taken out of my £ Universal Credit benefit when I finally get it.\"Orlagh said she was speaking out today to reduce the stigma of being poor because \"there are so many people out there who are pretending that everything is OK when its not\".She added: \"One catastrophic event after another has led me to this position.\"Im not a tracksuit-wearing person out on the streets whos never worked a day in her le. Once youre on minimum wage youre screwed youre nothing.\" The Department for Communities said statistics are not available to confirm how many local families rely on Universal Credit.In a statement it added: \"Current figures at January ,  show , live claims in respect of , claimants.\"The department also said there have only been  complaints since Universal Credit was introduced here in September .What the Department for Communities says... “Universal Credit is assessed on a monthly basis and is based on the claimant’s circumstances and earnings. All claimants are offered an Advance Paymentthey feel they will need financial support during the wait for the first payment, which can be up to % of the estimated entitlement.“DFC has also put in place a Universal Credit Contingency Fund, available to customers who require further financial assistance before receiving their Universal Credit. Unlike advance payments, the Universal Credit Contingency Fund payments are non-repayable grants. Loans or grants are also available through the Discretionary Support Service which is unique to Northern Ireland and helps customers who require short term assistance in crisis or emergency situations.“The Department has been working closely with the Independent Advice sector to prepare customers for the introduction of Welfare Reform and has provided funding in the region of £m to the advice sector to provide support for claimants impacted by Welfare Reform.” "},{"url":null,"title":"giant rats causing light bulbs to explode northern ireland homes invaded by rodents size of cats","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There is an obligation on people to actually have pragmatic solutions rather than wishful thinking.\"He said Ireland \"will insist\" the UK keeps its word to the people of Northern Ireland and the way to overcome the obstacles was through the future relations talks during the transition period.\"The backstop is already a compromise. It is a series of compromises. It was designed around British red lines,\" he said.\"Ireland has the same position as the European Union now, I think, when we say that the backstop as part of the withdrawal agreement is part of a balanced package that isnt going to change.\"However responding, the Health Secretary Matt Hancock said delaying Brexit would not resolve the issues.

He said Mr Varadkar was reminding people of what the border once looked like.\"What I would ask people to think about is how far we have come in the last  years and what the peace agreement has done for relationships between our two island.

There have been more than a dozen amendments tabled including ensuring there can be no departure in a no deal, delaying Brexit and binning the backstop and looking for \"alternative arrangements\".\"There is no magic solution here for this problem,\" Mr Coveney continued.\"If there was it would have emerged by now and that is why Ireland will insist on the UK keeping its word to Ireland, the EU and the people of Northern Ireland in terms of protecting a fragile but hugely valuable peace process.\"Askedthe Commons voted on finding alternative arrangements to the backstop, would the withdrawal agreement be \"holy text\" and untouchable the TD said that would be like asking Ireland to renege on its commitments and instead replace them with a hope something would be found.Listen to what the people of Europe are saying.FacebookTwitterHe said the way to tackle the issues was in the future trade relations talks.\"That is the way I hope these negotiations will go rather than the British parliament deciding on something that may command a majority in Westminster but has no chance of getting agreement or ratication in the EU.\"Listen to what people are saying in Europe. This is not just about Britains future. This is about how we work together in the future.\"He added: \"People keep talking about games of chicken and the UK position being against the Irish or the EU position. We are all trying to work together here.\"Britain and Ireland are two islands next door to each other, we have an extraordinary history at times a very tragic history. But we have to work out these things together and stop talking about games of chicken.\"Mr Coveney said he did not believe the only reason for Theresa Mays crushing defeat in the Commons earlier this month was down to the backstop alone.\"If you look at the withdrawal agreement it is actually not that controversial. It is about protecting citizens rights.. about protecting British citizens rights in the EU .. its about a financial settlement.. its about creating the time and space for a transition period.. for preparing for new realities.\"And its about protecting a peace process which I believe the Prime Minister is deeply committed to.\"He added: \"The problem with the argument is that nobody has come up with a pragmatic, sensible and legally sound way of avoiding border infrastructure reemerging between the two jurisdictions on the island of Ireland. And that is why it took two years to get the backstop agreed and that is why I believe the Prime Minister is correct when she defends it.\""},{"url":null,"title":"tsb blames it meltdown for 105 4m loss","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is situated at Belvedere Pl, Mountjoy, in Dublin which is a short five-minute walk to Temple Street Children’s University Hospital and close to other hospitals in the city.Whilst at Hugh’s House, parents are also able to share their own experiences which helps build an important support network at what is a very distressing time.‘Lesaver’googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshCllr Donnelly said the fundraising event at Creggan Community Collective on January  exceeded all expectations with people throughout the city supporting it.  The sponsored spin cycle covered  miles - the distance from Derry to Dublin.He commented: “We had a huge response, a lot of people took part in the cycle.  It was a km cycle and all sorts of people did shts, organisations, women’s groups and we well exceeded what we expected.“There is still some money coming in, UNISON just donated £ today and parent and toddler groups helped us out too.  When me and Paul Gallagher went down the Lord Mayor of Dublin was running afor Hugh’s House and there was another gentleman.  We were lucky enough that we met Ade and Martin who took us a tour around.“And whilst we were there we actually met two families from Letterkenny, but there have been a number of families from the council district who have been using it over the last while that we know of.”Speaking about local families who have availed of the service, he added: “I know a family who was supported by Hugh’s House in recent weeks, the mother was rushed to hospital in Dublin because there were no beds in the north.  The father was upset and they were stranded in the middle of Dublin with no contacts and had to find somewhere to sleep.“So it was through that that we phoned Hugh’s House and they were very helpful.  They then go through a social worker and visit the people in hospital, and they were lucky that two rooms had become available at the time.  The father was moved in and then when the mother got out of hospital she was able to use it as a base from which to visit the baby in hospital on a daily basis.“We talked to one of the families from Letterkenny who have three other children and, they said to us, ‘without this service we don’t know what we would have done.’  If you put yourself in that position, the hotels in Dublin are expensive, a child can be in for weeks, months or even a year in some cases then you couldn’t survive, people have bills to pay – it’s a lesaver for some people.”Photo: Cllr Paul Gallagher, Maria Kirby-BrennanAde Stack, Martin Curleyand Cllr Gary Donnelly."},{"url":null,"title":"newly acquired duncreggan road land may provide student parking solution","story":"The Ulster University Vice Chancellor has been urged to make available newly acquired lands at the old Foyle College for student parking in order to ease congestion in the Duncreggan area.SDLP MLA Mark H.

It is spread by elm bark beetles that burrow their way into the dying tree and lay eggs. Rather than felling it at that time, Council has actively monitored the condition of the dead tree and carried out successive crown reductions.  The tree was the centre piece of ‘Dead On’ - a Void Gallery sound artwork by Locky Morris in  and stands before the stunning backdrop of St Eugene’s Cathedral and the wider cityscape. Council’s Tree and Woodland Officer Brendan Garthwaite is responsible for the management of all Council owned trees and woodlands. He explained that the decision was made to remove the tree as it has now reached the end of its natural le, even as a standing structure. “We have been closely monitoring the tree’s condition for some time and unfortunately its condition has continued to deteriorate with several major cracks beginning to appear in the dead branches of the crown. “We manage the trees in Brooke Park to ensure they are kept in good condition and to sustain their presence. “We appreciate the affection that exists for the tree locally but we have had to take the decision to act and remove it in the interests of public safety.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"trade union seeks talks defend derry tesco staff","story":"Tesco’s decision to cut thousands of jobs including those at its Derry stores has put ‘corporate greed’ ahead of workers’ needs, according to a local trade union.The UKs largest supermarket has announced it will close food counters in ninety of its stores as part of a wider cost-cutting plan that will affect , staff.Yesterday, the retail giant told the Derry News that it could not confirm how many staff would be affected at its Derry stores – based at the Strand Road, Lisnagelvin and Crescent Link – but it is understood that several managers and around - staff could be at risk of losing their jobs.Tesco has said that due to customers ‘shopping in dferent ways’ and using counters ‘less frequently’ its remaining fish, meat and deli counters in  stores will be run on a full-time or flexible basis.It confirmed it will no longer offer a hot food service at its canteens which will impact those hired by third party caterers.Head office staff will also be cut, however, Tesco does not plan to make any signicant changes to bakeries “this year” despite media reports to that effect.  Up to , workers will be affected but half could be redeployed to other customer-facing roles.More than , jobs have already been cut at Tesco since the current chief executive, Dave Lewis, took over in .Jason Tarry, CEO, UK  ROI said: “In our four years of turnaround we’ve made good progress, but the market is challenging and we need to continually adapt to remain competitive and respond to how customers want to shop.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“We’re making changes to our UK stores and head office to simply what we do and how we do it, so we’re better able to meet the needs of our customers.

However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive.Despite a number of protracted attempts to secure the site and hopes that a deal could be agreed, it was bought by supermarket giant Lidl.While widely regarded as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor leisure facility and while there are some politicians who would like a swimming pool as part of any new development in the resort, this seems unlikely given there are local authority pools in Downpatrick, Kilkeel and Newry.It was previously suggested that the sale of the Annesley Buildings would free up the site for a new hotel and, signicantly, generate funds to help provide new leisure provision in the resort. But that now looks unlikely.As part of the drive to signicantly enhance leisure provision in the resort, council officials are continuing to work alongside education officials to develop a major new sports hub.Shimna Integrated College is planning to redevelop its King Street site which would include the creation of additional sports facilities at nearby Donard Park.It has been suggested that the proposed sports facilities could potentially be developed by the Department of Education in partnership with Newry, Mourne and Down Council with pitches and a sports pavilion forming the new sports hub which could also used by the community.While discussions are ongoing, the local authority still has to address the issue of no meaningful indoor sports facility in the resort to cater for both residents and visitors and is turning its attention to the Annesley Buildings site.Senior council officials have admitted that their initial thoughts about using the location for a town centre hotel have changed, confirming they are working to make a final decision on the way forward. It is also being suggested that the most likely outcome is developing a new leisure-cum-community facility at the Central Promenade site.A feasibility study on the redevelopment of the town centre site for a new hotel was completed several years ago which suggested a two or three-storey extension extension would be acceptable.The new hotel was viewed as a key ingredient in the plan to deliver highly ambitious proposals outlined in the Mournes Gateway proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in Newcastle.Other proposals include a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes and a visitor centre at the site of the old quarry at Thomasrsquo Mountain.It has emerged that work on the high profile tourism project is progressing with moves to establish a board to deliver its ious elements, with membership including representatives from the local council, Tourism NI, Forest Service, Mourne Heritage Trust and National Trust.Over the next month, work is scheduled to start on tendering for consultancy and architectural services, alongside the recruitment of environmental and traffic management services.

Scrum half Conor Gibson was on hand to move the ball quickly to Hutley, who put Luka Walsh in space for the first score of the game.Omagh bounced back well, again using the wind effectively, and their pressure gave way to a penalty which they successfully struck to close the gap.As they continued to apply pressure, the home side had a chance to take the lead on the  minute mark, but their kick drted to the right hand side of the posts.With  minutes left in the half, Down High extended their lead. Having forced Omagh deep into their own half, Luka Walsh capitalised on Omaghrsquos decision to play out from their own quarters when he intercepted the ball to score his second of the day. Hutley slotted over the conversion. Down carried a - lead into half-time.With the strong wind now on their tails and a reasonable points buffer, Down High controlled the game well. Omagh continued to apply plenty of pressure, but the Down defence was hungry and with the exception of a few indiscretions they soaked up the Omagh onslaughts.With  minutes left the game took a critical turn when Hutley slotted agoal to take the Down lead to -.As would be expected from the men from the west, they didnrsquot lie down, but they were forced to chase the game.

However, the book kept me from thinking dark thoughts. Soon, all I wanted was to hold a copy of the book in my hand.Maureenrsquos dream came true in the autumn of  when her haunting story was finally published.Maureen, who is the mother of five grown-up children, explained some of the background as to why she put pen to paper.She added: ldquoI was initially setting out to piece together my family tree and the computer screen flashed up information on my great aunt Brigid. I was so fascinated with what I read that I could see the story unfold in a book and in turn I felt the plot would work well on screen too.Research took Maureen to the Presentation Convent in Co Kildare, which Brigid entered at the age of .Maureen said: ldquoI met with such a warm and friendly welcome from the community of sisters, that it gave me the desire to pursue Brigidrsquos story further. I travelled to Australia shortly after and I received the same, warm and friendly welcome from the sisters of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Wagga Wagga.On herMaureen set about sting through a mountain of information and carefully crafted the remarkable story of her great aunt. The book was published in July  and was officially launched a few months later to a rapturous reception in Murphyrsquos Bar in Downpatrick.A chance meeting which her web designer, Michael McLaughlin, had had a year later led to a further development.She said: ldquoMichael was working on a display in Eclipse Cinema in Downpatrick for another movie when he struck up a random conversation with Colin McIvor.ldquoAs they chatted Michael mentioned that he had recently read a book written by a Downpatrick woman which he thought might make a great movie.ldquoWithin days Colin, with the backing of Northern Ireland Screen, was in my house and we were signing contracts on a movie deal. That was in July last year and since then the whole thing has snowballed.ldquoIt has been a pleasure putting the whole thing together. I wrote it like a novel which makes it easy for the reader to follow the story. My story is entirely based on fact.As Maureen describes the plot her face lights up. She believes her great aunt would be delighted at her revealing the long-lost tale to a new generation.ldquoBrigid had trained as a teacher and in  there was a great demand for priests and nuns with skilled trades in Australia and so she was shipped off to the mother house in Wagga Wagga.ldquoBrigid proved herself capable and popular with the children she taught for six years. But a bad day in front of a teaching inspector led the convent demoting her to refectory duties.ldquoTwo weeks turned into two years of hard labour that took their toll physically and mentally on poor Brigid. Requests toto her former duties were denied and feeling she had no real means of complaint, it left Brigid desperate.ldquoOne day she wandered outside the convent walls. Tears welled up in her eyes as she called at a strangerrsquos home. Her afternoon of tea and warm company by the fire ended all too soon and Brigid was sent back to the convent, seen by a doctor and put to bed, Maureen added.The story really begins in earnest at this crossroads in Brigidrsquos le. Drawing on every ounce of courage she had, Brigid leapt from her bed that night and made a hasty escape barefoot in her nightgown on a foggy winterrsquos night in .This night set the scene for a religious storm unprecedented in Australiarsquos history. Brigid found refuge in the home of Protestants who refuse to disclose her whereabouts to the Catholic authorities.A bishop swore before a magistrate that Brigid was insane and a warrant was issued for her arrest. She was hunted down like an outlaw and the local media attention created a level of sectarian tension rarely unseen in that part of the world.Later, when there was no apology from the bishop for the arrest and slur on her character, Brigid turned to the courts for redress. But taking on the bishop meant taking on the Catholic Church.Maureen had a challenging time presenting Brigidrsquos story.She said: ldquoIt was a scandal at the time but I had to be careful to write it from both sides and let people judge for themselves. Itrsquos all I can do.Maureen says she is looking forward to the filmrsquos premiere.She added: ldquoIt will be the culmination of not just my five years of writing and telling the story, but all the hard work and effort that my family have put into supporting and helping me and, of course, the efforts of the film company, the director and the actors.Colin spoke of his enthusiasm over Maureenrsquos forthcoming film.ldquoI am thoroughly delighted to have optioned such an amazingly powerful book and to have met the inspirational Maureen and her family through the process, he said.He is currently adapting the book into a screenplay. ldquoI believe the film will offer a fantastic role for a strong female lead and supporting cast, he said. ldquoTo be able to bring this beautully written, dramatic and deserved piece to the silver screen some day would be just fantastic.Log on to Maureenrsquos website toon the forthcoming movie premiere at www.theextraordinarycaseofsisterliguori..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C January 30%2C 1979  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash A Strangford man had a narrow escape from death when he turned up for work on Monday morning at the new Abbey Lodge Hotel, outside Downpatrick.A muffled explosion during the night had ripped apart a section of the hotel mdash which was due to open in three weeksrsquo time mdash but no alarm was raised and workmen were unaware of the danger when they reported for work.One of the men, Mr Francis Black, from Strangford, passed through the lounge and noticed a black bag and two yellow tins. He thought it was some material left for him to carry on with a job and picked it up.Mr Black failed to notice several wires leading from the bag, but an examination of the contents told him something was wrong. He put it down and it was discovered later that the contents were competence for a lethal fire-type bomb.By then Mr Blackrsquos colleagues had discovered the damage caused by another bomb and a warning was raised. Police and firemen rushed to the scene and the main Downpatrick-Crossgar Road, beside the hotel, was sealed off as army bomb disposal experts raced from Lisburn.An army officer successfully defused the second bomb and workmen moved in to assess the damage, which was confined that bedroom section of the hotel.The hotel owner, Mr William Polly, said: ldquoDoors, windows, the gable and the roof have all been damaged and this includes a total of eight bedrooms. It will mean that an entire section of the building containing the bedrooms will have to come out.

These premises will be our new premises with dedicated areas for Lowden acoustic guitars and new electric guitar ranges, said George.ldquoWe are currently planning out the logistics of our move from Down Business Park. This will require attention to detail and be orchestrated stage by stage to minimise any disruption to our ability to complete and ship our guitars to waiting customers.Lowden Guitars successfully managed to keep news that it was working with Sheeran mdash one of the worldrsquos biggest music artist, who has sold  million albums and has had more than  billion streams mdash under wraps for considerable time.

But a starting price for a Lowden was three grand. When yoursquore , three grand may as well be a million pounds.ldquoThe dream of any kid who likes music is to have a guitar and the dream of any musician is to have a signature guitar.George realised that he needed to make a range that was something special and revealed that he sought inspiration from the North Coast.ldquoEvery guitar that I design and make I have to feel afterwards proud of it, I have to feel that I have achieved something with it. That itrsquos not just a normal guitar, he explained.ldquoThe main aim was to design and make a guitar here at an affordable price noticeably better than anything  at that price range. So I went up to the North Coast and spent a week at the Giants Causeway walking and thinking and drawing. Then having designed it, of course I sent it off to Ed and the rest is history.Sheeran has previously bemoaned that fewer youngsters seem to be interested in guitar-playing these days.ldquoThere are fewer guitar bands and fewer artists using guitars now, and not as many kids picking up guitars, he added.ldquoThat is something I would like to change by getting these great quality guitars, made in Ireland, into kidsrsquo hands and encouraging them to learn and progress.The Sheeran by Lowden acoustic guitar range features eight inidual models across two small body sizes familiar from the Lowden range, known as the S and the Wee Lowden.The guitars have been designed for uncompromising tone and playability and are made using sustainably-sourced wood including naturally fallen trees and reclaimed spruce.George says that the new range combines years of hand-crafting and traditional luthier methods with new construction technology.ldquoItrsquos taking everything I have learnt over the last  years, cherry-picking from that a few traditional methods of working by hand and introducing those into a whole series of new groundbreaking procedures for guitar making so that the end result is a guitar made in Ireland but one which really sings and which I hope inspires many young musicians and older ones as well, he added.The first orders should be shipped in March.

Will they have any heart to get the changes needed, or will they even have the ability  “They have already negotiated a failed and useless deal, so are they really going to be able to do any better now  Will they even want to “You need a change in the team to have a change in outcome. “Put it this way,you had a football team that had got hammered by the other side, would you send them back out again, or would you change your starting line-up the next time “In this case, the team we sent out last time didn’t even try to play.”A source close to the government said they understood that Mr Falconer is one name that has been mentioned by Number  as a potential addition to the negotiating team.The News Letter asked Downing Street to clary whether Mr Robbins would still be heading up the negotiating team, and whether Mr Falconer was being considered for the role.A spokesperson replied: “Oliver Robbins is still the lead civil service negotiator. Mr Falconer has always had a role in advising the prime minister.”Ian Ogle murder: Police confirm they are investigating UVF involvement where victim was stabbed  times and left to die in street Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Meanwhile, Number  also confirmed the PM is still considering endorsing a new proposal aimed at breaking the Brexit deadlock by uniting Tory Remainers and Brexiteers.Prominent Tories on both sides of the Brexit ide have reportedly hammered out a secret compromise designed to bridge the gap between the warring factions within the Conservative Party.The so-called ‘Malthouse’ alternative, negotiated by ERG leaders Jacob Rees-Mogg and Steve Baker and Tory Remainers including Nicky Morgan and Stephen Hammond, has also been endorsed by Theresa May’s allies in government, the DUP.The Downing Street spokesperson said: “As the PM said this week, the fact that leading figures from dferent sides of the argument are coming together to develop proposals shows how much progress has been made over the past few weeks.“The government will be engaging with this proposal sincerely and positively, and the principle of alternative arrangements has already been accepted by the EU as a way out of the backstop.”try catch  TrendingDying single mother, , with motor neurone disease whose children have to dress her refused disability benefitsThese properties are just some of the least expensive currently up for sale in NISnow, ice and fallen debris could make your morning drive dficult - as Roads Service confirm salting of roads network underwayN.I. man headbutts police officer before spitting in nurses faceP.S.N.I. shutdown N.I. road after car crash - N.I.

Photo credit: Rebecca Black PA WireHe said he has worked very closely with the DUP during the Brexit debate.“The DUP has very similar views on many issues relating to Brexit,” he said.In terms of speaking at the event, Mr Rees-Mogg said those gathered have a “great deal to talk about in terms of Brexit”.He also emphasised that he wants the UK to secure a deal with the EU before Brexit.He described the Malthouse Compromise, a proposal to extend the transition period for a year and protect EU citizens’ rights, instead of using the backstop, as the way to do that.Mr Rees-Mogg said it was the best way to satisfy both Leavers and Remainers.“I think the Malthouse Compromise has received a good deal of interest and widespread support, it’s supported by the DUP, it is supported by many Conservatives from both the Leave and Remain points of view, and it seems to be something the Government is willing to run with,” he said.Ian Ogle murder: Police confirm they are investigating UVF involvement where victim was stabbed  times and left to die in street Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“I think there is a possibility of leaving with a sensible deal which is the preferred option for most people.“It is indeed my preferred option.”Arriving separately, Mr Banks told the Press Association that the DUP MPs had been very supportive of the campaign he was involved in for the UK to leave the EU, and said that he wanted to reciprocate that.“I think the DUP have been fundamental,Brexit gets delivered, it will be because of the DUP,” he said.“They have got a lot of power over Theresa May and they have used that, so good on them.”Mr Rees-Mogg’s attendance at the event was questioned by the Northern Ireland Conservatives.NI Conservatives chairman Alan Dunlop described it as an “odd alliance”.“Backbench MPs are free to speak to anyone they wish to, there is a clear convention within the Conservative Party however, not to speak in support of rival political parties,” he told the Press Association.“Jacob Rees-Mogg is a highly respected member of the party with impeccable knowledge of UK constitutional politics and conventions and therefore will be fully aware of this.“Sadly on occasions, often in an honest defence of their principal political views, politicians find themselves making odd alliances and standing elements of their own political logic on its head.“They make themselves look foolish when they do so.”Mr Rees Mogg is not the first Conservative MP to headline a DUP event, and is following in the footsteps of several high-profile representatives.Last November, former foreign secretary Boris Johnston addressed the DUP’s conference.try catch  TrendingDying single mother, , with motor neurone disease whose children have to dress her refused disability benefitsThese properties are just some of the least expensive currently up for sale in NISnow, ice and fallen debris could make your morning drive dficult - as Roads Service confirm salting of roads network underwayN.I. man headbutts police officer before spitting in nurses faceP.S.N.I. shutdown N.I. road after car crash - N.I.

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He’s just taken over at the helm of the internationally renowned next generation science park which is home to  innovative knowledge based companies, who are employing more than , engineers, researchers, entrepreneurs and executives, across four locations – and has his sights firmly set on making Northern Ireland a leader in two key innovative areas of tech business.Taking on the role as chief executive of Catalyst from stalwart Professor Norman Apsley OBE, just two months ago, plans are under way to build on the foundations of an organisation which has an estate of , sq ft of agile workspace filled with innovative companies. Catalyst leads the way in innovation and entrepreneurship by supporting the creation and growth of innovation companies in Northern Ireland.“We have a rightful place in leading the world. We aren’t going to follow anybody. Let’s get back to leading the world,” Steve tells Ulster Business.“I am going to take the foundation that Norman left and look at how we leverage that by a signicant factor – in terms of economic activity and dynamism for Northern Ireland.“We need deeper, more strategic partnerships with key institutions. It is through collaboration we can do something to scale and put Northern Ireland on a world map.”Catalyst is the thriving, beating heart of Northern Ireland’s booming technology sector and leading the way in educating and preparing companies and young people for the changing world of work through the impact of the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is seeing the impact of new technologies impacting on le, work and society.Formerly known as the Northern Ireland Science Park, Catalyst is an independent not-for-profit organisation operating across the region. It provides agile workspace across four locations – the main site in Belfast’s Titanic Quarter, the Innovation centres in Londonderry, and Ballymena and most recently opened Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, a co-working space dedicated to the fintech sector in Belfast city centre, which is a partnership with Danske Bank.“The business model we have had for the first  years was the perfect model for that period. We need a new model for the next. We are identying a simple, but ambitious strategy – building on the existing foundation.”Part of the strength of Catalyst is in attracting big international firms, such as Citi, in close proximity to businesses at the very birth of existence. Steve says as a result, “accidental encounters” lead to relationships and outcomes which otherwise, would not have happened.It also plays host to Queen’s University’s leading research body, ECITwhich itself is home to CSIT .Some of the leading thinkers based at the site include ECIT’s Professor Maire O’Neill – one of the youngest ever engineering professors at Queen’s, one-time UK Female Inventor of the Year and a leading researcher. “You have US companies looking at why would they want to move to Northern Ireland – they want to meet Professor O’Neill. She’s amazing,” Steve says.“Then there are cyber companies, like B-Secur. The firm specialises in technology which can read your ECG heartbeat as a unique biometric identy verication.“There are other indigenous companies, like Titan IC in cyber-security, Displaynote and ProAxsis. We have great companies that are now making a dent in the world.”And pushing forward with what his predecessor Norman Apsley built, plans are under way to expand and redevelop Catalyst further still.That includes another new building, Pierpont  – which will provide another , sq ft of space – and a revamp and refurbishment of Catalyst’s Innovation Centre, as part of an addition £m investment.“We want to make this the best place to work – improving the environment, the flow around the campus, the accessibility, and the experience, so that you love being here.“We want to refresh some of the buildings on the site. The Innovation Centre will be modernised by March and we will freshen-up our identity.”His big goal is to lead the way in two areas of technology and business at Catalyst – putting Northern Ireland front and centre.“We want to help to incubate two clusters where Northern Ireland leads the world.“How do we build on what ECIT is doing  We take the start-up capability, and ecosystem we have in Northern Ireland and leverage that further.“We want to make it easier for corporations to set up in Belfast and Northern Ireland in order to access amazing research talent. They want to define what the next big breakthrough is.“We can develop something for global companies that they can’t find where in the world. We want to create clusters, that will act as a magnet to attract hundreds of companies.”One of the unique elements of Catalyst is Connect – a network of experienced entrepreneurs, business professionals, top research talent and potential investors who provide their time and experience pro bono to help foster and develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.“It’s helping entrepreneurs to figure out how to build a company around their product idea and providing the support to validate and access the marketplace, capital, investment and or talent,” Steve says.“With the Connect network, we had  early stage companies or entrepreneurs engaged in our programmes last year. There is a lot of exciting and vibrant activity going on at the moment.”And it was Connect, which Steve founded and developed at Catalyst, which first drew him back home to his native Northern Ireland, following years of running and founding tech firms in the West Coast of the US.“I was an entrepreneur in Calornia for a number of years, in San Francisco and San Diego. I was there for the peak of the dot coms,” he said.That included his own start-up business, Kineticom, as well as other tech companies. It was his time in San Diego which resonated strongly with Steve.“Personally, I became obsessed with the San Diego story and the parallels to Northern Ireland. When they started on their journey in , San Diego had a population of . million people, % of their economy was dependent on the public sector. They have an ocean to one side, a mountain range around them and another country to the bottom of them.”San Diego went from the bottom of every league table to the top – with the collaboration of top universities, research and development and entrepreneurship, building the city into the tech stalwart it is now.The Connect  emanated from San Diego – a concept which help shaped the programme in Northern Ireland.“Meeting Norman Apsley at the Science Park was just the most beautul thing ever,” Steve says.The financial and economic impact and contribution that Catalyst has is hard to ignore. It’s estimated the businesses which operate there contribute around £m in GVA each year.“Everything we do is based on the simple belief that innovation has the power to transform our economy. People around the world are all innovating quickly, adapting new technologies, articial intelligence, for example. In Northern Ireland,people are producing goods and services, but are behind in adopting those new technologies, our economy is going to be in trouble as we will not be competitive.“The question is, how does innovation become the foundation on which everything is based ”And as a result of Catalyst’s research into the NI Knowledge Economy, an annual report published later this month, which acknowledges the huge changes to the workplace in the coming year, Catalyst is hosting their second Future of Work summit in May  – aimed at demystying how roles and traditional jobs are changing, right across the Knowledge Economy sectors.Of course, Brexit is still on the horizon. For Steve, the main concern is around the availability of talent. “The tech sector is hungry for talent, but with the uncertainty in the last couple of years, fewer people have been willing to consider moving to Northern Ireland. That places a lot of pressure on the existing employees in the sector.”“Long-term, we have to be optimistic and look at the opportunities which can come out of Brexit. The businesses within the Knowledge Economy are export driven, representing over % of all NI exports. With % of these exports outside the EU, the Knowledge Economy is the sector least dependent on Europe and should be the key for driving growth at this time of uncertainty.”So, for Steve, his level of optimism and dynamism is clear in his new role, one which he says he is “very fortunate” to have.“It’s a position which comes around so rarely, and whoever gets the opportunity is so blessed and fortunate to have the opportunity to lead. We have a talented team of people who are all passionate about what is possible. It’s so exciting. The opportunities and possibilities are endless.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/323433.jpg","title":"theresa mays brexit deal voted down business reaction","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by John Mulgrew Business groups have overwhelmingly raised concerns over crashing out of the EU without a deal after Prime Minister Theresa May’s withdrawal plan with Brussels was overwhelmingly rejected by MPs. Ann McGregor, chief executive of Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry “The business communities that we represent have always had a erse range of views on what form the UK’s future relationship with the EU should take, however they do agree on the need to avoid a messy and disorderly Brexit. “To achieve this we therefore need an agreement that will secure the transition period and protect jobs. As businesses wait to see what happens next in Parliament, it is crucial that those at Westminster move beyond tactical manoeuvring and look at all the options in order to avoid a ‘no deal’s scenario. “Firms are in the dark on too many aspects of le after March . This has already led to many businesses taking action – pausing on recruitment and investment, stockpiling goods, and relocating factories in other parts of the EU. In fact, a third of NI Chamber members are currently putting growth and investment plans on hold in the absence of clarity from Westminster. There is however nothing to stop government acting decisively on areas within their control, such as migration and customs procedures.”  Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “The result this evening will be a cause for concern across the Northern Ireland business community. Northern Ireland businesses desperately need certainty about the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU and will be severely disadvantaged by a no deal. A no deal Brexit means that Northern Ireland households will face higher prices and less choice on the shelves something they can ill afford. “Se need politicians  to coalesce around a workable solution that protects consumers from the costs and disruptions due to the loss of tarf-free and frictionless trade we currently enjoy with partners in the EU. We are now closer than ever to the possibility of a no-deal that will be a disaster for Northern Ireland.” “  Angela McGowan, CBI Northern Ireland director “Every business will feel no deal is hurtling closer. A new plan is needed immediately. This is now a time for our politicians to make history as leaders. All MPs need to reflect on the need for compromise and to act at speed to protect the UKs economy. “No deal would immediately put Northern Irish jobs and businesses at risk and jeopardise years of positive economic development and integration across the island.  It must be avoided to protect our all-island economy.”  Glyn Roberts, Retail NI chief executive “This is a disappointing but not unexpected result. While the Prime Minister’s draft Withdrawal Bill was in no way perfect, it was definitely preferable to crashing out of the EU with no deal. “The Government now needs to work on a cross-party basis with Labour and other opposition parties to reach a broader agreement for a withdrawal deal and secure the transition period, protect jobs and a positive future relationship with the EU  Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster “Leaving the EU without a deal would damage the sustainability of the Hospitality industry and impact on the potential growth of Tourism in Northern Ireland. We appeal to our elected representatives to work together in a spirit of consensus government to ensure that a no deal scenario does not happen.”  Tina McKenzie, FSB NI policy chair “With the clock ticking down to Brexit Day in just  weeks, we are running out of time to avoid a clf-edge, no-deal outcome. “A disorderly exit from the EU would be deeply damaging for small businesses, causing disruption to supply chains, increasing costs and stling investment. “A no-deal is something which we simply cannot countenance, so it is imperative that political leaders sharpen their focus and do all they can to reach agreement in the short time available.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"no deal brexit could cost ni economy bn by ","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s economy could suffer a £bn drop in output by  in the event of a ‘no deal’ Brexit, it’s been claimed. According to the CBI, its analysis of government figures published at the end of last year showsthe UK fails to secure a deal with the EU, by , GVA could be “.% lower than under the UK’s current arrangements with the EU according to government analysis”. The CBI calculates this could amount to an annual loss of output worth almost £bn by , based on today’s prices. It says “manufacturing activity is particularly important in Northern Ireland, and the agri-food sector, which employs thousands, is likely to be severely impacted as it is particularly exposed to the risk of higher tarfs and trade costs”. Angela McGowan, Northern Ireland director of the CBI, said: “CBI members across Northern Ireland are clear:the new approach to finding a Brexit deal continues to be a game of who blinks first, the Northern Irish economy will pay the price. “The deadlock will only be broken by a genuine attempt by all MPs to find consensus and compromise, not stick to rusting red lines and political conditions. Like the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland is not – and cannot be – ready for no deal. “The projected impact on our economy would be devastating and while business will do all it can to reduce some of the worst aspects, a no deal scenario is unmanageable. “The message from the CBI to our politicians is clear – we must see compromise or the whole country faces the unforgivable prospect of a disorderly Brexit which will affect jobs and livelihoods in Northern Ireland for decades to come. It’s time to put prosperity before party politics and dogma.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Air-1.jpg","title":"eight part belfast made airbus passenger jets delivered","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Eight part-Belfast made Bombardier Airbus passenger jets were delivered at the end of last year – bringing the total number to  during .

We tell client’s stories through engaging content written by former journalists – grab their customers’ attention with stunning design, maximise conversions by using the latest digital marketing expertise, and develop websites which are living, breathing, online stores or shop windows. As content director, my role is to bring almost  years’ experience in journalism, political communications, corporate PR, crisis management and digital content crafting to Grofuse. How did the business start and how has it grown The business was created by a fusion of expertise to achieve sales growth, including experienced digital marketers, PR consultants, web developers, software developers, graphic designers, illustrators and motion designers. I co-founded the company with expert digital marketer Denis Finnegan who has spent  years fuelling online lead generation for businesses. Growth has been swt over the last  months. We’ve employed an effective combination of marketing efforts and created fans of our existing clients.What is your background I’m a seasoned hack, having worked in print journalism for almost  years followed by a few years as a political communications adviser. I spent a brief period teaching English and history at secondary level before entering a newsroom. The working environments were poles apart in terms pace, excitement and... language choices. As a school pupil and university student, I worked on building sites, supermarkets, farms, bars, bread delivery vans, a bakery and even a bacon factory kill-line. However, I had never encountered such flurries of expletives as I did in newsrooms. Great places to work. High pressure, tight deadlines and great target-setting – a superb way to fuel productivity in any work environment.What do you do dferently from your competition and what are your strengths Clear communication with our clients is our greatest strength. We listen intently to what our clients’ goals are, take time to learn about their products and gain full understanding of their ideal customers. We start with a blank canvass and devise bespoke digital strategies to fuel each client’s business growth by engaging their target market effectively and delivering genuine sales leads that are easily quantiable.Who are your main customers Our customers operate across a wide range of sectors. We are currently working with clients across the UK and Ireland, US, France and Spain. Do you have a target in mind in terms of where you want the business to grow We are currently focusing the bulk of our efforts on the island of Ireland with a particular focus on Dublin and Belfast. What challenges have you faced The somewhat ‘snake-oil industry’ reputation of digital marketing sometimes poses a barrier to speaking with decision makers who in the past have invested with little . However, once we’re given an opportunity, we like to let the results do the talking. Who most inspires you Those who thrive in the face of adversity and have strong growth mind-sets. The type of person with the right measure of accountability, skill and relentlessness to inspire their teams to achieve targets. It’s a mind-set akin to that of a top athlete whose body is screaming ‘slow down’ in the business end of a race but whose mind interprets that as a cue to go faster. My we Martina – a former operations manager with Lidl Ireland who co-founded and runs leading human resources consultancy, HR Team – has these qualities in abundance. She inspires me in everything I do.Where do you see yourself in the next few years I love living and working in the North West. Whatever people like to call Derry or Londonderry, it’s a very special place with a lot of talent and a big future in driving the cross-border regional economy. With our headquarters at Catalyst Inc and plans underway for satellite offices in Dublin and the UK, we want to ensure our agency plays a part in shaping that economic prosperity with the provision of more high-quality jobs for the area.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
