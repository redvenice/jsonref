Published on Friday, Reboot has been serialised this week in the Mirror, with Owen airing his feelings about his move to Newcastle 14 years ago for a club record £16.8m and a salary of £120,000 a week.“From a career perspective, there was no doubt in my mind that a move to the North East was a downward step. As unpalatable as that opinion might be to Newcastle fans, that’s more or less what I felt,” writes Owen.Initially, he says, Newcastle’s “passionate fan base started counter-balancing my earlier reservations”. But when he was knocked out in a game against Watford, his relationship with them was “damaged beyond repair”.“When I got home, I switched on Match of the Day to watch the game and I could hear Newcastle fans, my fans, singing ‘What a waste of money!’ as I’m being stretchered off,” he writes. “I can’t deny their actions that day changed things for me. No longer was I even going to attempt to ingratiate myself with the fans. Instead, I flipped it in a slightly more resentful way.”Owen has not only provoked the ire of Newcastle booksellers. Alan Shearer, who was briefly Newcastle’s manager while Owen was at the club, has responded on Twitter to Owen’s claims in Reboot about their “feud”.Owen, who is set to appear at signings in Chester and Liverpool over the weekend, subsequently said he is also positive in the book about Newcastle: “I actually praise the people and the city. I bought a house and lived there for four years despite the myths that I flew home every two minutes.”Responding to The Back Page’s decision, Paul Dove, executive editor at Owen’s publisher Reach Sport, said: “Michael is keen for fans to read his book so they can fully understand the complete story of his life and career, including his time at Newcastle. The general response from booksellers has been fantastic.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe04d2f28c2e4914544c03c13531812843e69a51/123_0_3888_2332/master/3888.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76ccfdbdf875aab458f5b5fdcf18e1d5","title":"ba strike 4300 staff to take part in airlines first ever pilot walkout","story":"Reasons cited include pay dispute, cost-cutting policies and loss of confidence in managementWhat has gone so wrong that British Airways pilots earning six-figure salaries are angry enough to strike? On Monday and Tuesday, the majority of BA’s 4,300 pilots based at Heathrow and Gatwick will down tools for the first pilot strike in the airline’s history. BA would usually operate almost 800 flights a day carrying 145,000 passengers, most of which would have now been cancelled or rebooked.Pilots represented by the Balpa union have rejected this and have asked for the kind of profit share enjoyed by directors, plus an above-inflation pay guarantee.Few people would be dissatisfied with a BA pilot’s pay. Perhaps only Álex Cruz, the company’s chief executive, who is currently paid £1.3m, would be pained to earn a captain’s £167,000 plus allowances. But Cruz firmly believes the pay deal on offer is good enough. When strike dates were announced, he said blame laid “squarely at the door” of Balpa.Cruz added: “I personally believe BA pilots are the best in the world … but I think they have been very badly served by the union.”“And yet almost all of its pilots wanted to go on strike. You’ve got to look at what the company is doing to generate that level of ill-feeling among their staff.”One striking pilot, a long-serving BA employee based at Heathrow, said: “It’s the pilots pushing the union rather than the other way round.“Pilots are logical thinkers, they are not going to be led by the nose, no union leader is going to whip them up. Only management has the ability to do that. Communications from Álex Cruz have made pilots more angry, not less.”Speaking on condition of anonymity, he said: “It’s not really about money, it’s about respect. We’ve effectively been lied to. We’ve given up a serious pension scheme, pay and pay rises when the company was weak – all on the promise that when the company was strong and giving up proper returns to its investors, we would benefit.”BA said this week that it has “acted with integrity through many months of negotiations” and accused Balpa of backtracking on an agreement.In terms of pure profit, BA’s lean years are in the past. Its generous but burdensome pension scheme has been closed, saving BA an estimated £800m, according to Balpa. The airline is the cash cow of IAG, making more than £2bn in pre-tax profit in 2018. “And now that we’ve asked for a little bit of payback, it’s not there,” the pilot added.Day-to-day gripes associated with cost cutting have furthered pilots’ disenchantment, he said, including slow responses to minor engineering issues – “not a safety risk,” said the pilot “but you wouldn’t expect it at an airline like BA” – to worsening food and accommodation for long-haul flight stopovers. “If crew have done an 18-hour day, the least they need is a room where they can sleep,” he said.Complaints have headed into a void, the pilot said: “The stress is such that the pilots are trying to say – you’ve not been listening to us.”BA has said the pay deal would take some captains to more than £200,000 a year after three years. The pilot admitted he was well paid, but said other colleagues struggled to reach that point: “Many pilots are working flat out, they are not likely to get a decent pension, it’s a much longer pay scale to progress to higher pay.”According to Balpa, a cadet pilot comes in at about £27,000 and a first officer £59,000, while captains start at £78,000, making about £100,000 a more typical figure.While the row is pinned to pay, Strutton said: “There are a lot of factors. BA pilots have lost confidence in the management and direction of the airline. A cost-cutting regime has reduced the quality of the service pilots want to give to the customers, as well as affecting themselves. The cumulative effect is a serious groundswell of bad feeling.”Meltdowns at BA, in particular IT outages, have fuelled that feeling. The power cut that left 75,000 passengers stranded in May 2017 also disrupted the lives of pilots and crew, and they were left to deal with the fallout.“Management decisions are being taken that impinge on the working lives and quality of service that pilots and BA staff can deliver. They feel that quality should be the ethos of BA, and they don’t think that it is,” Strutton said.More strikes could follow. A further walkout is due on 27 September, although BA has yet to cancel those flights, and Balpa has a mandate for action until January.On Thursday, BA furiously rebuffed an offer of new talks and accused Strutton of reneging on an agreement struck during talks in August, which he denied: “Categorically, no, we didn’t shake hands on the deal.”Strutton said he was “running out of ideas to try to avoid the strike”, which he said would be bruising for all parties. “We need to start rebuilding the relationship of trust and confidence, which is so sadly lacking,” he added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e45ad13c428f0bdeda40d478eb473b3afcee8912/0_149_4466_2679/master/4466.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e60705194c0d2f03b5d16c4bfcdbce7e","title":"milk delivery firm milk and more price pint offline customers","story":"Milk \u0026amp More encourages people to switch to online accounts to save on administration costsAn “eco-friendly” delivery company that pledged to revive the traditional “Great British milkman” has raised the price of fresh milk by 4p a pint – but only for customers who don’t want to switch their accounts online.In a drive to modernise the business and move towards a cashless system, Milk \u0026amp More says it wants to incentivise customers to switch their accounts online to allow more efficient and less costly administration and payment.The delivery company was bought by the German-owned dairy giant Müller from Dairy Crest in December 2015 and has a total UK workforce of 1,050 milkmen and women (of whom 521 are franchisees) delivering 110m pints of milk in traditional glass bottles to customers’ homes every year. It has about 500,000 customers in the UK.In 2017, the company was the victim of its own success, after growing consumer concern about plastic waste in the wake of the BBC’s Blue Planet TV series led to an unexpected surge of thousands of new online customers.However, the simultaneous launch of a new website – involving the migration of 150,000 online customers – led to technical glitches that caused delivery and payment problems.  Money highlighted this after being contacted by disgruntled customers complaining about poor customer service. Many longstanding offline customers are elderly and disabled and value the convenience of having grocery items as well as milk delivered to their doorsteps.The increase will be 4p per pint for milk in glass bottles, which accounts for about three-quarters of the company’s milk deliveries. This takes the price from 81p to 85p – substantially more than supermarkets charge although delivery is free. Its last national price increase on the doorstep was in December 2014, when milk went up by 2p per pint or per 500ml.The company said: “This wasn’t a decision we took lightly, but in order to recover increased business costs it was a necessary one. We have been able to hold the price of milk for our online customers, simply because there is significantly less administration involved when customers manage their accounts in this way.“While we currently have customers who do not have an online account and who choose to pay their milkman directly by cash or cheque, by credit or debit card, or by direct debit, all of these payment options cost us more to process.”In a parallel move to streamline the company’s business model but which has also stoked controversy, Milk \u0026amp More is cancelling all franchisees’ contracts – with a 90-day notice period – giving them an “option” to take up an employed position or leave."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e1006f97c45d15c829284daa258ec3be16443ca/0_317_5998_3598/master/5998.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac0caf26caef815d8698ef129a874448","title":"philip greens retail empire faces uncertain future without new funds","story":"Taveta Investments reports £177m loss and warns no-deal Brexit could hamper three-year rescue planSir Philip Green’s retail empire is facing “material uncertainty” about its ability to continue trading without new funds, after slumping to a £177.3m loss last year.Taveta Investments, the owner of Arcadia Group and the company behind Topshop, Miss Selfridge, Wallis and Evans, said difficulties in refinancing a £310m loan on Topshop’s Oxford Street store, due to expire in December, could mean it would have to raise new funds.It also warned that “difficult trading conditions”, particularly in the event of a no-deal Brexit, might leave it without sufficient cash to deliver its three-year rescue plan.Physical retailers have been hit by a combination of changing habits, unseasonably warm weather, rising costs and broader economic problems. In 2018 Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld disappeared as a result.In terms of habits, shoppers are switching to buying online. The likes of Amazon have an unfair advantage because they have a lower business rate bill, which holds down costs and enables online retailers to woo shoppers with low prices. Business rates are taxes, based on the value of commercial property, that are imposed on traditional retailers with physical stores.\u0026nbspAt the same time, there is a move away from buying ‘stuff’ as more people live in smaller homes and rent rather than buy. Those pressures have come just as rising labour and product costs, partly fuelled by Brexit, have coincided with economic and political uncertainty that has dampened consumer confidence.Retailers with a high-street presence want the government to change business rates. They also want more political certainty as the potential for a no deal Brexit means some are not only incurring additional costs for stockpiling goods but are unsure about the impact of tariffs after October 2019. Retailers also want more investment in town centres to help them adapt to changing trends, as well as a cut to high parking charges which they say put off shoppers.In the October 2018 budget the government announced\u0026nbspsome relief\u0026nbspon business rates for independent shopkeepers. It has also set up a £675m ‘future high streets’ fund under which local councils can bid for up to £25m towards regeneration projects such as refurbishing local historic buildings and improving transport links. The fund will also pay for the creation of a high street taskforce to provide expertise and hands-on support to local areas.Some retailers could go under. Weakened by a difficult Christmas – which accounts for the entire annual profits of many retailers, and with further Brexit wobbles to come – retailers are facing a tough 2019. Another rise in the national minimum wage in April and the falling value of the pound against the dollar, which is used to buy goods in the far east, have also added to costs and hit profits.The big fall into the red was revealed in the company’s latest accounts, which were published at Companies House on Friday.In a statement accompanying the figures, Taveta’s finance director Gillian Hague said: “There are certain scenarios that could arise in the event of continued challenging and volatile market conditions in the retail sector, including a disorderly exit from the European Union, that would create uncertainties around the ability of the group to operate within the liquidity available from existing funding arrangements.” This was underlined in a similar statement by Taveta’s auditor, Paul Cragg at PricewaterhouseCoopers, who noted “a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt about the group’s and company’s ability to continue as a going concern”.The accounts cover the year to 1 September 2018, but both statements are dated 30 August 2019, indicating that fears for the company’s future persist even after agreement on the rescue plan.Despite the losses, the accounts show Green’s wife, Tina, the ultimate owner of the Arcadia Group, was paid more than £23m last year. Taveta redeemed £20m of loan notes and paid interest of nearly £3.4m relating to the purchase of BHS from the family in 2009.The Green family was still owed £43.4m in relation to BHS, but the accounts show this debt has now been written off.Tina Green has also loaned the company £50m and agreed to invest £50m of new cash to help with its turnaround plans as well as pumping £100m into Arcadia’s pension scheme over three years. Arcadia itself has put an additional £285m contribution in property assets and cash payments into the scheme.Those payments ensured support for Arcadia’s restructure plan from the Pensions Regulator, the group’s pension fund trustees and the pension protection fund, an industry-backed lifeboat for collapsed companies’ savings schemes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a2a6c778a943b2d4f95a2424a559411fef505db/0_109_4333_2601/master/4333.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efa4e4b3088b7ea58666f8b9bf075be7","title":"wetherspoons pledges cheaper booze as a post brexit tonic","story":"Pub chain reduces price of UK-made beer and vows further cuts on lager, wine and cider … if import tariffs fallJD Wetherspoon’s boss, Tim Martin, has pledged to slash the price of lagers, spirits, wine and cider if the UK leaves the EU, after shaving 20p off a pint of ale to illustrate the Brexit benefits he expects for drinkers.Martin has been one of the most vociferously pro-Brexit figures in the world of business, repeatedly insisting that leaving the European Union, even without a deal, will mean cheaper prices for customers.JD Wetherspoon has cut the price of Ruddles, an ale made by Greene King, by an average of 20p across its 900 pubs. Although Ruddles is made in the UK, Martin said a low-tariff regime would cut overall costs for the company, which it could then pass on to drinkers.Leaving the EU would allow the government to slash tariffs on imported goods, Martin said: “The reality is that if you’re running a business and you get a cost reduction, then you can allocate it to whatever part of the products you sell you want to.“There are no import tariffs on Ruddles bitter but pubs are synonymous with beer and I strongly believe that if we get a reduction in tariffs on non-EU imports, the most beneficial thing for us to do is to make our beer more competitive.He said that neither suppliers, nor employees, some of whom have complained of earning poverty wages, would suffer as a result. “We think we’ll be able to maintain our operating margin and reduce prices to customers,” he said.Martin has already axed drinks from the EU in its pubs and replaced them with less well-known brands from outside the single market in a move to demonstrate post-Brexit opportunities. He insisted that drinkers were as willing to order substitute products as they were the better-known staples of the drinks cabinet.“On the basis that the ports might block up, which I think is a fiction by the way, we buy brandy from Australia and America rather than France. On a taste test it was better than Courvoisier and it’s 10p a drink cheaper. It sells as well as Courvoisier.”Martin added that industries such as the automotive sector, which has warned repeatedly that leaving the customs union could deal huge damage to carmakers, were overstating the likely impact.“If those sorts of problems apply, businesses can reorganise their supply chains,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1109afad368a35c9f76ef6397db17932133fe21/0_30_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f31965e3a884e18b7a077ebbb23619e","title":"germany industrial eurozone recession brexit sterling non farm payrolls us dollar jobs report business live","story":"Rolling coverage of business, economics and markets as non-farm payrolls data show 130,000 new jobsRemember that Goldilocks report that we talked about earlier? The non-farm payrolls numbers appear to have delivered pretty much that. Not too hot, not too cold.Donald Trump, the US president, had an early dig at Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, shortly before the jobs numbers came through, but moved on quickly to watching Fox News, if his Twitter feed is to be believed.While clearly below expectations, the 130,000 jobs added by the US economy in August was not too far below the 158,000 consensus – and doesn’t add to recession warning lights.There has been a clear slowdown in the jobs market, according to Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics. But it wasn’t too bad, he added:Aside from the headline payroll numbers, the rest of the employment report was actually quite positive. That positive news means the Fed is still overwhelmingly likely to cut interest rates by no more than 25bp later this month.Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said there are signs that “prolonged and deep uncertainty” over the trade war was denting investment plans.However, today’s numbers could put off Powell’s stand-off with markets looking for renewed stimulus.Most economists think the trade war will eventually make its market on the jobs market (ahead of an election year), but it may not be quite there yet.Thanks for following our coverage of economics, business and markets today. Please do join Graeme Wearden on Monday for more. JJThe jobs growth was the weakest in three months, despite a boost from the hiring of temporary workers for the 2020 Census, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said.The 130,000 reading was below the average for the year so far, as the US economy comes to terms with slowing growth. Economists expect Donald Trump’s trade war with China to weigh on growth further.Job growth has averaged 158,000 per month thus far this year, below the average monthly gain of 223,000 in 2018. Investors have tempered their slight mood of optimism from earlier.Donald Trump, the US president, already has his thoughts on monetary policy – getting his jibes in early just ahead of the payrolls data.Some more detail on the jobs numbers:The US economy added 130,000 jobs, lower than the 158,000 predicted by economists.Powell is odds-on to loosen monetary policy, according to data from CME Group.But investors’ eyes are on the pace of change over the next few months. Markets are currently pricing at least two cuts by the end of this year.Manufacturing data have been weak in the US recently, but jobs numbers from private payrolls provider ADP were relatively strong, giving economists a mixed picture of where the US economy may be heading.Lukman Otunuga, an analyst at forex firm FXTM, said:And now let’s have a look ahead to the US jobs numbers, due shortly.The headline non-farm payrolls number is expected to fall, from 164,000 in July to 158,000 for August, if economists’ average forecasts are to be believed.Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell will be hoping for a Goldilocks non-farm payrolls number: too high and it could trigger a market adjustment in expectation of a delay to any stimulus too low and it could undo the fragile optimism about the US economy.Powell has come under massive pressure from Donald Trump, the US president, who has called repeatedly for interest rate cuts to support growth.Powell, for his part, has said that the president’s trade war with China is one of the major risks to the global economy.Wetherspoons’ boss Tim Martin has pledged to slash the price of lagers, spirits, wine and cider if the UK leaves the EU, after shaving 20p off a pint of ale to illustrate the Brexit benefits he expects for drinkers.Martin has been one of the most vociferously pro-Brexit figures in the world of business, repeatedly insisting that leaving the European Union, even without a deal, will mean cheaper prices for customers.Wetherspoons has cut the price of Ruddles, an ale made by Greene King, by an average of 20p across its 900 pubs.

If we have to take action, we will. People are offended by bonuses.US stock market futures have gained ahead of the jobs report.Whether that mood of mild optimism holds will depend in large part on the non-farm payrolls number.The news yesterday that the US and China will resume trade talks next month – coupled with a relatively strong private-sector estimate of jobs growth – have given investors a bit of appetite for riskier assets as we head towards the non-farm payrolls data.US government bond yields have also risen, as investors have moved their money elsewhere. Bonds yields rise as prices fall due to lower demand for the safe-haven assets.Boris Johnson’s decision to prorogue parliament for five weeks is legal, the high court in London has ruled.In a judgment handed down by three of the most senior judges in England and Wales, the prime minister was found to have acted lawfully in the advice he gave to the Queen to suspend parliament from next week, writes Owen Bowcott.The ruling will go to appeal at the supreme court, which has already announced it is prepared to hear any appeals on 17 September.You can read the full story here:A fun fact from Reuters’ UK economics correspondent, Andy Bruce: more Britons than ever before have no idea what is going on with monetary policy.As he notes, the public should probably be forgiven this time. Even Bank of England governor Mark Carney himself would be hard-pushed to predict what is going to happen with Brexit – or whether it will have even happened by the time he leaves on 31 January.If there is a no-deal Brexit the Bank could repeat its shock-and-awe rate cut and quantitative easing – but the Bank’s ratesetters have strenuously tried to persuade markets that rates could go either way.We know that there is a world of difference between the economies of London and some of the UK’s other regions.

As a trade war with the US dents growth, and with fears of a recession rising in countries including Germany and the UK, China is stimulating its economy.China’s central bank has announced another round of stimulus today: the People’s Bank of China has cut the amount of money banks have to hold against their loans, in an effort to make them lend more.It’s the seventh cut since early 2018, Reuters reports:China’s central bank said on Friday it was cutting the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves for the third time this year, releasing a total of 900 billion yuan (£102bn) in liquidity to shore up the slowing economy. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) said on its website that it would cut the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) by 50 basis points (bps) for all banks, with an additional cut of 100 bps for some qualified banks.

With over 1,000 people on the emergency housing list, however, it was soon revived.The organisation behind the project is Aprop – an acronym meaning “local provisional housing” that also means “close by” in Catalan – which is working in conjunction with three architectural practices.David Juárez, an architect at Straddle3, one of the practices involved, says people have an image of a “naff” project but that there is nothing shabby about the one- and two-bedroom flats being constructed.They will be built to the same standards as conventional housing, with good thermal and sound insulation and under-floor heating, he says, and when the work is complete they will not even be recognisable as containers.“These container homes are built to a higher standard than much of what is on the rental market in Barcelona,” says the housing activist Jaime Palomera, spokesman for the city’s Tenants’ Union. “This idea that the poor are being forced to live in sardine tins is nonsense.”But concerns have been raised about this type of housing.“The biggest problem with containers is insulation, both thermal and noise,” says Co Govers of the Zest Architecture practice in Barcelona, which specialises in low-energy construction.“That was the big issue when they built student residences in the Netherlands with containers, that they were cold and noisy. You have to add massive amounts of insulation, which is expensive.” Some forms of internal insulation also further reduce the cramped living space.There has been criticism of a similar scheme in Ealing, west London. The children’s commissioner for England recently criticised container flats as unsuitable and unsafe, and residents have said they are cramped, stiflingly hot in summer, and too cold in winter.The total cost of the scheme in Barcelona is €940,000 (£840,000). “We can deliver an apartment in a year while a traditional building takes six to eight years to reach completion,” says Tonet Font of the city’s social innovation department. Work is expected to be completed by the end of October.However, Govers argues that, despite the speed of construction, the flats do not in fact offer value for money: “If they’re producing 12 flats of, say, an average of 45 sq metres for €940,000, that’s not so cheap,” she says. “With that money you could build something new, and something that would be pretty OK, at that. This sounds expensive for temporary housing.”Juárez says Aprop’s prime motivation is to resist the tide of gentrification that is driving all but the most well-to-do out of the city centre as speculation and tourist apartments force up rents and house prices.“Nearly all social housing is built on the outskirts and not in the city centre,” he says. “This is because most of the work on public housing is done by a few big construction companies and they are only interested in big projects.“We can produce housing in much smaller empty spaces that exist all over the city. And if we can do this in a neighbourhood as dense as Ciutat Vella, we can do it anywhere.”Palomera says: “What’s been happening in cities is that private investors have been building luxury homes on these sites, and what the council is trying to do is gain some ground on investment funds and produce quality public housing instead.”The project is scheduled to be taken down after five years if necessary, says Juárez, “but it’s very likely that it will be there a lot longer and, as it meets all the regulations, it could stay as long as any conventional building”.He is aware of the criticism of container flats in the UK and admits that “building with containers can bring terrible results unless you really make an effort”.Juárez says residents’ responses have generally been positive. “Those who oppose it are smaller in number but they’re more vocal. I think the majority are positive but are reserving judgment until they see what it looks like.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/062b720bc3810189a21550210058c611efcec8dd/0_1_3512_2107/master/3512.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0332d37d8d1c3b5873b508b03b2212c5","title":"switzerland scientific exile no deal brexit britain eu immigration","story":"Switzerland has been touted as a model for the UK, post-Brexit. It is an independent state that determines its own laws, controls its own borders, and through its status as an associated country has access to many key elements of EU membership – including the institution’s leading science and research programmes.But Switzerland’s recent experiences should sound a warning about the importance of cross-border ties, and about how future collaborations between the UK and the EU could be jeopardised if a no-deal Brexit materialises this autumn.In 2014, the Swiss had their own referendum, which ultimately called on their government to impose stricter limits on the number of new entrants to their country. The intention was to curb the passage of low-skilled migrants into Switzerland, including free movement with the EU. However, the consequences have been far-reaching – and one unintended effect has been more than five years of isolation and regression for the country’s academic institutions and research groups.Swiss researchers were immediately locked out of Horizon 2020, the EU research and innovation programme, as well as the prestigious European Research Council, and saw their status as key players in Europe evaporate. Unbeknownst to the government, the referendum result undermined seven bilateral arrangements with the EU, dating back as far as 2002.The long-term financial hit Swiss science has taken is still unclear. But the reputational damage has been significant. According to the Swiss research institute EPFL, levels of collaboration with the EU dropped by a factor of 10. Previously, Switzerland had ranked seventh for EU project coordinations, but after 2014 it plummeted to 24th place.For UK science, which boasts an incredible history of world-leading research and discovery, there’s now a nervous wait. The fear is that a similar situation could manifest itself as Britain plots its exit from the EU. The country is, after all, one of the biggest recipients of research funding in the EU – claiming €8.8bn (£7.9bn) out of a total of €107bn during the funding round of 2007-2013. To abandon this would be catastrophic – and could put the UK on a Swiss-style path to scientific exile.There is some recognition of the peril at hand, at least. The UK government has confirmed that, like its Swiss counterpart, it is prepared to step in to make up the shortfall in EU research funding. However, no money can compensate for the loss of invaluable collaborative networks. After 2014, Swiss researchers were not welcome at European research consortia, and the flow of EU-funded scientists into Switzerland stopped.The UK government has said that it wishes to retain access to major pan-European research programmes. Yet the reality of doing so, while simultaneously restricting freedom of movement, does not align with current EU rules – and is something that would make even associate membership of EU research programmes difficult, and perhaps impossible, to attain. The financial hit alone of a no-deal Brexit would cost UK research more than €577m per year in lost opportunity to access very high-value grants – and that’s before the cost is counted of the thousands of jobs that are tied to these projects, and the trickle-down effects their loss would have on the wider economy.So it’s clear that some perspective is needed as we approach the Brexit deadline. The warnings of hundreds of experts, and the cautionary tale of Switzerland must not be ignored. If the proud research and innovation record of UK science is disrupted, it will jeopardise all of our prosperity.• Marja Makarow is a member of the strategic board of the University of Geneva and chair of Technology Academy Finland"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c19dc816cfdec8b4f375ba2bd895685e735276e/0_138_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e655bd8c29c2fb997ac9ac225ff0d303","title":"oil and gas companies undermining climate goals says report","story":"Biggest fossil fuel extractors warned they risk wasting $2.2tn ‘in a low-carbon world’Major oil and gas companies have invested $50bn (£40.6bn) in fossil fuel projects that undermine global efforts to avert a runaway climate crisis, according to a report.Since the start of last year, fossil fuel companies have spent billions on high-cost plans to extract oil and gas from tar sands, deepwater fields and the Arctic despite the risks to the climate and shareholder returns.Andrew Grant, the author of the report, said: “Every oil major is betting heavily against a 1.5C world and investing in projects that are contrary to the Paris goals.”The study is the first to analyse inidual projects to test whether they are compliant with a 1.5C world, and whether they would be financially sustainable in a low-carbon world.It found that none of the largest listed oil and gas companies are making investment decisions that are in line with global climate goals, and risk wasting $2.2tn (£1.8tn) by 2030 if governments take a tougher stance on carbon emissions.Last year Shell said it would spend $13bn on a liquefied natural gas project in Canada and ExxonMobil agreed to invest $2.6bn in the Aspen project in Canada, the first greenfield oil sands project in five years.“Investors should challenge companies’ spending on new fossil fuel production. The best way to both preserve shareholder value in the transition and align with climate change goals will be to focus on low-cost projects that will deliver the highest returns,” Grant said.The report contradicts the public rhetoric of many oil executives who have claimed to support the Paris goals and vowed to invest in renewable energy projects.A spokesperson for Shell said: “We agree that the world is not moving fast enough to tackle climate change. As the energy system evolves, so is our business, to provide the mix of products that our customers need.”A report from the UN Environment Programme has revealed that global investment in renewable energy projects over the last decade is on track to reach $2.6tn by the end of this year.The investment boom has almost quadrupled the world’s total renewable energy capacity from 414GW at the end of 2009 to an expected total of 1,650GW by the end of this year.Inger Andersen, the executive director of the UN Environment Programme, said: “Investing in renewable energy is investing in a sustainable and profitable future, as the last decade of incredible growth in renewables has shown.”The report, co-authored by BloombergNEF, showed that solar power projects led the rise in renewables. Solar power attracted around half of the total investment in renewables over the last decade and has grown from 25GW at the beginning of 2010 to an expected 638GW by the close of 2019.Jon Moore, the chief executive of BloombergNEF, said the sharp falls in the cost of electricity from wind and solar over recent years has “transformed the choice facing policymakers”.“These technologies were always low carbon and relatively quick to build. Now, in many countries around the world, either wind or solar is the cheapest option for electricity generation,” he said.However, Andersen warned that governments cannot be complacent about the growth of renewable energy if they hope to meet the UN’s climate targets."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/183c04d45d961f532673fb6ae83c5869780e6d58/424_358_3110_1866/master/3110.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=001f9ed8b6b4143f003e6f7145fe6562","title":"rare two headed snake nicknamed double dave found us","story":"Baby timber rattlesnake in New Jersey has two fully formed, independently working headsScientists have named a rare two-headed snake Double Dave after it was found in a forest in the US state of New Jersey.The baby timber rattlesnake was discovered last month by environmentalists from the Herpetological Associates group, who study endangered and threatened reptiles.The name Double Dave was coined because it was discovered by the environmentalist Dave Schneider and his colleague, also called Dave. The venomous pit viper, which is 20-25cm (8-10 inches) long, has two fully formed heads, meaning it has four working eyes and two flickering tongues.Schneider explained that Double Dave’s two heads worked independently of each other, and it would be difficult for such a creature to survive in the wild, because the condition meant it was slow-moving and could be easily picked off by prey.Two-headed snakes often have one head that is slightly more developed than the other, and the heads have been known to fight each other over food, not realising that whatever they eat is heading to the same digestive system.The condition of having more than one head is known as polycephaly, and happens in much the same way that conjoined twins are formed: an embryo that has begun to split into identical twins stops before fully iding.Two-headed animals are considered in many cultures to be a portent of disaster, and they have frequently appeared in mythology. But although they are rare, happening in around one in 100,000 live births in the wild, two-headed snakes do turn up fairly frequently. In recent weeks, another two-headed snake made the news after it was photographed in the Bali resort of Tabanan.In 2018, a two-headed snake even went on tour. Named Tom and Jerry, the 17-year-old California kingsnake appeared as one of the star attractions at the Reptile Expo in Villeneuve, Switzerland.Keeping two-headed snakes alive can pose problems. Photographs of a two-headed eastern copperhead found in Woodbridge, Virginia, last year went viral, and the viper breeder Cooper Sallade, who was looking after it, told Wired magazine: “Since the snake had such an incomprehensible amount of media attention, there was a lot of pressure on me to keep that thing alive.”He ended up gently force-feeding it, because the heads were not well-developed enough to eat independently, but after a few months the snake died.Because of its poor chances of surviving in the wild, Double Dave is being taken into captivity by the Herpetological Associates. “We’ll take care of it,” said Schneider."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26cd45527c08ba6ee5cee3ff712150f8c88f53d9/1_0_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f13dca26543ec67614ddff9deb81382e","title":"grandfather readers vintage clothes oxfam fashion","story":"To mark an Oxfam campaign against fast fashion, readers reveal their best secondhand findsFor many fashion lovers, September is one of the most important months on the calendar. Not only does it herald the start of various fashion weeks, but it’s also when many of us ditch our summer wardrobes and shop for the new season’s designs.However, our love of new clothes has become increasingly unsustainable. According to Oxfam, every week 11m items of clothing end up in landfill. And recent studies show the textile industry creates more CO2 emissions than aviation and shipping combined.In an attempt to combat fast fashion, the charity has launched Second Hand September, a campaign that urges people not to buy new clothing for 30 days. To mark the occasion, we asked our readers to share the stories behind their favourite secondhand finds.I was in an abusive marriage and during that time I gained six stone. After losing weight, I decided to celebrate my birthday – something I hated doing – and wanted something nice to wear. Being a single mum on benefits meant I had a tiny budget. I found this gem for £4.99 and in a size 10 (I previously wore 18-plus).Now I am a working single mum – I’m the manager of a charity shop. Because we sell mainly children’s goods, I am surrounded by kids all day and they are just amazing. We don’t sell our goods at ridiculously high prices as we believe everyone has the right to access affordable clothes. I often do £1 sales on all children’s clothes so people can buy essential items.I love shocking people when they realise this outfit is from a charity shop and it only cost £5 – £3 for the pants and £2 for the jacket.I give workshops and talk at panels about “hostile environment” immigration policies. I’m always talking about how bad things are, so when I can rock up in my favourite outfits and look colourful and happy, it helps me feel good about the work I do. It also throws some positive energy into the room.Yes, Primark is cheap, however I’ve had jumpers from charity shops that have lasted five years and are still in great condition. The only time I enjoy shopping is when I charity shop. It’s a slower process, of course. You can’t rush it because your dream piece could be anywhere. I hate shopping in high-street shops. I hate the rush of it, I hate that everything looks the same and I’m going to pay loads of money just to look like everyone else.I got a job co-presenting the Royal Academy programme on BBC2 with Kirsty Wark and I needed five outfits, so I went hunting for a few extra tops. Friends commented about how huge my wardrobe budget must have been. In reality, there was no budget and most of the outfits were secondhand, including this one.This top reminds me of my grandfather Hosea. I am basically trying to replicate him in the 70s. He oozed cool. I was first introduced to ‘op-shops’, as they were called in Australia, where I grew up, by my mum and aunty in the 90s. Back then I thought it was very uncool and only wanted to wear brand new Reebok pumps and Fido Dido outfits.I love buying new clothes but friends of mine who make social justice documentaries have taught me to think about the supply chain and conditions for workers, so these days I feel reluctant to just buy new.This is my favourite thing in my wardrobe. When I bought it a couple of years ago, a corner was just peeking out on a stuffed-to-the-brim row of clothes and I thought, ‘I don’t know what that is but, however much it costs, I know I need it in my life’. It still blows my mind that 80s Marks \u0026amp Spencer could have produced something so incredibly vibrant and unique. It makes me smile every time I look at it in my wardrobe – it’s like the sartorial equivalent of wearing a rainbow.I first started charity shopping in 2012 when I was at uni in Durham. I’ve been shopping entirely secondhand from 2016. Because there’s so much variety, I feel more inclined to be creative with my own style.I purchased this jumper from an RSPCA charity shop. I didn’t go into the shop for anything in particular, but when I saw this jumper I thought that it was something I would wear and a great way to recycle something that would otherwise have gone to waste. I wear it all the time – I especially like it with some shirts that I have.I have been buying clothes from charity shops for as long as I can remember. It used to be just a one-off thing to do if I was passing by, but now I try to make a conscious effort to get my clothes from charity shops. I really like buying clothes, but when buying new clothes I always have an underlying sense of the huge problem that this industry is causing for the environment and how much better it would be if more people bought secondhand clothes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9affe0677fd7f4ae935c5ea086126dcf609f6c8/1048_1635_2362_1417/master/2362.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b67304b978a06793e0359c5c2496db7b","title":"how to wear bourgeois chic","story":"Hit refresh with a back-to-school update that’s on ladylike lines but a bit more tongue in cheek“Bourgeois chic” is a major trend in autumn fashion. I’m not convinced we need to read all that much into this on a socioeconomic level, to be honest. Fashion’s grasp of how money operates in the real world is often pretty sketchy, after all. This is a world where a sales assistant tells madam solemnly that the keyring is £500, and madam is expected to keep a straight face.The significance of bourgeois chic is simply in terms of your wardrobe. This is a change of direction for daywear, so it means new options when it comes to outfits to wear to work. Which is important, because a back-to-school wardrobe refresh can really help this time of year feel like a new start rather than just the end of summer.Even better, from both an economic and environmental point of view, is that much of this new look is, most likely, in your wardrobe already. It starts with a skirt that is a bit shorter and sharper than the midi- to maxi-length ones we’ve been wearing recently. Have a rummage behind the midi skirts that have dominated the last few years, and you may well find exactly what you are looking for. I bought this skirt in J Crew about a decade ago, because I liked how the bubble-gummy colour made the wide pleats feel a bit less staid I still do. When I wore it the last time around it was often with a crew-neck sweater, shirt collar and cuffs pulled out: that Prada-esque haute librarian vibe, for those of you with long fashion memories. This time around, I’m leaning towards a silk blouse, which is the ultimate bourgeois chic garment – and, frankly, just one of the all-time most useful wardrobe standbys.The difference between bourgeois and ladylike, in the fashion lexicon, is that bourgeois is a bit more fun, a little more tongue-in-cheek. So you might go for a blouse with a dalmatian or a leopard spot, for instance. You could swap out the blazer I’m wearing here for a cardigan, but since we’re doing nu-bourgeois rather than haute-librarian you’re going to want a structured, slightly fancy cardigan – I’m thinking a gold button, or a piped trim, or a sequin à la new season Celine, rather than the pen-chewing slouchy kind.The palette is different, too. No more winter florals on a dark background, no more muted painterly tones. Instead you want urbane, sophisticated colours: cappuccinos and milky vanillas, and the pastel shades of window box flowers. Don’t overaccessorise it. Oh, and don’t overthink it, either."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6fa4232402b9309692236b262013d1eb33edde8/0_2437_4160_2495/master/4160.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0500cc0a7374fce46312aa531b7fa4e","title":"statement earrings and blue lipstick street style from ghanas chale wote in pictures","story":"The annual festival of arts that took place in Accra last month puts self-expression at its heart.

Perhaps, she says, it’s because of her obsessive natureLynne Ramsay crash-lands on an armchair on the terrace – hair flying, skirts swirling – looking as though she has just been blown in from the sea. She was out late last night at some ritzy Venice film festival soiree or other. “Dancing with Joaquin,” she says, scrunching her face in embarrassment. The upshot is that she is totally knackered today.No one is going to begrudge the woman a night on the tiles. All the same, it feels weird to have the director – arguably the toughest, purest voice in modern British cinema – wafting around the photo-calls and champagne receptions like some glamorous social butterfly. Any festival competition that doesn’t include a Lynne Ramsay picture feels, on some nagging, illogical level, like an opportunity missed.It is now 20 years since Ramsay’s debut picture, Ratcatcher, led us on its throat-catching child’s eye tour of her native Glasgow 15 since Morvern Callar proved that she was no flash in the pan. But since then, devotees have grown accustomed to waiting long years for the director to make contact. She has struggled to get some projects made ruffled industry feathers by bailing out of others. “I suppose I’m a bit of a perfectionist,” she shrugs, which is such a whopping understatement it almost makes me choke on my coffee.Without a feature to bring to this year’s festival, Ramsay has come with a short film instead. It is a documentary study of the French portrait photographer Brigitte Lacombe, commissioned as part of Miu Miu’s Women’s Tales series. Ramsay’s approach is typically curious and mercurial, crossing the line in both directions as the film shows her shooting Lacombe while Lacombe shoots her. Both women normally hate having their picture taken. Both have always loved making images of others.“I asked her how many pictures she takes a day and she wouldn’t tell me,” Ramsay says. “It was so many that it was like she was embarrassed. It’s like an addiction for her and I’m a bit like that too. I get really into things, totally obsessed. They thought I was deaf when I was a kid because I was always totally off in my own little world.”Actually, she adds, she has known Lacombe for years. They first met in 2011, when Ramsay was in Cannes with her elegant adaptation of We Need to Talk About Kevin. They were hanging out together in Poland when Ramsay received word that Joaquin Phoenix had signed on to take the lead role of wonky, dangerous Joe in 2017’s You Were Never Really Here, which meant that the project was finally up and running. I tell her that Phoenix’s latest turn in Joker seems to carry trace elements of his collaboration with Ramsay and she nods and smiles to humour me. “Joe’s scarier,” she says finally.When Ramsay got the call to make the Lacombe documentary she was holed up in Costa Rica. She was hard at work on a script, starved of human company. “Writing’s so hard,” she says. “Someone once said that it’s basically like vomiting and then bending down to pick out the good bits. And I always want to keep my hand in shooting stuff. Being on set, shooting a film – that’s the part of the process I love the most.”Which begs the obvious question: why isn’t she doing more of it? Ramsay has made four features in two decades, each in their way a masterpiece. But right before meeting her, I run into Steven Soderbergh. And over that same period he has cranked out 23.“Why am I not making more?” she says. “I suppose it’s all a money thing. Getting finance together can take a while. Getting everything right can take a lot of time.” She grins. “Also, I’m not a brilliant multitasker.”For years she nursed a desire to make a big metaphysical science-fiction movie, with a plot freely adapted from Moby-Dick. This strikes me as the perfect text for a director whose career has been a saga of prolonged deep es and sudden, splashy reappearances. She still thinks she would like to do it, but probably not for the foreseeable future. She has yet to catch Ad Astra, James Gray’s acclaimed space saga, starring Brad Pitt as an astronaut on an obsessive search for his father. But she suspects that it might have slightly stolen her thunder.“Every director has a labour-of-love project,” she says. “It’s like Stanley Kubrick always wanting to do Napoleon. So maybe I’ll make it when I’m 80 or something. But Ad Astra does feel a wee bit close to home. So yeah, James Gray probably got there first.”Naturally, there are other factors at play here as well. Ramsay was scarred by her fractious experience during the US production of Jane Got a Gun, eventually jumping ship at the 11th hour in early 2013. Her marriage broke down she went to live in Greece for four years. And she gave birth to a daughter, who is now about to start school. “That was probably the main thing,” she says. “It’s nice to be able to spend some time with my daughter.”But she is aware that life is short she says she probably needs to get cracking. Over in Costa Rica, she had been working on an original idea. The script is now done the financial situation looks hopeful. “So I hope to get up and running with another feature next year,” she says. “Maybe even sooner. Because I would like to make more, I really would. And I’ve actually got four or five ideas on the go, enough projects to last me the next 10 years.” Her eyes have taken on a faraway cast. She says: “Maybe this is going to be the most prolific time of my life.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/568b0ff8d875e5219707892db1779b4b461db633/0_0_2429_1457/master/2429.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a32fbd9327460fe79a3179698342e09b","title":"jack oconnell shaun ryder happy mondays biopic twisting my melon","story":"Jason Isaacs and Maxine Peake in talks to star as Ryder’s parents in Twisting My Melon, based on ‘Madchester’ singer’s autobiographyJack O’Connell is set to play Happy Mondays frontman Shaun Ryder in new biopic Twisting My Melon.The film, based on Ryder’s autobiography, will track the singer’s journey from a guitar-loving child to a leading light of Madchester’s party scene.

Maxine Peake is in talks to star as Ryder’s mother.Director Matt Greenhalgh said: “Shaun and the last true working-class band – the Happy Mondays – mainlined into my musical DNA when I was 16 years old … Ryder is the son of John Lennon, Johnny Rotten with a few kilos of John Belushi stamped in.” Production is set to begin in January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45ccb9e20ecdab57671159f625bf51894eac0b97/0_190_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c6e7363c927b96a6b0f5d53b005880c","title":"tell us who do you share your home with","story":"As part of a new series in the ’s Weekend magazine we are looking for interesting pairs who live togetherWe’re looking for unusual partnerships – two people who live together in a way that shows the changing nature of the traditional household – for our new series that seeks to reflect how the place we call home can now include extended family, friends and even strangers.In the first piece in a series talking to pairs of people who live together we met the McPhersons, a grandmother and grandson living together who tell us their story.

Harwood added that the US tech duo were being supplemented by new players such as Apple and Disney, which is launching its own streaming platform. “The rise of Netflix and Amazon represents a tremendous period of opportunity to tell a huge range of stories with many different outlets. They were stage one. Now we also have Apple, Disney+ and other players including Starzplay and Hulu all potentially looking to British producers for content. It is a tremendous period of opportunity.”The spending boom from Netflix and Amazon has put the squeeze on studio space to shoot shows and films. In July, Netflix, which made more than 40 productions in the UK last year, including Top Boy, struck a deal to take over Shepperton Studios as a permanent production base to enable it to keep a smooth flow of TV shows and films.The shortage of filming space has led some broadcasters to seek creative solutions with the emergence of “pop-up” studio sites. ITV uses a former military airbase in Yorkshire to film the hit drama Victoria and a converted carpet warehouse in Neasden, north-west London, was used as the filming base for another ITV production, Mr Selfridge.A strategy of providing a continual pipeline of new content has fuelled the rapid growth of Netflix, which has 151 million global subscribers, with 11 million in the UK, and Amazon’s Prime Video, which has 85 million subscribers worldwide and more than 8 million in the UK.The UK TV production sector is hoping for another fillip as Disney ramps up spending on programming for its new service, which includes the $100m Star Wars series The Mandalorian, which is to launch on 12 November.Disney is committing billions to make Disney+ a success in its effort to become a third global streaming giant alongside Netflix and Amazon, which will spend about a combined $20bn on making and licensing TV shows and films this year.The Pact report also highlights the booming popularity of British-made shows in international markets as sales of programmes such as The Bodyguard, The Cry, Line of Duty and Peaky Blinders hit £214m.“These figures show that there is a huge international market looking for quality British content,” said Sara Geater, the chair of Pact."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73eaf12e5bd39fab747fe094d295f30d11d49e8f/0_398_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9bb09ea47a9c51efc2607e7f4463e99","title":"guardian investigations giant tech data","story":"Our head of investigations explains how a new IT system, Giant, has the power to find needles in journalistic haystacksThere aren’t too many places to hide at the . The offices are open-plan and most of the meeting rooms have glass walls.There is one room, however, that has a special status. In recent years, when we have been involved in big investigations, this is the place where reporters and editors have relocated for months on end.Only certain people have been allowed in its general vicinity. For some reason, it gets too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter. The curtains are drawn most of the time. And because it’s off limits to the cleaners, it can look like a landfill site, particularly in the run-up to a launch.Our work on Snowden, the Panama Papers and the Paradise Papers all began in this room, which is a muddle of “clean” computers, run on separate networks, plugged into secure printers sitting next to oversized bins and paper shredders, one of which blew up from overuse during a panic a few years ago.There is a new addition to this room now it’s a humming, blinking stack of servers called “Giant”, and it will help us, and journalists from other media groups we work with, to undertake complex investigations more quickly and securely.It’s a brilliant innovation – one of a number being developed in-house that, in time, we hope to share with organisations that might find it valuable.Our investment in this kind of technology reflects how investigative journalism is evolving, and while reporters will always be at the core of everything, we have to give them the tools to undertake really difficult work in what is becoming an increasingly difficult environment.Giant is a part of this. It allows us to search and cross-search massive databases in quick time. At some point in the years to come, artificial intelligence too may help us to find important journalistic needles in haystacks piled high with millions of documents.One thing will never change. We rely on sources and whistleblowers to trust us, and to share sensitive information that we aren’t supposed to know about. ’s SecureDrop service allows you to anonymously share files with us by encrypting the contents.Handling this information has become an increasingly important part of what we do, especially if you want to prod and probe the kind of people, businesses, and institutions the  has focused on in recent years.Pursuing the truth behind the murder of the journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, led by Juliette Garside, or asking questions about the safety of medical devices being put in patients’ bodies, which was investigated by Hilary Osborne and Hannah Devlin in the Implant Files, can lead you to some uncomfortable truths.It is no exaggeration to say that some people and some organisations seem untouchable – because they operate in, or exploit, grey areas where nobody seems to know what is going on. It has been one of the more unnerving things in recent years for reporters to discover that the inspectors and law enforcement agencies that are supposed to be policing these environments are a long way behind us, or not there at all.The official bodies are either too weak or too poorly funded, or both, to properly scrutinise, for instance, how vast amounts of money is being laundered through offshore jurisdictions – or why some people, for whatever reason, have chosen to hide their identities, and their vast wealth, behind an array of shell companies that serve no obvious purpose.In the UK, there is now a tier of super-rich people that is well protected from the police, the Serious Fraud Office and the National Crime Agency. It means certain people and their businesses are actually beyond the reach of the law, and they know it. They are protected by a praetorian guard of solicitors and accountants who have got very wealthy defending clients with suspiciously earned billions.Before we published stories from the Panama Papers leak – a collaboration we undertook with media partners and coordinated by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists – we sent about 150 “right of reply” letters to various inidual and businesses in return, we got an equal number of letters from London’s top law firms threatening us with all manner of indignity and humiliation if we dared to publish anything. We were told their clients had done nothing wrong and we had no right to be investigating their private affairs. In short, there was no story – and we had no right to go looking.We published. In the three years since then, more than £200m in fines and back taxes have been collected in the UK, and more than £1bn worldwide. Politicians have had to quit, inquiries have been set up. It turns out there was a story – but a story of the kind that is increasingly hard to tell. Recent legal rulings in the UK have made “breach of privacy” the litigation of choice to frustrate and threaten journalists.We are in a position now where we can publish stories that are factually accurate and which we believe are in the public interest, and still run the risk of having to pay damages.Which brings me back to the secret projects room.  is lucky to have reporters and lawyers who know how to avoid the bear traps laid in front of them. But the last few years has shown how important the technical specialists have become too. To be able to research and tell certain stories, and to protect our sources, and the information they give us, we are having to develop new ways and methods.In July, for instance, we reported how Chinese border police are secretly installing surveillance apps on the phones of visitors. To understand the story, and then to tell it, we teamed up one of our investigative reporters, Hilary Osborne, with one of our developers, Sam Cutler. It won’t be the last time our staff collaborate in this way.There used to be quite a gulf between our editorial and digital departments. Giant shows that isn’t the case any more. The journalists of the next generation – some of them, anyway – will have to blend the skills of both."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8e7d9d37367fa3a368f538363bf038419d66f8e/0_0_1516_910/master/1516.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c8e70a06d3e5d3f03a9b1b30975b6eb","title":"what financial advice would you have given to your younger self","story":"From pension pots to property and investments, we asked three people with a wealth of experience what they wish they had known earlier on in lifeIt’s often said that we regret the things we didn’t do more than the things we did. The road not taken. But these regrets are typically rooted in explicit choices and decisions we’ve made. Often, however, we regret things that we weren’t even aware were options – the roads we didn’t know about. This kind of regret is particularly pertinent when it comes to managing our money. Although we make dozens of choices with our money every single day, we are blind to the options we didn’t even consider.For instance, even if we’re prudent enough to put some money aside instead of spending it on items we hardly ever use, we typically just stick it into a savings account. Or we put it into bricks and mortar. Many of us don’t even consider investing.Perhaps this is one reason why people who have successfully met some of their financial goals often credit the advice and wisdom of those with more experience. So what advice would people who’ve been there and done that give to their younger selves – and others?Debby Clarke, 54 bookkeeper, HarpendenMy advice would be to make an effort. I had no financial education whatsoever and I really wish I had. When I was growing up my dad handled the finances and my mum had nothing to do with them, so that set a sort of example. It didn’t help that when I met my future husband he was more clued up and I found it all a bit boring.Many kids still leave school without a clue now. As parents we took it on ourselves to explain things like budgeting, interest and credit to our daughter and that had the effect of making me make more of an effort.The other thing I’d tell myself is to start a pension sooner. I was in my late 30s when I took one out, but then we put all our money into getting on the property ladder, which I don’t regret. But I realise I should have invested a bit more for later in life now that I’m headed in that direction. I won’t be able to afford to retire early like my parents did, probably not at 65 either – but perhaps that’s not the worst thing.Trevor Levy, 55, financial adviser, LondonPensions seem a million miles away in your 20s and I was no different – even though I ended up working in the financial services industry. I was trying to get people to take out a pension but I didn’t have one of my own for a while. Now, I explain to people that pensions aren’t an older person’s thing. A pension is your long-term financial friend and I should have made friends sooner. People get obsessed by property but it’s about having a balanced set of options to cover all eventualities.Making money was seen as cool in the 1980s. Everyone was buying and trading shares. I didn’t know enough about it but I invested in a funeral firm. I thought: “There’s something that’s never going to run out of business” – but there was no plan and I didn’t hold them for very long. Everyone expected to make a quick buck in that era, but it doesn’t work like that. You need to take a long-term view and have a portfolio to spread the risk.Richard Southgate, 70, retired, MaestegOne piece of advice my dad gave me was: “Spend a bit, save a bit, make the devils wait a bit.” I didn’t quite heed my parents’ advice. There’s probably something in that. They knew stuff I didn’t. They were upper-working class and had to be careful with money.If I could do things again I’d have got on the housing ladder quicker. For my generation property has proved great value. Though obviously it’s much harder to get on the ladder these days.There was a tech boom a few years ago. I didn’t have a lot of money but I wanted to get in on it. I had a financial adviser and he said: “It’s too late, don’t bother.” I didn’t listen and lost a fair bit – so that was a salutary lesson. I have taken advice since and have done OK on the stock market. I learned to ride the ups and downs and take a long-term view. I use a technique known as pound cost averaging, which involves putting a few quid in each month, rather than investing a lump sum all at once. You can’t time the market – the ups and downs average out.Whatever your level of confidence, HSBC could help you make better-informed investment decisions.

But with a bit of careful planning, you can pull it off. We spoke to three people who did exactly thatPutting money aside – whether it’s for short-term goals or major life changes – can be difficult. There’s the unappealing prospect of forgoing stuff, toning down your social life, or taking on a side hustle. But with a bit of careful planning, and a clear goal to motivate you, you can pull it off. We spoke to three people who did exactly that.To overcome the daunting prospect of putting away thousands of pounds, she broke her goal down into setting aside a few hundred pounds from her salary per month. When Sarah eventually started The Gluten Free Blogger alongside her day job, she set a new goal: to put away all the money she raised from the website. “It made it easier knowing I didn’t have to sacrifice everything and could still live my life, by funding my savings goal through a side hustle I was passionate about,” she says. Sarah’s savings plan was fairly traditional – using an ISA to build savings and putting away a little each month. Eventually, she shifted to a savings account that gave her better interest rates.Sarah recommends that anyone trying to save for a mortgage should set a monthly goal and stick to it. “I enjoyed being able to save and spend at the same time, but in hindsight it would have been nicer to commit a set amount each month and perhaps reach my goal a little quicker,” she says. Day-to-day she made small sacrifices, such as eating out less and forgoing takeaway coffees. She also decided to put off some overseas holidays until after she had raised her deposit. “As the end came nearer, it felt easier to somehow find the money.” Her next goal? Finding her dream home.She set up an investment portfolio and chose a lower-risk option. “I have always tended to take guidance and invested my money, I got an insurance policy paid out and it was all invested, for example.” Kay says that it was simple enough to amass the capital she needed to invest, by living a little more modestly. “It’s not the fact that I don’t like spending, but I’m just an ordinary, day-to-day person – I don’t yearn for fancy things,” she says. I’m very content. If I can live like I’m living now from today until tomorrow, I’ll be more than happy.”How to save to travel the world as a volunteerDorothy Selleck, 86, has spent 40 years travelling the world, volunteering in schools via the World Organisation for Early Childhood Education (OMEP). While she was still at university, Dorothy, who speaks Welsh as a first language in addition to multiple other languages, was approached by a friend who convinced her to use her skills in charity work. For weeks at a time, Dorothy would take time out from her job as a school’s inspector and visit places around the world, including Japan, India and South America. “We were still at our jobs – you couldn’t leave them for very long, but you could leave them for long enough,” she says.Dorothy paid her own way volunteering. Flights, accommodation, travel expenses and a membership fee to OMEP were funded through a full-time job and living a modest lifestyle. “I didn’t spend a great deal of money on myself,” Dorothy says. As well as setting up four separate savings accounts where she could budget her money for travel and day-to-day living expenses, Dorothy put some of her money into a house and approached HSBC for guidance on setting up an investment portfolio.Dorothy says being afforded the freedom to volunteer has allowed her to see hidden corners of the world and master three languages. Even now, long after her retirement 27 years ago she still volunteers at schools a few days a week – although much closer to home. “I’m still doing voluntary work,” she says. “It’s very important to me.”Top tips for saving for a major life goalInvestments can carry a higher risk than cash savings and you may not always get back what you put in.

The amount you have will determine what sort of plans you can turn into reality.Putting together a financial plan for each of these defining moments can give you greater freedom and choice. You’ll be able to enjoy each stage without worrying so much about money issues.If you are financially secure, you can take more informed decisions about moving jobs or changing career you may even get better deals on products such as mortgages and loans and you’ll have more time to spend on the things that matter to you – like leisure, travel and family.Taking time to set goals, thinking about what your priorities are, and putting in place a savings scheme for the future are all essential elements in good financial planning. The good news is that it’s never too early or too late to start.You would imagine that you need a lot of money in order to start saving or investing. In reality, even relatively small sums can grow into a sizeable nest egg over time.The real secret of financial planning is making regular contributions and sticking at it over the long term. Building personal wealth is not a quick fix. Taking a lot of risk with your hard-earned cash in the hope of securing a short-term gain could be counter-productive.Instead, you should think of managing your money as a lifelong strategy and the key to future freedom, which can change and adapt as your personal circumstances change. When you are younger, you might take a little more risk and perhaps consider investing as a way of protecting your savings against inflation. In retirement you might need to think about how to protect your funds against sudden falls in value.Whatever age you are, the best way to start is to put away a bit of money at a time and allow interest to accumulate and investments to grow. If you save or invest into an inidual savings account (Isa), then everything you earn will be free of income and capital gains tax – giving your savings plan a boost.If you think of managing your money as the key to freedom, rather than a chore, you gain a new perspective on your finances. There are three key elements to planning for the big events in your life: setting goals, making it a habit, and reviewing your progress.What do you want to achieve with your savings and investments? Identifying a tangible goal – such as saving up a deposit for a home, being able to afford a wonderful honeymoon, or taking time off work after the birth of a baby – can be more motivational than having a vague idea of saving for some undefined future event. It’s important to have a rainy day fund first, for those unexpected events, so you won’t need to dip into your goal pots in troubled times.Now build in a timeframe – when will you need the money? What will you need to do in order to start saving? How much can you start with and could you make savings in your monthly spending in order to free up some spare cash? Small changes can make a big difference over the long term. For instance, if you have one less takeaway coffee at £3 a day, this equates to £15 a week, which over a year will amount to more than £700.If you have multiple goals, split your saving priorities into pots of money – short term, medium term and long term. Short term might be money for a fantastic honeymoon or overseas trip in a year or two medium term might be wanting to save for a house deposit over five or six years and long term will be your retirement planning.When you are clear about your goals and your timeframe, then you can start to think about the best home for your money.For funds you want to access within the next five years, you might consider a deposit account. You can make small incremental payments into a savings account or cash Isa. Moving money from your current account to a savings account on the day you get paid, or setting up a standing order, will mean you’re not tempted to spend it. However, as many of these are instant access, you’ll need to be disciplined about not touching it. If you think you might be tempted, consider a fixed rate savings product that locks your money away, often in return for a better interest rate.If your goal is five years or more away, you could consider investing in a variety of ways, at different levels of risk. Although these carry a higher risk than cash savings, they can also protect your money from the effect of inflation if your investments outperform the rate of interest offered by savings accounts. As you start this journey, it might be wise not to chase big wins or follow fashion – but instead to opt for a slower but safer approach, perhaps choosing funds that invest in a broad range of shares rather than trying to pick inidual companies. There are many sources of information about market trends, and it’s always good to become familiar with these.Any money you put into Pension savings has the benefit of being boosted by tax relief, but you can’t access the fund until you’re at least 55 and it’s best to wait until you retire. You should join a scheme at work if they have one, or save into your own private pension.It’s easy to start off with good intentions, and then forget to continue because of a lack of time or motivation.The key to successful money management is automating your financial commitments. Set up a regular amount to leave your bank account and be paid directly into your Isa or savings account. That way, the money has moved before you spend it, and you never have to set a reminder.Playing the long game can work in your favour, because the interest you build up in a deposit account will accumulate naturally. If you are investing for the long-term in the stock market, you’ll be less concerned with the short-term ups and downs of share prices. Sometimes people approach saving and investment in an emotional, rather than a rational way.It’s easy to buy shares when the stock market is doing well, and then panic after they have fallen. Try to take a long-term view, and check how your strategy is working for the long term, rather than from month to month. Remember: investments should be viewed as a five-year commitment, so make sure you think of these as a long-term strategy.Investments can carry a higher risk than cash savings and you may not always get back what you put in. Remember, the value of any tax benefits described depends on your inidual circumstances, and tax rules may change in the future.Whatever your situation, and no matter your level of confidence, HSBC could help you make better-informed investment decisions.

I respect him’Anthony Joshua believes he will be up against the best fighter on the planet when he takes on Andy Ruiz Jr in their 7 December rematch.Ruiz caused a major shock in June when he handed out a first defeat for Joshua to win the WBA, IBF, WBO and IBO world titles in New York. In the third part of the trilogy of press conferences to promote the rematch in Saudi Arabia, Joshua said: “My fights are the elite of the elite and are top of the crop. That little bit of motivation of fighting someone who has the skill set and is the champion. It’s not like I’m fighting someone as a stepping stone to a champion. We can’t overlook Andy and his talent and his success in the ring as I’m fighting the best out there right now. In my opinion Andy Ruiz is the best heavyweight out there.“I respect Andy and his team. I’m happy for him. I know what it means to fight for the championship and win the championship so he’s given hope to the people of Mexico.”Former Olympic champion Joshua was knocked down four times by Ruiz, a 29-year-old Mexican, before he was stopped in the seventh round on his US debut this summer, marking one of the biggest upsets in heavyweight history. But he says his motivation to return to the top is a big factor ahead of the December rematch.He added: “Once I’ve got my purpose of life organised, I can do anything and that motivation will be the same. Put me on the street to clean graffiti off the wall, I want to make sure my graffiti cleaning is better than yours – and that’s just my purpose in life.“So motivation isn’t just about boxing. I’ve got to make a few changes in my lifestyle now to correct and align them again so I align my stars.”The fight, the latest high-profile boxing event to be held in Saudi Arabia after Amir Khan’s victory over Australian Billy Dib in July, will take place in Diriyah, a town on the outskirts of the capital Riyadh.Ruiz is pleased he proved his doubters wrong last time out and hopes for more of the same in the second encounter. He said: “Everybody doubted me since I was a little kid and there’s times that I wanted to quit, but having the right people around me, telling me to keep pursuing, saying ’you’re going to be champion’, even when I didn’t believe it when I was younger. I just keep pursuing.“The main thing is believing and doing something you love. I’ve been doing this since I was six years old. This is the only thing I know how to do besides working with my dad in construction and being in the sun and I don’t want that. That’s why I have to give it all I’ve got.“I just have the mindset that I would become the first Mexican heavyweight champion of the world and I’d been praying to God and, what do you know, that came true in June.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09af8206c7a12768850b03c4b1582c9f2aa1b739/0_75_2486_1492/master/2486.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca1f149bbea2e93be27350c5f4e35442","title":"caster semenya starts new journey after joining football team","story":"The two-time Olympic 800m gold medallist Caster Semenya appears to be preparing for a career outside of athletics after joining a women’s football club.The 28-year-old is currently appealing against a decision by the Court of Arbitration for Sport which approved the IAAF’s introduction of a new testosterone limit for female athletes. The governing body introduced the rule change because it argues female athletes with differences of sexual development (DSD) – such as Semenya – have “a competitive advantage”.Under the rule, all athletes with a difference in sex development should reduce their blood testosterone to a specific level for at least six months – and then maintain that for the rest of their athletic career – in order to compete in events from 400m to a mile. Semenya has remained “steadfast in her defiance” to do so and, as such, is unable to defend her 800m world title in Doha later this month without taking hormone-suppressing drugs. So the South African, has started training with Gauteng-based JVW FC with a view to making her debut next season as the transfer window is currently closed.“I am grateful for this opportunity and I appreciate the love and support I already get from the team,” she told the club’s website. “I am looking forward to this new journey, and hopefully I can contribute as much as I can to the club.”Club founder and South Africa captain Janine Van Wyk said: “I am absolutely honoured that out of all the other women’s clubs around the world, she has chosen JVW as the club where she would like to start showcasing her football skills.Semenya is not the first athlete to transfer to football – 100m and 200m Olympic champion Usain Bolt did the same after retiring in 2017, joining Stromsgodset in Norway prior to signing for Australia’s Central Coast Mariners. However, it proved to be short stint in Gosford for the sprint icon he left after only eight weeks at the club.Semenya will not be registered for the 2019 SAFA Sasol League, the league in which JVW play, as the transfer window has shut for the current season. She will train with the team and target being ready to play for them during the 2020 campaign."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/701375902af80922bd4e14ea4b34248092930da8/82_0_3338_2003/master/3338.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd989588a23e56e1293fc03009fca878","title":"helmets dont eliminate concussions its time for the nfl to ditch them","story":"The league’s brain trauma epidemic needs radical solutions. If recent changes aren’t protecting players then we need to rethink the game’s fundamentalsOne of the dumbest storylines of the NFL preseason was Antonio Brown and his banned helmet. The whole saga stunk of a marketing ploy, a soap opera built for the Instagram age. Yet beneath all that fluff, there was a topic worthy of discussion. If the league is serious about reducing traumatic brain injuries, should players wear helmets at all?The biggest misconception about football helmets is that they prevent concussions. They don’t. Helmets protect the skull from fractures. Concussions are caused when the brain moves inside the skull helmets do little if anything to prevent the brain from rattling inside the skull. Helmets are part of the problem, not part of the solution.Modern NFL players are not built like normal people: they range in size somewhere between Captain American and The Hulk. When they put on a helmet, athletes gain a false sense of security. Since they believe helmets are there to protect them, they hit more often – and with reckless abandon. There’s a psychological term for this: risk compensation. Studies of cycling and snowboarding found that athletes wearing helmets are more likely to take dangerous risks than those without. They know there’s danger in plummeting down a mountain with a helmet on. Without one, they feel that danger and are more cautious.Then there is the facemask problem. Although NFL facemasks offer some protection, they also make opponents appear less human. One of the most impactful psychological studies of the modern age was Stanley Milgram’s authority-obedience test. A significant part of Milgram’s work was evidence that people are more likely to inflict pain and harm to people they cannot see. It’s no stretch to believe the same is true in sports with facemasks and visors. The cycle continues: Hit more. Hit harder.Facemasks carry a more significant risk, too. There are two different forces that can cause concussions: linear and angular. Linear involves a direct, head-to-head blow. Angular is an offset blow – basically any contact that isn’t forehead-to-forehead – to the head. According to a report published in the Clinics in Sports Medical Journal, with angular force, the brain cells not only stretch but they twist around themselves causing either damage or death to the cells. Though they don’t always inspire the same kind of gasps or shock, angular forces are more detrimental than linear ones. Additionally, the facemask also gives the otherwise spherical helmet a “nose” increasing torque, therefore amplifying any hit that isn’t head-to-head.Modern plastic, shelled helmets were not introduced to football until the end of the 1940s. Facemasks did not become commonplace until the 1960s. Prior to that, players tackled in a “rugby style”: with the initial point of contact being the shoulder (in the very early days of football, spear tackles were allowed but this dangerous practice was eventually outlawed). Once the plastic helmet was introduced, however, athletes felt safer and began to tackle headfirst. Fatalities spiked.Authorities took the same approach then as they do now. They added more equipment and more rules. In the past 10 years, the NFL has altered the physics of the game: the way people tackle kick-offs new rules on punts who can be tackled, and when.Last year’s so-called “bodyweight” rule broke the dam for even the most ardent of player-health-above-all supporters. It was met with universal contempt. This wasn’t football, the cynics scoffed. This was softer, more millennial. The goal was to keep quarterbacks on the field so the league’s owners could pen large TV deals, not preserve the brain cells of their stars. It was a step too far. The league was breaking the basic fabric of the game.Taking the helmets off would change that dynamic. Players would naturally alter their style, but the general aesthetics of the game would be preserved. NFL coaches have preached about rugby-style tackling for years. In a helmet-free world that wouldn’t be a fun niche, it would be a necessity.Pro football has finally moved in line with college football – it has become quicker, more finesse based, built around athletes in space, not power up the middle. That’s meant fewer destructive hits to players who play on the perimeter. But the risks remain the same for the big guys inside. Offensive and defensive linemen woodpecker away all game banging heads on somewhere between 70-80 plays in an average game. That’s about a 25 play-per-game increase in little over two decades. That’s 25 more times a pair of linemen’s helmets ricochet off one another and create a subconcussive effect, the phenomenon in which the brain hits the inside of the skull causing trauma but without players showing the obvious symptoms of concussion. New, innovative helmets do nothing to stop that they exacerbate the problem. Removing helmets would force linemen to move their heads away from each other rather than risk bumping foreheads up to 80 times in a three-hour .The league has been focused on the dramatic hits that cause concussions, turn off TV viewers and scare parents away from feeding their children into the league’s pipeline. But it’s the subconcussive hits that have the most damaging effects long-term. If there is a concussion crisis in football, it is a subconcussive one.Removing helmets is not about ruining the game fans love. It’s about preserving the game and the players who play it. The current changes have been small potatoes, nice things to stick in a social media campaign or spin to TV executives or parents. Concussions and brain trauma will never be entirely removed from football – or any contact sport – but there is a radical idea sitting under the league’s nose. And it’s time to start taking it seriously."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41b431d1be5a5e577fc80f61d85b98b074df7c6d/0_0_4901_3236/master/4901.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=c9ee76b29a4c2d75324f2a2ee9f9a158","title":"ashes 2019 england v australia fourth test day three live cricket","story":"38th over: England 109-2 (Burns 57, Root 36) The crowd are roaring every time a fielder returns the ball to Lyon. It’s just banter nothing vicious. One from the over. Ordinarily, Lyon would want to bowl to the left-hander, but he’ll want Root on strike as much as possible in the next hour. Here’s Graham Currie. “It seems that we have a struggling captain that wants to play at No4 and has the potential to be one of the top three batsmen in the world but is having to play at No3 because there is no other No3 a wicket keeper who isn’t the best wicket keeper and actually was pretty bloody good at No3 when he wasn’t doing the thing he isn’t the best at the best wicket keeper not playing despite having a pretty handy Test average and finally Jos Buttler in the team, struggling a bit to justify his inclusion, but apparently being regarded as a very good cricket captain? I dunno, seems like there might be a solution in there somewhere?”There might be a needle in that haystack, too. A few months ago I liked the idea of Buttler as captain, but now he can’t buy a run. I’ve no idea any more. If Eoin Morgan had a better back, I’d give it to him in a heartbeat. Of course, England might win the Ashes 2-1, in which case Root will definitely continue.37th over: England 107-2 (Burns 57, Root 35) A better over from Starc, just one from it.36th over: England 107-2 (Burns 57, Root 34) Root inside-edges Lyon for four, just past off stump. It was another big off-break from Lyon, and a lazy dab from Root. He was so lucky to get away with that. Burns wanted to steal a single off the next ball but was sent back by Root. He was home when Lyon collected Warner’s throw, a clean take that brought a huge, sarcastic cheer from the home fans. Lyon held the ball up to acknowledge the recognition of his Headingley cock-up.35th over: England 102-2 (Burns 57, Root 29) This is crap from Starc, who has conceded 22 in two overs since returning to the attack. Burns forces him for three Root tucks a poor delivery off the hip for four and clips three more off the pads.34th over: England 94-2 (Burns 54, Root 22) Root sweeps Lyon round the corner for a couple. He’s straining to find some safe release shots against Lyon, and later in the over he takes a quick single on the off side.“Hi, Rob,” says Smylers. “Congratulations on your ‘prediction’ towards the end of the Saturday at Headingley of England winning by one wicket at 4.21pm the following day — within five minutes of what did transpire! How did you do it, and care to make a similar prophecy for this match?”Crikey, I don’t even remember that. 33rd over: England 88-2 (Burns 53, Root 19) Starc, on for Hazlewood, is square-driven emphatically for four by Burns. That was a beautiful back-foot stroke, which he follows with an edge to the third-man boundary to reach an excellent half-century. That last shot was safe enough, played with soft hands so that it dropped well short of the cordon. Burns’ stats are modest - he averages 30 from 11 Tests - but he’s got the temperament of a Test batsman and he’ll surely stay in the team for the winter.32nd over: England 76-2 (Burns 41, Root 19) Root is struggling against Lyon. He inside-edges an attempted slap through the covers, with the ball whistling just past leg stump. Lyon gives him a knowing look he’s all over Root just now.“I know some might consider it techno cricket,” begins Jeremy Dresner. “However, my local ten-pin bowling alley has the ability to monitor feet over the line using some sort of computer device since the 1990s. Perhaps this wizardry could be the answer for cricket!”Or we could just get Walter Sobchak to do some umpiring. (NB: Clip contains adult language.)31st over: England 75-2 (Burns 40, Root 19) Burns is beaten, fencing at a back-of-a-length delivery from Hazlewood, and then he wears a short one on the body. He’s a fighter, though, and that’s the best England have got. He works Hazlewood off the pads for three to bring up a dogged fifty partnership.Thanks Adam, hello everyone. This is a compelling struggle, especially between Lyon and Root. The pitch is already turning appreciably, so Lyon has a great chance to turn his Headingley mess into nothing more than a detail. Root, meanwhile, might be batting for his job. 30th over: England 70-2 (Burns 35, Root 19) Burns pushes the first ball of Lyon’s over to cover, Root getting to the drinks break after prompting some activity around the bat when his inside edge is found. This contest has been the highlight of the session so far.“100 e-mails about Tendulker and Kohli? I’d be surprised if it was that few,” notes Pay Stephen, before the kicker: “And now you are going to get one about I.V.A. Richards and Brian Lara.” The debate that will roll on forever. And with that, I’m handing the baton to the best in the business: Rob Smyth. Have nice weekends!29th over: England 69-2 (Burns 34, Root 19) Not Hazlewood’s best set, a couple of times misdirecting into Burns’ pads, but the opener doesn’t take advantage. They clearly think the short ball is going to sort him out, and maybe they’re right, but he wants none of it. The data from the county championship says that he doesn’t fancy the hook. Oh, I neglected to note that England went beyond 67! Hurrah! 28th over: England 68-2 (Burns 33, Root 19) Lyon better Root watchful. He gets one to really bite at the start of the over, so the England captain elects to go back to full-defensive mode. Maiden.27th over: England 68-2 (Burns 33, Root 19) Hazlewood is brought back after a fairly short break, following Cummins from the Statham End this time around. But Burns picks up where Root left off in the previous couple of overs, taking a ball from his armpit down to the long-leg boundary. Nothing wrong with that. Of course, Hazlewood is immediately back to where he does his most dangerous work.“What if,” Richard Woods poses, “the umpire had not called Mohammed Amir’s no balls?” Good point. Although, the issue with them not watching the front line as they once did is a more modern problem. The Voges no-ball that wasn’t - costing New Zealand 200ish runs - must have played a role in how umpires now operate.26th over: England 64-2 (Burns 29, Root 19) Lyon misses his mark to Root as well, turned very fine for a third boundary in eight balls for England. That helps. The hosts aren’t going to win this Test but they will probably need to bat a great many overs to save it. 25th over: England 59-2 (Burns 28, Root 15) Cummins slips here, undoing quite a lot of good work since he and Lyon patnered up. First, he misdirects a full ball at Root, deflecting fine for four leg byes. He then feeds him a half volley on leg stump, from which the captain helps himself to another boundary. The crowd are involved. 24th over: England 51-2 (Burns 28, Root 11) Yep, Lyon is on it here. Nice drift, enough turn, hitting his length. Root has to get well forward to make sure he doesn’t get himself into strife and does it handily before keeping the strike with a tuck into the legside.“I am a 16 year old from America who is just getting into cricket after watching the World Cup and the match in Leeds last month,” writes Colin Madigan. WELCOME TO THE FAMILY! “As a relatively new fan, I’m curious to see what are your thoughts about how Steve Smith matches up against some of the best batsmen of all time? Would he make your top 5 list? On a second note, my dad got into the blog 10 years ago, would I become the first legacy to make it?”Not sure if you are the first legacy but let’s say you are. Well done. As for Smith, he is statistically the second best player of all time. That’ll do for me, given this has overwhelmingly been a bowling era. I’m now going to get 100 emails about Virat Kohli and 100 more about Sachin Tendkular, but it’s a risk I’m willing to take. But overall, Colin, I would caution against comparing players across eras.23rd over: England 50-2 (Burns 28, Root 10) What do you know, a no-ball called when Cummins is seen to overstep by Umpire Dharmasena. He’s keen on the short ball to Burns, the man he had out at Leeds hooking in the first innings there. Australia have a leg gully and a short leg in for that but the left-hander now wants nothing to do with it, getting under each bumper. Good cricket.22nd over: England 49-2 (Burns 28, Root 10) Back to back maidens that’s the ticket. Lyon v Root should again be a good contest. 21st over: England 49-2 (Burns 28, Root 10) Two maidens on the bounce from Cummins to begin, this time to Burns. In addition to attacking the channel outside the off-stump, he’s also got the short ball in operation for the first time today, causing the opener a spot of bother from the final ball when it spit back towards his chest.“TV just showed a replay of Cummins bowling to Burns,” says Ian Forth. “What do you know - a big and uncalled no-ball.”The same old problem with the umpires no longer checking, and fair enough too given the slack way it is all handled. Thankfully, the ICC are going back to the well with their plans to improve the process with the third umpire, in keeping with their 2016 trial. At last! Posting the overseas TMS link again. A reminder that the easy way to find this if we aren’t around on the OBO is going to the BBC cricket commentary page and clicking on “listen to TMS overseas.” 20th over: England 49-2 (Burns 28, Root 10) Nathan “Nathan” Lyon into the attack for the first time today, from the Anderson End. They like the match-up with the off-spinner bowling at Burns with a relatively new and hard ball. Within two deliveries he finds the edge, albeit played down with soft enough hands. Silly point is in the game soon enough too - a couple of times. He keeps the strike with a tickle behind square. No issues with Lyon finding his range there.19th over: England 48-2 (Burns 27, Root 10) Cummins is immediately where he needs to be, in keeping with the plan that Australia took to Edgbaston. He’s giving Root nothing to begin before finding his inside edge then beating him on the outside of the bat. Class.18th over: England 48-2 (Burns 27, Root 10) Hazlewood doesn’t suffer from the same impatience, banging away at Root just outside the off-stump before bringing one back that spits off the pad for a leg bye. His first misdirected delivery of the day to finish, down the legside at Burns. Looks like Paine is dragging Starc for Cummins.17th over: England 47-2 (Burns 27, Root 10) A window into why Starc hasn’t played until now, backing up an excellent previous over with a loose one. Burns makes no mistake when receiving a shin-high full toss, smashing it away to the cover rope, then clipping a ball from outside leg for two more. In response, instead of going back to the length that served him well in the previous set, he has a pop at two yorkers, one kept out then the other tucked away for another couple.16th over: England 39-2 (Burns 19, Root 10) Hazlewood’s interrogation of Root continues, the England captaining dealing with the first half of the over conservatively then backing his quick hands to steer a boundary past point, moving him into double figures. The big quick bounces back with a ball that jags back but is sliding down.15th over: England 35-2 (Burns 19, Root 6) Starc’s best over so far, breaking Burns’ concentration when beating him early in the over with a good’un. He took a swipe at one he needed to leave from the penultimate ball then was sorted out with another to finish. “I suppose you could call that nightwatchman’s innings Overton’s Window,” says John Starbuck. A lot bigger than it once was. 14th over: England 35-2 (Burns 19, Root 6) Oooh, Hazlewood is right on the money here. He has Root driving to begin, a ball he should have left well alone and was fortunate not to edge. He leaves the next two very close to that off-stump, the second of which sailed just over the off-stump. Good batting, really. Or judgment, at least. Root is back on the drive later in the over, recording an all run four out to the western stand. Sure enough, Hazlewood beats him again to finish, a delivery that keeps a fraction low if anything. 13th over: England 31-2 (Burns 19, Root 2) Beautiful shot, Burns stroking Starc through cover point for the first boundary of the day. Lovely balance. Another pretty good over from Starc, though, beating the opener early on and keeping him playing straight.12th over: England 26-2 (Burns 15, Root 1) As Nasser notes on telly, the captain Root is back where he likes to bat : No4. He is off the mark first ball, albeit off an inside edge. Burns is beaten by a very handy delivery to finish, moving away a treat from the southpaw.“One fast bowler who did not do the job as captain regularly, but was rather successful when he did, was F S Trueman!” recalls Ian Andrew. “His successes included beating Australia!” Tour game, 1964 or something like that?What a brilliant stat this is on Rory Burns, which says a lot about this very weird series for batsmen from both sides. It takes Hazlewood only three balls to locate Overton’s edge, taken with ease by Smith at second slip. He did his job as nightwatchman.11th over: England 23-1 (Burns 15, Overton 3) Starc’s first ball is on the legside and his second Burns has ample time to leave well short of a length, outside the off stump. His third ball is up near 90mph, closer to that off-stump. Forced to play, Burns pushes with soft hands to backward point. There’s a shout for leg before with a ball that is a bit quicker and swings a tad as well, but it’s going down the legside. Burns defends the final ball, right on the mark. A much better over from Starc than what he sent down to begin last night. The players are back on the field! Mitch Starc has the ball in his hand, he will be bowling from the Statham End. Rory Burns (15) is on strike, England resuming on 231 in pursuit of Australia’s 497-8 (dec). He has the nightwatchman Craig Overton (3) with him. PLAY! We’re nearly there. I can see kids with flags beneath my position in the front for of the press box, which means the players can’t be far away from running out for what I assume will be a long session. “Just wanted to drop you a message whilst on holiday in Riga,” writes Alasdair Robinson. “Thanks for the great coverage, I don’t think cricket is on the radar in Latvia so nowhere to watch. I think my girlfriend Kate appreciated the rain delay as I haven’t had my eyes glued to the phone for the entire holiday.”All part of the service. “On the subject of captains, I just hope that steve Smith never gets offered the captaincy again because one gets the feeling his batting will only improve over the next year or so without any further distractions. We can count ourselves lucky to be able to watch him improve in real time.”Yes to all of that. Let him bat. Just let him bat. But they won’t. Mark Gillespie wants justice for Ben Foakes. “They missed the trick a second time in the winter in SL and the WI. While the two changes didn’t completely overlap, he played a number of games at 3, while Foakes kept wicket. Bairstow averaged ~40 from number 3, with a century and a half century. Foakes batting record was roughly the same in both respects, and he kept impeccably. I’ve yet to hear any reason whatsoever why they reverted back, although one rumourperception (for which i have no evidence) has been that he threw his toys out of the pram. Whatever the reasons, Foakes (who is a superior keeper) was treated abominably.”The most balanced England side surely has him in it. Who knows. Meanwhile, a very Australians-on-tour moment just then.A lovely email from Konstanze Kwiet. “I teach History and Legal Studies at a Western Sydney high school and my cricket-mad students are trying to distract me.Me: “What regional and global situations threaten peace and security?Yr 12: “Broad to Warner?”Me: “What did Britain fear in the pre-WWI period?”Yr 9: “Steve Smith batting.”Love reading the OBO. All the best.” Thanks for being part of it!I’m giving Scott Roberts a right-of-reply because Richard Dennis gave him a clip. But this is my last Pippen-related email. Today, at least. “Firstly, I didn’t say that Pippen wasn’t a great defensive player, and he’s jumped to the conclusion that my only criteria for being a great player is being able to score, which couldn’t be further from the truth. Pippen clearly was a great defender, but he couldn’t carry a team. You can’t argue with the fact that when he lost MJ he didn’t stand a chance of winning, and clearly didn’t win, even with those stacked Houston \u0026amp Portland teams he played with after the Bulls.” Moving back to Warnie, here is Ian Forth. “Is it a fevered dream or do you recall the poolroom mural of his in which he can be seen in deep conversation with The Boss about his flipper? A naked Angelina Jolie, a left handed Elvis and Mad Jack with a slab of VBs also featured from tortured memory (don’t make me look it up). And Chris Martin playing poker, just to take things up to the next level.”What, you mean one of the best days of my life on the internet? OBO-regular Nick Toovey unlocked this at the time, his video going uber-viral of the clip on Sky Cricket. Tom Cowie, of The Age and White Line Wireless then worked out every participant. Wonderful times.“Rather than MJPippen,” begins Norval Scott, “a better comparison for BroadAnderson is another great combo: Glenn McGrath and Dizzy Gillespie. One partner is the metronome that gives you nothing, while the other is streakier, could still run through you on their own on a good day, but also could lose their line or length and get hit about a bit when they tried to do too much. Broad and Gillespie’s bowling and batting averages aren’t that far apart either (obviously I’m not claiming Anderson was as good as McGrath).”I can’t sign up to that. Data like this wasn’t kept then, but Gillespie was one of Australia’s most accurate bowlers. He was faster than McGrath, and fell away suddenly in 2005, but he was never streaky.“I remember talking recently about Stokes being unable to take on the Captaincy because of the Bristol incident,” says Robbie Chedburn, “but I would argue he has redeemed himself with the World Cup and Headingley performances. If Rooty does end up going Stokes could be the man, couldn’t he?”A little bit like Warner: he’s the best available option but has all that baggage. I would actually decrease Warner’s leadership life ban to the same two years that Smith is serving. But it will never happen.Great news. The sun has been shining throughout the lunch interval, the cover are off and now the two teams are quickly warming up. “*cough* Bob Willis *cough*,” replies Mark Slater to my comment about Imran and Kapil. “Certainly no worse than any other England Captain of that era, except for the ultimate specialist skipper Michael Brealey.” Free the fast bowling captains! Free them all!“Sat here outside the ground waiting to go in,” says Mark Carrington. “My mate Graham has just pointed out if play finishes at 8PM (7:30 official close + 30 mins) which is 15 minutes after sunset.”That won’t be quite right. The scheduled close will be 7pm, which becomes 7:30pm after the inevitable extra half an hour. Richard McConnell’s perspective is in line with mine. “I am always minded of the old adage about the folly of making your best operator in a factory the manager. They may not be cut out for the job, and you have also lost your best operator. The added burden of captaining does take focus from your primary role in the side. You can also see this with Bairstow when he has the gloves.”They missed a trick in 2016 with YJB, for mine. That summer - his best, by a mile, with the blade - he kept poorly. This was the time to give him the big batting promotion and move the gloves elsewhere. It’s difficult to see how they manage that transition now, isn’t it? He’s an excellent ‘keeper and wants to keep things are they are. “Graham Currie (12:14) wonders why teams keep giving the captaincy to the best player,” writes Andrew Cosgrove. “Surely it’s not so much that they give it to the best player, but to the player least likely to be dropped? I suppose you could have a series with a different captain each match, but some stability is surely desirable.”Yes, that’s definitely part of it. It’s why Australia might have a problem as Khawaja could have been a temporary fix but he’s found himself out of the XI now and, in turn, a fair way back in the pack. “Nine in Australia is gracing us with highlights from the 1st 1994 Test in Brisbane,” reports Thomas Chick. “Back in a time where shadows on text thicker than the text itself were in fashion, and when a change from, say, a score of 49 to a score of 50 would sometimes display 59 for a frame or two.” Simpler times.Craig McEwan is reading in from Lima. He reminds us that in Mike Brearley’s day “talk about his selection for his captaincy, not his batting. Of note, Paine has a similar Test record to him with the bat. Matt Dony, on the same topic. “Pretty much every Australian I’ve heard on the matter has said that they hope, even if Smith was offered the captaincy, he’d turn it down. I don’t know his character as well as you, but if the offer was made, do you really think he’d say ‘No’? In general terms, elite sportsmen aren’t exactly well known for an ability to recognise their own limitations, or to turn down extra prestige. And in specific terms, he’s come back and proven his point (fairly emphatically!) with the bat, might he be tempted by the redemptive arc of a second term of office?”If they ask, I suppose he would accept? Nobody has put that to him yet but I’m sure it’ll become a talking point. He averages 74 since August 2013, all his 26 tons coming in his last 99 innings. Just let him bat, I say. Leave him to finish with a Test average of 70-something.The stumps are in. The formal inspection isn’t scheduled for another ten minutes but the umpires are currently out there for an ~informal~ look, Trevor Bayliss too. It feels like they’ll be out there very soon.Lunch. With the weather here improving rather rapidly, I’m going to take this opportunity to grab some food myself. Back soon. ... and the covers are slowly coming off again. In theory, we could see some action at 1:10pm, David Gower reckons. In reality, given how much rain there has been so far this morning, it would have to be 1:30pm at the earliest. Then again, it’ll surely rain again soon. “Scott Roberts obviously knows nothing about Scottie Pippen,” slaps Richard Dennis. “He is (and rightly so) regarded as one of the all time best defensive players in basketball history, there’s more to the game than scoring buckets. And, also, Broad has been immense in this series, so even the attempted analogy makes little to no sense. Oh, and also again, 815. No?”To quote from a terrible Australian television show, I’m going to take that as a comment. “Has there been an Ashes (in the covered pitches era) in which the opening batsmen on both sides have performed so poorly?” asks Gavin Byrne. “An early wicket or two has seemed almost mundane in this one.”You can extrapolate that to batting across the Test-playing world, according to the data. Scores haven’t been this low since the 1950s.It is quite sunny at Old Trafford. Maybe we will play at 1:10pm?“England’s top order play the Slough roundabout from the original series’ opening credits,” says Mick Collins on our earlier topic. “Everyone gets a turn.” Excellent.

The CEO of Fremantle Asia Pacific, Chris Oliver-Taylor, said Neighbours was one of the most important dramas in Australian and British history and he was very proud of its evolution.The miniseries was developed by Neighbours’ executive producer, Jason Herbison, and features regular cast members as well as newcomers.“Neighbours: Erinsborough High is an exciting opportunity to shine a light on one of our most iconic playing areas – the local high school,” Herbison said.“It’s long been an ambition to delve deeper into some of our workplaces and the characters who populate them. Who knows what we might do next?”The series, which will be filmed at Fremantle’s Melbourne studios, promises to “explore issues universally troubling teens today – bullying, mental illness, sexuality, cultural ersity, parental and peer pressure, and teacher-student relationships”.Last week the show introduced the show’s first trans character, another first for the ground-breaking soapie which also screened Australian TV’s first gay wedding last year.

The move quickly drew fire from ethics experts and political rivals.The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, called Trump’s properties a “cesspool of corruption” and accused the president of “prioritizing his profits over the interests of the American people”.“Pence is just the latest Republican elected official to enable President Trump’s violations of the constitution,” she said.A spokesman for the vice-president said the decision was partly based on the president’s suggestion Pence stay there, and partly on secret service concerns about costs and logistics. Questioned about the decision on Wednesday, Trump claimed he had “no involvement, other than it’s a great place”.But that was only the start of the controversy.The  columnist Miriam Lord responded to a tense meeting between the vice-president and the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, in which Pence urged the republic to protect the “United Kingdom’s sovereignty”. That Varadkar is gay and Pence a past champion of anti-LGBTQ legislation in Indiana also caused widespread comment.Pence laid on platitudes about being “deeply humbled” and “honoured” to be visiting Doonbeg, the home of his mother’s grandmother. But in Dublin he offered his hosts a clear lesson in his administration’s political priorities.“Let me be clear: the US supports the UK decision to leave the EU in Brexit,” Pence told Varadkar in a prepared statement. “But we also recognise the unique challenges on your northern border. And I can assure you we will continue to encourage the United Kingdom and Ireland to ensure that any Brexit respects the Good Friday agreement.”Among media responses, Irish Central asked: “Did VP Pence betray Ireland in his Brexit comments during Irish trip?”The Irish Examiner accused Pence of trying to “humiliate” the republic.But Lord struck the most telling blow.She described the impact of the Pence visit on Ireland as “like pulling out all the stops for a much-anticipated visitor to your home and thinking it has been a great success until somebody discovers he shat on the new carpet in the spare room, the one you bought specially for him”.“As Pence read from the autocue and Irish eyes definitely stopped smiling,” she added, “it was clear he was channeling His Master’s Voice. Trump is a fan of Brexit and of Boris.”“Pence,” Lord continued, “is Irish American and wastes no opportunity to go misty-eyed about his love for the ‘Old Country’ as he lards on his Mother Machree schtick on both sides of the Atlantic.”Lord wasn’t alone in her criticism. The Cork Examiner’s political editor, Daniel McConnell, wrote: “The cheek of him coming here, eating our food, clogging up our roads and then having the nerve to humiliate his hosts.”• The headline on this article was amended on 6 September 2019 in line with  style guidance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e49daea734d52c958e028f1ef0824ce5c4508a7/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91464ec611098c354e6cb57458094c65","title":"socialism used to be a dirty word is america now ready to embrace the ideology","story":"Voters’ feelings on socialism have shifted with half of those under 40 saying they would prefer to live in a socialist countryIn his 1998 film, Bulworth, Warren Beatty played a Democratic senator who goes rogue, embarking on a truth-telling binge in which he spouts radical truths no Democrat serious about election would ever utter. At one stage, Bulworth even mentions socialism.“In America that’s like saying cocksucker,” Beatty once told me with a chuckle over dinner at his home in Los Angeles shortly before the film came out in Britain a year later. “We have this so-called thriving economy which has missed most people and while the disparity between rich and poor increases we have just one party – the money party, made up of Republicans and Democrats.”When I suggested to him he sounded like a socialist he swatted the term away.“I’m interested in a government that looks out for people who need to be looked out for,” Beatty said. “Ideology seems to be so unfashionable, so why not take advantage of it and not name oneself with a term that has become particularly problematic?”But quite what people mean by “socialist” is an open question.“The way I translated it to people was: you shouldn’t have to choose between paying for prescription and paying for groceries,” explains Sarah Innamorata, the socialist Pennsylvania state representative I met in Pittsburgh, who defeated a five-term incumbent who had been elected unopposed the last three times. “If you work for 40 hours a week you deserve to be able to support yourself and your family. And when you go outside you should be able to breathe clean air and turn on the faucets and get clean water. And really none of that is going to change unless we change who represents us and we change the way our government works.”To some extent, the views on socialism say as much about how people are feeling about capitalism. This is not a new trend. When President Barack Obama was planning his run for a second term his pollsters noticed that the time-honored rhetorical appeals to a life of relentless progress and upward mobility weren’t really working.“The language around the American dream wasn’t carrying the same resonance,” Joel Benenson, one of Obama’s key pollsters, told the Washington Post. “Some of the symbols of achieving the American dream were becoming burdens: owning that house with the big mortgage was expensive, owning two cars and more debts, having your kid go to college. The cost and burden of taking out those loans was making a lot of Americans ambivalent. They weren’t sure a college education was worth it.”Over the last 40 years wages have stagnated in real terms while the price of college has risen eight times as fast and the price of health insurance has also outpaced earnings.At a local level it is also a response to a sclerotic democracy riddled with entitlement, nepotism and corruption. In south-west Pennsylvania, Innamorata beat Dom Costa. His extended family had dominated local politics for several years. One of his cousins, Paul, was defeated in his race for state representative by another socialist candidate, Summer Lee, an African American woman. The previous year another of Dom’s cousins, Ronald Costa, was beaten by Mikhail Pappas, another socialist candidate, for district judge.In Chicago, where six socialist-backed candidates won seats to the 50-seat city council earlier this year, the same pattern of taking down a corrupt establishment was clear.The city’s 33rd ward had been in alderwoman Deborah Mell’s family for the past 44 years. Her father Dick Mell, the father-in-law of the former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich (currently in jail for corruption and extortion), had held the seat since 1975. When Dick retired in 2013, Mayor Rahm Emmanuel appointed his daughter as his successor. She lost the seat to a socialist candidate, Rosana Rodriguez-Sanchez. Another socialist, Andre Vasquez, beat Patrick O’Connor, who has been on the city council for 36 years and was part of the overwhelmingly white council group that fought hard to block the agenda of the Chicago’s first African American mayor, Harold Washington. All three of the aldermen who preceded Jeanette Taylor, also backed by the Democratic Socialists of America, were indicted for fraud.It is potentially, in these local spaces that the shift to the left and the shift to the grassroots might meet. At the first ward meeting for Rodriguez-Sanchez, more than 60 people crowded into a small room, where their new representative said a few words before encouraging people to approach her or her staff with issues they would like raised. Rodriguez-Sanchez beat Deborah Mell by just 13 votes. Every last piece of organisation helped.The Democratic Socialists played a role, explains local activist Sandy Gutstein, but so did lots of groups, including immigrants’ rights organizations and anti-racist campaigners. “A lot of people were coming into the office who have not been involved in politics before,” she said. “I think people were attracted to the campaign because of that.”Across town, that same night, Jeanette Taylor had to choose a ward superintendent, a paid position to monitor whether local people are getting the services to which they are entitled. Usually they are appointed. Taylor held an election. “I let the community decide,” she said. “Anything that’s going to get built in this community, it will be up for the community to decide whether it gets built or not. Three people applied. We heard a presentation from all three folks. They were asked to leave. We had some discussion and then they voted.”According to Gallup, Americans are more likely to associate socialism with “equality” than “government ownership or control”, as they did in the 40s. “I don’t think it’s about class antagonism,” explains Jesse Sharkey, the leader of the Chicago Teachers’ Union. “It’s about humane capitalism – having social control over the harshest features of capitalism like healthcare and pensions.”The point is it’s a question that is now regularly put in polls and a label that is popularly claimed. It remains problematic for many.But it’s no longer like saying cocksucker.Carlos Ramirez-Rosa has been an alderman in Chicago since 2015. When he ran four years ago he “flirted with the idea of running as an open democratic socialist” but decided against it. “There were a number of people in the community who wanted to see me run but said ‘Carlos, don’t run with this group of socialists’. Because you’re going to go out there and wave this red flag and these folks who are pushing you to do that are going to stay on the sidelines.”Ramirez-Rosa credits the shift to Bernie Sanders, the democratic socialist candidate who mounted a surprisingly effective challenge against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination in 2016 and is running again. “Seeing him so openly talking about being a democratic socialist. Not running away from the label leaning in to it.” Earlier this year he ran as a democratic socialist and won again.“Having been involved in the work I’m not surprised at all that we have six socialists on city council. But when I take a step back and put myself in the place I was in 2015 I think, ‘Wow, that’s tremendous.’”Rick Perlstein, a Chicago-based author who has chronicled the rise of the American right since the civil rights era, believes some of socialism’s appeal comes from Republicans using it as an epithet against Barack Obama in the midst of an economic crisis. “I think a lot of people felt, well if that’s what socialism is then how bad can it be?”I met Perlstein at a packed Martyrs’ nightclub in Chicago where the young dance while older folk clap and stomp as Daniel Kahn and the Painted Bird sing about gentrification, toxic masculinity and economic inequality. Flitting between Yiddish and English Kahn draws on pre-second world war leftwing Jewish traditions, adapting songs written by socialist Bundist leaders of yore.The event, organised by Chicago Yivo, which aims to promote the cultural history of Jewish life in eastern Europe, Germany and Russia in the city. “It’s an alternative to a Zionist identity,” says Kate Underhill who organized the event. “It’s not a total rejection of it but it tries to move beyond the two pillars of Jewish identity – Zionism and the Holocaust – by embracing left Jewish culture pre-world war two.”Shtumer Alef, the yiddish punk support band for Kahn, warmed the crowd up by getting them to sing along in Yiddish to: “Remember to always punch Nazis.”“Trump has politicised everything,” says Lorrie, who sings in the band, as she pops out for a cigarette. “People talk about politics all the time. But the Democratic establishment keeps failing upwards. That’s why they are so scared of someone like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez . She’s a powerful symbol of a different way of doing things.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06ad1c0da5f253951ae49727b6130518804fabc5/0_0_2768_1662/master/2768.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94a9b573b3721e602df0960db5860e32","title":"american philippines baby human trafficking charge","story":"Jennifer Erin Talbot arrested at Manila airport after allegedly hiding newborn in sling bagAn American woman has been charged with human trafficking for allegedly attempting to smuggle an undocumented six-day-old baby out of the Philippines hidden in a bag.Jennifer Erin Talbot was arrested at Manila’s airport on Wednesday and charged with human trafficking, kidnapping and child abuse.Talbot was able to pass through the airport immigration counter without declaring the baby boy but was intercepted at the boarding gate by airline personnel.The 43-year-old was unable to produce any passport, boarding pass or government permits for the baby, airport officials said. It is alleged she planned to board a Delta flight to Ohio.“She’s from a Mormon church and they’re trying to get the baby to be baptised and get church recognition for protection,” said Marlon Toledo, the supervising agent for the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI).According to an unsigned affidavit letter Talbot had with her at the airport, seen by the , the trip to the US was supposed to be temporary and “not exceed 6 weeks”. It names the child as “Andrew” and spells out the alleged purpose of the trip: for the baby “to receive a ‘name and a blessing’ and attain membership within the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.”.The letter said the child was to receive American medical vaccines and a checkup, and would be taken to “meet his great-grandmother before she passes”. Allegedly written by the biological mother of the child, Maricris Dulap, it sets out the return date as 8 October 2019 but was not signed.The baby has been turned over to government welfare personnel, where he will remain until a court order has been reached. Similar cases could last two to three years until a final judgment, Toledo said.Talbot had previously entered the Philippines last year, with entry stamps showing she arrived on 6 August and 2 July 2018, Toledo said. Most recently, she arrived in the Philippines on 6 August and again on 19 August this year. The child was born on 29 August.Describing Talbot as a “frequent traveller”, Toledo said she also held a long-term visa for China and had been to a number of different countries.Officials said no government travel approval had been issued for the baby, prompting them to file human-trafficking charges against Talbot. The charges carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. Talbot also allegedly violated at least two other laws on child abuse, kidnapping and illegal detention, the NBI said.The parents of the baby, who are at an unknown location, have also been charged with neglect of a child.Toledo said the US embassy, who had been informed of the issue, had not yet been in touch with NBI officials. The embassy could not be reached for comment. Another NBI official, who declined to be named as they were not permitted to speak to the press, said the anti-human-trafficking ision had “never encountered any similar case”.Manuel Dimaano of the NBI said Dulap gave her baby to Talbot in Davao City. He said investigators would try to determine how Talbot brought the baby out of Davao, where a city clearance is required for infants to be transported by a foreigner.The baby’s parents have been charged under a child protection law but have not been placed under arrest, although the mother has been interviewed by social welfare officers, according to Dimaano.He said Dulap told the officers she wanted to offer her baby for adoption, and that there was no indication she had sold the baby."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a099a76eb22b44f419b0346fdf6b8eaa32ab28c7/0_172_5150_3090/master/5150.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e16f5a22c6cde2a848db7f592ffc0e9b","title":"clergy hardship church of england wealth","story":"Exclusive: Some vicars are tens of thousands of pounds in debt and reliant on charity handoutsHundreds of clergy are in financial hardship, with some resorting to desperate measures such as a high-interest payday lender or credit cards – despite the Church of England sitting on a multibillion-pound investment fund.Some vicars are tens of thousands of pounds in debt, with many struggling to survive – especially those supporting families – and rely on charity handouts to make ends meet, the  has learned. Clergy Support Trust’s chief executive, Jeremy Moodey, told the  that in at least one recent case, a vicar had been forced to use a high-interest payday lender. He also highlighted how some clergy had been hit by the government’s controversial introduction of a two-child limit on benefits, which restricted the child allowance in universal credit and tax credits.It comes amid dwindling congregation numbers and raises questions over whether the CoE should be doing more to help impoverished vicars given that it has a healthy investment fund worth £8.3bn and is paying asset management executives six-figure sums, including one who earned more than £530,000 last year. The archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby – who has two grace-and-favour homes including Lambeth Palace – is paid £83,400 and last year attacked Amazon for not paying a living wage and railed against poverty.The bishop of Buckingham, the Right Rev Alan Wilson, told the  “there’s always more to be done” to help financially struggling clergy. “Clergy people’s circumstances and the stresses of ministry are becoming more complex and erse all the time,” he said. “Often people are kind and there is help out there, but there are holes in what’s available.”Moodey, a former banker who is training part-time to become a vicar, said he was shocked by the levels of financial hardship among some clergy when he took over as Clergy Support Trust CEO.“Clergy are not going to be serving their communities as well as they might if they’re worrying about paying bills or getting a holiday,” he explained. “They live in a goldfish bowl in the vicarage. They need to get away but often they can’t afford it if they have got families.”He said they often struggled to cover everyday costs such as fixing a broken washing machine or paying for new school uniform. Many clergy have an “innate tendency not to come forward for help”, Moodey added, also expressing concern for those who suffered relationship breakdown.He said: “There’s a sense of: ‘There are many in my congregation who are worse off than me. Why should I regard myself as a special case?’”In the case of the vicar who was forced to use a payday loan firm, Moodey said: “He is now working through a debt repayment plan with a debt advice charity which is a partner of ours with some help from us to get that sorted.”Welby has previously attacked payday lenders, but his criticism backfired when it emerged the C of E held an indirect investment in the now defunct Wonga. Moodey added: “Payday lenders are causing significant suffering amongst the wider population and you would hope that clergy would be able to mirror what is the church’s position which is that, actually, payday lenders are bad news. But if you’re desperate and you really can’t make ends meet, then desperate people do desperate things.”Most vicars receive a stipend of up to £27,886 plus housing but there are nearly 3,000 “self-supporting” ministers who are not paid, according to newly released C of E figures. The C of E’s website lists a series of adverts for so-called “house for duty” roles, which are unpaid. Wilson added: “Mental health issues pose an increasing challenge, and I worry about retired non-stipendiary clergy and some clergy spouses who are in real difficulties. There is always more to be done, not only for iniduals who are struggling, but in order to understand the underlying trends. Above all, it’s important that people experiencing problems alert archdeacons and bishops to what is going on.”A C of E spokeswoman said: “We take the wellbeing of our 20,000 clergy extremely seriously. We note with concern the cases highlighted by Clergy Support Trust and we are grateful for its support for clergy struggling financially, as well as for the work of the Churches’ Mutual Credit Union, launched in 2015 with the backing of the Church of England. Problem debt is a widespread and serious issue in our society and it is worrying that a group of clergy is also affected.”The C of E is “hugely appreciative” of self-supporting ministers “who work voluntarily for the church, many already with successful careers in the secular world”.The archbishop of Canterbury’s stipend is set independently and Lambeth Palace also houses offices for staff and space for other groups, and welcomes visitors, the C of E added.He is a familiar face on TV screens, fronting BBC documentaries exploring religious issues.But while many viewers will recognise the Rev Peter Owen-Jones, most will have no idea that he would not be able to continue in priesthood without charitable handouts.The 61-year-old is a non-stipendiary vicar – serving the villages of Firle, Glynde and Beddingham in East Sussex – meaning he is not paid by the Church of England for his duties.While most vicars receive a stipend of up to £27,886 plus housing, Owen-Jones is reliant on a yearly charitable grant of up to £3,000 and an “honorarium” from the diocese of £430 every quarter to get by. “I would not be able to continue as priest were it not for the support of the Friends of the Clergy,” he said.“I get a grant from them and I’ve had a grant from them for the last three or four years. This is my choice. I love being a parish priest. I’ve taken the moral decision to be a non-stipendiary priest because I think that just sits easier with me. I don’t have an issue with priests not being paid. I have an issue with that system subsidising what appears to be an unchanged and an unchanging centre.”Last month, the former advertising executive revealed that in his early days as a vicar supporting a young family, he had once been so broke he made money posing naked for an art class.In theory, Owen-Jones’s unpaid role – which comes with a house in Firle – is part-time, but the reality is different and he questions the CoE’s approach, describing its reliance on self-supporting ministers as “morally questionable” given that they are often expected to perform full-time duties.Owen-Jones, who orced and has four grown-up children, said: “When I tell people I’m not paid they say: ‘What?’ This has been coming for 30 or 40 years. The more and more non-stipendiary priests, the greater the clamour will become.“I think there is an increasing reliance on non-stipendiary vicars. How much of the church is being kept afloat by self-supporting ministry? Whether those ministers can continue to be treated as full-time ministers, that to me is morally questionable.”In 2002 there were 2,091 self-supporting ministers, but that has now risen to 2,920 following a slight decline in recent years. Self-supporting ministers tend to be older, with an average age of 62.3 compared to 52.1 for stipend posts. Nearly a third (190) of new vicars in training last year were preparing for non-stipendiary roles.Owen-Jones, who was a stipendiary priest earlier in his career, added: “What’s happening is that the church is increasingly relying on what they call ‘self-supporting’ ministers and ‘house-for-duty’ priests.“At the moment I believe it’s been happening under the counter. We need to have a frank and open discussion about whether the church can afford to maintain its working apparatus or whether there needs to be root-and-branch reform, given the number of people that are going to church and given the expectations that are placed upon the church by the state. At the moment it’s not adding up.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18130088e2b5fc3dfd99048700b8a276d56510fa/0_380_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5359ea29086fa8248a71c588e6f58acd","title":"sweden kebnekaise mountain loses highest peak title global heating","story":"Glacier at Kebnekaise’s summit has shrunk amid soaring Arctic temperatures, say scientistsThe mountain peak known to Swedes as their country’s highest can no longer lay claim to the title due to global heating, scientists have confirmed, as the glacier at its summit shrinks amid soaring Arctic temperatures.“This is quite a symbol,” said Gunhild Ninis Rosqvist, a Stockholm University geography professor who has been measuring the glacier annually for several years. “A very obvious, very clear signal to everyone in Sweden that things are changing.”In the far north of Sweden, about 95 miles (150km) inside the Arctic circle, Kebnekaise has two peaks: a southern, glacier-covered summit accessible to suitably equipped hikers, and a northern neighbour that is free of ice but reserved for experienced mountaineers.Since they were first measured in 1880, the southern peak has been the higher. But when Ninis Rosqvist and her team took this year’s measurements, at the end of the summer melt on 3 September, the northern peak was 1.2 metres higher at 2,096.8 metres.“We suspected this was probably the case last year,” Ninis Rosqvist told the  from the Tarfala research station at the foot of the massif. “But unfortunately our measurements were not precise enough. Now we can say with certainty: we are accurate to within a couple of centimetres.”The scientist said the height of Kebnekaise’s southern peak was the lowest on record: 24 metres less than in the 1960s. “Almost all the shrinkage has been in past two decades, when the glacier has lost an average of one metre a year,” she said.Since the glacier was likely to expand again with winter snow and ice, the southern peak could briefly recover its ranking, Ninis Rosqvist said. “It will keep changing for a while,” she said. “But the trend is now firmly established, and very clear.”Sweden recorded its hottest ever months of May and July in 2018, with temperatures soaring to more than 10C above normal. With wildfires burning across the Arctic, the Kebnekaise glacier shrank by almost four metres.Although this July was not as hot after an unusually cool start to the month, the village of Markusvinsa in the far north of the country recorded 34.8C on 26 July – the highest temperature ever recorded north of the Arctic circle in Sweden.Ninis Rosqvist said small glaciers such as that on Kebnekaise’s southern peak were particularly badly affected by warm summers. It was mainly cool summers that allowed glaciers to grow, rather than particularly harsh winters, she said. But the past two Scandinavian summers had caused the snow and ice to melt away very fast. “You can see it at the top, where it’s most exposed to the sun. It really looks different. It gets slippery up there you can see the meltwater running off.”The news may have been expected, but the official downgrading of the southern peak was still “emotionally quite something”, Ninis Rosqvist said. “The mountains are changing so fast – higher temperatures, less snow, winter rain.”The glacier on Kebnekaise’s southern peak was “iconic – a symbol for all the glaciers in Sweden”, she said, adding: “But you know, we don’t need any more symbols. We don’t need to pile up more evidence. We can see the climate changing before our eyes up here, and we need to do something about it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02f7a61f8539231213584436dafea0b73426d55d/0_179_5387_3234/master/5387.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80beda578212a0751d329edd5cc7d773","title":"hurricane dorian hammers the bahamas in pictures","story":"Images show the extent of flooding in cities including Nassau due to the hurricane, which has left at least 30 dead"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/549636030e1a734085875ec6d1d3b4c10fd12399/0_165_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d4b815f6ad3159d8a207f7128c1abf2","title":"hurricane dorian latest bahamas carolinas live updates","story":"’s Oliver Laughland is now on Grand Bahama island and will file a dispatch later today. Here is the report, updated this morning, from Nassau, in conjunction with the ’s Adam Gabbatt, who spent the night in Wilmington, North Carolina, as Dorian howled in.Hurricane Dorian’s flood waters surpassed the floor boards, already five feet off the ground, so Freeport banana-farm owner Alpha Celestin, 61, busted a hole in his ceiling, propped a ladder there and climbed inside with two of his workers, the Miami Herald writes this morning, in a dispatch from Freeport, Grand Bahama.The venerable daily paper reports that the degree of destruction on the northern reaches of the Bahamas is “unimaginable”.The article continues that Celestin knew the other men couldn’t swim, so he tied Styrofoam from his ceiling around their chests to keep them afloat. They stayed perched there for 48 hours.“This is the first time I’ve ever come so close to death, like I was watching death in the eye,” he told the paper. “I never knew of such a hurricane.”“Everyone expected to pull a dead body from that house,” he said. “When I called they were very happy.”Read the full report here.A few meager possessions stuffed in plastic bags,some of the haggard Bahamians who lost homes to the ravages ofHurricane Dorian are waiting at a small airport hoping to catch planesout of the disaster zone as an international humanitarian effort tohelp the Caribbean country gains momentum and the official death toll has risento 30, the Associated Press writes.A few hundred people sat at the partl- flooded Leonard M. Thompsonairport on Abaco island later yesterday, as small planes picked up the mostvulnerable survivors, including the sick and the elderly. The evacuation was slow and there was frustration for some who said they had nowhere to go after the category 5 hurricane splintered whole neighborhoods.“They told us that the babies, the pregnant people and the elderlypeople were supposed to be first preference,” said Lukya Thompson, a23-year-old bartender. But many were still waiting, she said.Despite hardship and uncertainty, those at the airport were mostlycalm. The Bahamian health ministry said helicopters and boats were onthe way to help people in affected areas, though officials warned ofdelays because of severe flooding and limited access.At least 30 people died in the hurricane and the number could be“significantly higher,” Bahamian health minister Duane Sands told TheAssociated Press in a telephone interview late Thursday. The victims are from Abaco and Grand Bahama islands and include some who died from injuries after being flown to New Providence island, he said.The hurricane hit Abaco on Sunday and then hovered over Grand Bahamafor a day and a half.Hurricane Dorian’s coming ashore at Cape Hatteras this morning marks the first landfall since the storm reluctantly departed the Bahamian archipelago, after hitting the northern reaches of the Bahamas over the weekend.So after much trepidation all the way up the east coast of Florida, into Georgia and South Carolina (don’t mention Alabama), Dorian has made its initial and likely only US landfall on North Carolina’s Outer Banks barrier islands.Flooding is happening there now, with reports of inundation on the small island of Ocracoke. Ocracoke is towards the southern end of the wafer-thin barrier islands, offshore from where the Pamlico, Bay and Neuse rivers reach the ocean in North Carolina.Stand by for fuller reports about the Outer Banks and a dispatch from our man in Wilmington shortly, while we take the opportunity meanwhile to update you on the disastrous situation in parts of the Bahamas.Having just made landfall at Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, Dorian is spinning up the Atlantic Coast with winds up to 95mph.Cape Lookout reported one-minute sustained winds of 81 mph, with a gust of 94 mph early Friday morning, according to the National Hurricane Center.Tropical-storm-force wind, meaning it’s over 39mph, is now blowing up to 220 miles from the center of the storm. Hurricane-force winds mean speeds over 74mph and they are shrieking along up to 45 miles from the center.Good Morning, weather watchers. With Hurricane Dorian still upon us, we’ll continue to follow its progress and effects moment to moment today.We have correspondents on location in North Carolina and on Grand Bahama, as well as our team keeping vigil at  US HQ in New York, and we will bring you updates on the Atlantic coast and the Bahamas as they arise.Dorian is still a category 1 hurricane and is currently shrieking up the barrier islands off the north-eastern part of North Carolina."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Dublin City Council agrees to accept statue following offer from Indian ambassadorSport has taken off in a region which has a Celtic affinity to Ireland\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquobrother culture\u0026rsquoAgreement reached between factory owners and protesters following alleged breach of injuctionsAustralian journalist claims to have drunk most expensive beer ever in ManchesterMark Andrew Adams (39), from Malahide, faces charges under anti-laundering lawsTaoiseach says \u0026lsquonot all of the same brands\u0026rsquo will stay in shops - but which ones will go?The-then PM said in 1995 people in UK \u0026lsquodon\u0026rsquot really care what happens elsewhere in the world\u0026rsquoArchbishop says no right to confuse personal opinion with well-formed Christian conscienceUK prime minister says cross-Border arrangement could extend beyond agri-foodProgramme shows clips of Martin McGuinness preparing bomb used in Derry attackA 42-year-old man was shot up to 10 times in his car in Lucan on WednesdayHome office says new EU migrants have three years\u0026rsquo temporary leave to remain\u0026lsquoExpensive and bureaucratic\u0026rsquo: Varadkar spells out effects of worst-case scenarioParents say cuts having adverse affect on students preparing for exams at Dundalk schoolEconomy in Northern Ireland will be \u0026lsquonegatively affected\u0026rsquo in all scenariosNew cases of rabbit haemorrhagic disease confirmed in Clare and LeitrimFriends say Cameron McClements was last seen in bookshop on Wednesday evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4009253.1567748541!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ian paisley supplied money to uvf for bombings in 1969 documentary claims","story":"Clip from BBC series \u0027Spotlight On The Troubles: A Secret History\u0027 in which a young Martin McGuinness is filmed showing young boys a handgun and rifle from his car in Derry. The series reveals important new discoveries about the troubles. Video: BBCA new BBC TV series on the Troubles claims former DUP leader Ian Paisley supplied money to the Ulster Volunteer Force to carry out a number of bombings in 1969.The seven-part series, which starts on Tuesday, also contains rare footage of former deputy first minister Martin McGuinness, of Sinn Féin, allegedly preparing a car bomb for an IRA attack on Derry’s Guildhall in 1972.The series, Spotlight on the Troubles: A Secret History, also reveals a “top secret” memorandum from 1972 in which British army commander Gen Michael Carver proposed as a “lasting solution” to the conflict that the British government gradually escape from the “commitment to the Border”.The allegations against Paisley in the first programme of the series relate to a number of bombings of water and electricity installations that the UVF and a group called the Ulster Protestant Volunteers carried out in early 1969.At the time, the unionist prime minister Terence O’Neill was trying to bring in reforms to meet some of the demands of the civil rights movement.The UVF hoped the bombings against targets such as the Silent Valley reservoir in the Mourne mountains and the water pipeline at Annalong, Co Down, would be blamed on the IRA. The plan was that it would generate further unionist hostility to an already beleaguered O’Neill and force him to resign.At the time, Paisley had been mounting a campaign of protest against O’Neill, who resigned at the end of April 1969 under claims he had lost control in Northern Ireland.The programme cites a police intelligence report of the period that said the UVF was linked to Paisley, a connection the cleric denied.Viaduct explosionFormer British army officer David Hancock, who served as a major in Northern Ireland from 1968 to 1970, told the programme an RUC district inspector in Kilkeel, Co Down, informed him Paisley had supplied money for the bombings.Mr Hancock, who was stationed nearby, actually heard the Annalong viaduct explosion and said he felt at the time it did “not have the footprint of the IRA”.Mr Hancock recalled: “I was good friends with the district inspector down in Kilkeel. He showed me the evidence that they had of the involvement of money from Paisley into what was then called the UVF, where they got the explosives from, how it was carried out, who did it, and why.”The programme also reports that Samuel Stevenson, Paisley’s bodyguard in 1969, told former SDLP and Fine Gael politician Austin Currie the UVF was planning to bomb the hydroelectric power station at Ballyshannon, Co Donegal. In that attack in October 1969, Thomas McDowell was killed when his bomb exploded prematurely.Mr Currie told the programme Mr Stevenson warned him of the planned attack and also told him he was supposed to be part of the UVF bomb team, but that he would try to avoid being involved.McGuinness footageThe programme also features footage of Mr McGuinness in Derry in 1972 that shows him sitting in a car while children crane in the window to look at bullets. It shows him handling a pistol while talking to them. A rifle lies beside McGuinness in the car.There is also film of IRA members assembling a car bomb in Derry, with Mr McGuinness clearly appearing to be part of the unit. The bomb was then used to damage the Guildhall in March 1972, as was evident from the car’s registration.The day after the attack, in which no one was killed, Stormont prime minister Brian Faulkner was brought to London by UK prime minister Edward Heath to be told the unionist government was being stripped of security powers. Mr Faulkner’s government resigned and direct rule was introduced from Britain shortly afterwards.The McGuinness footage came from an American documentary that was never shown in Britain or Ireland. Mr McGuinness admitted he was in the IRA, although he claimed to have left the organisation in 1974.The first programme in the series also covers Bloody Sunday on January 30th, 1972, and reports how an officer from another regiment described the First Parachute Regiment responsible for 14 deaths in Derry as “hooligans in uniform”.This comment was made shortly before Bloody Sunday and after members of the regiment were accused of brutally dealing with an anti-internment march on Magilligan Strand in Co Derry on January 22nd.Top secret briefingThe programme features part of a “top secret” briefing to British government defence secretary Peter Carrington in May 1972 from Gen Michael Carver headed “Army Aims in Northern Ireland”. In it Gen Carver said the IRA had strengthened its military position since the collapse of Stormont, while the British army was losing the military initiative.Gen Carver appeared to be proposing the British government should facilitate the creation of a united Ireland. “If I am right, and we want a lasting solution, it must be in finding a way in which HMG can gradually escape from the commitment to the border,” he wrote, adding that the “answer appears to lie with the plebiscite”.The series is edited by Jeremy Adams and produced by Chris Thornton, one of the authors of the Lost Lives book of those killed during the Troubles. The reporters for the series, which took two years to make, are Darragh MacIntyre, Mandy McAuley and Jennifer O’Leary.The first programme will broadcast on Tuesday, September 10th, at 8.30pm on BBC1 Northern Ireland and BBC4.Future episodes will deal with issues such as how the IRA sustained its campaign, the intelligence war against the IRA and loyalist paramilitaries, the loyalist Glenanne Gang and how the Troubles were brought to an end."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4009850.1567762647!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"is this the final brexit straw lyons tea may disappear with no deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLyons Tea is made in the UK and is owned by Unilever“There will still be plenty of food on shelves but perhaps not all of the same brands,” the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said on Thursday night at a British Irish Chamber of Commerce event .He said that Irish shoppers would have to to make some adjustments in their shopping basket in the event of a hard-Brexit - but what does that mean? What products can we expect to see disappear from our shelves. Will we be able to drink the same tea and eat the same biscuits? It is hard to say for sure exactly what will happen as retailers and manufacturers are keeping their contingency plans a closely guarded secret. However those that have spoke about it have assured shoppers that everything will be fine. That may be the case. And it may not be the case. What we do know is that Irish supermarkets are vulnerable to change. That has rarely been clearer than it was when a few days of snow brought by the Beast from the East two years ago led to immediate and unprecedented disruption.There were yawning gaps on Irish supermarket shelves as a chronic lack of resilience across the supply chain became impossible to ignore.With a no-deal Brexit looking increasingly likely, supply chains could face considerably more disruption than was caused by the snow and that could see many lines of fruit and vegetables, dairy products and products with a longer shelf life that currently come from the UK hit with delays.More than €4 billion worth of British food and drink is consumed in the Republic each year and this country is the UK’s main export market for groceries. In a no-deal scenario, prices will climb and products commonly found on our shelves could disappear entirely, at least for a spell.According to a report published by the Economic and Social Research Institute a no-deal Brexit could cost each Irish household an average of €1,400 a year as prices rise. The ESRI used a database of more than 4,500 products routinely imported from Britain and found that the price of bread and cereals in the Republic could rise by up to 30 per cent in a hard-Brexit scenario, while milk, cheese and egg prices could increase 46 per cent. A range of products - including meat, sugar, confectionery, coffee, tea and mineral water - are also likely to increase by 20-30 per cent.But back to the original question? What products could be in shorter supply or gone completely if Boris gets his way?In the Irish tea wars Lyons remains marginally ahead of Barry’s but while the latter is produced in Cork and will be protected from Brexit-Shock, the former is made in the UK and is owned by Unilever. The beans, soups, sauces and salad creams made under this brand most likely come from the Kitt Green factory in Wigan. It has multiple product lines churning in excess of a billion different products out each year before shipping them around the world. Many of those products end up on trucks bound for Ireland. Just two of the more popular soft drinks available in the Republic that are likely to be either in short supply or more expensive in a post -Brexit world, as both product lines are manufactured in a giant processing plant in England’s Forrest of Dean.While the old-school treat is still named after the Rathfarnham farm where is was born, it too is owned by Unilever. It closed its Irish manufacturing plant almost 15 years ago and all the ice cream sold under this brand is, in fact, made in England. It is the most popular soft-drink maker in Ireland and while it has a bottling plant in the Republic, it also has one in Northern Ireland so will have to figure out ways to ensure supply is unaffected with border-crossing difficulties on the cards.This is by some measure Ireland’s most popular washing-up liquid but as it is made in England, if the worst fears are realised, it could be in shorter supply in the year ahead.It is not just the chocolate digestives that will come under the Brexit cosh but all the biscuits in the range including Hob Nobs, Jaffa Cakes and Penguin bars.They’re likely to be scarce too as Burton’s Biscuits, the company behind the beloved brand, has its main factory in south Wales.The flow of the fastest growing tonic water in Ireland is likely to hit some class of dam as it is an English product and supply will either dry up or prices will jump by around 25 per cent."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4009814.1567751348!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland just another island for most britons major told clinton","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS president Bill Clinton (L) listens to remarks by British prime minister John Major at an US Air Force base in Pittsburgh in 1994. Photograph: Win McNameeReutersMost Britons regard Ireland as “just another island” and “don’t really care what happens elsewhere in the world”, the then UK prime minister John Major once privately told US president Bill Clinton.The comment is contained in newly declassified transcripts of phone calls between the two leaders dating back to the mid-1990s when both men were grappling with the turbulent early stages of the Northern Ireland peace process.In a private telephone conversation on May 27th, 1995, recorded in the Oval Office, Mr Major told Mr Clinton that the IRA ceasefire, then nine months old, made it look like the paramilitary group “may be serious” about peace.“Is any of this giving you a boost at home? Are your people recognising what’s been done?” the president asked.“Not a bit,” replied Mr Major. “For most people here, Ireland is just another island. They don’t really care what happens elsewhere in the world.”“I know how you feel,” said Mr Clinton. “Most Americans could care less about foreign policy, about what is happening outside US.”The telephone conversations, declassified by the US National Archives for the William J Clinton Presidential Library, show the shock and despair felt by Mr Clinton, Mr Major and then taoiseach John Bruton about the IRA’s bombing of the London Docklands on February 9th, 1996, which ended the first ceasefire.‘Pretty gutless’Mr Clinton told Mr Major during a call four hours after the blast, which killed two people, that it was “pretty gutless” of the IRA to blame the bombing on the failure of the British to embrace the peace process.In his calls with Mr Bruton and Mr Major, the then US president expressed surprise at the bombing, given that he had met Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams just days earlier at the White House.“I talked to him and I didn’t see it coming,” the president said. “I feel badly.”Mr Clinton told Mr Major that the bombing was “hard to explain” and that he “had no inkling of it”.Two days after Mr Major lost the 1997 election to Tony Blair and the Labour Party – and two months before the IRA agreed a second, permanent ceasefire – Mr Clinton consoled the outgoing British leader over the heavy electoral defeat, telling him that he “never got the credit” for what he did in Northern Ireland.“The British people should be proud of what you accomplished,” he said. “Your party hurt you more than you hurt it.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4006976.1567701052!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord how mike pence shat on the new carpet in ireland s spare room","story":"US vice-president Mike Pence meets Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in Dublin amid controversy about his decision to stay in President Trump’s Doonbeg golf course during his visit to Ireland.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS vice president Mike Pence, Nancy Pence-Fritsch and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, An Taoiseach at Farmleigh House, where Mr Pence was  the service records of his grandfather, Richard Michael Cawley, who served with distinction in the  Defence Forces during the Civil War.

He even said a special prayer for everyone and then, just before he left, he turned around and kicked them where it hurts.It came as a shock.Like pulling out all the stops for a much-anticipated visitor to your home and thinking it has been a great success until somebody discovers he shat on the new carpet in the spare room, the one you bought specially for him.US vice-president Mike Pence met President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar on Tuesday during an official visit. His Irish hosts, up to their oxters for the last three years in Brexit worry, hoped to impress upon him Ireland’s fears about the consequences of a no-deal Brexit for the country.He could, maybe, stick in a supportive word for us in his talks with Boris Johnson in London,\u0026nbsphis next port of call.Pence, after all, is Irish American and wastes no opportunity to go misty-eyed about his love for the “Old Country” as he lards on his Mother Machree shtick on both sides of the Atlantic. He couldn’t praise Ireland enough on Tuesday – “deeply humbled” and “honoured” to be going to the hometown of his mother’s grandmother and so on.But, after he said all these nice things about the “Emerald Isle” and how much his boss Donald Trump – he sent his best wishes, by the way – appreciates us and all we do to help American security in Shannon, he delivered a very strong endorsement of Boris Johnson and Brexit.No room left for doubt. As Pence read from the autocue and Irish eyes definitely stopped smiling, it was clear he was channelling His Master’s Voice. Trump is a fan of Brexit and of Boris.And this, after such a lovely morning, with Pence and his mother meeting the Taoiseach and his mother.His Irish mother, as Mike calls her. He dotes on Nancy. So he should have known that any Irish mammy will tell you if you can’t say anything good, say nothing at all.Instead, he veered off his rather gushing statement following his meeting with the Taoiseach into some crunching Brexit remarks about our duty to do right by Boris Johnson and the UK.As the air in the steamy ballroom turned decidedly frosty, Pence urged Ireland and the European Union “to negotiate in good faith” with the new British prime minister.The local crowd raised eyebrows and wondered what he thinks the aforementioned EU has been doing for the last three years, if not negotiating in good faith with the UK.Varadkar’s expression didn’t change. He stood on the platform beside the vice-president and hardly flinched, smiling politely.Even when Pence made it worse by not only mentioning “good faith” and “Boris Johnson” in the same context but by also requesting his hosts to have “respect for the UK’s sovereignty”, Varadkar maintained a stoic courtesy.He had to. It’s in the job description for normal prime ministers.Same goes for Michael D Higgins, even though it would be true to say that Michael D and Mike Pence do not sing from the same hymn sheet.But international diplomacy is what it is and in the context of going about their nations’ business, everyone has to be seen to get along.But for all that, Michael D’s sprayed-on smile when the US vice-president came to visit him in Áras an Uachtaráin was a joy to behold.The Áras was bedecked with flowers from the garden for the visit of the anti-gay-rights Pence. All the flowers were in shades of pink. The only other colour was lavender.Pence arrived with a huge entourage. President Higgins escorted him through the Áras and into the ballroom where he invited his guest to sign the visitors’ book. Michael D looked ahead a lot of the time. “Can I invite you to sign. . . ” he motioned towards the book.Pence sat at the table and began to write. The President stood to one side, saying nothing apart from the occasional whisper to his wife, Sabina. The VP kept writing as the silence got louder. Still writing. Michael D looking into the distance.Finally, thank God, Pence stopped writing, which was a relief all round. There was another photo opportunity then the party retired next door for tea. A picture was released of the two groups sitting on either side of a long table – two tables together.The sort of thing when more guests than expected arrive. “Quick, run out next door and ask Assumpta for the collapsible table they got in for Mossie’s wake. Your man from America is only after arriving with half of Indiana. Where’s the big tablecloth?”The talks between the President and the vice-president didn’t take long. Soon, they were waving goodbye from the portico. The dogs didn’t put in an appearance.He didn’t call the vice-president a “w*****r”, which is what he did when he had a row many years on radio with a famous American conservative commentator. Michael Graham was his name. Michael D might easily have become confused, because Mike Pence is an adherent of the “Graham rule”. This is where he doesn’t stay alone in a room with a woman who is not his wife so as not to give rise to bad thoughts and the like.At Farmleigh House, Varadkar’s static courtesy was equally impressive. But then, the Taoiseach has dined before in Pence’s presence.“We are all God’s children,” Leo pointedly told him when they met for breakfast last March in Washington. Just to be clear, they met for breakfast in a roomful of other people. The two men weren’t dining alone, perish the thought.It was a very pleasant event. This was when Leo invited his American host to Ireland and told him to bring along his mother too. It would be a grand trip for her and, in an emergency, if Mike’s wife was otherwise detained, mammy could sit in as chaperone should the VP have found himself unavoidably alone in a dining room with our gay Taoiseach.You can never be too careful. In the end, Pence brought his wife, his mother and his sister to the Old Country, where it seems a lot of the natives have turned alarmingly heathen in the generations since his ancestors left our shores.His morning began with a trip to the Phoenix Park and a courtesy call on the President.To look at Mike Pence, with all smiles and handshakes, you’d hardly think he isn’t very keen on the gays at all.Brave Mike sat down to lunch with the Taoiseach and his partner, Matthew, and managed not to choke on his Dublin Bay prawns. The VP’s wife Karen, who recently took up a part-time teaching position in a school which bans LGBT pupils and staff, kept her fillets of venison down despite the company.The next prime minister the couple will meet on their trip will be the serial philanderer Boris Johnson. He’s pretty experienced on the extramarital and premarital sex front, which they abhor.On Tuesday, to be on the safe side, nobody was left alone with the US vice-president in case it might upset him.“We have both been blessed with Irish mothers,” Pence told the Taoiseach when they met the press. He didn’t say anything about Indian fathers (in Leo’s case) but there you go.“I carry Ireland with me wherever I go,” said Pence, speaking of an old Ireland, one his ancestors left generations ago.Still, his visit was a great example of ersity in action. President Trump, who recently visited, is very hands-on with women and likes to grab them in all sorts of places. And his second in command is the opposite. He won’t stay on his own with a woman who isn’t his wife."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4009360.1567710847!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"we don t want to over react clinton to bruton after london bombing","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe aftermath of the IRA bombing of Canary Wharf.  Photograph: Matthew PolakSygma via GettyThey spoke by phone at 11.13pm Irish time on February 9th, 1996, just four hours after the IRA ended a 17-month ceasefire by detonating a large bomb in the London Docklands.The explosion, which killed two people and injured more than 100, came after months of stalemate in the attempts to start talks towards a peaceful political solution to the then 27-year-old Troubles in Northern Ireland.Conversations during that night’s phone calls between the leaders of the United States and the United Kingdom and then taoiseach John Bruton were filled with shock, frustration and sadness. None of the three leaders had seen it coming.The calls show the deep commitment that Clinton personally showed in trying to secure peace.Transcripts of the calls, released by the US National Archives to the William J Clinton Presidential Library in Arkansas – and The  – reveal a sense of despair among the three leaders as they tried to grapple with fast-moving and unexpected events.The US president’s surprise was compounded by the fact he had met Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams days before at the White House in Washington.“I just wanted to call and tell you how sorry I am about what happened,” Clinton told Bruton in a four-minute call from the Oval Office shortly after he had telephoned the British prime minister.“It is dreadful really,” Bruton replied. “It was completely sudden and unexpected.”The Fine Gael leader thanked Clinton for his public statement in response to the attack, in which he said that “the terrorists who perpetrated today’s attack cannot be allowed to derail the effort to bring peace to the people of Northern Ireland – a peace they overwhelmingly support.”“It touched a lot of people. It appears a lot of Sinn Féin’s leadership was taken by surprise,” Bruton said.‘Gutless’ IRAReferring to the IRA statement after the bombing, which blamed Major and his government for the failure of the peace process, the president said: “Blaming the British under these circumstances is pretty gutless.”At this stage Major had demanded the IRA decommission its weapons before being allowed to enter multi-party talks or there would have to be an election.Clinton was annoyed at himself because he had met Adams just days earlier and not foreseen the bomb attack, though he had noticed the Sinn Féin leader “seemed ill at ease”.The US president said he had “no inkling” of the bombing and that it was “hard to explain”.“I didn’t see it coming,” he said, adding that he felt “badly” having met Adams.It has emerged in recent years that Adams warned senior Democratic congressman Bruce Morrison, who was close to the Clinton White House, just over two months before the Canary Wharf bombing that the UK government’s demand for some prior IRA disarmament was threatening the ceasefire.During their February 9th, 1996 call, Major thanked Clinton for his statement “and the speed with which it was made”. He told the president he intended to “dampen things down”, according to the partially redacted transcript.“I think we are going to see how to keep the show on the road. First, we must make sure that the British and Irish governments lock arms and I think Bruton and I will be able to do that,” Major said.Both leaders criticised a statement Adams had released after the bombing in which he said he regretted that “an unprecedented opportunity for peace had foundered on the refusal of the British government and the unionist leaders to enter into dialogue on substantive negotiation”.Clinton told Major this was “ not a very diplomatic statement”.Proceed with cautionDuring a call to Clinton, Bruton said the bombing would put the idea of “proximity talks” – negotiations between warring factions through a third party – “on the back-burner”.Bruton said decisions had to be taken “from the security perspective and what attitudes to take with Sinn Féin” but that the three governments had to proceed cautiously.“We don’t want to rush into it, but we can’t reverse the course. We have to keep hope alive,” he said.Clinton agreed, adding: “We don’t want to over-react. It is sad and troubling.”The US president offered to help in any way.“I just wanted to call and check in with you and tell you if you have any ideas about what we ought to do just give us a call and let us know what to do and we’ll do it,” he told Bruton, wrapping up their call.In the weeks afterwards the three governments worked towards trying to put together a package that would enable Sinn Féin to enter all-party talks once the ceasefire was restored.The taoiseach told him there needed to be a definite date for all-party talks and that he felt he could convince reluctant members of the SDLP, led by John Hume, to accept some form of election “so long as the transition to talks is absolutely direct and there would be no delay and no further conditions”.“The best and only chance to get the IRA to restore the ceasefire is if a specific date is designated,” Bruton said.‘I am heartsick’Clinton promised to stay in touch with Adams and to see what he could do to persuade Hume on the election proposal – both of which, Bruton said, would be helpful.“Call me at any time. I am heartsick about this but I believe we still have a shot at getting this back on track so if there is anything I can do, I’ll do it,” the president told him.Bruton thanked him for taking the trouble to call. “It’s a critical situation right now,” the taoiseach said.Their next phone call (for which transcripts have been released) started on a more humorous note when, on June 6th, 1996, Clinton joked about being kept on hold by Bruton and having to listen to holding music.“I just want to let you know that you’ve got the best muzak in the world. We don’t have Tchaikovsky over here. I’m in much better humour than I was 30 seconds ago,” he said.“You had to listen to Tchaikovsky? That’s shocking,” replied Bruton.The taoiseach shared the “good news” that “things are coming through for the talks” and he was “very grateful” to Clinton for sending former US senate leader George Mitchell to lead attempts to find a solution.“We have not lost hope that there may be an IRA ceasefire by Monday – it’s still possible,” Bruton said.Clinton said the US would “do everything we can and call some of their best friends over here.“Most American-Irish are 100 per cent with you and Major on the agreement for decommissioning and the role of Mitchell,” he said. “I fully support the position you have taken that Sinn Féin cannot participate in the talks unless the IRA agrees to a ceasefire. If it hadn’t been for the bombing, it would be much easier.”In the end, it would take just over a year to convince the IRA to agree to a second, permanent ceasefire.In July 1997, the UK government, under new prime minister Tony Blair, dropped its demand that the IRA disarm as a condition of Sinn Féin entering the talks. This secured a resumption of the IRA ceasefire.On an earlier call, in May 1995, nine months into the first ceasefire, Clinton asked Major if the peace process was giving him a political “boost” at home.“Not a bit,” replied Major. “For most people here, Ireland is just another island. They don’t really care what happens elsewhere in the world.”"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons september 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraph matt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514. ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Brexit latest news: Opposition leaders to reject Boris Johnson\u0026#39s fresh election bid as PM says no to extensionCost of public transport in Germany could be slashed to €1 a day to fight climate changePrince Harry to follow in his mother\u0026#39s footsteps as palace announce Africa tour detailsRussia\u0026#39s electoral head attacked with electroshocker days before controversial voteUS says Iran \u0026#39inching toward talks\u0026#39 as Tehran abandons further commitments to nuclear deal74-year-old woman gives birth to twins in India after IVF treatmentWhite House announces Jared Kushner\u0026#39s former \u0026#39coffee boy\u0026#39 as new Middle East envoyRobert Mugabe: the darling of Africa\u0026#39s independence struggle who destroyed ZimbabweComment: Robert Mugabe\u0026#39s death raises awkward questions about the Vatican\u0026#39s failure to confront dictatorsComment: Denying Boris Johnson an election, Remainers want to see if he will \u0026#39die in a ditch\u0026#39 for BrexitWhy the timing of an election could be the difference between a huge Tory majority and a hung parliamentBoris Johnson: I yearn to believe in the Loch Ness monsterBoris Johnson: I will refuse to request Brexit extension even if MPs pass lawScientists discover new \u0026#39beaked\u0026#39 whale species off Japanese coastComment: In the face of \u0026#39Nazi\u0026#39 slurs, we Leavers need to start defending the dictionary11 must-see art exhibitions for Autumn 2019Duke of Cambridge \u0026#39fed up\u0026#39 with \u0026#39outrageous\u0026#39 racism in football as he vows to \u0026#39do something about it\u0026#39Pupil protest over gender neutral uniform policy sees police called to school gatesWho will replace Jamie Laing on Strictly Come Dancing 2019?We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/09/05/TELEMMGLPICT000208217466_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6844extr6dIv-d8O8PIpPqbshHooRpJk-anXnRBzWKY.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"japan resumes whaling giants deep returning britain record numbers","story":"Two minke whales off the Yorkshire coastLast Monday morning, as some of the first Japanese whaling ships for 33 years returned to shore with their bloody cargo, skipper Sean Baxter puttered out from Staithes harbour on the North Yorkshire coast in the opposite direction.A few miles out over the still North Sea, a flock of gannets were ing deep into the water in pursuit of the giant shoals of herring spawning below.

paint a disturbing picture on unsecured household debt, writes James MooreClick to followThe IndependentThe last of the three monthly Purchasing Managers Index numbers released by IHS MarkitCips showed that Britain’s dominant services sector just about grew in August. \u0026nbspBut the biggest part of the UK economy, which encompasses everything from your local coffee shop\u0026nbspto the City’s great banks,\u0026nbsplimped in to record a figure 50.6, with anything above 50 representing growth.\u0026nbspThe number was both below expectations and in decline compared with the previous month (51). The same is true of construction, 45 down from 45.3, and manufacturing, 47.4 down from 48. The difference is the latter two sectors are now shrinking, as is business activity overall.

It’s hard to see where the fairy dust might come from.\u0026nbspThese are the sort of figures that should be of deep concern to any sane and sensible government of whatever hue, all the more so to\u0026nbspa Conservative government with its\u0026nbspmuch ballyhooed, and largely undeserved, reputation for economic competence. In more normal times, they’d scare the pants off it.\u0026nbspBut these are not normal times and this is not a normal government. It is run by a party that has completely lost its marbles, having been dragged to the edge of a cliff by gangsters who have just one policy of note. \u0026nbspThe global situation mightn’t be terribly cheery, but the contraction that is getting underway in Britain is an entirely self created one, a squeeze manufactured in Downing Street.\u0026nbspAnd remember, this could just be a taste of what’s\u0026nbspto come, a red balloon or two of warning of what Johnnywise the dancing clown of Downing Street could yet brings down on us as he emerges from his sinister house.\u0026nbspThis brings us to another set of figures published this morning. They concern household debt and come courtesy of the TUC ahead of its annual Congress.\u0026nbspThey give voice to the disturbing level of unsecured borrowing engaged in by the average Briton before one even starts to consider things such as mortgages.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A reading below 50 indicates contraction, while higher than 50 shows growth.Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, said the sector had “clung on by its fingertips this month” as overseas clients “abandoned spending in favour of a wait-and-see approach and the political environment became increasingly murky”.He added: “There’s only so much companies can do to absorb costs before UK consumers notice the impact to their wallets, and only so much Brexit indecision the sector can take before it is tipped into contraction.”Recession fears grow as construction firms and retailers sufferBusiness confidence about the next 12 months in the service sector dropped in August to its lowest point since July 2016, the month after the\u0026nbspreferendum on membership of the European Union\u0026nbsp(EU).Similar surveys earlier this week showed the UK’s manufacturing sector was suffering its worst downturn for seven years and the construction industry had shrunk for the fourth month in a row.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He added: “The PMIs are excessively influenced by business sentiment and have given a misleadingly weak steer during the past 12 months of heightened political uncertainty.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

That’s not a story that we wanted to tell at this point in time.

The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)Although the film may feel relatively slight compared to the other titans of animation on this list, there is something so wonderfully zen about this Pooh, filtering the wise words of AA Milne through the slow, thoughtful tones of Sterling Holloway. Bambi isn’t exactly the most action-packed Disney film around, and it’s hard to imagine many people are getting a kick out of the singalong version to “April Showers”. But is there any bigger shock to the system for a child at the movies than the sudden, ruthless slaughtering of Bambi’s mother?Of the Disney Renaissance offerings, Pocahontas stumbles in its messy handling of history, since turning any interaction between white colonisers and indigenous people into a fluffy romance arguably whitewashes the brutal reality of what happened. But there are plenty of positives to be found, since Pocahontas was such a huge influence in Disney’s later portrayals of strong, independently minded women. The film may be relatively light on story (it’s basically Lady and the Tramp, but there’s an added kidnap element), but who cares, when the film features the hottest party of the entire Disney franchise? It’s true what they say: “Everybody wants to be a cat.” In a way, Robin Hood is the ultimate Disney film of the 1970s. It’s a folksy, low-key entry into the canon that’s all about keeping the peace and spreading good vibes. Just ignore the fact that it recycled several pieces of animation from the likes of Snow White and The Jungle Book.It may not have spawned the same level of craze as Frozen did, but Zootopia doesn’t deserve to become another forgotten Disney film. Although it’s as funny as you’d hope from a film about animals with jobs, it also offers parents an easy entry point to talk to their kids about racism and xenophobia. And that’s something that shouldn’t be taken for granted. Dumbo demonstrates the two gifts of early Disney films. There’s the capacity for moments that are pure and heartwrenching, as seen in “Baby Mine” (a scene that’s almost impossible to watch without welling up). Then there’s the ability to descend into the totally bizarre, as characterised by the downright scary “Pink Elephants on Parade” sequence. Tangled finds fun, humour, and adventure in its reimagining of the Rapunzel tale, but what’s crucial to its success is how it anchors the entire film around a single, showstopping sequence: “I See the Light”, where Rapunzel watches hundreds of paper lanterns float up into the skies. It’s, quite simply, a beautiful piece of filmmaking. 930 22. Princess and the Frog (2009)Disney’s brief return to traditional animation reminded us what had been lost in the switch to 3D animation. There’s a wonderful sense of artistry to how The Princess and the Frog renders New Orleans during the Jazz Age, especially in the Art Deco stylised number “Almost There”. And a Disney princess working hard to make her dreams come true? That’s something to celebrate. Although Cinderella is a central member of the Disney princesses, her film hasn’t aged quite as well as the rest of the early Disney films. There’s an odd amount of time spent on Lucifer the cat, and relatively little time spent at Cinderella’s magical soiree. 1130 20. One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961)Cruella de Vil may have committed attempted puppy murder, but there’s still something irresistibly delightful about her “Patsy from Ab Fab” combination of luxury goods and frightening taste. Only Cruella could answer a simple “How are you?” with the line: Miserable darling, as usual, perfectly wretched.”1230 19. Lady and the Tramp (1955)One of several films on this list containing problematic material, Lady and the Tramp certainly isn’t a faultless film. However, given that the central courtship is between two dogs, the film boasts a surprisingly elegant love story. Not only is there the famous “Bella Notte” scene and its accidental spaghetti kiss, but the crooning Pekingese, voiced by Peggy Lee, is simply sublime.Disney took the straightfoward path to making a hit musical for today: they hired Lin-Manuel Miranda. The Hamilton composer and lyricist is a maestro when it comes to cranking out the hits. Opetaia Foa\u0027i helped create the soundtrack’s South Pacific touches, while Dwayne Johnson even wheeled out some light rapping for his performance as the demigod Maui. Moana tells a culturally specific story with spirit, heart, and humour – more of this in the future please, Disney. The Emperor’s New Groove never quite got the appreciation it deserved when it was first released, largely because, like Lilo \u0026amp Stitch, it’s been tossed aside as another forgettable post-Disney Renaissance entry. Not so fast: though it may not have the epic scale of Mulan or Beauty and the Beast, The Emperor’s New Groove is a funny, endlessly quotable (“Pull the lever, Kronk!”) Disney film that – most importantly – finally let Eartha Kitt voice a Disney villain. It may be every modern parent’s least favourite Disney film, but Frozen is actually pretty great if you’ve not been forced to watch it five times a day, seven days a week. On top of a moving central story about self-acceptance and sisterly love, Idina Menzel’s rendition of “Let it Go” is a showstopper tune that demands to belted at least once at every karaoke night. A flight of fancy that celebrates the power of imagination, JM Barrie’s Peter Pan was always an obvious fit for Disney. The film presents an uplifting and limitless world to younger audiences, while letting the adults pretend miserable things like taxes and orce don’t exist for a precious hour and a bit. Plus, Tinker Bell seems like a vicious gossip and the ideal person to go for a drink with, even if she doesn’t quite speak our language. 1730 14. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)It’s the film that started it all. Although Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has since been overshadowed by its successors to some degree, it still has its fair share of magical moments. There’s the small army of birds and rodents that come to Snow White’s aid during “Whistle While You Work”, and the Evil Queen, gone full Joan Crawford, delivering her oft misquoted line: “Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all.”A round of applause for John Musker, who had the idea of telling the Greek myth of Hercules through a chorus of gospel singers. They are, without a doubt, the true heroes of this film, thanks to the insanely catchy “Zero to Hero”. That said, Megara’s definitely a close runner-up for the title, since her “I’m a damsel. I’m in distress. I can handle this” routine made her the go-to Disney princess for the cool kids. Let them deny it all they want, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find a Nineties kid who hasn’t secretly put “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” on their workout playlist. The whole film, in fact, is a power anthem, while Mulan’s one-woman feminist revolution makes her one of those rare multitasking princesses who can do a lot more than just win over a handsome prince. As the very last film to be produced by Walt Disney himself, The Jungle Book marked the end of an era for the studio. The film captures the kind of easy charm that made Disney’s work such a huge part of so many childhoods in the first place. As Baloo eases into “The Bear Necessities”, it feels very much like someone’s come to gently pat you on the shoulder and tell you everything’s going to be alright. Aladdin may have plenty of tricks up its sleeve, but it deserves its place in the upper echelons of Disney films purely on the strength of Robin Williams’s performance as Genie. The comedy actor recorded over 18 hours of additional improvised material for the film, and the finished product is one of the greatest existing tributes to his manic energy as a performer, alongside his vast gallery of impressions. 2230 9. Alice in Wonderland (1951)Another magnificent adaptation of complex source material, Disney’s take on Alice in Wonderland doesn’t get lost in Lewis Caroll’s maze of wordplay, but cooks up its own delightful nonsense. Alice gets read to filth by a patch of garden flowers, Ed Wynn’s Mad Hatter oozes moneyed eccentricity, and there is a general psychedelic vibe to the whole affair. Alice in Wonderland was initially a flop, but there’s no denying its status as a cult classic now. 2330 8. The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996)The Hunchback of Notre Dame is easily the most adult Disney film ever made. There’s religious hypocrisy, lust, genocide, prejudice, violent misogyny, infanticide, and corruption – take your pick! Although Disney certainly used a little creative license in adapting the 19th-century Victor Hugo novel (there are no singing gargoyles in the original, sadly), it’s surprising how fluently its central themes have been translated without threatening the film’s PG rating. 2430 7. Lilo and Stitch (2002)Although it was technically released in the dip that followed the Disney Renaissance, Lilo \u0026amp Stitch is a highly underrated entry that deserves to sit among the classics. Few Disney films speak to real experiences like it does. Look past the alien intruders and Stitch’s more unusual characteristics, and you’ll find a reminder that family is defined only as those who love and support us, no matter where we find them. It’s a simple but pure message, elevated by a cast of characters who act and speak like those we recognise in our own lives. This is the Disney film that comes closest to a David Lynch fever dream. Putting “When You Wish Upon a Star” – the song that best captures Walt Disney’s dream – aside for a moment, let’s remember just how much of a surrealist nightmare the Pleasure Island sequence really is. “Be virtuous or you’ll be turned into a literal donkey,” was quite the threat for an America only recently freed from the grip of Prohibition. It’s a weird and wonderful entry from Disney’s early years. We’re free to question Ariel’s decision to trade her voice so she can chase after a cute guy she met only once, but she will always remain the most loveable dinglehopper-collecting weirdo around. Ariel’s unquenchable curiosity is what makes this aquatic tale so charming, second only to the fact its villain was inspired by the legendary Divine. Plus, “Under the Sea” is such a party tune. Sleeping Beauty is Disney’s most beautiful film, thanks to the fact artists John Hench and Eyvind Earle drew heavily from Medieval tapestries, Renaissance art, and even Japanese prints. It gives the feeling of actually flipping through a storybook, as Aurora wanders a forest that looks as if it’s made entirely of stained glass. And, truly, has there ever been a Disney villain as deviously elegant as Maleficient? One of Disney’s boldest and most avant garde films, Fantasia is simply masterful in its concept. A musical education for many young viewers, the film pairs classical pieces with short animated stories, each wildly different and inventive in its own right. Although Mickey’s appearance in The Sorcerer’s Apprentice has had a life of its own outside of the original film, anyone who grew up with Fantasia is probably more likely to remember the nightmares Chernabog gave them – the Night on Bald Mountain sequence is unlike anything else in the Disney canon. 2930 2. Beauty and the Beast (1991)If you need a sign of exactly how impressive a piece of filmmaking Beauty and the Beast is, reflect on the fact that a love story between a woman and a buffalo-bear-man is the first animated film ever to have been nominated for an Academy Award. And this is nearly two decades before The Shape of Water brought interspecies romance to the ceremony. This is truly “a tale as old as time”, with a lush Alan Menken score (with lyrics by Howard Ashman) and a smart, relatable heroine in Belle. Produced at the height of Disney’s Renaissance in the 1990s, The Lion King is an epic testament to what animation can achieve as a medium. Can it match the power of its source material, William Shakespeare’s Hamlet? Well, when Rafiki lifts an infant Simba up to the skies, as an entire kingdom of savannah creatures bows in servitude, all soundtracked to “Circle of Life”, you can’t help but feel momentarily convinced. A film of stunning vistas, heart-wrenching tragedy, and memorable musical moments, there’s no doubt that The Lion King deserves its place as one of the greatest animated films of all time. 130 30. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)Although the film may feel relatively slight compared to the other titans of animation on this list, there is something so wonderfully zen about this Pooh, filtering the wise words of AA Milne through the slow, thoughtful tones of Sterling Holloway. Bambi isn’t exactly the most action-packed Disney film around, and it’s hard to imagine many people are getting a kick out of the singalong version to “April Showers”. But is there any bigger shock to the system for a child at the movies than the sudden, ruthless slaughtering of Bambi’s mother?Of the Disney Renaissance offerings, Pocahontas stumbles in its messy handling of history, since turning any interaction between white colonisers and indigenous people into a fluffy romance arguably whitewashes the brutal reality of what happened. But there are plenty of positives to be found, since Pocahontas was such a huge influence in Disney’s later portrayals of strong, independently minded women. The film may be relatively light on story (it’s basically Lady and the Tramp, but there’s an added kidnap element), but who cares, when the film features the hottest party of the entire Disney franchise? It’s true what they say: “Everybody wants to be a cat.” In a way, Robin Hood is the ultimate Disney film of the 1970s. It’s a folksy, low-key entry into the canon that’s all about keeping the peace and spreading good vibes. Just ignore the fact that it recycled several pieces of animation from the likes of Snow White and The Jungle Book.It may not have spawned the same level of craze as Frozen did, but Zootopia doesn’t deserve to become another forgotten Disney film. Although it’s as funny as you’d hope from a film about animals with jobs, it also offers parents an easy entry point to talk to their kids about racism and xenophobia. And that’s something that shouldn’t be taken for granted. Dumbo demonstrates the two gifts of early Disney films. There’s the capacity for moments that are pure and heartwrenching, as seen in “Baby Mine” (a scene that’s almost impossible to watch without welling up). Then there’s the ability to descend into the totally bizarre, as characterised by the downright scary “Pink Elephants on Parade” sequence. Tangled finds fun, humour, and adventure in its reimagining of the Rapunzel tale, but what’s crucial to its success is how it anchors the entire film around a single, showstopping sequence: “I See the Light”, where Rapunzel watches hundreds of paper lanterns float up into the skies. It’s, quite simply, a beautiful piece of filmmaking. 930 22. Princess and the Frog (2009)Disney’s brief return to traditional animation reminded us what had been lost in the switch to 3D animation. There’s a wonderful sense of artistry to how The Princess and the Frog renders New Orleans during the Jazz Age, especially in the Art Deco stylised number “Almost There”. And a Disney princess working hard to make her dreams come true? That’s something to celebrate. Although Cinderella is a central member of the Disney princesses, her film hasn’t aged quite as well as the rest of the early Disney films. There’s an odd amount of time spent on Lucifer the cat, and relatively little time spent at Cinderella’s magical soiree. 1130 20. One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961)Cruella de Vil may have committed attempted puppy murder, but there’s still something irresistibly delightful about her “Patsy from Ab Fab” combination of luxury goods and frightening taste. Only Cruella could answer a simple “How are you?” with the line: Miserable darling, as usual, perfectly wretched.”1230 19. Lady and the Tramp (1955)One of several films on this list containing problematic material, Lady and the Tramp certainly isn’t a faultless film. However, given that the central courtship is between two dogs, the film boasts a surprisingly elegant love story. Not only is there the famous “Bella Notte” scene and its accidental spaghetti kiss, but the crooning Pekingese, voiced by Peggy Lee, is simply sublime.Disney took the straightfoward path to making a hit musical for today: they hired Lin-Manuel Miranda. The Hamilton composer and lyricist is a maestro when it comes to cranking out the hits. Opetaia Foa\u0027i helped create the soundtrack’s South Pacific touches, while Dwayne Johnson even wheeled out some light rapping for his performance as the demigod Maui. Moana tells a culturally specific story with spirit, heart, and humour – more of this in the future please, Disney. The Emperor’s New Groove never quite got the appreciation it deserved when it was first released, largely because, like Lilo \u0026amp Stitch, it’s been tossed aside as another forgettable post-Disney Renaissance entry. Not so fast: though it may not have the epic scale of Mulan or Beauty and the Beast, The Emperor’s New Groove is a funny, endlessly quotable (“Pull the lever, Kronk!”) Disney film that – most importantly – finally let Eartha Kitt voice a Disney villain. It may be every modern parent’s least favourite Disney film, but Frozen is actually pretty great if you’ve not been forced to watch it five times a day, seven days a week.

This means data doesn\u0027t need to pass through servers controlled by internet and technology firms, essentially handing back people control of their data.\u0026nbspHTC Exodus 1 hopes to bring blockchain technology, bitcoin and cryptocurrency to the masses (The Independent)When it was first launched,\u0026nbspHTC described it as the first smartphone built for this new internet, representing a paradigm shift away from the big data business models of large tech companies.All out private data - from credit history to search data - is handled by third parties, Phil Chen, who led the development of the HTC Exodus 1, told\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspat the time.\u0026nbspFacebook offers $10,000 to anyone who can crack its cryptocurrencyWe don\u0027t own or control any of it. Instead, it is just seven companies in the world that control almost all of the data. They have become more powerful than governments.One of the things that this new wave of phones could transform is payments, with each phone coming with an in-built cryptocurrency wallet.This allows owners of these phones to store and spend cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, as well as forthcoming digital currencies set to be launched by apps like Telegram.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Scientists\u0026nbspthen monitored\u0026nbspthe test subjects’\u0026nbspepigenetic clocks, to understand the effect\u0026nbspon how they aged.Nobel Prize given to scientists who explained the biological clockThe epigenetic clock is measured by the body’s\u0026nbspepigenome\u0026nbsp– a record of chemical changes to an organism’s DNA. As people age, chemical modifications or tags are added to people’s DNA, and those change throughout their lives,\u0026nbspso by looking at those tags\u0026nbspa person’s biological age can be measured.Researchers had actually intended to look at how the growth hormone would change the tissue in the thymus gland, which helps with the body’s immune functions and sits in the chest. It normally shrinks after puberty but they hoped to see whether it could be pushed to regrow, by giving participants the growth hormone.It was only as a secondary consideration that researchers then checked how the drugs changed their epigenetic clocks. The study had finished when the analysis began.Professor Horvath then looked at four different measures of the epigenetic clock to understand the differing ages of each of the patients. And he found that every one of them had reversed significantly – so significantly that he is optimistic about the results, despite the limited number of participants.Scientists now hope to test the same effects with more people, through a controlled study, and with different age groups, ethnicities and with women.The changes could still be seen in the blood of six participants who provided samples\u0026nbsplong after the study finished.Some of the drugs used in the cocktail are already being researched as ways of fighting age-related diseases. But the discovery of the combined effect of the three of them could have major implications for the ways that a variety of different drugs are tested, scientists say.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A reading below 50 indicates contraction, while higher than 50 shows growth.Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, said the sector had “clung on by its fingertips this month” as overseas clients “abandoned spending in favour of a wait-and-see approach and the political environment became increasingly murky”.He added: “There’s only so much companies can do to absorb costs before UK consumers notice the impact to their wallets, and only so much Brexit indecision the sector can take before it is tipped into contraction.”Recession fears grow as construction firms and retailers sufferBusiness confidence about the next 12 months in the service sector dropped in August to its lowest point since July 2016, the month after the\u0026nbspreferendum on membership of the European Union\u0026nbsp(EU).Similar surveys earlier this week showed the UK’s manufacturing sector was suffering its worst downturn for seven years and the construction industry had shrunk for the fourth month in a row.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He added: “The PMIs are excessively influenced by business sentiment and have given a misleadingly weak steer during the past 12 months of heightened political uncertainty.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Over 5,000 people are estimated to receive bites from rattlesnakes every year in America, with about five people dying as a result. However, the majority of bites are attributed to diamondback rattlesnakes rather than timber rattlesnakes, which exhibit less aggressive behaviour.Rattlesnakes are ovoviviparous, meaning they carry eggs inside their body until they hatch, giving birth to live offspring.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Heres what the bookies think...British bookies have slashed the odds on there being a General Election in .According to the Oddschecker website, some firms are offering odds of  o on there being a general election in .“Boris Johnson’s coup has sent shockwaves across the country since its announcement, and those shockwaves have translated into political betting money, said Oddscheckers Callum Wilson.“A betting flurry has taken place today on a General Election taking place before the end of the year, and it seems almost inevitable that we’ll see one, according to the heavily odds-on prices.”William Hill are offering odds of   on the UK going to the polls in .That suggests Britain has a  per cent chance of a General Election before the end of the year with money starting to trickle in for a Lib Dem victory.Boris Johnson certainly wants one now that  rebel Tory MPs joined with the opposition in backing a law that would block a No Deal Brexit.The PM now believes he needs a fresh mandate from voters to prise a new deal from EU leadersHe has said any move to block a No Deal Brexit would weaken his hand in attempting to negotiate an agreement with Brussels.If MPs backed a bill that would force him to seek an extension to our leaving datethere was no deal, then he would seek a general election.After they did just that, the Prime Minister followed suit with a motion seeking the two-thirds majority needed to go to the polls on October .But the vote was lost after Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn ordered his MPs to abstain in the knowledge this would prevent Boris getting the two thirds majority he needed.A motion for the snap poll would be tabled by the Government which would require the support of two-thirds of MPs under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act .Boris could try and call a snap election at any time.He would have to pass a vote of MPs in the Commons first, however, thanks to the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act.Elections in this country take place on a Thursday.By law, Parliament is dissolved  working days before a General election."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit block useful work westminster","story":"Sometimes these show the skull and crossbones, to frighten any would-be intruders. The message is clear: Useful work is no longer done here.If Remainer MPs block Boris Johnson’s Brexit plan this week, we should place similar signs around the Palace of Westminster.Parliamentarians will have turned the place into a toxic waste ground which no longer fulfils a decent .It will have become an eyesore, a municipal liability, an assembly which no longer represents its voters and has become a poisonous threat to them. It will stand as sad testament to the misjudgement of its management in latter days.If Speaker John Bercow, former Chancellor Philip Hammond and other dead-set Remainers such as Sir Keir Starmer refuse to enact the  referendum result, the British Parliament — supposedly the fount of modern parliamentary democracy — will have lost its centuries-old claim to give voice to the people. The consequences of that would be enormous.The word “Parliament”, first used in these islands in the early s, comes from the French “parler” .The th Century Parliament was where leading men of England could let the king know how they felt about his laws and taxes. Kings did not always take much notice but the principle was established: That the people of England would be heard by their ruler.Over the ages, the people slowly became the boss. Until now.Sometimes you will hear the Commons derided as a talking-shop but that, correctly, is what it is. Talking can prevent violence.There is a reason modern heads of government are not, by and large, stabbed in their beds like poor King Duncan in Shakespeare’s Macbeth.That reason has been the parliamentary process and the comforting knowledge that when push came to shove, parliamentarians would be on our side.Our side, please note. Not on the side of rival countries.There developed a quiet understanding that on issues of conscience , MPs need not slavishly follow their constituents. They were not quite delegates.But as representatives, they would be expected to follow broadly the sympathies of their electors and the policies of their parties. Otherwise they could just lie at election time then do the opposite once they had won their seats in the Commons.In his address outside  Downing Street last night, Boris left people in no doubt of his intentions to see us out of the EU after October .But when MPsto the Commons this afternoon, you will hear Remainers complain that “Parliament has been bypassed” in the Brexit process. This is tommyrot.As can happen in modern politics, it is the very opposite of the truth. I’m afraid they’re lying. They are ignoring you — the electorate — and they think you are too busyto notice.The EU referendum in  was set up by the Commons.The Commons approved the Article  process under which we told Brussels we were off. All well and good.David Cameron would not have won the  election had he not promised a referendum.Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn would not have attracted millions of votes in the  election had they not promised to respect the Leave result.But now that our departure is imminent, Remainer extremists such as Hammond, Bercow, Gauke, Grieve, Soubryplan to try to stop it.They have already bent the rules doing so and will possibly do so again today.Please, guys: Spare us any bleating about “constitutional outrages” by Boris. Your behaviour has been far worse.These swivel-eyed Europhiles have decided that the Leave vote of  — the biggest exercise in British electoral history — must be neutralised.The plebs got it wrong. Computer does not recognise. Reboot time. All past data has been lost.Just look at that warped figure Tony Blair, who treated Parliament with open contempt when he was PM.Yesterday he was throwing up his soft hands in horror at the idea of a new General Election to break the Westminster deadlock. He opposes an election because he knows it could result in a big win for an on-fire Boris. All this from the same Tony Blair whose regime helped kill hundreds of thousands of Iraqis in the name of, er, democracy.Instead, Blair wants a second referendum, whose wording would be decidedby the current, pro-EU, electorate-defying Parliament.We used to laugh at communist assemblies in countries such as North Korea, which were stuffed full of identikit dummies.We mocked minnows such as Ireland, which were forced by Brussels to re-run referendums that produced “wrong” results.We thought our democracy was more authentic because Parliament was connected to its constituents and because our politicians accepted the electorate’s verdict.We won’t be able to make such boastsWestminster’s Remainers have their way.What is the point of a parliamentit ignores the electorate  None. Many of these Remainer MPs seem readier to take their cue from Twitter users than from their own voters. It’s weird and it is not democracy.If our Parliament ceases to have a point, so do its buildingsand so do its members’ privileges .The very nation state becomes questionable, for what is the point of a state without a democratic Parliament Before long you find yourself asking what is the point of Western Europe, Nato and the whole web of Western values that separate us from Putin’s Russia and other hostile powers.Such is the importance of the decisions facing our MPs this week. Let’s hope they ponder hard before vetoing Brexit, the greatest-ever popular demand for change. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Suddenly, the all-encompassing full-time job into which you poured all your time and effort becomes harder to juggle with what’s going on at home.Ruth Davidson is the case in point, after tendering her resignation as leader of the Scottish Conservatives because, among other reasons, the thought of getting on the road to fight two elections in  months would have once fired her up but now fills her with dread.Ruth, who will remain as an MSP, adds: “Additionally, I fear that having tried to be a good leader over the years, I have proved a poor daughter, sister, partner and friend.

It is a pathetic showing for a main opposition party at a time when it should be sailing ahead.Corbyn — branded a chicken by Boris Johnson for blocking a snap election — is doing so much worse than he did in his unexpectedly strong  ­election campaign.That’s because voters have seen so much more of this unreconstructed Marxist than they had then. And the more they see, the less they like it.Gradually it is dawning on the country that the economic policies advanced by Corbyn and his even more left-wing shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, would not so much redistribute national wealth as obliterate it.Earlier this week McDonnell came up with his latest wheeze for robbing the rich and — as he sees it — giving to the poor.He promised to give private tenants a “right to buy” their homes at a discount. I can see why this policy might initially seem attractive to young people who have been priced out of the housing market — a group with whom I have a lot of sympathy.Notionally, the policy may seem little dferent from Mrs Thatcher’s right to buy which enabled a generation of council house tenants to become homeowners for the first time.But there is every dference. If private investors were forced to sell their properties at a discount it would crash the housing market. Who would want to buy a property, knowing that the Government could come along at any moment and confiscate it If you crash the housing market, you crash the ­mortgage market, too. Private tenants might in theory gain the right to buy their homes, but that will not be much usebanks refuse to lend them any money.Confiscation is a thread which runs through so much of Labour’s programme.McDonnell has already announced a plan to snatch ten per cent of the shares of all private companies with more than  employees.He wants to put these shares into what he calls an inclusive ownership fund, invested on behalf of the workers.The workers shouldn’t get too excited, though. They would be allowed a maximum of £ a year in idends — and that onlytheir ­company was able to pay a idend.Meanwhile, the value of ordinary people’s pensions would plummet by far more than £. According to an analysis by law firm Clford Chance, workers would gain £billion — but overall, investors would lose £billion as share values crashed.Labour’s plan would dilute a company’s shares, effectively confiscating wealth from existing shareholders.Corbyn and McDonnell ­promote a fantasy that shareholders are a bunch of capitalist fatcats.Yet the reality is that almost everyone who works in the private sector is indirectly a shareholder. Share investments form the bedrock of the pension funds on which we will rely in old age.EvenMcDonnell was only helping himself to ten per cent of company shares initially, he could be sure to come back for more when his tax revenues failed to match his vast spending plans.These include spending £billion nationalising utility companies — that is £billion for gas and electricity firms, £billion for water firms, £billion to buy out Private Finance Initiativecontracts for schools and hospitals and £.billion for the Royal Mail.Labour claims this will save householders an average of £ a year on the basis that these firms will no longer have to pay shareholders.But he overlooks the poor record of nationalised industry. Lower efficiency could well lead to higher prices.How is McDonnell going to bring in the revenue for his massive spending plans He seems to live under the delusion thatyou raise taxes by x per cent, revenue, too, will rise by x per cent.Thus he claimed, in Labour’s  manesto, that reversing corporation tax cuts would raise £billion. But tax doesn’t work like that. In fact, cuts to corporation tax made by George Osborne increased revenue as multinationals erted profits to, rather than away from, Britain.So it is perverse for Labour to claim jacking up rates again will raise extra money. On the contrary, McDonnell would likely end up with LESS revenue.As for iniduals, McDonnell has promised to increase income tax for the top ten per cent of earners, which means anyone on more than £, a year. The top rate of income tax would go up to  per cent.But the real damage could come from a wealth tax — an annual levy on the value of homes, shares, bonds and all other assets.Although not yet Labour party policy, McDonnell has previously expressed approval for a whopping  per cent levy on the wealthiest ten per cent of the population.It wouldn’t be the super-wealthy who paid — they would quickly be off.In the s, a high-tax Labour ­government caused a brain drain which led to net outwards migration of , people over a few years.It would be worse now, as wealthy iniduals and businesses are much more mobile compared with the s.The real victims of a wealth tax would be ordinary people who have spent years saving to buy a home and build themselves a half-decent pension. To qualy for McDonnell’s wealth tax you would only need to own a home, and to have a pension with a combined value of £,.With Labour on just  per cent in the polls, of course, the nightmare of a Corbyn government — or at least a Corbyn majority government — is at the moment unlikely.But no one should be ­complacent.We could all too easily end up with a Labour-SNP coalition with the ­Scottish Nationalists happy to inflict pain on English, Welsh and Northern Irish voters infor the promise of a second independence referendum.Over the past couple of years we have had endless attempts to blame Brexit for every economic woe. Actually, over that period, employment has risen to an all-time high and the economy, except for the last quarter, has grown.But international investors, have been shy of Britain.The uncertainty over Brexit doesn’t help but talk to wealth managers and they tell you a very dferent story.What really strikes terror into investors is the prospect of Jeremy Corbyn arriving at the door to No.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You made a conscious decision to remain firends.Then as she tossed the cue card with his statement behind her, she added: So I dont care what he says.Meanwhile, lawyers for one of Jeffrey Epstein’s victims blasted Prince Andrew’s claims a photo with the royal’s arm around her is a fake.In a letter to the Duke of York they said his denials were “hurtful” to Virginia Roberts and ask to interview him about his friendship with wealthy paedophile Epstein.Ms Roberts has alleged she was lent out Epstein to Andrew for sex - claims he vehemently denies.Prince Andrew was once pictured with his arm around her when she was  at a party thrown by billionaire Epstein and his alleged Brit madam Ghislaine Maxwell.Maxwell has also strenuously denied any wrongdoing.It has been reported the Prince and his lawyers have cast doubt on the authenticity of the pictures with sources saying the his fingers are “chubby” and do not resemble the hand seen in the infamous picture.Epstein, , was found hanged in his Manhattan jail cell on August  as he awaited a sex trafficking trial involving girls as young as .Lawyers for Ms Roberts, who also uses her married name Virginia Roberts Giuffre, have now written to the Duke of York and even offered to fly to London to speak to him.Despite Epsteins death,  of Epsteins alleged victims were given the chance to tell their harrowing stories.Outside New Yorks Southern District court in Manhattan, Ms Roberts said of Andrew: “He knows what he has done and he can attest to that.“He knows exactly what hes done - and I hope he comes clean about it.Epstein was jailed for  months in Florida in  on charges of soliciting a minor for prostitution.But despite the conviction, Prince Andrew continued to see Epstein - and was pictured staying with him at his £million Manhattan mansion in .At the end of last month the Duke broke his silence is silence to express tremendous sympathy for Epsteins victims in a y statement issued by the Palace.He also said it was a mistake seeing Epstein after his release from prison.A previous Buckingham Palace statement has said: The Duke of York has been appalled by the recent reports of Jeffrey Epsteins alleged crimes.His Royal Highness deplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent.A spokesperson said: “It is emphatically denied that The Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts. Any claim to the contrary is  and without foundation.”A spokeswoman for Buckingham Palace declined to comment on Welchs claims."},{"url":null,"title":"measles children vulnerable infections","story":"Scientists said it explains why vaccinating against the disease, which is seeing a resurgence in the UK, helps slash childhood deaths by up to half.Around one in  kids infected with measles is killed directly by the bug.But now a study shows the impact continues for years afterwards, raising their risk of chest infections and viral illnesses.The findings were revealed at the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Vaccine Conference.Lead researcher Dr Michael Mina, from Hard University, said: “The epidemiological data from the UK, USA and Denmark shows measles causes children to be at a heightened risk of infectious disease mortality from other non-measles infections for approximately - years.”Experts claim having measles “knocks out” the immune systems memory of previous illnesses, leaving youngsters more vulnerable.Dr Mina added: “Because we now think that measles infections may erase pre-existing immune memory, by preventing measles infection through vaccination, we prevent future infection with other diseases allowed back into the body by the damage done by measles.“This suggests that measles may have been associated with as much as half of all childhood deaths due to infectious diseases prior to vaccination.”A previous UK study found kids were up to  per cent more likely to need antibiotics in the five years after suffering measles.And they were at greater risk of chest infections, viral illnesses and tonsillitis.The findings come after the UK lost its World Health Organisation “measles-free” status, as parents shunned jabs for children following scare stories on the internet.Cases more than doubled in two years and the infection rate is rising.MEASLES is a highly infectious viral illness that can sometimes lead to very serious complications.It can cause things like pneumonia and encephalitis - both of which can kill or leave people seriously disabled for the rest of their lives.Now, experts are calling for measles vaccinations to be made mandatory in certain countries.Its given in two doses as part of the NHS childhood vaccination programme.The first jab is given to kids at around  months old, while a second dose is administered at around three years, four months.There is no link at all between having the MMR vaccine and autism - even in children who have other risk factors for the condition, scientists confirmed back in March.Thats the conclusion of a nationwide study of all children born in Denmark to Danish-born mums between  and .Last week, we revealed that anti-vaxxer parents were holding measles parties to give their kids the deadly virus.There were  in the first half of this year — yet  in all of , says Public Health England.All kids should get two doses of the measles, mumps and rubellavaccine before primary school to be fully protected – usually at  months and three years and four months.But the number of children starting classes fully vaccinated in England is at its lowest level in more than five years, with . per cent covered.It is well below the official  per cent target.Dr Jamie Lopez Bernal, from Public Health England, said: “These findings only add to the evidence of the phenomenal impact of vaccination programmes.No other medical intervention has been as important in the last  years.“UK measles vaccination has prevented  million cases and , deaths – and that’s not taking into account the potential other benefits.This is about not only protecting ourselves but protecting each other.Vaccines stop the spread of disease and save lives.”"},{"url":null,"title":"hurricane dorian sean connery lucky survive bahamas mansion","story":"The mph mega-storm battered the Caribbean island nation for two days, causing widespread devastation.The deadly vortex left “apocalyptic” scenes in its wake, reducing homes to rubble with thousands feared dead.The Bond star, , was at his home on the island of New Providence, where he has lived with his we Micheline since the s, when Dorian struck.But his mansion survived the worst of the storm – with its epicentre just missing the island and instead striking Great Abaco and Grand Bahama, just  miles away.Sir Sean told the Scottish Daily Mail: “We are both fine.

They’re not all “champions”, or possibly even the best each respective part of the Cowell empire has to offer.That goose was cooked the moment SuBo, Diversity, Dennis Egeland almost everyone  with a signicant career or talent declined to appear.There was a certain curiosity value to BGT: The Champions, though, I’ll admit, as it featured several performers doing the one thing everyone in their country should arguably be forbidden from even attempting.Indian salsa, Ukrainian sand-painting, Australian stand-up comedy, Indonesian magic, British dog dancing.This last one was  winner Ashleigh Butlerwho began by revealing that, moments before Pudsey died: “He lted his head and had a little look at me.That was him saying ‘Goodbye’.” Or  him saying: “You’ll be going through the same motions, with some hyperactive little impostor, in two years’ time, mark my words.”I got the impression everyone  at the show thought it might just be “a bit too soon”, as well, which may not entirely explain The Champions’ in-built British bias.But the line-up was certainly front-loaded with other familiar faces, Paul Potts, Boogie Storm and Connie Talbot, who’s doubled in size since we last saw her, with Piers Morgan, in . So’s Piers Morgan, for that matter.The great unknown factors were the foreign acts, though, who proved to be a pretty forgettable bunch apart from America’s “comic daredevil” Bello Nock, whose wheel of death t***tery, with daughter Annaliese, was almost as terrying as his appearance,which was described perfectly, by David Walliams, as “Jedward’s dad”.It was certainly enough to hypnotise the Wembley arena audience into voting him the winner.If all this exotica and the set were designed to make us think we were watching something on the scale of Eurovision, though, it failed. The Champions is nothing like as good.Nor is it even as original as Going For Gold, with Henry Kelly, for the simple reason BGT has been welcoming foreign acts for years.All this adds up to is Britain’s Got Talent minus the best bit, the auditions. We also don’t get a chance to vote, either.That came down to a golden buzzer Amanda Holden went for the Ukrainian sandpainter and the arena vote for Bello Nock.Quite something, isn’t it, when we can’t even win such a heavily loaded show and, I have to tell you, Paul Potts took it pretty badly. Simon Cowell, though, had some words of comfort for Ashleigh.“Pusdey’s in dog heaven, looking down on you now, thinking . . . ” “I was the talent. I was the bloody talent.”DIVA Forever’s Gemma Collins landed in Los Angeles last Wednesday night on ITVBe with all the charm and subtlety of a jolt from the San Andreas Fault.Take comfort, though, from the fact our gain is very much Calornia’s loss.Because within five minutes of arriving she’d already decided, “I ain’t going back to England”, and was using her new catchphrase to describe everything.Hamburgers  “Next level.” Hollywood Hills mansions  “Next level.” The Beverly Wilshire hotel  It’s next friggin’ level.

And Piers as well. IF this fth series of Peaky Blinders achieves nothing , then Irish actor Brian “Jimmy McCavern” Gleeson’s attempt at a Scottish accent has certainly highlighted the problems of frictionless borders.Back and forth it pings between Dublin and Belfast.With the odd stop-off in downtown Hyderabad, before settling at something closer to Hercule Poirot Belgian rather than the leader of a depression-era Glaswegian razor gang thug he’s meant to be.It has a knock-on effect as well. Notice one thing that’s wrong with the show, you’ll probably notice everything  as well.Like the fact it’s all over the place historically, Paul “Arthur” Anderson is over-acting so badly the estate of Yosemite Sam should sue and Helen McCrory doesn’t look foxy dressed up as Janet Jackson. She just looks ridiculous.Underneath all that baggage and the obtrusive soundtrack, there is, I think, a serviceable enough plot involving Oswald Mosley, the IRA, the UVF, even though they weren’t formed until , and all sorts of carnage involving gypsies and Glasgow’s infamous Billy Boys gang, which our friend Brian Gleeson attempted to put into sharp focus at the end of Sunday night’s episode.“Zo, Tummy ­Shell-beee, it’s wuuuurgh yur wunt, it’s wurgh you zjall ’ave.” No, me neither.THIS week’s winner is BBC Breakfast presenter Dan Walker and Beaker from The Muppets.Compiled by Graham WrayJONATHAN Ross, in , to producer Andy Davies, on the subject of his -year-old neighbour: “I think you should, just for charity, give her one.”Jonathan Ross, in August , to Judge Rinder, on the subject of Brazilian President Bolsonaro’s disparaging remarks about Emmanuel Macron’s we: “I’m team Macron.It’s the most pathetic and most misogynistic thing they could say.

The Lib Dem MP, who was relected as the Labour MP for the South London seat of Streatham, said he will try and take the City and Westminster seat from Mr Field. The former Foreign Office Minister apologised in June when a video emerged of him grabbing a protestor by the throat. Mr Field has a majority of just , at the  election in the constituency where  per cent of residents voted Remain in . Mr Umunna told the Evening Standard : “I worked as a solicitor in the City and West End and I know they are the last places that should be represented by one of Mr Johnson’s MPs who has just voted to enable a no-deal Brexit .    “The City is the centre of international values, while the West End is home to our greatest creative industries. These centres are telling us that Brexit will be bad for them.” Mr Umunna quit the Labour party in February and joined the ill fated Change UK before defecting again to the Lib Dems in June. “I resigned from the Labour Party primarily because of the party’s failure to oppose Brexit, the racism towards Jewish people in the party, and Jeremy Corbyn’s poor leadership. Whilst it is important to win seats from Labour, it is also vital we win seats from Boris Johnson’s populist nationalist Tory party - which is doing so much damage to our country - in order to stop Brexit and build a more liberal, inclusive and equal Britain.  The overwhelming majority of residents in the Cities of London  Westminster who we speak to believe this strongly Remain constituency should not be represented in Parliament by the party of Leave – we will work hard to change that. Mr Umunna added: “I will be sad to end my time as the Member of Parliament for Streatham but in Helen Thompson, Streatham Liberal Democrats already had an excellent and incredibly hard-working parliamentary candidate when I joined the party. Helen lives in the community and works at an NGO that provides lesaving aid to people in places such as Yemen and Syria.She led a European Election campaign in the constituency this year which the Liberal Democrats won comfortably. Thanks to her leadership Streatham is now a key target seat for the Liberal Democrats at the next election. I have no doubt Helen can win Streatham for the Liberal Democrats and,elected, she will be an excellent local MP.” When Mr Field apologised for his attack on the protester he said he had grabbed her so violently because he believed she could be armed.

Hundreds of grief-stricken mourners brought streets to a standstill yesterday as they paid a final farewell to Shane Thomas. Among the other floral tributes honouring the -year-old were bottles of Jack Daniels and Grey Goose vodka, boxing rings and a giant boxer.Shane died when the van he was travelling in hit a parked car in Pontypool on August , reports Wales Online.Ahead of his funeral, family and friends lined the streets as his ornate white and blue coffin coffin was carried by a horse-drawn carriage to the church.    The whole procession was expected to last around five hours and conclude at around pm. The two white horses had a plume of sky blue feathers between their ears and blue cloth draped from their flanks.    Mourners, some dressed in dark jeans and bright white T-shirts emblazoned with the words: Rest In Peace Shane, simply the best, gathered round to welcome the cortege. An image of Shane, in a victorious boxing pose, was also printed on their backs. Six silver cars, each one carrying two flags depicting Shaneaposs face, pulled up behind the carriage and family members got out.    All wore crisp white shirts and an item of sky blue, scarves for the women, ties for the men. There was total silence as a red carpet was rolled out from the church doorway as the coffin was carried inside flanked by five men each side. Six pick up trucks waited on the pavement with colourful tributes on the back.  Flowers in all shapes and sizes depicted some of the things Shane was best known for, including a le sized boxer, bedecked in red shorts, his arms held aloft in victory. Family and friends wrote moving tributes to accompany the flowers, which were formed into tributes including a McDonaldaposs meal, complete with fries, a bottle of Jack Daniels and coke, boxing belts, a weights bench and a barbell, a pool table and even bright orange chainsaws. Shane worked in tree services and a company van completed the line of pick ups.  The brief service at Pontymoile Undenominational Christian Mission began at around .pm and was conducted by reverend John Funnell from Noddfa Church, Abersychan. Mourners, who had started filing into the church at am, listened to the welcome, prayers and a time of reflection before singing the only hymn, Amazing Grace. After the eulogy and final prayers, the service ended at .pm and mourners began a slow procession onto the main road. A second service was held at the gym where Shane trained.

Richard Selley, from Perth in Scotland, was diagnosed with motor neurone diseasein , and can no longer walk, talk or swallow. The -year-old has now flown to Zurich in Switzerland with we Elaine and brother Peter, where he has paid around £, to end his le in a matter of hours. He says he was quoted a price in excess of a thousand pounds to have my ashes sent back by courier so has asked his daughter Lorna to pop me in her handbag when she next flies back to Scotland. As his le comes to an end, he is urging for the law to be changed and although it would be too late for him, it would enable other terminally ill people to die peacefully.  In a final video message before his planned death, Richard, the former head of Loretto junior school in East Lothian, called on MSPs to support an assisted dying Bill. He said: I hope that members of the Scottish Parliament support an assisted dying Bill in the future. I think the momentum for a change in the law is growing. It will be too late for me, but I hope that sometime soon people in my position will have the choice to have a peaceful death at a time of their choosing.  He added: Since my diagnosis with MND four years ago, I have lost the ability to walk, talk and swallow. I have also lost most of the power in my arms. Despite these losses I have tried very hard to remain positive and my palliative care has been outstanding. However, as I enter the final stage of my journey, I donapost wish to suffer for much longer so I am seeking an assisted death with Dignitas. Despite what some people think, Dignitas do not let people simply fly to Zurich, knock on their door and ask to die. I have already had to compose letters, write a le story and obtain medical records that prove that I am terminally ill.  This has been stressful, particularly as my GP was advised to refuse my request for an up-to-date medical report. He said the cost attending of the clinic in Switzerland is about £, which he is fortunate he can afford, as others cannot. Having to be able to fly means that I am choosing to die earlier than I would prefer, he added. If an assisted death was possible in Scotland, I would be able to die at a time of my choosing, at home.  Holyrood has twice considered Bills aimed at introducing assisted suicide, with these having brought forward by independent MSP Margo MacDonald and, following her death from Parkinsonaposs disease, Green MSP Patrick Harvie. However, these both failed to get enough support to proceed through the Scottish Parliament. Sarah Wootton, chief executive of the campaign group Dignity In Dying, which released Richardaposs video, said: Richard and his we Elaine have shown immense bravery and dignity in sharing their story and speaking out about the injustice they have both suffered under the UKaposs outdated, broken law in their final weeks together.  She added: If we are serious about improving end of le care in this country and ensuring that everyone has the death thataposs right for them, assisted dying must be part of the conversation. Gordon Macdonald, chief executive of campaign group Care Not Killing, said it is sad Richardaposs case is being used to try and justy a campaign that will rip up long held universal protections, by treating those who are terminally ill, disabled, or have chronic conditions dferently in law. He added: Such a change in the law will put vulnerable people at risk of abuse and of coming under pressure to end their lives prematurely.

I was so shaken up, I didnapost care about myself at all I just couldnapost cope with the fact she might have harmed my baby.aposapos Hoodaposs motivation for the attack came from back in  when Shannon had unwittingly found herself in love triangle.

Shannon said: I did really feel for her at the time, weaposd both been played by the same guy and I wouldnapost wish that on anyone. But Siobhan just wouldnapost let it go. She somehow got hold of my number and would message me threats, eventually I just changed my number and she stopped.

Subsequent campaigns have continued to be influenced by people and music, alongside a respect for traditional manufacturing techniques.The generations of women in his family who worked in jute mills in Dundee helped inspire his Juteopolis Spring Summer  collection, which involved a collaboration with the city’s historic fabric mill Halley Stevensons.His Blackwatch Autumn Winter  collection involved researching the complex global story of tartan and the le of George Rose, a Sergeant in the Black Watch regiment who was born a slave. A new kilt for the collection was developed in partnership with Glenisla Kilts of Lanarkshire.Nicholas Daley said: “This exhibition for me is a celebration of my personal history, my family connections to Scotland and Dundee and of the manufactures based here. It reflects what happens in my studio and the processes I go through when researching and creating a new collection.“Most of the women on my mother’s side worked in Dundee jute mills and on father’s side came over to London from Jamaica in the s, bringing with them a certain style.“My parents started a reggae club because they felt at that time in Scotland there wasn’t a space for that type of music. In a way, with my fashion shows and with this exhibition, I’m carrying on that family legacy.”Mhairi Maxwell, VA Dundee project curator, said: “It’s been thrilling to work with Nicholas on this exhibition and to capture the energy of his studio here in Dundee, a city that has had such a big impact on his work.“Nicholas’s honest and playful re-working of tweeds, jutes and tartan express a creative response to identity, belonging and authenticity. These are topics of wide concern in international fashion today and are something that I hope everyone will connect with.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/08/5d63e2fec534c2.18919648-406x564.jpg ","title":"bard of salford john cooper clarke promises a right good night in dundee visit","story":"John Cooper Clarke is ready to rock# and Dundee should be afraid, very afraid.He may be in his older years, but he is not holding back.And the man known as the punk poet has vowed to perform in his unmistakable style – machine gun delivery studded with factory floor language.The rasping Salford accent is still there and the humour as cutting as a surgeon’s scalpel.And for the real devotees, John has teased them by telling the Tele exclusively that he has begun planning his memoirs.In typical fashion he says: “I haven’t kept a f****** diary, but I have got a good memory.“In fact, my memory is long and my vengeance is total.”To the musicians and celebs who have crossed JCC in the past, start praying now because the master could even recall the gig I saw him perform at Strathclyde University in the early s and who was playing on the same bill.For the record, it was Siouxsie and the Banshees – and I couldn’t remember that, despite being a few years younger than the man.Back in the day, John easily recalls everyone being angry young men and women. The hate for Thatcher was pure and the depth of feeling surged through concerts and rallies.He says with a chuckle: “Them were the days.“We thought it was bad then, but everything can get worse, as we see now. It’s a case of careful what you wish for.“I don’t get involved in politics now, like I say when didn’t anyone complain about politicians “Can you point me to a golden era where# everybody liked being ruled  F***ing never!“But there are some real creeps nowadays. But then again I expect the worst from any politician.”So what can fans in Dundee expect when John rolls into town for his show at the city’s Gardyne Theatre on Saturday October  Without missing a beat he fires back: “A right f****** good night!“And they can expect more of the same#and then some. There will be a few classics and there will maybe be a few extra poems.“Then I will add a bit of fun and I can guarantee – solid, copper-plated guarantee – that everybody is going to leave with a smile on their face.”John has fond memories of Dundee and spoke of savouring the atmosphere of a waterfront hotel and added: “I love coming to Scotland and Dundee. I’ve been many times and the reaction of the crowd is great.“I was here last year and saw the VA which is fabulous. I know of DC Thomson and the Sunday Post, the Beano and the Dandy plus Oor Wullie.“Maybe I will buy one of those sculptures.”Posh hotels and venues seem a world away from the clubs and student venues of the s with smoke-filled rooms and plastic tumblers full of warm beer.He used to travel to the shows on public transport and chuckles at the memory.John said: “Yeah, long time ago now, mate. Now I have a driver and I am too old for public transport.“But I still love doing live gigs. It’s smashing. Anywhere where there’s people is greatI’m doing my stuff.“I am working on my book of poems right now.

I just hope to live long enough to finish it.“But I am not finishing up any time soon. I have never even thought about that.

The adjacent Maritime House, which was once the home of travel firm DPL, is being converted into  new flats.No concrete plans for Custom House will be on the table until a new buyer for the property is found.However, the building could appeal to a property developer looking to create more homes in the area, rather than a rival hotelier."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/5d70de618ba320.45355383-848x564.jpg ","title":"kobee good place for a meat lover and a handy location on the waterfront if a little pricy","story":"Driving into Dundee off the bridge I couldn’t help but look at Kobee’s shiny, glassy exterior and think “I haven’t been there in a while”.Sadly, the place no longer does teppanyaki with the chef cooking it in front of you and calling you names – an experience I’d enjoyed on my previous visit when celebrating my future we’s birthday, despite her surviving having food chucked into her hat without getting egg on her face.I didn’t think I would miss being called “sexy boy” by the chef as I ordered my dinner but I guess I did#It is, though, still a place to enjoy some good meat, evenyou can’t say it’s the cheapest place in town – a once-in-a-while choice for those living on a budget.Eating on a Monday night, getting a table wasn’t a hassle and we even managed to get plonked down next to the window to watch Dundee le passing by.The excitement and wonder of the teppanyaki show disappearing was a disappointment when we recalled how much we’d enjoyed it.However, we resolved to make our own fun and had an enjoyable night out on the town.The first order was to get the drinks in – a pint of Pravha for meand a ml helping of Malbec for my we .Then it was on to figuring out which of the mouth-watering options we were going to opt for from the Teppan grill.Eventually I made my choice of Surf and Turfwith Angus sirloin and king prawn in either spicy or teriyaki sauce.A solid choice, I thought, and one I would stick to no matter what.Well, for a couple of minutes anyway.My partner made the same choice and couldn’t understand why us having the same meal would make for a rubbish review.So I changed to Kobee Delightwhich gives duck breast with Angus sirloin for a couple of bob extra with spicy sauce rather than the honey option.I do love duck so I couldn’t claim it as much of a hardship, despite doing just that to justy stealing prawns from across the table.On the side we added salt and pepper chipsto share between us.For a place that prides itself on the quality of its meat the food was just fine – but I couldn’t help having a tinge of disappointment along with it.Harking back to my previous meal there probably isn’t fair but it was a memorable night, not just because of the chef’s antics but the incredible quality of the prawns and steak that night.This just didn’t live up to that high standard, though it was good in its own right.The duck was lovely and the steak just fine, with the spicy sauce not too bad on the hotness.It was an enjoyable meal, only spoiled by my own previous experience.My we’s choice went down just the same, too, with the teriyaki-covered prawns sweet and tasty.There was still time for me to watch her down some ice cream to finish, too– I’m not much of a puddings man when there’s no sticky toffee option.Overall it’s a decent meal and an enjoyable one but, for the prices charged, decent won’t have me back too soon eventhe new chef calls me “sexy##"},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"oscar-marzaroli-images-past-glasgow-life","story":"Kneeling in front of the old John Smithrsquos bookshop in Glasgowrsquos St Vincent Street is a boy.

Scott is obviously disappointed that he is not going to be playing in these qualiers as they are two great games.“It would have been two brilliant games for him to go into.“However, I think the good thing is that when Steve took the Scotland job on he played Scott in the first two games.“He sees Scott as part of that .”The hamstring tear suffered at Kilmarnock was the latest injury setback to marr McKenna’s international career.The centre-back suffered a hamstring tear against Rangers in the opening game of last season that ultimately ruled him out of action for six weeks.That injury saw him miss Scotland’s opening UEFA Nations League clash against Albania and the friendly with Belgium last September.McInnes believes the recent injury was particularly cruel for McKenna as he was in good form despite the speculation over his Aberdeen future.McKenna had submitted a transfer request days before the English transfer window closed on August  for Premier League and Championship clubs.Nottingham Forest and Queens Park Rangers both had bids for McKenna rejected before he handed in the request.Sheffield Wednesday came in with a late bid on transfer deadline day that was also rejected for the defender who is contracted to Pittodrie until .McInnes said: “Scott’s level of performance have been very strong. Unfortunately he missed spells of football last season with two hamstring injuries and this is another one.“This is a similar injury to when Scott over-stretched itagainst Rangers here making a blocking tackle.“He has over-stretched it again having lost his footing on that pitch and is out for the region of three to four weeks.“It may be a bit longer, maybe a bit shorter, but Scott has been a quick healer in the past.”Devlin’s call-up came  hours after histo the Dons starting line-up for the first time in six weeks after a hamstring injury.McInnes said: “It just shows you need that squad and how it changes because Mikey thought he was not getting into my team a couple of weeks ago.“Mikey is now in charge of he jersey and he comes back in now and plays.“We know we can rely on Mikey when he is called upon.“It is great to have that quality in the squad to call upon when you have injuries.McKenna is one of five centre-backs ruled out of Clarke’s Scotland squad with John Souttarand Stuart Findlayboth omitted with injuries.Grant Hanleyand Liam Palmerwere called up but dropped out with injuries.In reaction Clarke called up the Dons’ Devlin, , and Hamburg’s David Bates, on loan at Sheffield Wednesday.Uncapped Devlin was previously in the squad last November and was set to earn his first cap only to suffer an ankle injury training with Scotland that would rule him out for three months.McInnes said: “What looked like an innocuous injury when he was away with Scotland saw him miss the best part of three months.“He missed out on the League Cup final, playing for Scotland and a number of key games for us.“For a young lad he has a lot of injuries to deal with but hopefully he will have better times ahead.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/08/5d6004abb61e43.23715313.jpg ","title":"logan and campbell fitness boost for dons","story":"Aberdeen have received a double fitness boost with right-back Shaleum Logan and midfielder Dean Campbell both set tofor the next Premiership clash.Logan missed the - defeat of Ross County prior to the international break having undergone a minor procedure on a groin injury.The defender is on course tofor the next clash against St Johnstone at Pittodrie next Saturday.Teenage midfielder Campbell has been sidelined since the - League Cup defeat of Dundee with a hip injury.Campbell had to withdraw due to injury from the Scotland Under- squad to face Japan in Pinatar, Spain, in two friendlies as preparation gets underway for UEFA European championship qualying in October.However, Campbell is also set to be fit to face the Perth Saints.Dons boss Derek McInnes said: “I think Shay will be all right for St Johnstone.“Under medical instruction he was advised not to play against Ross County.“Hopefully we can get him back in contact training in the week building up to St Johnstone.“Dean Campbell will hopefully be fit for St Johnstone.”Logan’s expectedwill be a timely boost for McInnes who had only four fit defenders for the clash with Ross County.Centre-backs Scott McKenna and Ash Taylor were also sidelined with hamstring tears.The manager said: “You could see on the benchthere were no midfielders and no defenders.

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

The deadline was broken on  minutes when Lee MacLean broke from midfield and managed to beat the offside trap, his cross from the left channel was met by the in-form Stuart MacLean whose shot beat Martin to give Star the lead.Tarbert looked to commit bodies forward in a bid to get back into the game which made for a more open contest, however the Star defence of Coll McCallum, Ricky Reid and Kyle Selfridge coped well throughout.Red Star should have made the closing stages a lot more comfortable for themselves with Gregor Peacock going close with a couple of opportunities and Aaron Moore having a shot well blocked but in the end Stuart MacLean’s goal was enough for a hard-fought but deserved win.On Saturday August  Star welcome Dunoon to the joint campus for their final game of the group stage, where a victory for the Lochgilphead side will see them progress to the quarter-finals.The kick-off time will be announced on the club’s social media pages during the week."},{"url":null,"title":"easy like summer busking","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe music club designed for everyone continues its summer of busking on Wednesday August .Get along to Lochgilphead Resource Centre for an evening of music from the much-missed Danny Kennedy with bagpipes, percussion and plenty of chances to sing along to the music.The event starts at pm and is free other than donations.

These songs were associated with the Tlell River on Hai Gwaii in Canada. These tracks, with a selection of later collaborations, make up River to Sea from Tlell to Tiree. The title documents Sheila#s journey from the coast of Canada to Tiree, where the track All You Really Need is the Sea was written.This artist is probably best described as a folk blues singer. She has the sharply observing, descriptive eye of the classic singer songwriter troubadour and while her voice is given gravitas and character by time, she swings and has the timing of the blues singer.Wild Biscuit#s musical accompaniment gives Sheila#s characterful voice depth and presence. The menacing guitar on I#ve Waited a Long Time and the atmospheric double bass and keyboards on Where the Pebbles Grind and Scrape complement Cameron#s lyrics and singing.Remembering Mr Toast is an atmospheric and evocative, less bombastic or overblown Scottish Jim Morrison, finding real beauty in a melancholic memory. The delicate hesitant guitar and reflective lyrics continue on Don#t Sigh and Go on Then, beautul, bitter sweet country love songs. All You Really Need is the Sea and Deep and Real are spiritual songs, again moving between an intimate relationship to consider the huge landscape and the restorative natural world.Is it blues, country, easy listening, folk or poetry set to delicate sympathetic music  It doesn#t matter. Close your eyes, listen to Sheila#s rich voice, with its cadence and rhythm. Enjoy the flow of words and the pictures they conjure on this warm and captivating set of recordings."},{"url":null,"title":"macalister wins tarbert golf championship","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe delayed fourth and final round of the Tarbert Golf Club championship took place at Glenralloch on Saturday August  in glorious conditions.The greens were freshly cut with captain Smyth choosing some interesting pin positions to test the players# skills.Iain Macalister held a one shot lead over Bruce MacNab and a five shot lead over John MacNab heading into the final round.If there were any nerves at the start of play this was not evident as Iain started with four fours then followed that with an excellent -foot birdie putt at the fth and a chip-in birdie at the sixth. He finished the nine with three pars to give him an outward level par .John was also playing well, enjoying a birdie at the sixth with the only blemishes at the third and ninth for an outward . Bruce had the poorest nine of the three with , so with nine holes to play Iain held a five shot lead.

At the th and th both players had pars then at the th Bruce got another shot back, to be two behind going to the nd and final hole.By this time a large turnout of members had gathered to watch proceedings in the late afternoon sunshine not knowing the state of play. Iain sensibly played short of the burn while Bruce had no option but to drive, splitting the fairway in the process leaving a  yard shot to the green. Iain#s second shot came up a bit short leaving him a dficult up and down, and the drama continued as Bruce almost holed his second shot to leave a tap in birdie. With nerves of steel, Iain chipped on to four feet and duly rolled in the putt for a well deserved victory of the Sam Andrews trophy.This was Iain#s first championship victory and in his acceptance speech he told the crowd of his delight at winning while complimenting the sterling work done on the course by Graham Prentice, John MacNab and Duncan Johnstone.Iain swept the boards, also winning the nett and senior championship at the same time. Captain Smyth also presented the John Reid Quaich to Duncan Johnstone, the James Johnson Cup to Iain Johnstone and the August medal to himself.Members were treated to a lovely buffet provided by Sheena, Georgie and Catherine, with celebrations carrying on late into the evening.Final totals: , Iain Macalister  , Bruce MacNab  , John MacNab ."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll course draws skippers and compliments","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowMid Argyll Radio Sailing put its toe in the water last Saturday when skippers arrived with their model radio controlled yachts from the club#s first competition.Several Scottish clubs # Ayr Bay Radio Yacht Club, Greenock, Rhu and Paisley # travelled to Mid Argyll joined by others from as far afield as the Preston area.A total of  yachts raced each other around the club#s Loch a Bahrain course near Cairnbaan.A steady wind from the south produced some exciting close encounters results and near misses.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream.

The overall revenue budget for the upkeep of parks across the Borders is contained within the budget for neighbourhood services and no savings are projected from this budget as a result of the play programme.ldquoThe removal of old play equipment from playparks, which following appraisal, deemedto be low value facilities, will allow for sufficient resources to be deployed to maintain thenew facilities being invested in by the council through the outdoor community spacescapital project on an ongoing basis.ldquoThe new facilities include more pieces of equipment, widening access and providinghigher play value than the previous, aged, low-amenity, play equipment. Thedecommissioning of the older low value facilities will ensure the revenue impact to the parks and environment service budget is cost neutral.ldquoI would further confirm that no play park will be decommissioned until such times as thenew play park investment in that locality is complete.ldquoMembers should also note that no town or village which currently has a play park will beleft without one following the upgrade process.Tweeddale West councillor Heather Anderson also queried the council leader, asking for an update on the proposed closure of eleven parks in her ward.Councillor Haslam told the chamber: ldquoThe council requested feedback to the programme for decommissioning of play parks with an end date of August .ldquoOfficers will now undertake a review of the feedback and, where appropriate, respond prior to implementing the council decision.ldquoIn announcing a signicant investment in outdoor community facilities the council recognised the need to address the historic over provision of low value playparks, indeed the council is in amongst the largest providers of play parks per  head of population when compared to similar authorities, however when it comes to quality it is amongst the lowest in play value terms.ldquoThe council decision to invest in destination playparks and decommission those play parks which are obsolete does not remove the spaces from fulfilling an important community need in terms of access to open spaces.ldquoThese spaces can be used for informal play and have the potential to help the council address other issues such as its obligation to identy places for community food growing.Scottish Borders Council recently spent pound, on a new playpark at Harestanes Countryside Visitor Centre, near Ancrum, which follows on from new parks built in Galashiels, Oxton, and Stow.The council also opened up a new playpark in Hawick in  as part of the regeneration of WIlton Lodge Park, and Coldstream is set to be next to receive a new playpark with a pound, facility set to open in Home Park at the end of the month."},{"url":null,"title":"driving-legend-jackie-opens-museum-39-great-friend-39","story":"SIR Jackie Stewart praised Jim Clark as a driver and as a friend when he officially opened the refurbished Jim Clark Museum on Thursday in Duns.Clark won two Formula  World Championships, in  and , claiming overall a total of  Grand Prix victories with  pole starts, and also the Indianapolis  in  before he died in a horric crash at Hockenheim in .Sir Jackie, who later was flying off to Spain for the weekendrsquos Grand Prix, recalled his friendship with Clark.And he revealed how he regularly visited the Borders to meet up with his lsquogreat friend.He said: ldquoWhen Jim Clark was racing he was my hero and was certainly the best racing driver I ever raced against.\"We had a great le together and he was an enormous help to me.

The tragedy is I cannot tell my grandchildren the same because we messed up.ldquoBut so long as there are young people like those I met on Zomba Plateau about, we can have hope and faith in a future where all can share the bounty of this beautul creation.Afterwards, the youngsters moved on to the Liwonde Game Reserve where they helped restore no less than fourteen houses damaged in the severe floods of March.Then everyone got to experience a safari drive, many of whom for the first time, seeing elephants, hippos, warthogs, and lions up close.Also, a site visit was arranged to YONECO, one of the main sponsors of the camp, to learn of their special approach to promoting youth empowerment.To reinforce the talk the RYLA participants engaged with the women who live on the Plateau and men who make a living there passing on their newfound knowledge on how to minimise the effects of Climate Change.And handed out mango plants in small plastic sleeves that will provide a crop of fruit in three years.Nineteen-year-old leader, John Little said: ldquoThe pilot Malawi RYLA camp was a massive success.

 after owners Roy and Lorna Curry had failed to make the business profitable.Plans were submitted by Rikeja Ltd with the local authority the following year for an extension to be added and  apartments

Ryan McConnachie opted to go straight down the middle and evaded the e of the Dunoon keeper.There was a moment of worry at the other end, though, when goalscorer Souden also committed a handball in the Pupils’ box, and referee Peter Laing pointed to the spot. Dunoon halved the Pupils’ advantage, making it -.Then, just  seconds later, the Pupils restored their two-goal lead through Donald McCallum, who met left-sided substitute Kenny Kerr’s low cross to squeeze a shot between the Dunoon defenders and the frame of the goal.Soon after, the Pupils made it -, when Kerr guided another delightful cross onto the head of John McCallum, who guided an effort past the keeper from six yards, but it was the goal creator Kerr who was rightly mobbed by his team-mates.Not content with four, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils scored again, with # stand by # Kerr making it three assists in one match.Played in by McConnachie after some strong play in midfield by fellow substitute Michael McKinlay, Kerr set up young winger Ross Brown, who gladly tucked home goal number five with a close-range finish.With the match drawing to a close, McConnachie sealed his brace # and the Pupils’ sixth goal # with an excellent inidual effort, surging past a defender before rounding the hosts’ keeper and slotting the ball low into an unguarded net, adding gloss to an already emphatic cup win.After a great team performance, the Pupils will be hoping for more of the same tomorrowwhen they welcome a Tarbert side # who last week also defeated Dunoon # in a Kintyre derby.The match is scheduled for a pm kick off at Kintyre Park."},{"url":null,"title":"third round of tarberts golf championship","story":"Former champion Bruce MacNab held a four-shot lead going into the third round but a horror start saw the lead wiped out at the very first hole when Iain Macalister birdied and Bruce had a seven.Iain went on to birdie the second hole as well and despite the windy conditions was very much in control of his game over the first nine holes to be out in .John MacNab was also playing his normal steady game also ing , enjoying birdies at the st and th holes.After nine holes Iain had turned a four-shot deficit into a four-shot lead over Bruce and six ahead of John.Over the next four holes both Iain and John dropped four shots allowing Bruce some breathing space to claw back some of the deficit.When play was complete and all scores checked the totals after round three were as follows: Iain Macalister , Bruce MacNab , John MacNab .In the John Reid Quaich the silverware again headed south to Largieside with Duncan Johnstone retaining the trophy, shooting  nett over the two rounds.

Work is expected to start at the end of the month and should be completed by the send of September.Councillor Frank T. Spears stated that the work would not involve any long-term closure of the main roadway.The #dry bridge#, owned by Lord Margadale, has been the subject of much discussion and minor rows for the past several months. Since Western Ferries Ltd. began their sea service, heavy articulated lorries carrying malt and grain to the island#s distilleries have been unable to go under the bridge. Matters came to a head three months ago when Argyll County Council re-imposed a weight limit on the Glen road # the ersion used by the transporters to avoid the bridge.The bridge owners came quickly to the rescue and allowed the heavy traffic to use their private road at Bridgend for a three-week period, but following local protests and legal consultations the transporters were again allowed to use the Glen road.Leboat saves three on rocksThe crew of a lobster fishing boat were marooned on a partially-submerged rock for more than two hours when their vessel foundered off the north-east coast of Islay on Thursday morning.The ft #May#, owned and skippered by -year-old Mr Lachlan Clark of Port Charlotte # the veteran of several sea-dramas # struck the rocks while they were lting lobster creels.The Islay leboat was called out to rescue the skipper and his crew # Alastair MacDonald, a -year-old fisherman, and Norman Gardiner, a -year-old Colonsay doctor#s son who was making his first trip and deputising for a sick crew member.Following the rescue, the crew # who were unhurt # were landed at Port Askaig.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGONational Health Insurance ActA number of contraventions of the National Health Insurance Act were the subject of prosecutions in Campbeltown Sherf Court on Thursday # Sherf MacMaster Campbell on the bench.The first case was that of a Clachan merchant who was charged with neglecting to stamp the card of a female servant.Mr M. Dick, solicitor, who appeared for accused, tendered a plea of guilty, and said the observations he was about to make would apply equally to all the cases subsequently to be heard. These were the first prosecutions of the kind in this court. The Act, as his Lordship knew, was a most voluminous and complicated measure.The sherf observed that some excellent and very lucid summaries had been circulated.Mr Dick, proceeding, asked his Lordship to examine the contribution card. He would find that the part which was the very kernel of the offence was embodied in the middle of Art.  in very inconspicuous type. The employer was there required to stamp the card #not later than the time at which wages are paid# but to read that one required to hold the card at about  degrees.The sherf askedhe was to understand that this was the first occasion on which a domestic servant had been employed by accused  If not, he must have been trained in the use of this wonderful document years ago.Mr Dick said his Lordship must consider this, that in cases of this kind there were two standards of clearness. What was clear to the judicial mind might be very far from clear to the lay mind.It was a matter of common knowledge that there was a very general belief in this part of the country thatinsurance cards were stamped at the time they were run out the Act would be complied with.The card, of course, bore that the stamps must be affixed #not later than the time wages are paid#. He asked his Lordship to consider the phraseology. These cards came into the hands of many rustic employers of labour. Why should it not be stated in bold characters on the card that the stamps must be affixed at the time wages are paid In the country wages were paid sometimes by the half-year, sometimes by the month, and sometimes at irregular periods suitable to the circumstances of the worker.The cards represented not the half-year of the feeing terms, but the calendar half-year.

When the corn was eventually gathered in early September, it is said decaying corpses were discovered. They had lain in the fields since August , a day of barbaric infamy in Tranentrsquos history. The dead were victims of the Tranent Massacre, and one of the bodies may have been that of Jackie Crookston or Crookstone.I say lsquomayrsquo for there is ironically so little known about this well-known woman. A statue by David Annand of Jackie on Tranent High Street shows her beating her drum with a clenched fist, defiantly leading the protest against the Militia Act. The plaque by the statue calls her a ldquoresolute woman who joined the protest, and states she was one of those killed by the cavalry.Her heroic reputation is well established in local lore. The th-century historian John Martine called her ldquoa Tranent virago. This word describes a woman of brave, fearless qualities, but it has a sting in its tail. It can also be used to mean a woman who has overstepped her mark, broken cultural rules in relation to her role as defined by gender.And by leading the protest against the Militia Act she most certainly did this.Another th-century historian and collector of traditions, P. MrsquoNeill, was clear on her role: ldquoJackie indeed was the prime mover in the whole affair, he states.We have accounts of her beating her drum and leading the protest with chants of ldquonae militia. She is said to have threatened a captain of the cavalry and declared defiantly that ldquoshe didna care a pin though she were cut in halves, she wad hae nae militia. Another account has her telling a member of the yeomanry to leave or she would ldquothraw his neck, at which he duly rode off.If these accounts are true, she was indeed resolute on that day in defending her family, her neighbours and her community. Jackie was not the only woman on the streets that day, for women took a leading role in defending their families. But she was the most prominent, it seems.The Militia Act aimed to conscript young men into a militia by means of a ballot. It was resisted for a number of reasons, but for the poverty-stricken mining and farming communities of Tranent and the surrounding area, it was seen as an imposition which would take young men of working age away and potentially cripple their families economically.There is no space here to recount the details of the massacre, but much of what happened on that day remains hidden behind a mist of cover-up and official indference.And somewhere in the bloody carnage of August , , Jackie Crookston was killed, along with many others. Yet despite her leading role, her name was not included in the original list of people killed. Eleven deaths were recorded, but no mention of Jackie. ldquoHow her death escaped recording is dficult to explain, reflected P. MrsquoNeill in his book Tranent and its Surroundings.Perhaps an explanation can be found in an eyewitness account written immediately after the massacre. It was a letter from Archibald Roger to his we in Edinburgh.It begins: ldquoDear we, this comes to acquaint you that you need not weary for my ing home, for my sister is to be buried this afternoon at four orsquoclock, and I cannot come away till I see her decently interred. I am sorry to inform you of the cruelties that were committed here yesterday there were six persons shot dead on the spot, of which my sister was onehellip the number of wounded is not yet ascertained, but I am just now informed that  dead corpses were this morning found in the corn-fields and it is not known how many more may be found when the corn is cut.Was Jackie one of those lying undiscovered in a field  It seems so by some accounts. Is that why her death was not on the list  Sandy Mullay in his book The Tranent Massacre says she was shot in the streets, but there is also a tradition which states her body was found well away from Tranent much later in a field, with stab as well as gunshot wounds.Was she initially wounded and then a victim of later retribution  Was she hunted down in an unrecorded atrocity because of her role as ring leader, and a woman who didnrsquot know her place  She will have been easy to identy because of her prominence in the protest.Her death, just like her le, is unrecorded by history. Despite her leadership in the events, she was a woman and she was poor, and history lacks interest in such characters. A tax on the registration of births and deaths at this time meant many poor people lived and died unregistered even in parish records.So who was Jackie  We know she was born in Gladsmuir in June  and was a mother. Perhaps not all her children were registered because of the tax, but it seems she had at least four surviving at the time of the massacre. She was only  when she died, but how do we imagine her le  What was behind her passion in defending her community When I spoke of her to artist Mags Nisbet-Macfarlane, she was inspired to use art to search for the woman behind the historical glimpses.ldquoI felt connected to this woman I did not know, she told me, ldquoshe will have had a le that explains her defiance that day she had so little, but was protecting what was important to her. Magsrsquo image of Jackie tells a story without the need of words.The plaque by the statue in Tranent says there were  killed in the massacre, as Jackiersquos name has been added to the original . But in truth we will never know for sure how many were really killed and maimed that day.There was no prosecution of those responsible, no investigation and no interest by those in authority to allow the truth to be told."},{"url":null,"title":"new-dunbar-area-radio-station-hunt-volunteers","story":"Sescot Radio, previously known as Dunbar On Air, is looking to take to the airwaves and have the community at the heart of its programmes.Andrew Morris, who is behind the proposals, was keen to get people involved, whether that was on air or behind the scenes.He told the Courier: ldquoFirst of all, we are an internet radio station so our catchment area is all around the world.ldquoBut, from a common sense point of view, there is no physical radio covering from East Linton and Dunbar right down the coast to Burnmouth and along to Kelso wersquove got a triangle.ldquoIrsquom keen that these little places that have got two or three cottages are just as involved.ldquoWhat we are doing is covering Eyemouth, Dunbar and Kelso but we donrsquot want to preclude these folk either.ldquoWe want to involve everybody and preclude nobody.Already, the fledgling station has been out in the community and got involved with Dunbar Civic Week earlier this summer.Mr Morris was keen to see the radio station cater to as large an audience as possible.The -year-old was previously involved with both East Coast FM in Haddington and Tranent-based East Lothian FM, which is now Radio Saltire.He told the Courier that he had interviewed a number of East Lothian councillors on air but the focus was firmly away from politics and instead looked at a number of dferent topics.That was something he was keen to consider repeating, with other shows looking at ious genres of music, as well as cooking shows.As well as music, the station would promote local good causes and encourage involvement from schools, charities, clubs and other organisations.Now, Mr Morris, who lives on Dunbarrsquos John Muir Crescent, is calling on members of the public to come forward and offer a helping hand to get the station off the ground.A meeting takes place at Hallhill Sports Centre in Dunbar on Wednesday evening.Mr Morris said: ldquoWe are progressing but a lot slower than I hoped.ldquoWe have got ious applications out for grant money and have been awarded some but we need a lot more before we think about buying the gear that we need.ldquoWe are also anxious to find some suitable premises.In-house training will be provided at the station, which will be run entirely by volunteers.The station also intends to offer work experience opportunities for those looking to find their way into a career in the media.The meeting takes place at pm, when members of the public will be updated on the stationrsquos progress."},{"url":null,"title":"up-and-coming-band-go-first-scottish-tour","story":"Johnny Brown and the Devanties, made up of frontman Johnny Brown, , Erin Ritchie, , Andrew Dobie, , and Struan Blacklock, , will be heading to Aberdeen at the start of next month on the first gig of their headline tour.Johnny told the Courier: ldquoIrsquove been singing and writing music since I was about  years old.ldquoI knew the tour manager for The View so ended up playing a few gigs with them.ldquoIrsquove played the EH festival and once I had the chance to play with Republica.ldquoIn January I reconnected with a few people I went to school with through the music scene and we decided to form the band.ldquoWersquove released one single and our next one, Streetlights, will be released after the tour.Johnny of Edinburgh Road, Cockenzie, met his fellow bandmates while at Preston Lodge High School.He said: ldquoWe had to make sure that we were able to sell out shows before we knew we could tour.ldquoWe sold out about seven gigs in a row, so thatrsquos when we thought we should give it a go.The bandrsquos first single, Brooklyn, was released just after they were first formed in January and garnered good reviews, in particular from Discover Music, Scotlandrsquos Music Blog.As to the future, Johnny said: ldquoWersquore hoping our tour and our new single will do really well, hopefully itrsquoll help us break through.

Wersquore not falling for that trick ndash no way Jose. Asking for an election was just Boris Johnson trying to use democracy to get off the hook, said Labour and the LibDems.Jeremy Corbyn may have spent the last two years demanding ldquoa General Election now, but he didnrsquot actually mean ldquonow, according to Labourrsquos Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary, Tony Lloyd, on Newsnight. He meant: ldquoonly when the Opposition parties choose it. They want to stop No Deal first by mandating the Government to ask for an extension of Article .:Brexit: Boris Johnson to seek election after Commons defeatNow, the original objection to the election, as with the prorogation, was the threat that Mr Johnson might cunningly schedule the campaign to last beyond Brexit day, on October , thus forcing the UK out when Parliament is not sitting. That would have been outrageous. But even the offer of an election on October  ndash two and a half weeks before Britain is set to leave ndash seems to be unacceptable to Labour or the Tory rebels. Or at least most of them. There were many contradictory statements yesterday, as Parliament went into meltdown.You can understand why many Labour MPs might want to delay an election. A lot of them would lose their seats for a start. Mr Corbyn is thought to be a closet Brexiter, so maybe he doesnrsquot want to risk the possibility that Labour might actually win, leaving him with the poisoned chalice of Brexit.All Opposition MPs relish the prospect of Mr Johnson, who said he would leave the EU on October  ldquodo or die, being forced to go cap in hand to Brussels to ask for yet another extension to Article , as ordered by the Extension Bill. Butthe Tory rebels stay strong today, and the bill becomes law, could Parliament really order the Prime Minister to do something he has repeatedly promised not to do Outside Downing Street on Monday, Mr Johnson said there were ldquono circumstances in which he would ask Brussels for a delay. But it would be the law of the land, chorus MPs and commentators. He would just have to do what hersquos told by Parliament. But it isnrsquot quite as easy as that. You can take the PM to water, but can you make him drink He could refuse to give the Extension Bill what is called ldquoQueenrsquos Consent, because it interferes with royal prerogative ndash the right of governments to conduct foreign affairs, and sign treaties. This has been used by Prime Ministers before, Labour included.The similar Cooper-Letwin Bill, last March, didnrsquot require Queenrsquos Consent because Theresa May accepted it. Indeed, she went ahead and requested the extension of Article  before the bill had finished going through Parliament. She wanted an extension to avoid no deal. Mr Johnson doesnrsquot, so he could refuse to let it become law.Alternatively, he might just note the Extension Act, and then noty Brussels that,the EU  agree to an extension, he will not cooperate. He could just empty-chair the whole process, as he did the TV debates during his leadership election. Or he could attach unacceptable conditions over budget contributions. The European Union does not negotiate with inidual MPs or with parliaments ndash it negotiates with the governments of member states. Would the  EU countries agree to extend British membership under such a recalcitrant, delinquent PM Mr Johnson would argue that the constitution is on his side. If the Commons keeps him in office, and by not supporting a confidence motion, it would be reaffirming him as the Prime Minister, then he has to act according to Government policies. This would be an absurd situation of course. A demeaning spectacle.:What the papers say about Boris Johnson and BrexitIn times past, when a PM lost on a key plank of government policy, he or she would simply resign and call an election. This was what James Callaghan did after he was defeated in . But because of the Fixed Term Parliament Act ndash passed by the Cameron coalition in  without thinking through the consequences ndash the Prime Minister cannot actually call an election. Mr Johnson has to win a two-thirds majority in the Commons.Labour appears to be saying that it would vote to keep him, pro tem. It wants the Extension Bill to be law before there is an election, to prevent Britain crashing out of the EU at the end of October. But the idea of a Prime Minister being forced to act, as it were, by an alternative government based in Parliament, is not something our constitution can handle. The Westminster system is based on the assumption thata government has no majority for its actions, it ceases to be it is a dead parrot. The Fixed Term Act allows the Opposition parties effectively to hold the Prime Minister hostage.The matter will probably end up in the courts. Remain groups already have their legal teams working against the prorogation and will roll that into an action claiming that the government is acting unlawfully. Willy nilly, democracy is moving from Parliament to the judges benches. Irsquom not sure this is a good thing.Whatever happens this week, there will have to be an election soon. It could destroy both the main parties. Indeed, after ex-Chancellor Philip Hammondrsquos claim that the Tory Party is being taken over by ldquoentryists itrsquos questionable whether the Conservative Party still exists. Conservative MPs are crossing the floor, like Phillip Lee, or leaving like Justine Greening.:Andrew McKie: Contradictions at heart of SNPs Brexit election strategyLabour isnrsquot in much better shape. It is hopelessly confused over Brexit, still apparently committed to negotiating another deal with Brussels before putting it to a referendum. In Scotland the party is facing virtual extinction.Perhaps thatrsquos why the prospect of a General Election before Brexit Day has become somewhat unattractive.

In part, this could be because her fiction is risky, challenging, sometimes riotously funny, but as often sizzling with rage. Her titles include Man or Mango , Dot in the Universe, and Mimi, savage satires on gender politics which are nevertheless also filled with tenderness and optimism. Her fondness for emphasising words in capital letters or italics has irked some critics, who prefer the page to look ordered and calm. But since when was fiction a form of beta blocker  With Ellmann, you feel yoursquove had an injection of adrenaline, quickening your heartbeat and bringing the world alive.Compared with her other novels, Ducks, Newburyport takes something of a new turn. As always, a woman is at its heart, but in this instance, instead of a slim work, it is big: just shy of , pages. Told by an Ohio housewe, who bakes her way through the tale, it is a stream-of-consciousness portrait of modern-day America, in all its confusion, consumerism, and cupidity. A y glossary of abbreviations is appended, ranging from Ato ZPGby way of IHPand WMD . You get the picture.Theof the story is ambitious enough, but asshe needed something more to spur her on, Ellmann has written the entire book ndash barring the opening passage ndash in a single sentence. Does this sound intimidating  Probably. Or make the book hard to read  Not at all. It is like stumbling on an oasis in a desert, a refreshing, invigorating, restorative immersion in a piece of remarkable, thoughtful and truly innovative fiction. Too many headline-grabbing novels are dull and predictable, enervating rather than enjoyable, derivative when they should be daring. Such tedious stuff makes you forget that the original meaning of the word novel was something dferent, unique, and new.Thankfully the Booker  has recognised a work of exceptional talent. Its presence on the shortlist adds lustre to a prize that has been dogged over the years by accusations of mediocrity and popularism, charges that last yearrsquos winner, Milkman by Anna Burns, helped to refute. Ellmannrsquos fellow shortlistees are prestigious, including Margaret Atwood and Salman Rushdie, both of whom have won before, along with El Shafak, second only to Orhan Pamuk in Turkey for international acclaim, British writer Bernadine Eisto, and the Nigerian Chigozie Obioma, shortlisted for his second novel, as he was with his first.The competition is stf, but already statistics are being trotted out: were it to win, Ducks, Newburyport would be the longest to prevail in the historyrsquos prize, beating even Eleanor Cattonrsquos doorstopper, The Luminaries, by more than  pages. Apart from their size, however, these two novels are poles apart. There is nothing conventional about Ducks, Newburyport. Indeed, Ellmannrsquos literary credentials can be traced back to James Joyce, the exemplar of stream of consciousness, where the reader has to surrender themselves to the flow, trusting the author to keep their head above water until they reach their destination. In the fluidity of Ellmannrsquos prose therersquos an echo of Henry James, with his sharp and self-conscious interrogation of America. Therersquos a nod to Virginia Woolf too, but Ellmannrsquos wit and acerbity, her scorching political lens, are all her own.The direction her style has taken is perhaps no surprise. Ellmannrsquos late father Richard was a world-renowned expert on Oscar Wilde and Yeats, but above all on James Joyce. His biography of the myopic Dublin genius has never been surpassed, remaining one of the most acclaimed literary biographies of the last century. The linguistic poetry and emotional range of Joyce, who must have been an invisible but constant presence in the Ellmann household, seems to have got under his daughterrsquos skin at a formative age.The announcement of the Booker Prize next month, on October , will mark  years to the day since its only Scottish winner, James Kelman, took the prize in  with How Late It Was, How Late. This was a highly contentious choice, not just because of its interior monologue narration, but also its liberal use of the F-word, which horried one uptight judge. The controversy it sparked has never been forgotten. These days, though, you canrsquot help thinking the title sounds like a lament for the lapse of time between Kelmanrsquos success and that of anyone  living north of the Border.There is no doubting Kelmanrsquos status as one of our finest novelists. Along with Alasdair Gray, he is an obvious contender for a Nobel Prize, though the chances of that idiosyncratic telescopersquos lens turning in this direction seem slim. Unlike many others, winning the Booker did not make Kelman rich or famous. It did, however, raise his profile internationally, and set a benchmark for those keen to add something memorable to the literary cairn.Ducks, Newburyport certainly does that. Other than in their tireless search for a mesmerising and distinctive way of expressing themselves, at first glance there is little obvious common ground between this pair. It is only when you read their books and recognise their seemingly effortless brilliance that you realise how similar, and rare, they are.In the acknowledgements at the end of Ducks, Newburyport, Ellmann thanks ldquoEdinburgh City Council for my Saltire card, a dandy aid to the impecunious. Itrsquos a cheerful reminder that unless yoursquore a bestseller, the literary le is not deluxe. Yet listening to the naturalness of her narratorrsquos voice, and the stories she tells, makes you grateful that the writerrsquos feet are firmly on the ground, be it a New Town pavement, No.  bus, or mid-west America, where the future is unfolding fast."},{"url":null,"title":"brian-beacom-tattoos-cant-cool-even-david-dimbleby-one","story":"The intent was to explore the paradox that while employers feel disdain for tattoos , nearly a third of --year-olds and a fth of the entire population, have been inked, clearly laughing in the face of career prospect.Yet, the research throws up another paradox which isnrsquot mentioned how can those who have a tattoo consider themselves to be ldquoimpulsive, believe they are the type to colour in outside the margins, the stand-out characters who now command attention, when tattoos are as common to Scottish skin as blue legs in winter Snce Robbie Williams and David Beckhamand Amy Winehousesomehow imprinted the notion of skin printing onto the psyche of the nation, itrsquos been impossible not to stand in a queue at Greggs and not see a female with a Polynesian fertility symbol etched onto her arm, or a male in Tesco without a thistle or an Arabic symbol.Roll up a bank managerrsquos sleeve and therersquos likely to be a quote from a Bob Dylan song.

Tattoos still remind me of men like my Uncle John who ed from National Service with a rites-of-passage snake-dagger on his forearm and a whole load of regret hersquod been so drunk that night in Aden.Yes, tattoos can be fun ndash but only for those drunken pals laughing at their -year-old chum who, on his first trip to Aya Napa, wound up with a le-sized male member indelibly drawn onto his chest, or the girl who had no idea the Mandarin writing wasnrsquot a proverb but a Szechuan take-away dish.You may well argue tattoos can defy class classication. And, yes, Churchill had a tattoobut for the most part tattoos were boasted by pirates and bad boys and sometimes girls with reputations.So why is the nation continuing to Beckhamise their bodies, to even deface their faces  Some psychologists say multiple tattoos signal passive aggression. Psychology Today indicates itrsquos about making a person feel better, and inking can produce the sort of feeling that comes about after diet or plastic surgery. Dr Vinita Mehta says those with tattoos generally want to feel unique, and they want to explore their le and live experiences that are outside of the norm. But how can that be achieved when a dolphin tattoo on an oversized Scottish calf is the norm Those planning a parlour trip to have their body turned into the Mark Bros song Lydia the Tattooed Lady should know tattoos are nothing new. The oldest tattooed body discovered dates back to  BC when lsquoOtzirsquo was found frozen beneath an Alpine glazier. He had more than  tattoos but itrsquos not knownany of them revealed a thistle, lsquoCarpe Diemrsquo or lsquoAgnes.rsquoYet while it seems insane to pay someone to stick needles into your body for hours on endcan tattooing ever be endorsed There are doctors who say having a permanent statement on your body can be a positive, such as the date you gave up an addiction. And inking proved inspirational for tennis hero Stan Wawrinka who has a Beckett quote on his forearm. lsquoEver failed. No Matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.rsquo And tattooing micro dots on the head can colour the appearance of baldness.But it should be tattooed into the minds of young people that inkings are pretty much for le.

As the child of immigrant parents, I had been brainwashed with the lsquoeducation is everythingrsquo mantra since I was wee. My mother had pretty much mapped out my educational future as she lsquoenjoyedrsquothe two weeks in hospital after my birth. Now, on the verge of my own children starting school, it suddenly hit me that being an Asian Tiger Mum was going to take drive, time and commitment and, worryingly, I was low on all three.I lacked the drive. As a second-generation British Scottish Asian I didnt have the same hunger to see my children succeed that my parents had. I lacked the time. As a TV producer, I worked fairly long, and sometimes irregular, hours which meant I would often just appear at bedtime. And, as for commitment ndash I was that invisible parent whose nanny was presumed to be mummy, even though the skin tones were definitely a puzzle. So, the Asian Tiger Mum of my dream was replaced by a half-arsed, Asian Tabby Mum. . I was also surrounded by laissez-faire, non-Asian, friends who urged me to: ldquoRelax, chill, let them do their own thing, which seeped into my psyche like a dose of Valium.Last weekend, fast-gulping tears as I dropped my younger son at university, I reflected on where it had all gone wrong for Asian Tiger Mum. Sure enough, both boys are at university but neither had achieved what Asian Tiger Mum had hoped. With a mix of As and Bs in their Highers they struggled to get into universities of their choice. In fact, the younger son had had five rejections from universities to study law. This marked the final, humiliating demise of Asian Tiger Mum, as I phoned round universities begging them for any space they might have available in any subject.His last few weeks at home were marred by arguments, sulks and door slamminghellipand not just by him. Dinner times were fractured by heated discussions ndash mainly about politics or what he was going to do with his le ndash that descended into full-blown rammies. I began to resent his youthful, mental agility ndash being able to pull facts from thin air to prove points and his steely determination to be heard and strike the winning riposte at the crucial moment. Asian Tiger Mum would never have countenanced this.So, what happened  Alongside my half-arsedness, there were other factors in the slaying of Asian Tiger Mum. Number one son was diagnosed with a rare condition called Chronic Repetitive Multocal Osteomyelitis , which caused painful lesions. There was stfness in his joints, and awkwardness in his gait. His handwriting was truly shocking, and I worried that examiners might not be able to read it, but I attributed that to the stfness. His Higher results were acceptable, but I could tell by his reaction that he was deflated. Tiger Mum was disappointed too, but priorities had shted, and I was simply relieved that the CRMO was easing. On his th birthday after watching him struggle to cut his birthday cake, I took him to an Occupational Therapist who told us he had Dyspraxia too. Dyspraxia, characterised by a lack of coordination, clumsiness and poor fine motor skills , helped him understand why it had all been a bit of a struggle, and it explained to me why he had refused to take part in sports, play any sort of instrument and struggled at PE.As for the wee one, Asian Tiger Mum was slayed by the sheer force of his personality. A non-compliant child from a young age, this child gleefully worked his way through a whole address book of childminders, until I finally had to leave my job and run a business from home to look after him. A child who, when I confiscated his phone when he was , wilfully gathered  of my mumrsquos old Encyclopaedia Britannicas so he could lsquoread about stuffrsquo because he couldnt get his fix of Wikipedia. This child was not going to let me sit alongside him as he studied, get a tutor or attend any clubs or activities.So, yes, le got in the way of me being the parent I wanted to be, and every once in a while, that irritates me, but then I think lsquoactually itrsquos all relativersquo. And whilst Asian Tiger Mum has been neutralised, shambolic Asian Tabby Mum looks around the empty nest and feels pretty chuffed."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10207527.jpg?type=article-full","title":"conference-ethos-built-preserving-history","story":"These traditional skills will be the focus as some of the worldrsquos foremost practitioners in traditional trades gather in Stirling today as the Engine Shed hosts the annual International Preservation Trades Workshop , this year with the theme of lsquoCrafting the Futurersquo, run in partnership with the Preservation Trades Network .Taking place outside of the US for the first time, the three-day conference will bring together building conservation specialists to share knowledge, skills and best practice across a range of fields, including stonemasonry, glasswork and woodwork.Among the speakers and demonstrators taking part in the event is historic preservation specialist Leslie Price, who will be leading a session on conservation and climate change.As part of the event, the Engine Shed will be opening its doors on Saturday, September th for a special discovery day, with family-friendly craft demonstrations and hands-on activities.See live blacksmithing from the Ratho Byres Forge blacksmiths, while carpenters from the American National Park Service will be showcasing their skills.

Other theories, such as that Nessie may be a giant catfish, a giant sturgeon, an eel or even a Greenland shark, which can live for up to  years, were also eliminated.The only possibility not ruled out by the research was that of a giant eel ndash perhaps explaining Nessiersquos looped shape in the popular imagination.The team found a very signicant amount of eel DNA in the lochrsquos deep waters.Mr Gemmell said: ldquoEels are very plentul in Loch Ness, with eel DNA found at pretty much every location sampled.So, are they giant eels  The DNA data doesnrsquot reveal their size, Prof Gemmell said, ldquobut the sheer quantity of the material says that we canrsquot discount the possibility that there may be giant eels in Loch Ness and what people see and believe is the Loch Ness Monster might be a giant eel.He added: ldquoDivers have claimed that theyrsquove seen eels that are as thick as their legs in the loch. There is a possibility that there are very large eels present in the loch.This could be the case even considering the size of some sightings ndash m He said further research was needed to test the theory.: DNA scientists - Loch Ness monsterstill plausibleThe Nessie myth dates back to the Sixth Century, with enthusiasts holding out hope that somehow the loch might be home to the last surviving plesiosaurs.Mr Gemmell added: ldquoWe canrsquot find any evidence of a creature thatrsquos remotely related to that. So, sorry, I donrsquot think the plesiosaur idea holds up.Another finding from the research was the high levels of DNA from land-based species in the loch, including humans, dogs and farm animals such as sheep and cattle. DNA from wild animals such as deer, badgers, foxes, rabbits, voles and multiple bird species was also found.The approach used by the New Zealand team could produce useful in other settings, Dr Gemmell said. ldquoWe now have an excellent database which,compared to any future testing, could enable us to identy trends and changes in the Loch environment.A documentary about the hunt for Nessiersquos DNA is due to air on the Discovery Channel on September .Reaction to the scientistsrsquo findings has ranged from delight at a distraction from the UKrsquos political chaos to dismay and refusal to accept the researchersrsquo findings.A Yougov poll last summer found one in seven people and one in four in Scotland said they believed the monster was real.Meanwhile, the legend unexpectedly trended on social media in July, when tens of thousands of people pledged to attend a ldquostorm Loch Ness event this month. ldquoShe canrsquot hide from all of us the organisers claimed, until the RNLI stated that ndash given the size of the loch and the potentially fatal temperature of its waters ndash ldquoshe probably could.A VisitScotland report last year claimed the Loch Ness Monster legend is worth nearly pound million a year to the Scottish economy."},{"url":null,"title":"north-coast-500-driver-jury-racism-claim","story":"Sherf Margaret Neilson was angered by comments -year-old engineering company boss Craig Coote made to social workers that the jury only convicted him because he was English and drove a Porsche.But she stopped short of jailing Coote because of the effect custody would have on his employees and family.

He may be polling only  per cent of the vote but Nigel Farage is open to an electoral pact. With that in place, then thanks to the hopelessly unrepresentative Westminster voting system, Mr Johnson could well win a thumping majority on well below  per cent of the popular vote.This might be fabulous news for the SNP, since Mr Johnson is the most effective recruiting sergeant theyrsquove ever had Sturgeon speeches could not, by pushing support for independence above  per cent.But for the wider rebel alliance seeking to prevent a hard Brexit, it is very challenging indeed. A Johnson win would undo all the unprecedented cross-party effort that has gone into trying to block a no-deal Brexit.The timing of an election has been much discussed, with Opposition parties more or less agreeing that they cannot allow a poll to take place before Boris Johnson has been forced to delay Brexit.But even , prior to the election, Mr Johnson had bowed to the demands of the Extension Bill and asked Brussels for a delay to Brexit , once elected he would most likely steer the country towards no-deal at the end of January instead of October.Of course he might be able to use those three months to negotiate a deal with the EU, but in spite of the Government spin suggesting that a deal is imminent, therersquos been precious little progress so far. Like a lazy child who insists hersquos nearly finished his homework when it lies untouched in his schoolbag, Mr Johnson has come up with nothing concrete yet to replace the Irish backstop, according to the EU, which is still waiting.So what can be done to prevent a hard Brexit  Mr Johnson must be kept out of Downing Street ndash which means Opposition parties forming an electoral pact.:Ian McConnell: No escape from Johnsonrsquos dire Brexit farce in Paris metro and airportNow, Irsquom not saying this will be easy.

The latest poll shows Labour on  per cent, the Lib Dems on  per cent and the Greens on five per cent, UK-wide. Add in a strong showing for the SNP and Plaid Cymru, and an anti-no deal majority is possible ndash but onlythe pro-Remain parties are prepared to work in concert.They did it in the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election, where the Greens and Plaid Cymru graciously stood aside to help the frontrunner Lib Dems win. Now the Lib Dems, Labour and the SNP must consider similar action.What are the other options  Try to force through a referendum bill  There wasnrsquot enough support for adding a referendum provision to the Extension Bill, so that looks unlikely. Get the Extension Bill through, then hold a no-confidence vote in Mr Johnson in order to create a government of national unity to seek a new deal on dferent terms which could then be put to a referendum  This is an appealing prospect andpoliticians were characters in a childrenrsquos TV drama, then we could trust them to come together like this ldquoin the national interest , but again, it would require trust across tribal lines and a willingness to suffer the brickbats such an arrangement would inevitably trigger. Jo Swinson has said Jeremy Corbyn could not lead such a government, since few Tories would back him, and she may be right, but thatrsquos not to say a compromise candidate couldnrsquot be found.An election, however, remains the most obvious way out of the impasse, so the Opposition parties must be ready.It has felt at times in the past few days asthe plot of a Simon Pegg movie is unfolding at Westminster, one where a crazy sect of androids has taken over the government and is ejecting respectable Tory pensioners onto College Green in the rain, dropping the torn fragments of their Conservative Party membership cards at their feet.

In this he displayed the utter ignorance of and insouciance of the Westminster elite to the reality of le beyond the Watford Gap and the societal changes brought about by years of deliberate austerity. This had compounded the wounds caused by the progressive deindustrialisation of the regions stemming from the time of Margaret Thatcher coupled with the centralisation of wealth and its means of creation in the south-east of England. Not only did Mr Cameron fail to appreciate that he could lose the referendum he had no plans in place to deal with this eventuality.The electorate faced a referendum based on what have subsequently proven to be  promises and non-existent prospectuses. So an internal dispute within one political party which currently only governs because of our archaic ldquofirst past the post electoral system and shady back room deals has been allowed to fracture a country.That we witness daily MPs, some of them Cabinet ministers, drawing lines in the sand only for the incoming tide of promotion and self-advancement to wash them away is revolting. Scottish Conservative MPs voting to support the interests of the party rather than those of the constituents who elected them is simply unsupportable as it is the antithesis of the basis of a representative democracy. The only positive we can take from the whole exercise is that it has clearly demonstrated that we cannot trust our politicians when they put party before country, tell barefaced lies, change their opinions to advance their careers and are willing to shut down Parliament to force a minority view on the country irrespective of the harm it will, not may, cause most of us.David J Crawford, Glasgow G.MUCH will be said in the coming days and weeks about David Mundell, the MP for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale who was also until recently Scotlandrsquos Secretary of State. As a resident of Dumfries and Galloway I am very aware that both the current Secretary of State Alistair Jack and David Mundell were elected in  to represent the residents of this county.Alistair Jack voted for keeping a No Deal Brexit as an option. Strangely, despite all the independent evidence that it would be disastrous for jobs, livelihoods and prices in the shops, he has always supported the No Deal option. Although he was voting against his constituentsrsquo wishes, at least you knew where you stood with Mr Jack and the voters of Dumfries and Galloway will have the choice at the next election to remove or keep him on as their representative.What about the Right Honourable David Mundell  ldquoRight certainly describes his political leanings but ldquoHonourable  On Tuesday, Mr Mundell voted to support Boris Johnsonrsquos option of a disastrous No Deal exit from the EU. However, in  he agreed with the wishes of his constituentsby saying publicly leaving the EU would be an absolute disaster for Scotland ldquo. More recently, this year he joined his party leader Ruth Davidson in totally denouncing the No Deal option and confirming he would not support a No Deal because of its devastating effect, not just on Scotland, but on the whole of the UK.Should we voters care about this apparent lapse of integrity when at least Ruth Davidson, as well as  Conservative MPs, including former Cabinet Members , decided to put the country and their own beliefs before the narrow interests of the extreme right-wing Johnson Government Mr Mundell failed this week in his duty to represent his constituents by voting against his own and their democratically-expressed beliefs. Many Conservative voters, as well as those from other parties, the non-aligned, and of course young first-time voters whose future rests on decisions taken by their representatives, looked on and noted how they will vote in the next Westminster election.S Campbell, Moffat.AS everyone knows, Scotland is a member of the United Kingdom and the UK in turn is a member of the European Union. Scotland is only a member of the EU due to our country being a part of the UK so this oft wrung-out overture that Scotland voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU is a misnomer or a red herring as someone of Ruth Marrrsquos intellect knows full well . The referendum on EU membership was a UK-wide vote not a nation by nation or region by region vote. She might as well claim that the workers in the local pie factory voted overwhelmingly to remain and that the workers behind the counter in the tuck shop voted to leave.I am fed up hearing from the likes of Ian Blackford, Nicola Sturgeon el al claim that Scotland is being dragged out of the EU against its will. When will they realise that this argument would only stack upScotland had sole membership of the European Union Christopher H Jones, Gfnock.WITH regard to the letterfrom Gordon Bannatyne, in which it is argued that Britain should have adopted a tough stance with the EU right from the start, it begs the question ndash why  It is the disunited UK that wants to leave, not the EU ejecting anyone. As for the question ldquohow did we manage before the EU was formed , there is a simple answer ndash ldquonot very well. I am old enough to remember the wonderful days when strikes were a weekly occurrence, lights went out or never went on, when the three-day-week was introduced, when there were few human rights, no wildle directives, fishing was a catastrophe with species like herring almost wiped out, and an assortment of other failures bestowed on us all from the elite Old-Etonian ruling classes of arrogant England. Not forgetting their appointees the unelected Lords. Yes ndash how did we manage  Thankfully after joining the EU, the eyes of Scots and others were opened and intelligent laws passed, farming brought into the th century, fishing quotas introduced internationally, manufacturing industries co-operating across borders, free movement of people, many useful and necessary roadworks and bridges financed from monies paid in to the EU that would never have been handed out to many areas in Scotland and where.Why also are the Brexiters so eager to leave the EU  The population of the UK is around  million, not the  million who voted to leave, meaning  million and the remaining millions eligible to vote, but who did not vote on a spurious right-wing pack of lies, require to remain.Bernard Zonfrillo, Glasgow.HOLYROOD is just not the same without Ruth Davidson. Already she is badly missed. The ongoing Brexit madness makes her loss even more acute.The first exchanges between the pompous and prickly First Minister and Jackson Carlaw were only a shadow of what we have come to expect from the forensic and palpably honest Ruth Davidson. She was the champion of not only the Tories but of truth and all Scots and alone among opponents of the SNP could cause fear in the nationalist ranks and puncture regularly a few overblown egos.Will you norsquo come back again, Ruth Alexander McKay, Edinburgh EH.I WOULD like to point out that an election date on the week beginning October  will disenfranchise many Scottish voters.This date falls during most Scottish school half-term holidays when many potential voters will be away from their local areas. It is unlikely that they will have the time to apply for a postal vote. This could have a signicant effect on the results in Scotland.Margaret McGregor, Aberdeen AB.MY mother had a saying she used to good effect. She had little time for people of some standing in the community who, when things were not to their liking, affected a pose of boredom at having to put up with the tiresome stupidity of his fellows. She would give a little shake of her head and in a brusque and dismissive tone of voice say, ldquo Hmph! The height of ignorance!. Remind you of anyone  It was extraordinarily effective in cutting the poseur down to size.A McDonald, Cambuslang.Agrave PROPOS Jacob Rees-Mogg lounging languidly like a lizard on the front benches, we should feel sorry for him ndash ruling st century Britain from the th century cannot be easy and having been nurtured from birth by an army of nannies must have taken its toll. Perhaps he was just waiting for his nanny to tuck him in and remove that silver spoon of his from his mouth in case he hurt himself in his slumber. But all is not lost, because\"sleeping like a Mogg\" passes into common parlance, then at least he will have served a purpose.P Fabien, Glasgow.RE the current Brexit-induced debate on sovereignty, it rests ultimately with the people, not Parliament. Otherwise there would be no need for elections Parliament would simply renew itself perpetually. No doubt the many anti-democrats at Westminster would welcome that.In other states constitutions the sovereignty of the people is explicit.

The society now also delivers animal welfare educational programmes, reaching more than , children in .So it’s fair to say that it has come a long way in the last  years.But for all the successes, there are also new issues it has to face – not least thanks to the advent of the internet.Mike explained: “For years, we have looked after all of Scotland’s animals – wild, farm and domestic.“Farming has come on leaps and bounds in the last few decades and we now have very few problems in the industry.“When I was a kid growing up, you used to have pet shops selling cats, dogs, budgies and the like.“Now, thanks to the internet, people have far more exotic animals in their care which all of our inspectors need to know how to care for and handle – from bearded dragons to massive boa constrictors!“We also have to contend with puppy farmers plying their trade online and selling puppies from car boots.“Some of the puppies die within a few days of people buying them, having paid a lot of money for the animal and thousands on vet fees.“Sadly, we also still see things that I saw  years ago such as Dobermans with every rib on their body sticking out.“However, thanks to our education programme, we are reaching the children of today who will be the animal lovers of the future.“And the majority of people our inspectors visit are not harming animals for fun – it’s a case of ignorance and neglect. In those cases, we’re not just helping the animals, but humans too.“Only five to ten per cent of cases every year are intentional cruelty. So Scotland is still a nation which, in the main, loves and cares for its animals.”That care and concern shines through as the public helps fund the SSPCA’s £ million budget annually.That covers the cost of  employees, including  inspectors,  ambulance drivers and the -strong team based at its nine centres across Scotland and its widle sanctuary.The society receives no government funding and relies solely on the public to fund its work.Mike added: “We are really lucky that, from a population of five and a half million, only  people were prosecuted last year for animal cruelty.“We will never be out of a job but the vast majority of people in Scotland are law abiding and animal loving.“And we couldn’t do what we do without their support.”In December, the Society plans to launch celebrations to commemorate the th anniversary that will run throughout .Anyone with interesting anecdotes or memorabilia they’d like to share should get in touch via its website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.The SSPCA is the only animal charity in the UK able to report animal cruelty cases to the Crown, with reports sent to the Procurator Fiscal Service. The charity receives no government funding and relies on donations and grants to continue its work, which costs £ million each year.In , it found homes for  rescued animals, helped more than  wildle casualties and spoke to more than , children.For every pound it receives, p is spent on animal welfare, p on fundraising and promotion and p on administration.So you can rest assured that the bulk of any donation you make will make a huge dference to the animals in the SSPCA’s care.Last year, its animal helpline received almost a quarter of a million calls, the inspectorate attended more than , incidents and more than , animals were cared for across its nine rescue and rehoming centres and at the national wildle rescue centre.

The judges have a hard task ahead of them.The quality of the albums featured reflects the strength and breadth of the Scottish music industry it is home to creativity that for decades has produced globally recognised artists. Its cultural importance is matched by its economic importance, and it is only right that we take this opportunity to recognise not just those competing for the SAY Award, but all of those that work for and support Scottish music.: Shortlist for  Scottish Album of the Year revealedFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereAccording to the most recent report from Creative Scotland, the music industry employs over , people in nearly  businesses. This accounts for almost  per cent of the country’s creative and cultural employment. The Scottish public also shows a marked commitment to music consumer spending on recorded music is above the UK average, and the country accounts for a greater share of the UK’s live music revenue than its population suggests it should. In the SSE Hydro, Scotland also has the fourth most popular live music arena in the world.This passion and the music it creates deserves support. As the UK’s licensing company for more than , performers and record companies, PPL works to offer this by ensuring that those who perform on or own the rights to a recording receive the royalties they are due when it is played on TV, radio or in public.We have more than , members in Scotland, a membership which includes artists releasing their first demos session musicians, orchestral performers, independent record labels, and renowned festival headliners. We are here to support those artists and record labels from the very start of their career all the way through to their highest heights.This is especially important in Scotland, where  per cent of music businesses have a turnover of under £ million and  per cent have fewer than  employees. These are enterprises that are embedded within and contributing to their local communities. Each source of income for these businesses can be crucial to their success.

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree. I would hope local people can support it in any way they can.#The Skye Live festival runs from Thursday th until Saturday th September.

On Friday , Mrs Steenson received a call informing her that no bus was available due and mix-up between the EA and the transport provider. Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Mrs Steenson said she had “issue after issue” during the summer months due to their errors.“My experience of it is that the Education Authority has a lot of people off sick, they are understaffed and there is a lot of pressure, and there just isn’t enough transport places available for the kids that need them. There are children being let down, and for us personally, it’s just not doable. We both work, and it’s an hour-and-a-half to get down to Fleming and back up again, so to do that while working and bringing our other child to school is impossible.”She continued: “This week we have been very lucky that my work has been flexible and allowed me to take some times, but that’s not sustainable. I hope that her transport can get organised very very quickly so that she can go to school. We have prepared her for going on the bus or getting in a taxi and she’s wondering why it’s not happening – it’s confusing for her.”She added: “I don’t know what we’re going to do. It’ll be very stressful. There’ll probably be days where she can’t make it in because we can’t get transport. I might have to take more time off or my husband might have to.”Despite complaints from parents, the Education Authority has said there has been no reduction to transport services.A spokesperson for the Education Authority , said: “EA provides transport assistance to over , children every day, including , children with Statement of Special Educational Need.“We remain committed to ensuring that all necessary arrangements are in place ahead of the new school year.“In this case, EA’s transport service provision has been maintained and there has been no reduction to services at either school. Where parents are experiencing any issue with their child’s school transport we would encourage and advise them to call their local school transport office, which can be accessed by calling the EA Transport enquiries line   .”"},{"url":null,"title":"sign up for our weekly brexit newsletter","story":"Your browser is outdated, it may not render this page properly, please upgrade.Select any of your favourite newsletters and get them delivered straight to your inbox||||Main Area|Daily News Headlines - checkbox|Pos[:]|\"type\"checkbox\" name\"newsletters\" id\"f-newsletters-BT_DailyNews\" value\"BT:DailyNews\" class\"tick-a\"  Daily News Headlines Daily News from belfasttelegraphPreview Subscribe||||Main Area|Weekly Business Digest - checkbox|Pos[:]|\"type\"checkbox\" name\"newsletters\" id\"f-newsletters-BT_WeeklyBusiness\" value\"BT:WeeklyBusiness\" class\"tick-a\"  Weekly Business Digest Weekly Business Digest from belfasttelegraphPreview Subscribe||||Main Area|BelfastTravel - checkbox|Pos[:]|\"type\"checkbox\" name\"newsletters\" id\"f-newsletters-BT_Travel\" value\"BT:Travel\" class\"tick-a\"  BelfastTravel Travel news headlines and offers directly to your inbox.

He said of Northern Ireland that the people were British, but the cattle were Irish.\"And in that idea there is the germ of a solution to the question of frictionless movement across the Northern Irish border.\"We do want to minimise all theoretical checks as well as practical checks.\"We think all practical checks can of course be taken away from the border theres no need...\"And the UK will not be instituting any border checks of any kind in Northern Ireland.\"We also think there is scope for recognition of the practical reality on the ground in the agri-food sector in Northern Ireland.\"Whether that could be extended to other sectors \"depends entirely on democratic control by the people of the United Kingdom\".Rev Paisleys reference to cows here being Irish were first revealed by Jonathan Powell, a former adviser to Tony Blair during the peace talks that led to the Good Friday Agreement.He wrote: \"The border between Ireland and the UK just came to mean much less once we were both in the EU.\"This was particularly brought home to me when Ian Paisley, the fire-breathing DUP leader, came to see Tony Blair in the midst of the  Foot and Mouth crisis in the UK and in an attempt to take advantage of the looser restrictions on movement of cattle in the south than in the north said, Our people may be British but our cows are Irish.\"Mr Johnsons reference to Rev Paisley - later Lord Bannside - will be seen as an attempt to ameliorate DUP concerns, as the proposal appears to cross the DUPs red line of having a border in the Irish Sea. data-dfpadtargetingTaoiseach Leo VaradkarBut in an apparent softening of its position, DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds has said his party is open to discussions with Mr Johnson on a possible all-Ireland food standards zone as part of a solution to the Brexit backstop.A dossier drawn up for the Government has described an all-island economy for food and agricultural products as the \"most practical\" and \"deliverable\" alternative to the backstop.The secret papers prepared for Mr Johnson show the best substitute for the backstop is broadly similar to what is currently on the table - and would create a regulatory barrier between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Dated August  and marked \"official-sensitive\", the document said \"regulatory alignment\" between Northern Ireland and the Republic would be the most likely way of breaking the current impasse.The document was prepared for the EU Exit Negotiations Board and sets out a timeline for the UK to actually produce alternative ideas to the backstop.Meanwhile, in the Commons, DUP deputy leader Mr Dodds welcomed \"remarks of the Foreign Minister of the Irish Republic yesterday in which indicated that in the event of a no-deal there will be no checks or infrastructure at the border\".\"Thats very, very welcome - we should build on that, in that there is room for progress to get a deal, which we all want.\"Elsewhere, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said talks on the backstop should be the easiest part of the Brexit process, ahead of a showdown with Mr Johnson.Mr Varadkar has indicated he will not be in a compromising mood when the Prime Minister goes to Dublin on Monday.Irish officials are confident the meeting will go ahead despite Mr Johnsons plan to try to collapse his own Government that evening. But the Taoiseach has sought to turn up the pressure on his counterpart, saying he will not allow the UK to \"merely kick the can down the road\".\"A Withdrawal Agreement without the backstop is no good to us,\" Mr Varadkar told the British Irish Chamber of Commerce last night.He hopes Mr Johnson will bring genuine proposals to Farmleigh House - but added that in any event \"there is no such thing as a clean break\".The Prime Ministers priority now appears to be convincing parliament to sanction an election on October .He claimed legislation which forces him to seek a delay to Brexit has \"absolutely torpedoed\" his negotiating position.Despite MPs coming together to block a disorderly Brexit, the Irish Governments assessment is that no-deal remains the most likely outcome.Signicantly, Mr Varadkar said last night that this would result in checkpoints \"near the border\". Previously the Irish Government has refused to go further than to say checks would be \"away\" from the border.Ministers are wary of the motivations behind Mr Johnsons trip to Dublin given he has stated the negotiations cannot proceed without a UK election first.However, ministers are keen for the meeting to take place so that Mr Varadkar can personally reiterate a willingness to work with the UKthey produce workable alternatives to the backstop."},{"url":null,"title":"peers approve bid to prevent government forcing through nodeal brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Their address is listed as  Parnell Square, which is the partys headquarters in Dublin.It was outlined in Mr Hamptons will that the money was to be used to cover election expenses, to fund Sinn Fein offices and advice centres, and to aid republican prisoners and their families in both Ireland and Britain.Mr Hamptons will stated: \"In the event that the organisation which is now known as Sinn Fein should cease to be in existence or should have split or taken a dferent name at the date of death then I direct that my executors and trustees are to apply my monies to the political party to which Mr Gerry Adams MP then belongs.\"\"Should Mr Adams pre-decease me or not be a member of any political party at the date of my death then I direct that my executors and trustees shall apply my monies to the republican or nationalist political party in the six counties, other than the SDLP, which has the largest number of elected councillors.\"Mr Hamptons donation was made public on Thursday by the Electoral Commission.A Probate Registry of Wales document confirms that when he died on January , , at a nursing home in Pembrokeshire, Mr Hampton left an estate in the UK worth £,,.However, at the time of writing his will in , he was living in a mobile home in Ireland.

We worked with Nerve Visual to bring two of our most impactful exhibitions from the Ulster Museum to Derry.”The exhibitions referred to are Silent Testimony and Art of the Troubles. “Derry needs this gallery!” she added.The Nerve Centre reopened the former Turner Prize gallery space as Nerve Visual in June  when it was lauded as a “major new venue for visual arts in the Northern Ireland”.A spokesperson for the Nerve Centre said it has received no core funding and was programmed and funded on a project by project basis.In just over three years it has hosted  successful exhibitions.However, writer and art critic Dominic Kearney said he couldn’t understand why it was so poorly attended, particularly as the Turner Prize was such a success at the same location.Nerve Visual only took over a section of the Creative Hub Building   in  but during the City of Culture year in  the same gallery space hosted the prestigious Turner Prize - one of the best-known visual arts prizes in the world.Mr Kearney believes the location is “terric” and “exactly” what Ebrington needs. “The space is perfect for a gallery and the exhibitions that they had there were very impressive.“The Troubles Art exhibition, Future Artist Makers and the Colin Davidson one was stunning, I’d hesitate to say beautul given the nature of its subject, but it was incredibly powerful.“It’s the only gallery that’s open to the public in Derry that deals with mainstream, accessible, representational art. For this to close is really going to detract from the local art scene, from Ebrington, the Waterside and Derry as a whole. Like a pebble dropped in a pond, the ripple effect will spread out from that building to the outer ring of the entire city.”He added: “It’s such a shame, in six years it’s gone from hosting the most prestigious modern art competition in UK to a couple of empty rooms.“People can only have so many cups of coffee, tourists need something to do when visiting the city. If there was a gallery dedicated to Irish art with links to galleries in Dublin, the Ulster Museum, and maybe Britain. Tourists would definitely want to go there as galleries are the type of thing people look for.”‘Massive draw’Local artists were regularly showcased at the Nerve Visual gallery.Stephen Lewis has lived in Derry for over  years, he’s an artist based at Bishop Street Studios who also works with the arts charities Creative Village Arts and ArtLink at Fort Dunree. He expressed his “disappointment” at the gallery’s closure.“There have been recent initiatives by the Nerve Visual, Tower Museum and An Culturalann to give folk here a chance to see art that is held in their own national collections - but it simply goes back to the inability to keep a space that is equipped to do this open.“People in the North West should not have to travel to Belfast to see their own art - The Ulster Museum often has  or  art exhibitions on at any one time - we built a world class gallery in  and we really should demand that this becomes our space to see our own art collections - properly advertised it could be a massive draw for locals and tourists alike.\"It’s understood there will be plenty of people interested in taking over occupancy of the building but at this stage it is unclear what will be based there.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"magnificent moon monty cracking cornish sunset super images powys county times camera club members","story":"Moonshine over the Mpontgomery War Memorial from David Lister.\" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetA Buff tailed bumbleebee on Cosmos from Lizzie Wood.\" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetA frog in my wildle garden, says Lizzie Wood. \" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetA beautul Cornish sunset as sent in by Paul Hanrahan.\" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetA beautul Cornish sunset as sent in by Paul Hanrahan.\" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetA duck along the canal from Robin Bridgen.\" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetA dragonfly at Llandrindod Wells lakeside from Laura Shepherd.\" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetA beautul Cornish sunset as sent in by Paul Hanrahan.\" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetSunrise over Newtown from Robin Bridgen.\" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetThe Royal Welsh may be gone, says Steven Derek, but this is still worth posting.\" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetDferent birds, dferent wire says Toni Mannell with reference to her earlier ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtposting.lt spangtlt spangt\" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetMore fun with fungi on the Rainbow Walks near Llangadfan from Toni Mannell.\" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetNot all Montgomery visitors are human - bugs enjoying our herb garden, says Daviltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtd Wilson.lt spangtlt spangt\" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetCamera club\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"elan show one best","story":"The championship in the terrier section went to Jason Davies of Pantydwr with Toltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtnic.

There is a parking area at the rear with spaces for around  vehicles andthese are lost what happens, especially during the summer months when the villagersquos popular Youth League is in full flow, said one community official.ldquoLocal people have been using the property for around  years and we would very much like church officials to consider donating it to them so they can take it over and work with others to manage the running costs.Community officials say there was a need for a dedicated indoor community facility in Crossgar which would meet the needs of many groups and organisations.The added ldquoplans for a major new sports complex unveiled a number of years never came to fruition and were unlikely to in the future.Officials believe thatthe Downpatrick Street building was donated to the people of the village, its future as a community base could potentially be guaranteed.Community officials insist that one of their key priorities is looking after Crossgar Youth League which continues to go from strength to strength and also uses the car park at the rear of the building to store equipment.ldquoIt is no onersquos fault that the Downpatrick Street building is being sold. If there are concerns around its running costs why doesnrsquot the parish come and talk to us and give us the opportunity to work alongside others and take it over  suggested one community official.ldquoThere was a major push to open this building many years ago and a lot of public money was invested in it. The property is critical to the success of the Crossgar Youth League and is an enormous community benefit. It is the best thing we have in the village.ldquoThe loss of the building would have an enormous impact on the Youth League and indeed the Crossgar community. There is potential to do so much with the property and we hope it is not lost to the people of the village.

Existing paths will also be upgraded.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker mdash who has been lobbying for the existing pedestrian crossing to be upgraded mdash is delighted that it is finally going to happen.ldquoThe scheme has been included in the Department for Infrastructurersquos programme and will be installed as pat of the forthcoming environmental improvement scheme, he explained.ldquoI am delighted that after years of lobbying, this much-needed scheme is finally now in the programme and will be delivered. I hope that it will be delivered as soon as possible, given the huge volume of traffic which passes through the centre of the town each day.Cllr Walker said a number of traffic surveys have been carried out over the years to determine the need for an upgraded crossing and is pleased that one is finally going to be delivered and will be paid for by the Department for Infrastructure.ldquoThe importance of this puffin crossing cannot be highlighted enough, he continued. ldquoThe new crossing will see the provision of Killyleaghrsquos first set of traffic lights which in itself is signicant. The traffic lights will ensure drivers come to a complete halt while people are crossing.Cllr Walker said a number of people using the existing pedestrian crossing were hit by cars, while there were ldquocountless near misses.ldquoWhen people press the button on the new puffin crossing, traffic will stop immediately to allow them to cross safely. My thanks go to roads officials for finally agreeing that an upgraded crossing is necessary, he continued.ldquoThe biggest concern many in Killyleagh have is the speed of vehicles approaching Catherine Street from the Comber direction. The new puffin crossing will address this issue at what is a particularly busy main street which is notoriously dficult to cross, even with the presence of the current crossing.Cllr Walker said people need to be able to bring traffic to a halt so they can cross in safety. He is also delighted with the planned environmental improvement scheme and has no doubt it will have a positive impact on the town centre.He added: ldquoA number of similar schemes carried out in other towns and villages across the district have had a signicant impact, helping restore pride and encouraging businesses and residents to spruce up their respective premises.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed the council was developing proposals to bring forward seven environmental improvement schemes across the district, one of which is proposed for Killyleagh.ldquoIt is anticipated that this will include upgrade works to pathways, street lighting and street furniture, he explained.ldquoImplementation of the works is however subject to planning approval and the council being successful in an application for funding to the Rural Development Programme.

But he conceded that theof -hour AE services may be dficult.Mr McGoran was invited to address the Down Community Health Committee and said it was important that the South Eastern Trust was having a conversation with campaigners who are keen to continue discussions with officials to ensure the retention of existing services and the delivery of enhanced provision moving forward.Over previous years, relations between both organisations was particularly fraught at times and while they did not always see eye to eye, Mr McGoran hopes they can now move forward together.He said he had ldquonothing but respect for the Down community because local people cared about their health and social care services, committing time and energy to make sure the area gets the best provision it can.ldquoThis is not always obvious everywhere in Northern Ireland, Mr McGoran continued. ldquoYou have been at this for a long time and I have no doubt that without your campaigning work we would not have some of the things we have in this organisation today. I am also not sure that we would have the Downe Hospital.ldquoYour contribution and those who went before you has been fundamental in keeping this area in the spotlight, fighting ultimately for your services. I take my hat off to you. The Downe is here to stay and we have a fantastic facility and there are no staff better. In fact, we have incredible staff who work right across the organisation.Mr McGoran said that while administrators and campaigners may not have always agreed in the past about how the health trust did things, he suggested they all had the same aim mdashwanting the best health and social care that could be delivered, sometimes within challenging resources.Looking to the future, the health chief referred to an ongoing review of emergency care which has resulted in the group overseeing the exercise visiting the Downe and meeting with senior health officials.ldquoI do envisage that there is going to be further change for emergency medicine but when I was asked the question what did I think about the future of the service at the Downe, Ulster and Lagan Valley hospitals in  yearsrsquo time, I could not really answer that, explained Mr McGoran.ldquoI was prepared to say what it would be like in five yearsrsquo time, but could not look beyond that. A five year vision is really something that you can get a hold of and we made it clear to those in charge of the review that the emergency care model we have in place at the Downe will be here in five yearsrsquo time.Mr McGoran said the health trust was on record with the Department of Health during the early stages of the current engagement that it still sees the current model at the Downe comprising the emergency department, out of hours GP service and weekend nurse-led minor injuries unit remaining in place.ldquoWe will still have acute beds in the Downe and it will deal with medically unwell patients. All of the current infrastructure we have will remain in place and our vision is to expect these to remain in place for the next five years, he confirmed.Mr McGoran said the one caveat was that it remained to be seen what the Department of Health will do with the information it has been provided with in relation to the future of emergency care, suggesting serious conversations about the way forward have only just begun.He added: ldquoThere is work ongoing and at some point there may be a consultation exercise. I do not know where all this is going to go and it is a bit early to speculate.Community Health Committee chairman Eamonn McGrady welcomed the health officialrsquos ldquoconstructive and honest engagement with campaigners.He said: ldquoWe need to go forward in a partnership, but that does not mean that we will always agree. Our community supports the Downe Hospital and also the centres of excellence in the bigger hospitals that our delivering our health needs.ldquoBut we need as much care as possible provided as locally as possible, safely and well adequately resourced in a brilliant building.Mr McGrady added: ldquoI hope that in five yearsrsquo time we will be looking at a very major extension at the Downe and a major increase in capacity.

Then we heard noises from a cabin mdash and found Suki mothering three new kittens.ldquoUnfortunately, we had to have the three kittens put down and Suki neutered. And then when our two tom cats took a dislike to Suki we were forced to appeal for a home for her.Mrs Owens added: ldquoThe response was overwhelming and the first of many callers took Suki away. My husband, Jim, and I will be ing to our caravan at Ardtole, near Ardglass, this weekend. We hope we donrsquot find any more animals in distress!DOWNPATRICK mdash Downpatrickrsquos new maternity hospital, which is due to replace the Hardy Greer House unit early in the New Year, will not become fully operational until staffing dficulties can be resolved.It is expected that an advertising campaign is to be mounted shortly for all grades of staff required in the bright, new up-to-date hospital.The -bed unit in the grounds of the Downshire Hospital will require up to % more midwery staff than the -bed Hardy Greer House on the Strangford Road, which seems to be permanently under-staffed and struggling along.The new unit will also accommodate an out-patient centre which will mean the transfer of ante-natal and post-natal work which is currently conducted at Downe Hospital.The expected completion date for the new building is November. It is already a couple of months behind schedule because of a host of supply dficulties, the cement strike among them.Once it is handed over it will have to be equipped and sterilised before it can be commissioned. That could take a couple of months.BALLYNAHINCH mdash The September Flower Show organised by the Presbyterian Womenrsquos Association connected to st Ballynahinch Presbyterian Church proved to be a huge success.The Huston Hall was crammed full of baking, handiwork, flowers and vegetables.

This was foreseen in the design of St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse where there is excellent lantern sidewall and cowling ventilation in a tower  feet above the ground in this remote location. There is little hazard from the liquid mercury since it is not readily absorbed dermally.Campaigners have suggested that it would be interesting to see CILrsquos lighthouse keeper health monitoring records for mercury covering the past  years and more when the lighthouse was manned and used the present system. They also said it would be interestingto see the training records for keepers in safe mercury handling during all these years. ldquoPresumably, these would have been managed by independent bodies of experts since the Commissioners probably didnrsquot previously have and donrsquot today have any toxicological experts on your permanent payroll, says the campaigners letter.Another area of concern highlighted is the poor state of the lighthouse, including adjoining housing which a delegation from the Commissionerrsquos office recently visited.Campaigners point to the ldquolamentable state of the walls of the lighthouse station and the grounds, suggesting that they present a picture of ldquowoeful neglect and asking how CIL can expect the public to be impressed with a lack of basic asset maintenance.The letter highlights that the current Fresnel lens system turns  hours a day and is clearly visible from the road outside the lighthouse station.Campaigners say this in itself is a visual attraction during daylight hours ldquosince the magnicent large lens system is big enough to be seen turning on itrsquos mercury bearing and is even more magnicent at night.The letter continues: ldquoWe believe that CIL will miss a tremendous opportunity to preserve this lighthouse and its sweeping beamyou persist with your alternative bearing plans. The whole lighthouse station could become part of a wider tourist attraction in the area. Future generations will thank you for retaining the current historic beam system, still going smoothly after  years and showing no signs of obsolescence. You have not made an economic case for change of lens system at St Johnrsquos Point as far as we know and it is dficult to see how you can.ldquoWhat happens at the lighthouse remains the focus of keen and widespread local and political interest in this area and we will ensure this continues to be a high-profile local issue.The letter adds: ldquoLecale Lightkeepers are willing to fully support CIL and others in any preservation programme that involves retaining the sweeping beam. However, we reject the idea that the use of mercury in this lens bearing application represents a health hazard that cannot be managed by a sensible, low-cost maintenance programme involving chiefly adequate ventilation. This has always have been the case anyway..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th September 2019 new.jpg","title":"New sponsorship page for Newcastle League cups  ","story":"THE Newcastle League has released details of a lucrative sponsorship deal with NFU Mutual.The home, business and motor insurance company, who have local offices in Downpatrick, Ballynahinch and Saintfield, have agreed to sponsor both the Bobby Dalzell Cup and Harry Clarke Cup.Details of the sponsorship were announced at the draw for the first round of the Bobby Dalzell Cup in Downpatrick last Thursday night.A delighted Newcastle League secretary said: We are thrilled that the NFU have agreed to sponsor our two main cup competitions for this season as well as taking up the option on any further sponsorship, he enthused.Downpatrick NFU branch manager Johnny McGreevy said the company was delighted to be able to support local sport.ldquoThe league has been a vital part of the local community for over  years and are known for their integrity and fairness, he said.ldquoAs a long-standing local business these are qualities we appreciate and reflect in our own activities.The draw for the first round of the Bobby Dalzell Cup, to be played on Saturday, September , is as follows:Kilmore Rec II v Castlewellan Forest, Saintfield United III v Valley Rangers Colts, Drumaness Mills Reserves v Ballynahinch United Swts, Ballyvea II v Ballyhalbert United, Tollymore Forest v Ballynahinch Young Men, Strangford v Dromara Village II.The draw for the second round was also made last week and is:Ardglass v Drumaness Mills Reserves or Ballynahinch United Swts, Rossglass County v Kilmore Rec II or Castlewellan Forest, Dundrum United v Ballynagross, Ballynahinch Olympic Town v Strangford or Dromara Village III, Carryduff Athletic v Saintfield United III or Valley Rangers Colts, Newcastle Swts v Mourne Rovers, Ballyvea II or Ballyhalbert United v Tollymore Forest or Ballynahinch Young Men, Celtic Bhoys v Killough..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th September 2019 Schoolboy.jpg","title":"Schoolboy motors his way into national driving competition final  ","story":"NEWCASTLE youth Evan Biggerstaff has made his way into the final of a national driving competition mdash despite being four years away from allowed to drive legally.The  year-old, who attends Shimna Integrated College, will be one of  finalists in his age category at the Young Driver Challenge .He is the first ever competitor from Northern Ireland to make the final which will be at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham where they will be crowned Britainrsquos best young driver by TV presenters and motoring experts Quentin Willson and Vicki Butler Henderson.All the competitors are under the legal driving age but the aim of the event is reinforce safe driving in prospective drivers at a young age.Pupils drive dual controlled Vauxhall Corsas on private land with a fully qualied instructor and learn the skills needed to be a safe and responsible driver.Despite ranging in age from just  to , all of the drivers have shown exceptional skill.The challenge is run by Young Driver, the UKrsquos largest provider of pre- driving lessons.Evan has had lessons at the Young Driverrsquos Belfast venue mdash one of more than  across the UK.He said: ldquoDriving is a skill that is, for most people, completely necessary in le but most people learn how to do it at  or older, so to have it nearly mastered by , I think will come in really useful later in my le.ldquoIrsquove always loved driving and didnrsquot think I was too bad at it for my age but I never suspected I would be ranked in the top  in the entire UK for my age group.

If we ever have to renew the battle with the IRA, we shall do so from a position less favourable than that of August . If we merely have to maintain our position, we are liable to suffer increasing casualties and to be forced to employ not only greater numbers of soldiers but also higher degrees of force merely to maintain that position.”.ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button He went on: “If I am right, and we want a lasting solution, it must lie in finding a way in which HMG can gradually escape from the commitment to the border. The answer appears to lie with the plebiscite.“It would have to be organised in such a way that it shows up the inequity of the existing border and leads to the situation which Lloyd George persuaded Arthur Grfiths and Michael Collins that it wouldie. one in which it made no sense for Belfast, Co Down and Co Antrim to remain separate.“If this radical view is accepted, political discussions to erect a new Stormont or something in its place are a waste of time. Discussions, whether arising from an end to violence, a truce or a failure of the present policy, should centre on the plebiscite.”Another solider, David Hancock, said that when loyalists attacked the Army on the Shankill Road “it was the first time that any of us...had been fired at by people carrying the Union Jack.

Image: BBC SpotlightAlthough it has long been known that Mr McGuinness was an IRA commander, he refused to discuss his actions in the organisation and insisted that he had never killed anyone.The images will be broadcast next Tuesday in the first part of one of BBC Northern Ireland’s most ambitious projects, a two-year re-examination of the Troubles which will run over seven programmes. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button The first programme in the series also includes a former colonel saying that he was shown evidence by the RUC that Ian Paisley, the future First Minister, had supplied the money for explosives which caused one of the first explosions of the Troubles.The rare footage of an IRA car bomb being assembled was filmed in Londonderry in the early years of the Troubles.During the programme, former IRA bomber Shane Paul O’Doherty commentated on the pictures, saying: “There’s a huge charge there. A very dangerous alarm clock timer that could blow them all to hell.”When asked who he recognised, he said: “Well, there’s Martin....Martin McGuinness.” Mr O’Doherty said he was certain that it was the future deputy First Minister, saying “nobody walks like him, with a stoop in his back”.The car containing the bomb could be identied by its number plate. The BBC programme includes footage of the bomb exploding  minutes later in the centre of Mr McGuinness’s home city, Londonderry.The day after the bombing, Northern Ireland Prime Minister Brian Faulkner was brought to London to be told that security powers would be removed from Stormont and taken on by Westminster, leading to the collapse of Stormont.The Spotlight programme also includes footage of Mr McGuinness showing guns to young children and handing them bullets while seated in a car.Commentating on the film pictures, Mr O’Doherty said: “It’s Martin McGuinness. Very young, tall, handling weapons – a rle and a revolver – rolling up to a load of kids who are staring in the windows, craning in the windows and showing them bullets.“It’s horric, really, because here was McGuinness showing eight, nine and -year-olds guns and bullets that were exciting. People had a feeling that you were on television, you know, you were superstars.”Police had evidence Ian Paisley paid for Troubles bombing, says ex-colonel Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The programme does not explain the background to the footage. However, Spotlight reporter Darragh MacIntyre said that it would be made clear in a future film in the series.He said that it had been shot by an American documentary maker and was never broadcast.Mr McIntyre, the reporter who in  exposed the then DUP MP Iris Robinson’s affair and financial dealings with property developers, said that the  footage “speaks to a time when within Free Derry and where in the north there was a sense that the IRA had it won, that they were the original guerrilla fighters and within a matter of months would see their way to a new united Ireland...so they were quite free - not just Martin McGuinness - when they were filming with this documentary team”.In , Mr McGuinness told the journalist Eamonn Mallie that he was “very proud that I was a part of the IRA in Derry” but declined to say whether he had ever killed anyone.Last month, former IRA member Kieran Conway said that as the IRA’s chief of staff at the time of the attack which killed Lord Mountbatten and others, including two children, Mr McGuinness had to “take responsibility” for what had happened that day.Another former IRA man, Anthony McIntyre, said of that attack: “If they knew about the children, and were quite prepared to go ahead and to sacrice their lives in order to get Mountbatten, then it’s a war crime”.However, Sinn Féin MLA and former IRA man Raymond McCartney denounced such criticism of Mr McGuinness, saying that he was “held in the highest of esteem across Ireland and internationally”.The Foyle MLA said: “It is reprehensible that anyone would make unfounded allegations against a man who is no longer here to defend himself.”Spotlight on The Troubles – a Secret History involve two -minute programmes and five hour-long episodes. The series has been overseen by editor Jeremy Adams, deputy editor Gwyneth Jones and producer Chris Thornton. It involves three senior Spotlight reporters – Darragh MacIntyre, Jenner O’Leary and Mandy McAuley.The first programme will be broadcast on BBC One NI on Tuesday at .pm and will also be shown on BBC Four across the UK at the same time.try catch  TrendingNI man killed in road crash is namedTransfer Deadline Day RECAP: Rangers confirm pound.m Ryan Kent signing from Liverpool, Celtic sign three,

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

out how much it costs  ","story":"Do you want to complain about a neighbour#s high hedge  It#s going to cost you five times more in the Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Council area.That’s £ - five times more than any other area in NI, says AllianceCllr Eóin Tennyson.Cllr Tennysonsays the Council must make it easier for people to deal with high hedges.He said: “As it stands, where mediation fails in dealing with concerns around high hedges – which can often be a real nuisance and source of frustration and stress for people affected – raising an official complaint in the ABC area costs up to five times more than other areas in NI.“Often people dealing with high hedge disputes have no choice but to make an official complaint, which is why it is dficult to comprehend why ABC Council insists on charging applicants £ – adding financial strain to an already stressful situation.“While the fee is ed to the applicantthe complaint is upheld, this is still a large outlay which can be prohibitive for residents seeking resolution to a problem that has often been lingering for some time.“The fee is set by Councils, so while in other areas like Derry and Strabane Council it costs £ to pursue a complaint, I must question why the fee is so excessive for people to access the same service in the ABC area.“That’s why we are not only calling for a review of the costs of high hedge complaints in ABC Council, but have urged officers to advance the development of a mediation toolkit or resource to help resolve a greater number of disputes at an earlier stage.”A Council spokesperson said: “The matter of high hedges was raised at this week’s Environmental Services Committee. It was agreed that a report, which would include how the fee was set within the framework of the council’s fee setting policy and the investigation process, would be brought to next month’s Environmental Services Committee.”Princess Charlotte arrives for first day of school - accompanied by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID

We speak to founder Daniel Crawford and his team about the journey so far A spark in the mind of Daniel Crawford as he studied for his masters degree in Glasgow just a few years ago has grown into a business at the sharp end of technology. axialD is tasked with turning the complicated and laborious process of converting D medical scans into D models – and producing them for use by surgeons and medical professionals. It’s an ever-growing business, spun out of Ulster University, which is expanding its reach across the UK, Ireland and now into the US where it’s targeting a burgeoning fresh marketplace. The company has been involved with Catalyst since , been directly involved with a host of its programmes, and is participating in the EU INTERREG funded North West Centre for Advanced Manufacturing , managed by the Special European Union Programmes Body . Catalyst is Northern Ireland’s leading technology hub, home to  companies and around , staff. Daniel has a strong team around him – growing to  staff based in Belfast city centre, including Niall Haslam, chief technology officer, Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships and Cathy Coomber as operations manager. While studying medical visualisation and human anatomy in Glasgow, Daniel was exposed to the raft of imaging available – including CT, MRI and ultrasound, and began examining how the crucial data could be better used. The biomedical physics undergraduate grew the idea into his thesis – looking at converting D data sets and converting them into fully D printable files. “That allows us to turn images into D models to allow surgeons or registrars, to understand digital pathologies, before going in to theatre,” he said. “But we discovered it wasn’t just good for that and surgeons also wanted to get their hands on the D models.” That gave Daniel greater scope for developing the concept. In one early case, a surgeon was able to use one of the D prints to identy small fractures in a patient who had suffered a motorcycle crash, that weren’t initially apparent using more traditional methods. The company was thrust into Catalyst’s Springboard programme in  – a  week scheme which allowed a would-be entrepreneur, fresh out of university, access to business training and development, which included working with PathXL’s Stuart Harvey. From there, it was into the Halo programme – bringing axialD together with angel investors in order to get the start-up off the ground. It landed £, through Techstart and private investors, which allowed the company to get the ball rolling. Through Catalyst, Daniel also got the opportunity to visit MIT and the entrepreneurial development programme, Way to Scale, bringing axialD to Massachusetts and the Boston area – the global heart of the health technology sector. Niall Haslam is axialD’s chief technical officer. He said a Belfast and Boston partnership has helped strengthen the links between the cities, bringing firms from Northern Ireland to the US for both networking and scoping out the potential for setting up shop across the Atlantic. “The Way to Scale program brings entrepreneurs together. It’s a great networking opportunity,” Niall says. axialD is now a partner in the EU INTERREG-funded NW CAM, which brings together a network of research institutes, universities and enterprises to carry out research in advanced manufacturing. It is working with Ulster University on a number of projects, including looking at developing custom designed jigs for hospitals to produce D models. Cathy Coomber has been with axialD for three years. “What we have done in that time is looking at standardising the processes,” she says. “Biomedical engineers from Ulster University and those across the UK are producing data, manually segmenting thousands of medical images in order to help them develop an algorithm. “That allows us to massively improve our standardised process and reduce the time involved in producing those files.” That could mean reducing the time down from up to five hours, to as little as an hour. “When the company started, Daniel was able to get those early users excited in Glasgow, and then setting up in Belfast there were key surgeons which helped set the pace,” Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships said. The company has since been involved with NHS frameworks as a means to help remove as many bottlenecks as possible. This involves developing and marketing the products to the NHS and HSC in the Republic – helping them to learn about the product, the process and what area of specialism it can be used in. “In the last  months with the development of the algorithms, we are moving in to the US,” Katie said. “We’re seeing a lot of growth in the US.” And the axialD team is also growing fast. “We have  staff at the moment but are looking to expand in  months,” Daniel said. “That includes new staff in the US to help grow and manage that market as we further expand our software team back home.” The success of axialD mirrors the overall success of Catalyst, since its inception  years ago. It’s an independent not-for-profit organisation across its four sites – including its largest base at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast, alongside its Londonderry hub, Ballymena, along with the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub at Danske Bank in Belfast city centre.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jm_1.jpg","title":"how do you retain staff and keep them enjoying their job","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by Ulster Business With such intense competition for talent, the challenge for employers isn’t just finding prospective candidates, it’s also keeping them, writes John Moore, managing director of Hays NI Astonishingly, almost half of professionals surveyed in the Hays What Workers Want Report said that they left at least one new job within the first  months because it didn’t match expectations formed during the application process. A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"new  bedroom boutique hotel planned for belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by John Mulgrew A listed Belfast building could become a new hotel and restaurant as part of wider plans for a £m revamp of the city centre. Tribeca Belfast, formerly Royal Exchange, will see UK developer Castlebrooke redevelop much of the north side of the city centre. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. As part of the revised plans it wants to turn the listed former Assembly Rooms building at the corner of North Street and Waring Street into a new -bedroom hotel, with a restaurant and bars. That would involve knocking down part of the newer extension to the building, including the rear part of the former Northern Bank and the adjacent - North Street to “accommodate the new extension to form the proposed boutique hotel”. “The proposals for the existing building are similar in scope to that which was included as part of the extant approval. It is proposed to conservatively repair the existing historic fabric of the former Northern Bank,” a design statement says. “A key feature of the proposed extension is that the interface with the rearelevation of the existing listed bank building will be improved by setting back the footprint of the proposed extension so that the north west corner of the original building is readable.” The scheme includes the re-use and adaptation of the existing building as well as an extension on the footprint of the existing s extension on North Street. The extension will be set over five floors, with a rooftop bar, while upper floors are set back with metal cladding to the facades to “reduce the overall massing of the building and reflect the roofing materials or upper story treatment of surrounding buildings”. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. This summer the developer ran a fresh public consultation amid revised plans for the scheme, which included signicantly reducing a huge -storey building to around , retaining additional facades and dropping plans for an underground car park.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
