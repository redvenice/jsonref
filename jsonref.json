His other exes include American comic Sarah Silverman and actress Rachel McAdams.Others who have returned or rejected honours include John Lennon, who was awarded an MBE in 1965 but returned it in protest at Britain\u0027s foreign policy and the Vietnam War. Alan Bennett turned down a CBE in 1988 and rejected a knighthood in 1996 as it wouldn\u0027t \u0027suit\u0027 him.The actor\u0027s OBE decision was prompted by researching the history of his native Wales and its relationship with the British state for his 2017 Raymond Williams lecture.In the lecture he called for Welsh Independence, saying: \u0027Who speaks for Wales?Nobody\u0027, adding:  \u0027Wales has suffered and is suffering acute economic, political, and cultural strains, and by the fact of history has to try and resolve them in a world of crude power relationships and distant parliaments\u0027.He also said that Wales\u0027 history is 1,500 years of outside interference.\u0027It is the story of a nation that never was, struggling to be. The story of a people continually shocked and shaped and acted upon from outside.  \u0027From the Romans to the Anglo-Saxons to the Normans, they all came to fracture us, to control us, to subdue us. To bend us to their will. They built their roads, they built their walls, they built their castles.\u0027They changed our language, they changed our faith, they changed our sense of ourselves. And all the while, we tried to live in the shadow of their powers\u0027.  Michael Sheen has previously revealed his relationship with Sarah Silverman indirectly ended because of Brexit and Donald Trump\u0027s presidency.In the lecture he argued that Wales had voted to leave the EU because of a slanted view fed to them from England.He said: \u0027It was in the face of being disconnected from its own history, and denied opportunity to explore its own modern identity in the context of that history. The dragon had no voice so it spoke through the mouth of St George. \u0027When it comes to the Brexit vote - ‘For Wales - see England\u0027. That, infamously, was all that was written as the entry for Wales in the 1888 edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica. ‘For Wales - see England.’"},{"url":null,"title":"WHO says coronavirus pandemic not necessarily big one","story":"Share this articleShare this articleWHO warns Covid-19 pandemic is \u0027not necessarily the big one\u0027 | World news | The Guardian"},{"url":null,"title":"Hilaria blames decade long Spanish grift people misrepresenting me","story":"Share this articleHilaria Baldwin Talks Spain, Boston, Alec and Instagram - The New York Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Prince Harry Meghan Markles episode 30m podcast ranked whale noises","story":"Share this articleHarry and Meghan\u0027s £30million Archewell Audio podcast series beaten by show that sends people to sleep in Spotify charts"},{"url":null,"title":"UK weather England wakes coldest morning year 7 5C lows","story":"Share this articleAlthough the AA said regional restrictions imposed due to Covid-19 meant roads were quieter than normal, bitterly cold conditions continuing throughout today and into the new year will bring a continued risk of ice to drivers.Tonight will be the first time Scotland has seen temperatures below -9C (16F) at Hogmanay since 2009.The conditions have sparked fears of travel chaos, including the risk of ice building up on the £1.35billion Queensferry Crossing, possibly forcing its closure. Pensioners\u0027 groups are also calling on people to look out for elderly neighbours who may be struggling to heat their homes.Speaking about the forecast for Scotland, Met Office meteorologist Ollie Claydon said: \u0027Overnight into Thursday morning we are expecting readings of -12C (10F). Hogmanay and New Year\u0027s Day could see -10C (14F) in the countryside, especially where snow is lying on the ground.\u0027Even towns and cities will drop below zero, with -4C (25F) expected in Glasgow as the clock strikes 12 on Hogmanay. But the mercury falls further on Saturday night, when -12C is expected in the countryside again.\u0027The last time similarly low New Year temperatures were seen was December 2009, when the mercury plunged to -18C (0F) at Braemar in Aberdeenshire.In Inverness-shire yesterday, dedicated wild swimmer Nicky Goode had to break through the ice before taking a chilly dip in Loch Insh.Meanwhile, a rare phenomenon known as \u0027ice pancakes\u0027 formed on Dunbeath Water near Latheronwheel, Caithness. The frozen discs tend to occur in very cold oceans and lakes and are frequently seen in the Baltic region.As 2020 neared its end, the last full moon of the year shone brightly in clear skies. But despite the natural beauty of the season, there was a reminder of the dangers of winter.Elderly people in Ardrossan, Ayrshire, were trapped in their homes without food because untreated pavements had become \u0027ice rinks\u0027 before volunteers from the Salvation Army stepped in to take vital supplies to pensioners.Last night, Age Scotland asked people to watch out for the elderly during the cold spell.The charity\u0027s head of policy, Adam Stachura, said: \u0027With strict restrictions in place in many areas, we\u0027re less likely to see older family, friends and neighbours in person but it\u0027s vital to keep in touch.\u0027Offering a hand with shopping or collecting prescriptions, or even just a phone call or doorstep chat where possible to check someone is OK can make all the difference. This sense of connection can also be a lifeline for those feeling isolated and lonely.\u0027With these icy conditions expec-ted to last a good few weeks, we can all play a part in looking out for older, more vulnerable members of our communities and making sure they keep warm and well this winter and beyond.\u0027Citizens Advice Scotland is also reporting soaring demand for energy advice across the country as temperatures plummet. In the Highlands, meanwhile, drivers have been criticised for leaving carrots at the roadside to feed red deer. The animals are being attracted to graze close to the A82 at Kingshouse, Inverness-shire, presenting a danger to traffic – particularly at night."},{"url":null,"title":"Bulgaria uses hot dog trucks deliver Covid vaccines","story":"Share this articleCongressman-Elect From Louisiana Dies of Virus - The New York Times"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1fce7994990c7569ca7185f49b8110fa7c8f387/0_107_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5572434bfe8aa761331ee856c55f8735","title":"inside oxfords coronavirus vaccine development","story":"From a small discovery to producing at scale, photojournalist David Levene documents the groundbreaking work of the scientists of Oxford University during the development of a vaccine which is now poised for approval by medicines regulatorsFrom the moment the coronavirus spilled out of China and spread around the world, the great hope for the return of normal life lay with safe and effective vaccines. While wearing masks and washing hands helped to reduce the flood of infections, they would never be enough to hold back the tide. Social distancing – a phrase that does nothing to convey the hardship of the act – suppresses the virus, no doubt. But what kind of life is a life lived apart?In response to the pandemic, the first great shock of the 21st century, scientists around the world came together in a staggering effort to tackle the crisis. No element of that work has been more impressive than the rapid development and testing of vaccines. To have shots in the arms of the most vulnerable people, which protect them against a virus unheard of 12 months ago, is an achievement worth reflecting upon.Scientists at Oxford University were among the small number of teams at the forefront of the race to find a Covid vaccine. In the space of 10 months, they designed and manufactured a candidate vaccine and proved its safety and efficacy through rigorous clinical trials in tens of thousands of volunteers in multiple countries. The shots are now being churned out in their millions, and by agreement with Oxford’s partner, AstraZeneca, will be sold at cost price to poorer countries.It all starts at the Jenner institute at Oxford University. Named after Edward Jenner, the 18th-century pioneer of immunisations, the institute ranks as one of the world’s premier vaccine research centres.Step one was to design the vaccine. In modern vaccine research facilities, much of this work is performed on a computer. On the morning of Saturday 11 January, within hours of the virus’s genetic sequence being published online, a team led by Sarah Gilbert, a professor of vaccinology at Oxford, downloaded the code as a text file. They found the genetic instructions for the “spike” protein that studs the surface of the virus. This tiny club-like protein is swiftly recognised by the immune system.The Oxford vaccine is based on a virus that causes common colds in chimpanzees. This adenovirus is engineered so that it cannot replicate in human cells, meaning it cannot cause an infection. It is then modified further to carry the genetic instructions for the coronavirus spike protein. A shot of the vaccine releases vaccine virus particles into the body. Once inside, these particles enter cells and deliver their cargo of spike protein instructions. The cells then start to make spike proteins – each one a tiny, harmless fragment of the coronavirus – and these are ferried to the surfaces of the cells. Protruding like red flags, the immune system swiftly spots them. It raises an army of antibodies and T cells that are then primed to fight the coronavirus.As scientists at the Jenner institute ran tests in the lab and arranged for the necessary animal studies, the clinical biomanufacturing facility geared up to produce the medical-grade doses that would be needed for human trials. It is a meticulous, multi-staged process performed under increasingly stringent clean room conditions to ensure none of the raw materials, the final doses or vials become contaminated before they reach trial participants.The work starts with a strand of DNA brought across the car park from the Jenner institute. The DNA contains the genetic instructions for the vaccine adenovirus, complete with the code for the spike protein. Add this to modified human cells and they will take up the instructions and churn out adenovirus vaccine particles. Eventually, the cell makes so many that the vaccine particles burst out.The step is repeated multiple times. The vaccine particles that erupt from the single cell are added to a fresh batch of modified human cells, infecting those and producing yet more vaccine adenovirus. These are then added to more human cells, and on it goes, until a decent stock of sterile vaccine doses has been built up. Only genetically modified human cells can make the vaccine because these alone contain a gene, named E1, that the adenovirus needs to replicate.Each batch of vaccine made this way is purified to remove the ruptured cells that litter the nutrient-rich liquid. But another step is needed before the doses are ready for awaiting arms. Some adenovirus particles are duds: they assemble as empty shells that are missing their DNA. To separate them out, the liquid is spun down in a centrifuge. The valuable DNA-filled adenovirus particles settle into a band from which doses can then be taken, ready to administer as jabs.The Oxford scientists launched trials in Britain and around the world. To make enough doses for the volunteers, they sent “starter material” to factories far and wide – to Advent in Rome, Halix in the Netherlands, and the Serum Institute of India. Those who signed up for the trials were randomly assigned to receive the Oxford vaccine or a control vaccine. Most received two full shots, four weeks apart, but others received a half dose followed by a full dose a month later.Throughout the trial, clinicians on the team took blood samples from the participants to measure how their immune systems responded. But whether the vaccine worked would only become clear with time: who went on to fall ill with the virus? The vaccinated group or the control?Oxford Biomedica is manufacturing tens of millions of doses of the vaccine on behalf on AstraZeneca. Production involves various stages, starting with a vial of a frozen master bank of cells, which are thawed out and transferred into larger and larger solutions of media, each time being given time to grow. This takes several weeks until eventually there is enough vaccine to fill a 1,000-litre bioreactor. The solution then goes through a process of separation, purification and concentration before being frozen into 15-litre bags which are stored in special trays, ready to be transferred into inidual dose vials at a fillfinish house at a different location.At Wockhardt in Wrexham, one of the largest generic pharmaceutical companies in the UK, the vaccine that was manufactured at Oxford Biomedica and developed by the Oxford Vaccine Group is transferred into vials before being packaged ready for distribution.In December, following 11 intense months of vaccine development, manufacture and trials, the Oxford vaccine is poised for approval by medicines regulators. In the UK, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, has been conducting a rolling review of clinical trials data so it can reach a decision swiftly. Other regulators will perform their own assessments.Upon approval, a major operation will swing into action to distribute the vaccine from storage facilities to countries around the world. Here, the Oxford vaccine has an advantage. Two other frontrunner vaccines, from PfizerBioNTech and the US National Institutes of HealthModerna, must be stored at ultra-low temperatures until shortly before they are used. This makes distribution of the shots a formidable challenge in some parts of the world. The Oxford vaccine isn’t as fragile and can be stored for long periods at 2C to 4C, or standard refrigeration temperatures. The Oxford vaccine is much cheaper too: about one-tenth of the cost of the other two.AstraZeneca, Oxford’s industrial partner, has agreed a deal to supply the vaccine at about £2 a dose through Covax, a system set up by the vaccine alliance Gavi, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the World Health Organization, to ensure all countries, rich and poor, have equitable access to tests, treatments and vaccines. Delivery of the first 300m doses should begin by the end of the year, with 2bn shots available by the end of 2021. A separate agreement with the Serum Institute of India – the world’s largest vaccine producer – secures 400m doses before the end of 2020.Only once the shots reach people’s arms will the benefits be felt from this staggering and unprecedented scientific effort. There was a time when the cavalry brandished sabres and rifles. Today they arrive bearing needles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30b25ff371ae9e1a064868f81421e565b23bdb03/35_0_7372_4425/master/7372.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea6138527576388567796dad6e388904","title":"face off the best guardian portraits of 2020 in pictures","story":"From Jeremy Vine in an alley to Sarah Lucas with a bouquet of breasts, here are some of the people who graced the  during the year that went tits up ...

Aldi is Britain’s fifth largest supermarket with more than 900 stores and 36,000 employees.Giles Hurley, the chief executiveof Aldi UK, said: “We are expecting significant sales growth in 2021 as we open new stores and bring Aldi to more locations across the UK. With the vast majority of our grocery products now coming from British suppliers, our growth will lead to additional jobs and investment in our UK supply chain.”Aldi, which sources its core range of fresh meat, eggs, milk, butter and cream from British suppliers, said the new commitment would create opportunities for hundreds of UK-based food and drink producers.It singled out Manchester Drinks Company, whose partnership with Aldi began in 2015 to supply a range of gins and gin liqueurs. Its new site in Yorkshire employs 19 people.Richard Benjamin, a co-owner of Manchester Drinks Company, said: “Our new contract with Aldi is a fantastic opportunity to showcase our flavoured gins and liqueurs to shoppers across the country, and will help to provide stability for our business in an uncertain climate.”Aldi introduced the immediate payment terms for small suppliers at the start of the coronavirus crisis and will now continue until the end of next year. This means it will continue to process payments for suppliers with an annual turnover of less than £1m with Aldi as soon as they are submitted.Aldi announced in September that it planned to create another 4,000 jobs with the opening of 100 stores and the trial of a click and collect service as part of a big investment drive in the UK.The new jobs are in addition to 3,000 permanent roles it created this year after grocery sales surged during the pandemic. Its long-term target is to have 1,200 stores by 2025, including more than 100 upgrades."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a4601c76829eba0e877702761caf1e3d0016964/0_76_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=287baffb21e8104778bc115a750a570c","title":"countrywide sale looms after 130m takeover offer is accepted","story":"Owner of Hamptons International and Bairstow Eves estate agents agrees new offer from ConnellsThe estate agency group Connells has struck an agreed offer for Hamptons International owner Countrywide after raising its bid to £130m.The boards of Connells, part of Skipton Building Society, and Countrywide, the UK’s biggest listed estate agency group, said they had agreed terms of a recommended cash offer at 395p a share. Connells made an initial offer of 250p a share in early November and raised this to 325p a share a month later.The deal will bring together Countrywide’s 60 well-known high street brands, including Gascoigne-Pees, Bairstow Eves and King \u0026amp Chasemore, with Connells’ 25 brands – Allen \u0026amp Harris, Bagshaws Residential, Fox \u0026amp Sons, and Barnard Marcus in London. Countrywide has 651 branches while the Connells group has 581.It scuppers a rival move made by the UK private equity firm Alchemy, which proposed a £90m cash injection into Countrywide in October in return for a controlling stake, and had the support of , Peter Long, Countrywide’s executive chairman. Long quit in late November after opposition from shareholders to the plan.All of Countrywide’s lenders will be repaid in full, said Connells, pledging to invest in the group’s technology, branch network and staff to turn the business around. After years of mounting losses, Countrywide has been struggling under debts of £91.9m and has been closing branches.Connells said there would be some job losses as the two head offices are merged, but not in the branches.The offer is far below Countrywide’s £750m valuation when it floated on the stock market in March 2013 amid a buoyant property market.The company amassed debts when it went on an acquisition spree in 2014 and 2015, buying up high street brands at a time when others invested in online estate agency services. Long blamed its woes on on the “completely wrong” strategy pursued by the former chief executive, Alison Platt, who sought to run the estate agent like a retailer from a central base, triggering an exodus of middle management.David Livesey, Connells’ chief executive, said: “We have the right management team, strategy and investment firepower to work with the talented teams at Countrywide and lead Countrywide into a bright future.”The agreed deal comes eight months after LSL Property Services, which owns Your Move, abandoned a planned all-share merger with Countrywide.David Watson, acting chairman of Countrywide, said: “Following a thorough evaluation of options and extensive consultation with the company’s major shareholders, we have been encouraged by their recognition of the need to put in place a sustainable capital structure and a willingness to support the company, which is a great business that has been constrained by too much debt.”The UK housing market has been surprisingly buoyant this year despite the Covid-19 pandemic. It ground to a halt for a few weeks during the first national lockdown but bounced back in the summer, helped by a stamp duty cut.Demand from buyers looking for bigger homes in leafy locations has surged as many office workers switched to working from home. But forecasters expect the market to cool next year, when the stamp duty cut expires, with unemployment expected to rise sharply."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fa3c1ea38b933ed3dd6233a2d6120fb36939c99/0_36_7807_4686/master/7807.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14693b4b80319b455a993939f063287a","title":"covid winners losers pay uk year in business","story":"From the decimation of several industries amid the Covid pandemic to the rise of Zoom, 2020 has been an unprecedented yearIt was an unprecedented year that none of us will forget. The coronavirus pandemic shook the world of business and economics to its core and continues to have profound, often unpredictable effects, some of them permanent. It hasn’t all been about Covid-19 though. 2020 also witnessed the usual corporate chicanery, deal-making and scandal. There were world-changing cultural and political moments, landmark departures and arrivals as well as, of course, some pocket-stretching pay packets. Here is a review of the year in business.The shift to buying goods and services online accelerated during the pandemic. Any company that could deliver essential goods to the door or provide digital services became instantly indispensable. Supermarkets moved quickly to increase online delivery slots, and took on thousands of extra workers to help meet the additional demand.Amazonwas a big beneficiary as non-essential shops were forced to close and people stayed at home. Skyrocketing demand helped its founder-boss, Jeff Bezos, increase his net worthby $13bn (£10bn) in a single day to take his personal wealth to an unprecedented $189bn.. His workers didn’t fare quite so well.It was an even better year than normal to be a multi-billionaire, in fact. Ten of them increased their combined wealth by $400bn.Increased hygiene protocols paid off for Dettol-maker Reckitt Benckiser, although it did have to warn people against ingesting its disinfectant to combat Covid-19 after the US president Donald Trump floated the idea.The video-conferencing service Zoom emerged from relative obscurity to become a household name valued at about $100bn. “You’re on mute!” became a pandemic catchphrase.Online gambling companies ended 2020 worth more than they were at the beginning of the year. After an initial hit caused by the suspension of sports, bored punters flocked to online poker, roulette and slot machines.Many homebuyers were handed a boost, thanks to the chancellor’s stamp duty holiday.Other winners included some of those with political connections and contacts with a Chinese face mask supplier. Hundreds of millions of pounds of contracts were handed out, with next to no scrutiny, sparking allegations of cronyism.Several industries are facing an existential threat, putting hundreds of thousands of jobs at risk.Hospitality has borne the brunt, prompting warnings that tens of thousands of pubs, restaurants, bars and hotels could disappear. Pub groups such as Marston’s and Greene King cut jobs, while the nightclub firm Deltic filed for administration. Worse could follow with the lucrative Christmas period ruined for many.The picture is similarly bleak in travel, tourism and leisure. By early October, more than 40 airlines had gone bust. Refused a government bailout, billionaire Sir Richard Branson had to prop up Virgin Atlantic with a £1.2bn rescue package, including £200m of his own money. EasyJet denied it faced collapse.British Airways lost a staggering £5bn in the first nine months of the year, while tour operator TUI announced losses of £1.8bn. In entertainment, Cineworld shut UK and US cinemas indefinitely, while many live music and theatre businesses face oblivion.Deserted high streets wreaked havoc on retailers, particularly those deemed non-essential, triggering a string of administrations. The billionaire Philip Green’s retail empire Arcadia collapsed into administration, as did Debenhams, Edinburgh Woollen Mill, Laura Ashley and Cath Kidston.And let’s not forget the estimated 3 million people, such as some self-employed, who have seen limited or no benefit from government measures to support businesses and jobs.This all made for some mind-blowing and unwelcome economic and financial milestones.As global trade slowed, so did demand for oil, with mind-boggling results. The price of US oil briefly moved into negative territory, as traders paid to be rid of unwanted barrels rather than incur storage costs.The pandemic allowed some businesses – and their staff in particular – to shine. Supermarket workers, cleaners and delivery drivers emerged as some of the true heroes of the crisis.In the early days, industrials rallied round in a wartime-style effort, with the likes of Airbus, Rolls-Royce and McLaren joining the Ventilator Challenge to produce thousands of medical ventilators that, thankfully, have not been needed in the quantities feared.Fashion firms including Burberry made PPE, while the likes of the chemicals firm Ineos and craft beer firm BrewDog churned out hand sanitiser.You don’t often hear three cheers for Big Pharma but the likes of Pfizer and AstraZeneca have won public goodwill thanks to swift work producing vaccines.Retailers paid back £1.8bn in state support that they did not need, including Sainsbury’s, Asda, B\u0026ampM, Aldi, Tesco and Morrisons.Away from coronavirus, the Black Lives Matter movement led many businesses to engage more seriously with racial discrimination and inequality, but progress has been slow and critics have warned firms must wake up to race issues.2020 spawned tales of skulduggery worthy of the late John Le Carre. In January, fugitive former Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn told of his dramatic escape from incarceration in Japan. Accused of financial misconduct, Ghosn was smuggled to Lebanon thanks to an elaborate plot that involved him hiding in an audio equipment box.Tidjane Thiam, one of the stars of banking, was ousted as boss of Swiss bank Credit Suisse after a saga involving corporate espionage, an alleged car chase and bitter personal vendettas.The payment processing firm Wirecard enjoyed the backing of the entire German financial establishment as it tried every trick in the book to discredit Financial Times reporters who eventually unmasked the company as a fraudulent house of cards.British firms played their part, too. Aston Martin was revealed to have close links to a “sock puppet” PR firm questioning the green credentials of electric vehicles.Then there was the furore over fast fashion firm Boohoo and its ties to garment factories in Leicester and Pakistan, where workers were allegedly underpaid and exposed to unsafe working conditions.The fallout from the collapse of London Capital \u0026amp Finance, costing investors £236m, cast significant doubt on the efficacy of the financial watchdog, the FCA.Covid-19 subdued merger and acquisition activity but the US graphics card specialist Nvidia swooped for Cambridge-based chipmaker Arm Holdings, in a $40bn deal that sparked concern about the future of a rare British tech world-leader.The ticket resale firm Viagogo announced a $4bn takeover of rival StubHub, only to see the British Competition \u0026amp Markets Authority step in and threaten to scupper the whole thing. The deal hangs in the balance.After months of uncertainty, British Steel was eventually sold to the Chinese firm Jingye, securing the future of steelmaking in Scunthorpe.As the UK considers a crackdown on gambling, the US is opening up. The Las Vegas casino firm Caesars grabbed William Hill with a £2.9bn takeover. Meanwhile, the Paddy Power owner, Flutter, completed a $12.3bn merger with Canada’s The Stars Group, creating the world’s largest online gambling company.As the year drew to a close, the security firm G4S accepted a £3.8bn offer from its US rival Allied Universal Security Services.Tesla’s founder, Elon Musk, took the first steps on the road towards a controversial $55.8bn pay bonanza. It hinges on some tough targets, including Tesla reaching a market value of $650bn. The electric car firm zoomed through that barrier earlier this month following a remarkable and sustained rise.In the UK, Matthew Moulding, the chief executive of the e-commerce firm The Hut Group, was in line for £830m in performance-related shares thanks to its strong performance since listing. He claims to have made 74 staff millionaires too.Even before the pandemic boosted Ocado’s fortunes, its boss, Tim Steiner, scooped £54m in share price-related bonuses.It’s hard to believe that Rishi Sunak only became chancellor of the exchequer in February. He was briefly flavour of the month when handing out more than £210bn in Covid relief to fund the furlough scheme and initiatives such as eat out to help out. His star has fallen a little since then and he faces the tough task of managing the finances during a recession.As Sunak arrived, the Bank of England governor Mark Carney bowed out after seven years overseeing a post-banking crisis British economy, with his reputation pretty much intact. Andrew Bailey succeeded him at Threadneedle Street.Sharon White became chair of John Lewis Partnership in February.

Most stock markets suffered their briefest bear market ever only to stage a meteoric recovery and emerge much stronger, oil prices turned negative for the first time in history, and the once-beloved US dollar is now trapped in a relentless downward spiral.If there is a lesson to be learned from all this, it is that when governments and central banks join forces to fight a crisis, the stimulus response is so overwhelmingly powerful that it eclipses everything else in financial markets. When sovereign bonds go from being a risk-free asset to becoming a return-free risk, equities and commodities are bound to shine bright. There is simply no alternative.Looking into 2021, the burning question is whether this cheerfulness will continue to dominate as vaccines are fully deployed and the global economy heals its wounds. The vast consensus within the financial community is that it will.Anxiety about the UK’s latest Covid-19 restrictions are weighing on the stock market today, says Marketwatch: The U.K. House of Commons on Wednesday massively voted to ratify the U.K.-EU trade deal concluded last week, which became law in the early hours of Thursday, clearing the way for an orderly exit from the European markets. But investors in London focused on another layer of strict measures announced by the government, such as a postponement of school openings due next week.Stock markets in the Asia-Pacific region were set to end 2020 at record highs, Reuters reports:“A lot of the rise in the second part of the quarter is because the political risk evaporated,” said Kerry Craig, Global Market Strategist, J.P. Morgan Asset Management, citing the U.S. election, hopes for an easing in U.S.-China trade tensions and the Brexit deal.Looking to 2021, Craig said investors were trying to balance the potential for rising inflation against a likely economic recovery, and assess whether that rebound might be impeded early in the year by new strains of COVID-19 and struggles with rolling out vaccines.At this year’s closing session, Akita Kiyota, CEO of the Japan Exchange Group, described stock prices in 2020 as “getting swayed by the novel coronavirus,” The Asahi Shimbun newspaper reports.China’s stock market rallied today, after new economic data showed that its factory sector kept growing this month.The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI) came in at 51.9 in December, down slightly on November’s 52.1 (which was a three-year high). Any reading over 50 indicates growth.The non-manufacturing PMI, which tracks the services and construction sectors, dipped to 55.7, below November’s reading of 56.4, but still comfortable in expansion territory. The National Bureau of Statistics, which produces the data, said Chinese economic activity remained strong in December despite the declines in both manufacturing and non-manufacturing sentiment. Zhao Qinghe, a senior statistician at NBS, said:“The pace of recovery in the manufacturing sector accelerated in the fourth quarter. Although the December manufacturing PMI dropped slightly, it was still only 0.2 percentage points lower than the year’s high in November. The overall manufacturing sector maintained a steady recovery, with the pace at a relatively high level for the year.”Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Avatrade, points out that the US Nasdaq index has roared away this year: Travel, hospitality and retail companies could recover in 2021, he adds, if the economic recovery comes good.Traders are hoping that they will be able to reap their reward from their investments in these companies in 2021 as economic recovery shifts into a higher gear.

That, and the prospect of more stimulus measures in the US next year, is dampening demand for the dollar.Even the A-Team’s “Hannibal” Smith would be impressed at how well the financial markets buy everything, sell the US Dollar plan is coming together as the year ends. US 10-year yields eased slightly overnight, equities are moving higher, along with precious metals, commodities and energy, and currency markets spent the overnight session clubbing the greenback harder than a harp seal harvest. Although the US Dollar has been grinding lower throughout the week, it is interesting that currency markets have waited until the year’s penultimate trading session to press the accelerator. Part of that is probably down to the UK approval of the Astra ZenecaOxford University Covid-19 for immediate use. The Astra Zeneca vaccine is a potential game-changing accelerator in the Covid-19 battle, being producible rapidly in massive amounts, and storable at room temperatures, instead of environments that mimic the South Pole in the middle of winter. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.We’ve nearly made it. Today’s the final trading session of 2020, ending a year dominated by the Covid-19 pandemic.And after a highly volatile year, Britain’s FTSE 100 share index is on track for its worst year since the financial crisis 12 years ago, and the worst performance of any of the big share indices.Overall, stock markets roared back from their spring slump, thanks to the unprecedented stimulus packages from governments and central banks.The FTSE 100 has suffered from several factors. It lacks major tech companies, and is instead dominated by financial firms and energy companies, along with some defensive-yet-unexciting consumer goods makers and utilities.The strength of the pound (which has just hit a 31-month high against the US dollar) has also hit major exporters.Plus Brexit uncertainty, and the economic damage suffered during the pandemic this year, have also dampened demand for UK stocks, with travel, leisure, and retail all have a rotten 12 months.Russ Mould of AJ Bell has dubbed 2020 a ‘game of two halves’, writing earlier this month that:“The UK was a turgid performer, weighed down by its sector mix and heavy exposure to banks and oils and limited exposure to technology, as well as Brexit and perceptions (fair or unfair) that the pandemic has not been handled that well. In fact the UK was the worst performer in the second half of the year when Latin America, the Middle EastAfrica and Asia were the best.“This switch toward emerging markets again hints at investors looking for cyclical growth – value for want of a better turn of phrase – rather than secular growth – or more reliable, almost defensive progress – as well as global export and inflation plays.We’ll be tracking the action on the final day of the year, and looking ahead to 2021."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1053db46663bf6ca2031a6ea73bd488a7a96abdf/0_338_5072_3043/master/5072.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=53b7bf8ef8649e71326f8e30a2799ea1","title":"years denial finally accepted trans woman","story":"Lockdown gave me the space to explore my feelings, but living with my conservative parents means I’m transitioning in secret This year, I accepted that I am a trans woman. As early as at the age of five years old, I knew that something wasn’t right and I never felt completely whole. In my 20s, I resolved to figure out what these feelings meant, and so began a journey of self-exploration and self-denial, obsessively visiting online transgender support groups to find an answer. In my heart, I was hoping for a way out, any explanation that didn’t involve actually being trans. None came.This year finally brought clarity: I am not, and have never been, a man. My name is Sophie. While lockdown gave me the space to address these feelings, it also put obstacles in my way. I am transitioning in secret while I live with my socially conservative parents who I know will not approve: last year my mother boycotted a reality TV show for including a trans woman.At the beginning of 2020, I believed I wouldn’t see the end of it. I’d finished a long stint in higher education, and career plans a decade in the making refused to come to fruition. I suffered the ignominy of moving back in with my parents, while all of my peers settled into careers and homes of their own. The combined effect of depression and gender dysphoria – a fundamental incongruence between the gender I was assigned at birth and the gender I actually was – meant that I stopped being able to imagine a future at all.I visited my GP as a promise to a friend. The same day, I started taking antidepressants and was referred to a counsellor. It didn’t exactly fix me, but it did give me just enough clarity of mind to know that there was only one way I could continue living.And so I sought out a gender therapist. I contacted him as Sophie, the name that I’d been using in online support groups for two years. It surprised me how unremarkable he found it to use this name for someone who presented as completely male. He picked up immediately on my reluctance to call myself a trans person. So he conducted a thought experiment. “If you could push a button,” he asked, “and wake up in a world where everyone knew you as female, would you push it?”There’s a reason gender therapists often ask this. It invites you to imagine a reality where you can be yourself consequence-free. Where you can transition without being rejected by friends, evicted by family or subjected to harassment. It helps to isolate doubts about your own identity from the fear of the repercussions of coming out. “Yes,” I said.Within two sessions, I could no longer avoid the conclusion that I was trans. But realising it and accepting it are two very different things. When the time came to tell my partner of seven years, I broke down trembling in her arms as I detailed all of the ways that I wasn’t the person she’d spent her 20s planning a life with. As the dust settled, I broke the silence between us with a question: “Do you think I’m odd?” She said no, immediately and unequivocally. She received me for who I am, like all the friends who accepted me more easily than I had accepted myself.I was unaware of how much I had internalised society’s transphobia. Being trans is a struggle of self-realisation against a tidal wave of invalidation and disapproval from public figures and parts of the media. I am coming out into a world that sees my existence as a matter of legitimate debate. For years it was easier to live in denial, but in 2020 I realised I had to live as myself or not at all. Being trans is not an ideology or a choice. It is an inextricable part of who I am.My partner left me in September. She accepted me unquestioningly, but I was not what she’d signed up for. Suddenly I had no attachments and no reason not to transition. And so I became intimately acquainted with the Kafkaesque bureaucracy running the UK’s transgender healthcare. The waiting list for the NHS’s backlogged gender identity clinics frequently exceeds three years, leaving trans people with no choice but to funnel money into private medical services, so that we can finally start living as ourselves.This summer I did exactly that. The scheduled hour-long consultation with a psychologist was over in 15 minutes. “I have what I need,” she said. “You know who you are.” Within 24 hours I received written confirmation that I met the criteria for gender dysphoria. A prescription for oestrogen and progesterone arrived at my door two days later.Transitioning while being at home and unable to interact with the wider world means that my journey feels incomplete. I can’t dress as I identify and have to carefully choose clothes that keep my physical changes hidden. I face the contradiction of hoping these changes happen quickly, but not so quickly that my parents will notice before I am able to move out. I have joined local support groups for trans people, but I can’t access them. All face-to-face meetings have been cancelled due to coronavirus, and anything I say over online video calls could out me to other people in the house. Right now I am Sophie in private and someone else in public. The way I present and the person I am have nothing to do with each other.Still, I’m grateful every day for the unwavering support of the many friends who now know who I am. The first time they called me by my new, real name, it dawned on me how numb I had been. I had been living in black and white, and suddenly the world appeared to me in full colour, alive with possibility.So I enter 2021 as a different person. Next year, when life begins to unfurl itself again, I will have the chance to live authentically as me."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1c4c41dbfaf162d36367ca9554a8964ee430e3b/0_41_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25482241d359f30a54129ebc7e7bb635","title":"parents in england tell us what you think of the new rules on primary schools reopening","story":"We’d like to hear from parents about their thoughts on the varied reopening of primary schools in EnglandAs the start of the new term approaches, primary schools in England are to be subject to different rules according to the rates of coronavirus in their area.

But in a party season with no parties, what becomes of the party dress?With festivities curtailed by coronavirus restrictions and many families choosing not to risk gathering, and with bars and restaurants closed in many areas, this year’s new year celebrations will be small-scale and home-based. As a result, the LBD has been replaced by a new dress code: kitchen disco dressing. Cocktail frocks, tailoring and heels are out and fancy pyjamas, velvet slippers and sparkly knitwear are in.Dancing, after all, is still permitted, albeit under kitchen spotlights and Christmas tree fairy lights rather than glitter balls. Icons of the 2020 kitchen disco scene include Nigella Lawson, perched on her stairs tucking into a creme caramel on her recent BBC cooking show, and Stanley Tucci fixing a negroni for his wife on Instagram during lockdown. Despite the disco tag, Bianca Jagger riding a white horse into Studio 54 is not where these parties are pitched – although Truman Capote, who liked to hit that club’s dancefloor dressed in a plush dressing gown and monogrammed velvet slippers, could be said to feature on the mood board.This year, the bestselling look in John Lewis’s 12 Days of Christmas Dressing collection is a kitchen disco two-piece by Hush, with gunmetal sequin sweater and matching silky tracksuit-style trousers. The head of womenswear, Jo Bennett, said she “can’t wait to dance around the house with my boys” in it, for “a little bit of joy and a small moment of escapism”.At River Island, the social media sensation of this winter’s collection has been its £83 silky pyjamas with detachable feather trims for cuff and hem, which sold out in days, eclipsing every party dress on offer. Meanwhile at Primark, a £35 cocktail trolley featuring brass rails, mirrored shelves and a champagne flute rack, petitely scaled to fit into a modest kitchen, has been flying out of stores. Even if they had parties they could attend, shoppers who have spent the best part of a year in loungewear would probably be resistant to Spanx, uncomfortable high heels or the desperate hunt for unsnagged hosiery. By leaning in to the home comforts of pyjama- or tracksuit-based looks, kitchen disco fashion makes a virtue of staying put.The freedom to wear elasticated waists and stretch fabrics having been one of lockdown’s few luxuries, comfort is emerging as a strong priority for shoppers as 2021 looms. Joseph Altuzarra is one of many designers focusing on soft fabrics and non-constrictive silhouettes in collections going into 2021, believing that “after spending months in sweatpants, people are going to want to feel comfortable”.The kitchen disco dress code is both a mirror to consumer psychology and a savvy marketing ploy on the part of retailers. During the summer, brands such as Kitri, designed by Haeni Kim, made a strategic decision to pivot away from taking “event” dressing to market in December and towards dressy clothes that would appeal in a domestic setting. A £49 “Elisa Rose” embroidered knit camisole featured in the holiday-wear edit is styled for the Kitri website in an at-home setting with a cardigan and knit joggers, described as “a supremely soft conversation piece”.Formalwear is traditionally bought with a specific event in mind, and with parts of the UK continuing to shift unpredictably between different Covid restrictions going into 2021, the versatility of separates that can be dressed up or down outshines the appeal of formal dresses. With many social and professional interactions still taking place on Zoom, outfits that can be deconstructed when polish is only necessary from the waist up are outpacing dresses.There are signs that the kitchen disco may prove vaccine-resistant and continue to thrive in 2021. The singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor, whose Kitchen Disco videos from her family home became a lockdown hit in the spring, is preparing to take the concept on the road, with a Kitchen Disco album and live tour planned for next year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e8fb7f5dd78471274413ca966ac73d8d1bdb9fe/0_0_2858_4169/master/2858.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73681ecf510ea3fb116c218fbb7b1260 880w","title":"womens transfer window january 2021 every deal in europes top five leagues","story":"Latest deals and club-by-club guides for the WSL and leagues in Italy, France, Germany and Spain"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c253a772c50d02eae26bf6c9ea1f77ce1564e4c/0_235_7035_4220/master/7035.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=cbd67ecb8795fa5d9caf81df3a392889","title":"tell us how you are celebrating new years eve in the uk","story":"We’d like to hear how people in the UK are celebrating New Year’s Eve under coronavirus restrictionsWith the majority of the UK unable to mix with other households indoors, most traditional New Year’s Eve plans will be cancelled.From Zoom parties to social distanced walks at midnight, we’d like to hear about your plans for New Year’s Eve this year.You can get in touch by filling in the form below.

The 35-year-old becomes the fourth F1 driver to be knighted after two fellow Britons, Sir Stirling Moss and Sir Jackie Stewart, and Australia’s Sir Jack Brabham.There had been a question mark over whether Hamilton, who also surpassed Schumacher’s record of grand prix victories in 2020, would be knighted given he lives in the tax haven of Monaco. But it was reported that the prime minister, Boris Johnson, had personally intervened to ensure Hamilton would be rewarded for his sporting achievements.It was confirmed on Wednesday that Hamilton, who in September also set up a commission to analyse the lack of ersity in motor racing, had been recognised through the “diplomatic and overseas” list rather than the domestic list to avoid controversy over his tax returns.Hamilton was congratulated by Stefano Domenicali, the new CEO of F1, who praised him as a “true giant of our sport”.“His influence is huge both in and out of a car,” he added. “What he has achieved is phenomenal with still more to come. All of us at Formula 1 congratulate him on this well-deserved recognition of his achievements and look forward to seeing more of his brilliance in 2021.”The Exeter director of rugby, Rob Baxter, was awarded an OBE, meanwhile, and the team’s captain, Joe Simmonds, an MBE after the Chiefs won the Premiership title and the European Champions Cup. There were also MBEs for Jimmy Greaves, the former Tottenham and England striker, and the former Wolves midfielder Ron Flowers, who become the last surviving members of England’s 1966 World Cup-winning squad to be honoured.In women’s football Gill Coultard, the first to win 100 senior England football caps, received an MBE – a gong that was also given to Great Britain’s Billie Jean King Cup tennis captain Anne Keothavong.The former Leeds Rhino scrum-half Rob Burrow, who has motor neurone disease, was also granted and MBE in recognition of services to his sport and in raising MND awareness during the coronavirus pandemic. His former teammate, the Leeds director of rugby Kevin Sinfield, ran seven marathons in seven days to raise funds for the MND Association on Burrow’s behalf, with the total now more than £2.5m.Burrow said “2020 has taught us all to appreciate the gifts we have and it is my honour and privilege to accept this award on behalf of all the MND community”, and added: “I hope it gives people hope that we are not ignored and the drive for more research and support to end MND will not stop.”Bob Champion, who won the 1981 Grand National on Aldaniti after recovering from cancer, has been awarded a CBE for his charitable work at the Bob Champion Cancer Trust.Matt Hampson, who was paralysed from the neck down during a training session with the England Under-21 rugby union team in 2005, has been given an OBE for services to charity. Matchroom chairman Barry Hearn was given the same award for services to sport after a 40-year career.

I have not had time to look at my phone. So, I don’t know what’s going on outside the AT\u0026ampT Center.”Hammon and the Spurs already had a lot to contend with against the defending league champion Lakers.James celebrated his 36th birthday with 26 points, eight assists and five rebounds in the Lakers’ third double-digit victory. The teams will complete the two-game set Friday night.“(I was) trying to get the guys in the right spots,” Hammon said. “Trying to get them motivated. Obviously, it’s a learning situation for all of us, but I would have loved to have walked out there with a win with the guys.”Popovich was ejected by official Tony Brown with 3:56 remaining in the second quarter. Popovich screamed at Brown and entered the court following a non-call on DeMar DeRozan’s attempted layup and a subsequent attempted rebound by Drew Eubanks.As he exited the court to applause from several of the team’s family members in attendance, Popovich pointed a finger at Hammon and had a succinct message.“You got ’em,” Hammon said. “See? He doesn’t treat us any differently than he does you guys.”Said LeBron James: “Obviously she’s been paying her dues over the last few years and Coach Pop has given her the opportunity. ... It’s a beautiful thing just to hear her barking out calls, barking out sets. She’s very passionate about the game. Congrats to her and congrats for our league.”Hammon took over the team’s huddles during timeouts and walked the sideline following Popovich’s ejection. Hammon was the first full-time female assistant coach in league history.“Well deserved,” Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. “I’ve talked to her before and she really knows her stuff and obviously she’s here for a reason. She’s equipped, intelligent (and the) guys have great respect for her. She’s going to be a great coach one day.”A three-time All-American at Colorado State, Hammon played for the New York Liberty and San Antonio Stars in the WNBA as well as overseas before retiring to join Popovich’s staff in 2014.“Even in timeouts with Pop as head coach, she is quick on her feet,” DeRozan said. “She tells us about defensive assignments, offensive sets we should run. Seeing her in the forefront, it would have definitely been cool to have won for her.”The Lakers contributed to Popovich’s frustration and the Spurs’ fortunes didn’t get much better after the veteran coach exited.Dennis Schroder had 21 points, Anthony Davis had 20 points and eight rebounds for the Lakers. Wesley Matthews was 6 for 6 on three-pointers in scoring 18 points off the bench.The Spurs opened with a 9-2 run, including an uncontested drive through the lane by Keldon Johnson for a two-handed slam. The Lakers responded with an 11-0 run that promoted a timeout by Popovich.The Lakers took their first double-digit lead at 35-25 on Kyle Kuzma’s 3-pointer with 1:14 remaining in the first quarter.Dejounte Murray had a career-high 29 points, seven assists and seven rebounds.“At the end of the day, it don’t mean nothing, we lost,” Murray said.DeRozan added 23 for the Spurs, who lost their second straight after opening the season with two consecutive wins."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16a94f2b1ac0a638892517cd7f7127e4d81c4639/0_45_1948_1169/master/1948.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c14fec03568e49a26575ed8903e0dc8","title":"roger federer perfect excuse walk away 2020 wants to go on tennis","story":"After two arthroscopic knee surgeries and a year away from tennis the 39-year-old is showing remarkable grit to continueIn July 2018, during times when rooms could still be safely filled with people, Roger Federer was at Wimbledon for a pre-tournament press conference as he prepared to defend his title. For half an hour he fielded questions in three languages from a packed room, but suddenly things took a left turn. An unfamiliar reporter was handed the microphone and without missing a beat, she opened her question with a simple, direct statement: “You look even more handsome than last year.”As onlookers cackled and Federer responded with a timely injection of humour, that cringe-inducing moment felt as if it was a reflection of the way Federer is discussed in general. Even before he marked himself as one of the all-time greats, Federer took on a mythical status in the sporting world. He is the maestro. He is peRFect. He is often described as some otherworldly being. There are those interminable jokes from commentators about his inability to sweat, even when his headband is clearly soaked through. Such a comment from a professional journalist seemed as if it was a natural progression.Detractors of Federer and some neutrals argue there is far too much fawning over him, while his fans would point out that a once-in-a-lifetime talent who has won so much and attracted so many fans to the game is worthy of that adulation. What is clear is that with so much of the focus on his effortless style and bottomless toolbox of shots, it often belies the many other qualities that make him great.On Sunday night, Federer concluded his year by announcing he will not be competing at the Australian Open in February. After previously undergoing surgery for a torn meniscus in his left knee in 2016, this year Federer had two arthroscopic surgeries on his right knee. He did not recover satisfactorily from the first surgery in February, so he decided on a second attempt in June. He is now working his way back up to full intensity in Dubai and he will eventually decide on his first tournament back.For much of his career, Federer’s evasion of injury has been a pillar of his game, allowing him to preserve his body and remain competitive for so long. Now the reality of being 39 years old with 1,513 ATP singles matches under his belt has arrived. Federer’s withdrawal means his injury layoff will last longer than a year. His mortality as a professional player has naturally been on his mind. “It is already clear that I am near the end of my career,” he said in July to the Swiss broadcaster SRF. “I can’t tell what’s in two years. That’s why I plan year after year. I’m still happy right now. But when the cogwheels no longer work, I stop.”The most interesting aspect of these final years of Federer’s career has been what he is willing to do to keep those cogwheels turning. It has taken far more than just a wave of his magic wand. Eighteen months ago, he was so close to one of his great achievements, leading Novak Djokovic by double match point in the Wimbledon final before falling in a fifth-set tie-break.For Federer, memories of that match should also include the 10 months of work it took to return to that spot. After defeats at Wimbledon and the US Open in 2018, his powers waning, Federer responded by adding more tournaments to his schedule. He spent a long winter with his head down, slowly grinding through uncertain patches of form. There were many ugly matches, balls thrashed in bursts of anger, and he was still searching for his level by the 2019 Australian Open. It was engrossing to see him resolutely work through his issues before he finally soared again.The only sighting of Federer in 2020 came at the Australian Open after a shortened off-season. Despite never really finding his best, he dragged himself into the last four, engineering two breathless five-set escapes against John Millman and Tennys Sandgren. By the semi-final, his body was finished.At any age, recovering from a serious injury is difficult. Surgery is physically painful and mentally draining. Rehabilitation is the height of tedium. The uncertainty of if and when it will be possible to return to competition can be suffocating enough as a 20-year-old, let alone in a brittle body after decades of competition. Since February, Federer will have had to navigate all of those emotions.In that same Wimbledon press conference two and a half years ago, Federer was asked about Serena Williams’s comeback after her pregnancy. He noted his happiness at her decision to take the route back to sport after such a long time away. “Why not?” he said. “After everything she’s done, it would have been the perfect excuse and exit to say: ‘I’ve had it.’”After two knee surgeries and a year away from tennis at 39 years old, 2020 produced the cleanest excuse and exit route for Federer to vanish into the night. Instead, he has not had it. He has been consistent and resolute in his determination to compete at the highest level again. Age eventually comes for us all, but he has impeded its effects by complementing his ability with grit, resolve and an enduring motivation that remains more than 22 years since his first professional match and so long since most of his contemporaries let go. In the end, that feels even more meaningful than his talent alone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51b3a5c35c1749fad7ddbfe8878668cb108a6ae6/0_144_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=1fb36503134be2fdee77af05ec5f3127","title":"britons urged to stay home on new years eve as covid cases soar","story":"Scientists say virus rampant in UK and advise people to avoid meeting up with family and friendsScientists, police and the prime minister are urging people to welcome in the new year in their own home, with an NHS chief warning it is “absolutely vital” to avoid meeting family and friends because “Covid loves a crowd”.Prof Stephen Powis, the national medical director of NHS England, told Wednesday’s No 10 press conference that the new UK coronavirus variant was fuelling a steep rise in infections, and said any plans to meet with those from other households should be postponed.“Its absolutely vital that this year everybody continues to follow the guidance by staying at home and not mixing,” he said. “Covid loves a crowd so please leave the parties for later in the year.”The prime minister, Boris Johnson, also instructed people to follow local restrictions and see in the new year at home.“That means not meeting up with friends or family indoors, unless they are in the same household or support bubble, and avoiding large gatherings of any kind,” he said.Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, told the briefing: “I know new year is coming up, I know it is normally a time of great festivity and enjoyment, but you have just got to play your part now in bringing us back from this very dangerous situation that we find ourselves in.”The UK reported another 981 Covid-related deaths on Wednesday, the highest daily toll since April, and a further 50,023 infections in the last 24 hours. The number of patients in hospital with Covid in England is higher than recorded during the peak of the first wave. Prof Peter Openshaw of Imperial College London, a member of the UK’s Sage scientific advisory sub-group Nervtag, said the situation was very worrying.He added that the impact of Christmas mixing was expected to become apparent in case numbers and the death toll in the coming weeks.Prof Kamlesh Khunti, of the University of Leicester, who sits on Sage and is also a member of the Independent Sage group of experts, said the virus was rampant and the situation severe.Khunti added that no one should be complacent, noting Covid had also affected young people, and urged people to forgo meeting up in person to welcome in 2021.“Please do not go out and celebrate,” he said. “Some people have managed really well having celebrations virtually. There is a way to do this,” he added, noting that technology meant people could chat, drink and socialise together safely.“We have got now the vaccine, we shouldn’t really mess this up now,” he said.Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, urged Scots to avoid traditional celebrations for Hogmanay on Thursday, including “first footing” neighbours and relatives on New Year’s Day and holding house parties to welcome the new year. “We should bring in the 2021 in our own homes, with our own households,” she told MSPs. “This new strain is very serious. I can’t stress that enough.”Police have said most people were obeying the restrictions in their areas, but across the country they had discovered a number of raves, large-scale parties and businesses including hairdressers trying to stay open.Police say they will concentrate on the biggest breaches of the Covid rules on New Year’s Eve, such as ticketed events and unlicensed music events including raves, with sources adding officers will not be going “house to house” looking for breaches. Officers will try to encourage people to comply before issuing fines.Martin Hewitt, the chairman of the National Police Chiefs’ Council, said that while many people may want to celebrate after a difficult year, it was necessary to stick to the restrictions to prevent the spread of coronavirus."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46d0b9b569001780ac8b51644b0f12a29809e0ac/496_0_728_437/master/728.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=44f1e08e423777520521bfe99327652b","title":"messina to maastricht the modest european towns that marked the road to brexit","story":"As Britain embarks on its solo journey, we celebrate the places put on the map by the UK’s rocky relationship with EuropeIoannina is no Mykonos. A city on the northern Greek mainland near the border with Albania, it is landlocked and rarely on any tourist trail. As far as guidebook mentions go, it’s silverwork, feta cheese and local spring water.But back in spring 1994 it burst on to front pages across Europe, seizing the minds of politicians. Ioannina joined the ranks of little-known European cities to host a European summit and become a household name for a fortnight.From Messina to Maastricht, such places will fill history books of the future as they retrace the story of European integration – and Britain’s troubled joining and departure.In March 1994, Europe’s foreign ministers, meeting in Ioannina, were arguing about power and who really gets to wield it. The debate was all about the EU’s smaller countries “taking back control”. The result – the Ioannina compromise – was a seemingly arcane technical bargain about voting rights in an enlarged EU, but it paved the way for fewer national vetoes and deeper European integration.Ten years earlier, in June 1985, it was Schengen – not even a town or city, but a Luxembourg village – that was on everyone’s lips.With a population of fewer than 5,000, and previously known only for its wine-making, it is close to where the territories of Belgium, France and Luxembourg meet. A number of European nations met there to sign the momentous Schengen agreement – a milestone in Europe’s integration, which abolished border controls over much of Europe.And though most people think it started in 1957 with the Treaty of Rome – rich with imperial symbolism, surely – the key breakthrough actually came a few years before, in the more obscure city of Messina, the third-largest on the island of Sicily.Messina kicked off the whole EEC project. However, the British famously didn’t go. Old Foreign Office hands reminisced that was it was “too outlandish and far away” to send a UK government representative.Forty years later and over 1,000 miles north, it was another “m” that unexpectedly took centre stage.In the student-filled but quiet medieval town of Maastricht, on the banks of the River Meuse in the Netherlands, European leaders took the huge twin strides of creating the euro and launching a European political union – creating the treaty that took the city’s name.Imagine how the UK tabloids would have coped if the meeting had been in Berlin.The journey of subsequent European treaties snaked across Europe in a winding path worthy of any student’s interrail ticket – from Amsterdam to Nice to Lisbon – each stop a step on the way to more European integration.But these places are synonymous not only with leaps forward in the European project, but also rising arguments over it, as Britain fell more and more deeply out of love with the EU.Dublin – one of Europe’s smaller capitals – witnessed one of Britain’s most momentous rows with European leaders. The acrimonious summit held there was Margaret Thatcher’s first, and was dominated by her demands for her money back. As Helmut Schmidt, the then German chancellor, quipped: she had hardly spent a penny and she wanted her pennies back.The row simmered through summit after summit until it was finally defused five years later at Fontainebleau.But perhaps the most poignant is another small French town with an impressive chateau, traditionally the summer residence of French presidents. Britain’s uncomfortable relationship with Europe is symbolised by the rebuff at Rambouillet.In December 1962, the then British prime minister, Harold Macmillan, was doggedly fighting to get Britain into the European club against resistance from the French leader, General De Gaulle.Meeting at Rambouillet’s chateau, Macmillan was bluntly let down by his French counterpart. Realising his plans to get Britain into the EEC were in ruins, Macmillan reportedly left the town in tears, leaving Britain to wait another 10 years.Security concerns and growing workloads mean that more and more meetings are held in Brussels. But the crisscrossing journey to obscure European backwaters will continue without the UK. The decisive meetings on Europe’s future won’t be hosted by Carlisle, Leicester or any other UK town – but they could be in Belgrade or Minsk."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7eda8b6569c476393971423f7f39f6e51858e61e/0_21_4909_2946/master/4909.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=836c121835588abe8d6ef22097bd91e5","title":"coronavirus covid live news updates vaccine lockdown","story":"Latest updates: Mayor of London Sadiq Khan says he is seeking urgent clarification on school closures Covid cases surge in TokyoDoctors’ union the British Medical Association (BMA) said advice that first doses of the Pfizer vaccine should be prioritised and second doses be done within 12 weeks was “grossly unfair” for patients whose imminent second jab appointments could be rescheduled.Dr Richard Vautrey, chairman of the BMA GP committee, said: “This group of very elderly patients is at the highest risk of death if they contract Covid-19, which is why GPs are so concerned for them.It is grossly and patently unfair to tens of thousands of our most at-risk patients to now try to reschedule their appointments. Local leaders are telling us that is unprofessional and impractical to amend the appointments for thousands of frail elderly patients, particularly those booked and who have already made arrangements to have their second vaccination in the next two weeks.The decision to ask GPs, at such short notice, to rebook patients for three months hence will also cause huge logistical problems for almost all vaccination sites and practices.A total of 232,169 people tested positive for Covid-19 in England at least once in the week to 23 December, according to the latest test and trace figures.The prime minister, Boris Johnson, had pledged that, by the end of June, the results of all in-person tests would be back within 24 hours.The world risks a “moral catastrophe” if Covid-19 vaccinations are delayed in Africa while wealthier regions inoculate their entire populations, the head of the continent’s disease control body said.The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) hopes significant vaccination campaigns on the continent would begin in April, its head, John Nkengasong, told reporters.“That’s a long way to go given that this virus transmits very quickly,” he said, adding that in Africa, “the second wave is here with a vengeance”.South Africa, where a new variant of the virus has been detected, recorded 82,000 cases in the past week, he said.We cannot delay, we need those vaccines and need them now,” Nkengasong said.The major blockers to vaccinations beginning in Africa are global availability of doses and financing but wealthy nations have acquired vaccines in excess of what they need, he said.“We don’t have to get into a moral crisis, where these things are stocked in the developed world and we in Africa are struggling to have,” Nkengasong said.The African Union is in talks with the European Union, Canada and pharmaceutical companies to secure doses, he said, to secure vaccines in addition to what Africa has been promised by the World Health Organization’s Covax programme. Covax is a global scheme to deliver Covid-19 vaccines to poorer countries.Ireland has toughened Covid-19 restrictions by closing non-essential retail and imposing a 5km travel limit to try to tame surging infections.The taoiseach, Micheál Martin, announced the move to the highest tier level five on Wednesday night, saying the country’s third lockdown since March was the only way to save lives and stop hospitals becoming overwhelmed.The truth is, that with the presence of the new strain and the pace of growth, this is not a time for nuance in our response. We must apply the brakes to movement and physical interaction across the country.Ireland recorded 1,718 new infections on Wednesday, a record high. The R number is now between 1.6 and 1.8.A six-week lockdown that ended at the start of December had driven infection rates to the lowest in the EU but socialising before and during Christmas let the virus roar back, the chief medical officer, Tony Holohan, told RTE.It’s been one year to the day that health authorities in Wuhan, China reported an unknown pneumonia outbreak to World Health Organization (WHO) colleagues in Beijing.Here’s a look back at what’s happened since in the city where it all started:Dozens of elderly South Korean coronavirus patients were transferred from nursing homes to hospitals this week after criticism that government policy had led to a spike in deaths among the vulnerable residents.South Korea’s total tally of infections passed 60,000 on Thursday, as 967 additional cases were reported.At least 486 of South Korea’s 900 reported deaths were people over the age of 80. Only 40 deaths have been reported among people younger than 60.Meanwhile, some 792 people had been infected at a Seoul prison since 27 November, the Ministry of Justice said earlier on Thursday, leading the ministry to minimise inmate contact and limit access to lawyers amid criticisms that it had inadequately dealt with the infection.Kim Dong-hyun, president of the Korean Society of Epidemiology, said the government was repeating mistakes it had made during waves of infections earlier in the year, similar to mistaken steps in the United States and Europe.“Even if they separate the infected patients to other floors and rooms, transmission is inevitable,” he said.Ben Wallace has urged the British public to respect social distancing rules but said the army would not be deployed to “push people around”.When asked why the army was not being used to clear out crowded public spaces, the defence secretary told Times Radio:We have civilian authorities, police, others to be able to do that.People need to take that responsibility but the army aren’t going to push people around in that way.He added: “Our armed forces are there to support and help the civilian authorities - they have those powers.”As well as deploying 100,000 police and gendarmes across France this evening, other measures aimed at deterring large New Year celebrations include closing 200 Paris  stations at 9pm and shutting down half the lines. Travellers and others will need a sworn declaration attesting to the necessity of being out if they are stopped by police after the curfew at 8pm.The interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, has told police chiefs to break up “clandestine” parties and gatherings and impose instant fines on organisers. Officers will also clamp down on the New Year “tradition” among youths of torching cars. While it is not illegal to invite friends and family to your home, there is a recommended limit of six adults per gathering. The UK’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has said the military “stands ready” to help staff Nightingale hospitals if the NHS exceeds its capacity of critical care beds.Speaking to Times Radio, the defence secretary said: Of course we stand ready to help with Nightingales if the critical pressures go beyond the capacity of the existing NHS.We are on, I think, 17,000 ventilator beds currently being used of a capacity of 21,000.If it starts to tip over there, then of course you’ll see those Nightingales being more active and, yes, we have a number of medical staff.The defence secretary has said the military will not be “imposed” upon the NHS to help with the Covid-19 response, but will be available if help is asked for.Slovakia reported 6,315 new cases of coronavirus, the highest daily number so far, the government said.The country of 5.5 million has recorded 179,543 cases so far, and 2,138 deaths, Reuters reports.Scotland’s ability to give people aged over 50 the new coronavirus vaccine by a spring target will depend on supplies, according to the country’s health secretary.Jeane Freeman also confirmed that Scotland would receive 44,000 doses of the Oxford University and AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine next week, with the four nations continuing to plan supply and delivery, PA Media reports.After this second vaccine’s approval on Wednesday, the Scottish government announced it would be given to people north of the border from Monday along with the rest of the UK nations.But speaking to the BBC’s Good Morning Scotland Programme, Freeman admitted they could not guarantee the target of being on track to vaccinate everyone over 50 by the spring without taking the issue of supplies into account.It can’t be a guarantee because it depends on supplies but what I do know is that our planning is ready.Our modelling and the number of registered vaccinators we have is there.As long as the supplies of both vaccines continue to come through to us then we are ready to deliver the vaccine to all of those in that Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) priority list – so that’s everyone over 50 – in the spring we will get there as long as those supplies arrive."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4447990.1609404628!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"return to school in northern ireland delayed by a week","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPrior to Peter Weir’s announcement, the Stormont Assembly had already been recalled for a hearing on Thursday to discuss school reopening issue.

Special schools and childcare provision will, however, remain open.“All schools must provide supervised learning for vulnerable children and key workers’ children.“I must stress that these decisions are not made lightly as I know the negative impact on children’s learning and mental health and wellbeing of not being in school.“However, particularly after unprecedented levels of positive Covid-19 tests since Christmas, and the pressure this applies to our health service, it is critical that we all must consider the public health and scientific advice as we look forward to brighter days ahead.” – PA"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Every 0.1 degree matters as the world attempts to keep within 1.5-degree rise\u0026lsquo2020 is on course to be the 10th consecutive year of above-normal temperatures\u0026rsquoOver half of Irish people aiming to live more sustainably in 2021, says survey"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4447543.1609344746!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland s climate a year of extremes from wettest february to driest spring","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPhotographs taken from drones showing the extent of widespread flooding in the Shannon river catchment during February 2020, due to 252 per cent of normal rainfall. Photomontage: Paul Scott Graphics StudioAny notion Ireland in 2020 escaped the effects of global heating that is triggering more extreme weather events does not tally with Met Éireann’s data for the year.Looking at those figures, and trends over many years, the fate of Ireland in terms of facing into more variable weather patterns with potential for extremes could not be clearer, according to Met Éireann’s senior climatologist Keith Lambkin.His verdict on the year is emphatic: “In Ireland, 2020 is on course to be the 10th consecutive year of above-normal temperatures. A record-breaking wet February and dry spring in places led to flooding followed by a national hosepipe ban. These are extremes that we expect to see more of as our climate continues to change.”There are enough standout figures to indicate there are no grounds for complacency in relation to extreme weather, though “there might not have been as much damage as other years – and thankfully no deaths”, he says.For starters, Lambkin points to 2.5 times more rainfall in February – 16 of 25 monitoring stations recorded their wettest February ever – and records being broken during “a very unseasonal Storm Ellen” in August. What’s more, 19 of the 20 years of this century have had an above-normal temperature.The picture globally is more obvious in terms of extremes. 2020 has been marked by a record hurricane season in the Atlantic wildfires across the planet, from Siberia to the Americas to Australia accelerating melting ice sheets in polar regions and record temperatures in a great many pockets of the planet.In contrast, Ireland is in a “longer burner” scenario, as he describes it. We have variable weather normally, which will continue, Lambkin adds, but with potential for more extreme events, where roofs may come off stadiums and flood defence walls are broken.So while there may be a perception that 2020 was a relatively benign year, the picture from the perspective of a climatologist looking at trends over a longer period is “very consistent”.DroughtsThat means wetter winters and drier springs including droughts than we have been used to. So rainfall will increase by some 10 per cent, but how that manifests itself will be the critical factor. A complex interaction of rain, winds and tides will often combine, resulting in extreme weather events that will be increasingly evident.In the case of February, it was the amount of rain that fell which was the standout feature. That was quickly followed an extended drying period. “So 2020 is a great example of that trend,” Lambkin explains.Huge variation this year was typified in the switch from record rainfall to parts of the east having their driest spring on record. Countrywide, only 58 per cent of normal rainfall fell in March, April and May. During August, sustained wind and gust records were broken during Storm Ellen.As 2020 draws to a close, the world has experienced the warmest decade on record and one of the three hottest years ever measured, according to the World Meteorological Organization.This is in spite of a La Niña event, Lambkin says – when natural weather patterns cool global temperatures. This is expected to peak in intensity in coming weeks and continue through the early part of next year.Record warm years usually coincide with a strong El Niño event – when surface water in the equatorial Pacific becomes warmer than average and east winds blow weaker than normal, as was the case in 2016.We are now experiencing a La Niña, which has a cooling effect on global temperatures, but has not been sufficient to put a brake on this year’s heat, Lambkin confirms.And despite Covid-19 lockdown, global concentrations of greenhouse gases continue to rise. “The science is complex, but the message is clear: to reduce the extremes, we must reduce the warming,” he adds. “The warming we see globally is also observed here in Ireland and it is this warming that increases the risk of more extreme weather events.”Of most concern, this warming is “on an accelerating path, and there is no real slowing the trend downwards”.The global pictureA report by Christian Aid shows extreme weather events occurred in all continents during 2020, many of which caused death and widespread economic damage.The report – Counting the cost 2020: a year of climate breakdown – details the most destructive climate disasters of the year.Ten of those events cost $1.5 billion or more, with nine of them causing damage worth at least $5 billion. Most of these estimates are based only on insured losses, meaning the true financial costs are likely to be higher.Among them is Storm Ciara, which struck Ireland, the UK and other European countries in February, costing $2.7 billion and killing 14 people.While the report focuses on financial costs, which are usually higher in richer countries because they have more valuable property, some extreme weather events were devastating in poorer countries, though the price tag was lower. South Sudan experienced one of its worst floods on record, which killed 138 people and destroyed the year’s crops.Some of the disasters hit fast, such as Cyclone Amphan, which struck the Bay of Bengal in May, fuelled by record warm temperatures in nearby seas, and caused losses valued at $13 billion in just a few days. Other events unfolded over months, such as floods in China and India, costing an estimated $32 billion and $10 billion respectively.Six of the 10 most costly events took place in Asia, five of them associated with an unusually rainy monsoon. And in Africa, huge locust swarms ravaged crops and vegetation across several countries, causing damage estimated at $8.5 billion. The outbreak has been linked to wet conditions brought about by unusual rains fuelled by climate change.Hurricane seasonIn Europe, two extra-tropical cyclones, Ciara and Alex, had a combined cost of almost $6 billion (€4.88 billion), while the US suffered from both a record-breaking hurricane season and a record-breaking fire season adding up to more than $60 billion (€48.82 billion) in damage.Some less-populated places also suffered the consequences of a warming world. In Siberia, a heatwave during the first half of the year set a record in the city of Verkhoyansk, with temperatures reaching 38 degrees.Heat and drought drove the fires in Bolivia, Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil. While there were no human casualties reported from these events, it had a terrible impact on bioersity and the planet’s capacity to respond to a warmer world.While climate disruption may have influenced these events, many of the countries that bear little responsibility for global warming were affected, the report underlines.“Whether it be floods in Asia, locusts in Africa or storms in Europe and the Americas, climate change has continued to rage in 2020,” said report author Dr Kat Kramer, Christian Aid’s climate policy lead. “It is vital that 2021 ushers in a new era of activity to turn this tide. With president-elect Biden in the White House, social movements across the world calling for urgent action, post-Covid green recovery investment and a crucial UN climate summit hosted by the UK, there is a major opportunity for countries to put us on a path to a safe future.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4447675.1609360463!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland in level 5 third nationwide lockdown to last until at least the end of january","story":"Taoiseach Micheál Martin has announced the return of Level 5 Covid-19 restrictions for at least one month, warning that measures to combat the spread of coronavirus are likely to continue after January 31st.

Photograph: Julien Behal PhotographyPA Wire The country will on Thursday enter a third nationwide lockdown to last until at least the end of January following the rapid spread of coronavirus.Schools will remain closed until January 11th in order to give families 10 days to minimise their social contacts.All non-essential retail will close from Thursday night while social gatherings or visitors in the home are no longer permitted.The public is being told to stay at home and not travel beyond a five-kilometre limit. Indoor and outdoor sports such as in gyms, as well as tennis and golf, will also not be permitted.Speaking at Government Buildings following a special Cabinet meeting, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said the virus is “spreading at a rate that has surpassed the most pessimistic models available to us”.It is understood that Tánaiste Leo Varadkar warned the Cabinet it is unlikely many of the restrictions will be lifted after the mooted end date of January 31st, while Ministers were also warned of the significant impact the move will have on the economy.Mr Varadkar said on Wednesday night the decision to enter a stricter lockdown represented a “very hard blow for workers and employers alike”.The pandemic unemployment payment will remain in place at current rates until the end of March at least, under a memo to be brought to Cabinet next week by the Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys. Some 40,000 additional workers will be laid off in the coming weeks in light of the tightened restrictions. Businesses forced to close from Thursday will be given a double payment for two weeks under the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS).‘Scarring effect’The Taoiseach warned, however, that there will be a long-term “scarring effect” on the economy.“The economic cost is significant. The concern we would have is around the impact on certain sectors and companies in terms of a long-term scarring effect, so we will continue to evaluate that.”While Mr Martin said schools will reopen on January 11th, a Government statement said there would be a “further review on the precise situation in advance of that date”.The Taoiseach said it is “fair to say quite a number of these restrictions will continue beyond the end of this month”.Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said the ban on travel from Britain will be extended until January 6th while a separate ban on travel from South Africa has also been announced until the same date after a similar new strain of Covid-19 was found there.For the second day in a row, a new record for additional cases of the virus was set, with 1,718 positive tests reported. Another 13 Covid-related deaths were also confirmed.Public health officials responded to the worsening figures by telling people to “stay home” so transmission of the virus can be limited.Partial reductionThey also warned of up to 3,000 new cases a day and 1,200 patients in hospital by the end of January, even with partial reduction in transmission of the virus.Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said Ireland was once again in a mitigation phase, meaning resources should be focused on those who are sickest.The Health Service Executive (HSE) warned the testing and contract tracing system is approaching maximum capacity.Continued exponential growth in cases will challenge the system and reduce the marginal benefit it provides, officials said.The benefit of iniduals taking action to prevent infection “far outweighs” what testing and tracing can currently achieve, HSE chief executive Paul Reid told a briefing.Most indicators of the disease have sharply deteriorated in the past week, with a 41 per cent increase in testing and a 129 per cent rise in contact-tracing calls.The number of Covid-19 patients in hospital increased to 455 on Wednesday, up from 411 the previous day. ICU numbers rose slightly to 37, up three.The reproduction number, a measure of the extent to which the virus is transmitting, is currently estimated at 1.6-1.8, and case numbers are doubling every seven to 10 days.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4447677.1609366229!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"level 5 restrictions to remain in place until january 31st says taoiseach","story":"Taoiseach Micheál Martin has announced the return of Level 5 Covid-19 restrictions for at least one month, warning that measures to combat the spread of coronavirus are likely to continue after January 31st.

From January 3rd, up to six guests are permitted.Universities are being asked to continue operating primarily online, while creches will remain open “with protective measures”.Preschools or early learning services will resume from January 4th.The Department of Housing has confirmed that a moratorium on evictions will be reintroduced from midnight until February 10th due to the curbs on travel.Sports matches and events are banned, except for elite levels. Gyms, leisure centres and swimming pools will close and golf and tennis should not take place. Exercise or dance classes will not be allowed.The ban on flights and ferries coming from Britain into the Republic will be extended until January 6th, while travel from South Africa will also be prohibited.The travel ban had been put in place over fears of a new Covid-19 variant identified in southeast England, and was previously extended until December 31st.The new variant, which is believed to be significantly more transmissible, has since been detected in the Republic.New arrangements would be put in place after that date, and “limited repatriation” of Irish residents left stranded in Britain would continue in the meantime, the source said.A different mutant variant of Covid-19 is prevalent in South Africa.‘Deteriorate’In his address to nation, Mr Martin said the new UK strain of Covid-19 was here and the virus was spreading at a rate faster than even the most pessimistic modelling, putting the health service under strain. On Tuesday, 18 per cent of positive cases were this strain.We are already seeing a sharp rise in hospitalisations, he said, almost doubling in one week. The R number is now between 1.6 and 1.8.“The numbers will deteriorate further over the coming days,” he said, and that we will “do what we need to do” to suppress it.This now includes “full scale Level 5 restrictions for at least one month”.He said we now have safe and effective vaccines and factories working around the clock to produce them.“For the first time since this awful disease\u0026nbsplanded on our shores we truly have an end in sight.“The virus can still do immense damage until we have progressed much much further with the vaccination programme.”Until then, we have to continue protecting the vulnerable, he added.“Right now this is what we must do. We must stay at home and eliminate contacts with others now.”In a press conference after his announcement, Mr Martin said: “I think it’s fair to say that quite a lot of these restrictions will continue on beyond the end of this month.”Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said: “The next three months in Ireland are going to be difficult, they will be as difficult as the last nine months were”, adding that while he was optimistic about vaccines it was important not to give people false hope.Mr Varadkar said 50,000 people were laid off on Christmas Eve when hospitality closed but that supports remain.On economic cost, Mr Martin said this was “significant”. Last week’s measures made 50,000 people unemployed and Wednesday’s measures could add 40,000 more.The National Public Health Emergency Team reported 13 coronavirus-related deaths and 1,718 new cases of Covid-19 on Wednesday, more than the previous record reported on Tuesday.A Cabinet meeting was hastily arranged on Tuesday following what was described as an “exponential” increase in the number of cases, the highest number of hospitalisations since May and a massive rise in referrals of suspected cases in the past week.Minsters said they expected numbers to continue to grow sharply over the coming days reflecting increased social contacts at Christmas. “This is perhaps the most dangerous moment for the country since Covid-19 began,” said one Minister, speaking on the basis of anonymity.Vaccine rolloutIreland started its vaccine rollout on Tuesday and Annie Lynch, a 79-year-old Dublin grandmother, on Tuesday became the first person in the Republic to be vaccinated against Covid-19.She was among 2,000 people, mostly frontline health workers, who received the first supply of the vaccine in four hospitals in Dublin, Galway and Cork.Ireland is set to receive an additional one million doses of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine after the EU responded to surging case numbers by ramping up orders for the one treatment it has so far authorised.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4447487.1609338802!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"review of allowances should look at other student groups as well as nurses siptu","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Micheál Martin told the Dáil earlier this month that any exploitation of student nurses would not be tolerated. Photograph: Getty imagesThe Government is expected to look at backdating any changes recommended by a review group to allowances for student nurses to the start of the college year.An interim review of the allowances for first- to third-year student nurses, as well as the situation for those in fourth year who receive a pro-rated salary, is scheduled to be given to Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly on Thursday.This review will look at the current position in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. A second review to be completed in the weeks ahead will examine the situation in the medium to longer term. Meanwhile, the trade union Siptu has argued that the Government should introduce paid allowances for students in other healthcare disciplines such as radiography in addition to nurses and midwives.In its submission on the review Siptu said its terms of the reference were “quite limited”, and that it fully backed students across all grades being paid for their clinical placements in the health service. It said students on placement did not have access to sick leave and could lose out financially if they had to isolate due to contact with a confirmed or suspected Covid-19 case.The union suggested that the Government should consider introducing temporary healthcare assistant contracts for students across all grades.The Government announced the reviews of allowances after it came under strong pressure in recent weeks from the Opposition and the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO) over payments for student nurses who were on placement in hospitals and in relation to what they were being asked to do while on their placement.The Opposition maintained that students were effectively being asked to carry out work – without pay – similar to nurses on the regular roster during their placement rather than it being an opportunity for them to learn. The INMO declined to comment on its submission to the new review. Equal treatmentLast spring the then government appointed student nurses and midwives to paid healthcare assistant posts, a scheme that cost €41 million. Siptu argued strongly at the time that more than 50 student radiographers, who were working on the frontline in hospitals during the Covid-19 pandemic, should receive equal treatment.He said student nurses who were rostered for work should be paid. He said personal experiences of inidual nurses during their placement, which had been raised in the Dáil, should be sent to the HSE and Department of Health for investigation.The HSE said last week that at senior management level it had not received any complaints from student nurses. It said details of all supports available had been brought to the attention of the students.It is understood that the Minister is seeking a report into claims made in the Dáil about the experiences of student nurses during their placements. It is unclear as to whether this report will be carried out by the HSE or by an independent third party."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4447649.1609362750!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"we are shutting schools leaving off licences open as old questions remain","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe UK has now approved two vaccines while Ireland waits for decisions from the European Medicines Agency, which has taken a more “relaxed” approach to authorisations without any visible benefit so far. Photograph: Getty Images Politicians don’t do panic, not officially, but there was more than a touch of desperation to the latest responses of the Irish and British governments to surging Covid-19 case numbers.Both Micheál Martin and Boris Johnson were forced on Wednesday to pull down the shutters on society given the paucity of alternative ways they have of tackling the virus.Almost a year since we started fighting the disease, lockdown remains the fallback response of politicians when they can no longer ignore the warnings delivered by public health officials.With the decision to delay the reopening of schools in the Republic, the final plank in the Government’s strategy for tackling Covid-19 has been swept away.Ministers may contend that the delay is just for a few days, but we have heard a similar refrain before in relation to the closure of schools and the length of lockdowns generally.As a nation we are now shutting our schools and depriving our students of a proper education, while at the same time leaving off-licences open. This even though alcohol has repeatedly been identified as a driver of unsafe socialisation and although the biggest rises in case numbers are occurring in 18- to 34-year-olds, traditionally the biggest consumers of alcohol.The same criticisms can be made of Martin’s speech as were made about previous announcements by taoisigh. No mention of effective quarantine arrangements, for example, or measures to tackle the Border issue.Border countiesWhile case numbers are rising across the country, they are highest now in three Border counties – Donegal, Monaghan and Louth. This has been the trend for months yet no meaningful action has been taken until this month thanks to lockdown decisions in both jurisdictions.And while Johnson’s government may have made a hames of responding to the crisis for much of this year, the UK appears to be leading the way in terms of vaccine approval and genetic research into the virus.Most care-home residents in the North have already been vaccinated, while the Republic’s vaccination programme in nursing homes only starts next week.The UK has now approved two vaccines while Ireland waits for decisions from the European Medicines Agency, which has taken a more “relaxed” approach to authorisations without any visible benefit so far.At this stage it is unclear whether the new UK and South African variants of the virus are as much a threat as they have been made out to be, but if this does prove the case we will be indebted to the work of scientists in London and Porton Down, not Brussels.This new lockdown will work to a point. The Christmas effect will wear off most people will hole themselves up for January. Things will get worse for a while, then improve.But then what?The old questions remain what do you do then? Do you lift restrictions at the end of January, just as we did at the start of this month? Or do you continue the lockdown into the spring, with all that entails?Single digitsThere is no prospect, given the suite of measures being applied, the failings in quarantine and other areas, and the declining compliance in sections of the population, of eliminating the virus or reducing numbers to, say, single digits.Ireland, it has to be said, is not alone in Europe is facing this conundrum. Many countries with previously good track-records have fallen by the wayside including ourselves, with currently the fastest growth in cases on the continent.It follows that the only game in town from now on is the vaccine. Should we go down the emergency authorisation route used by the UK? Should we focus on giving the maximum number of people a first dose of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine, rather than holding two doses for a smaller group?We have to show alacrity and agility in rolling out what options there are if we are to hope to lift the shutters again early(ish) in 2021.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4447692.1609400016!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"q a everything you need to know about level 5 lockdown","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThere has been mixed news on the vaccine front. Photograph: Brendan SmialowskiAFP via Getty ImagesBack to full-blown Level 5 then? And earlier than we thought. Why is it happening now? An emergency Cabinet meeting was held on Wednesday evening, with Covid-19 infections surging and the numbers in hospitals with the virus climbing alarmingly. After the meeting Taoiseach Micheál Martin confirmed the country was moving back to Level 5 in the Living with Covid-19 framework.Why was ramping-up of restrictions agreed to?It is all about the numbers. As the Cabinet was meeting, a further 1,718 cases of coronavirus were announced, bringing the total number of cases since the start of the pandemic to 90,157 in the Republic. Wednesday’s figure was the highest daily tally since the start of the crisis in February. A further 13 deaths relating to Covid-19 were also announced, taking the total number of deaths relating to the virus to 2,226.Are those numbers as terrible as they sound?Yes, and it has been widely anticipated that things are only likely to get worse in the days ahead. “This is perhaps the most dangerous moment for the country since Covid-19 began,” one Minister said ahead of the meeting.It is approaching capacity. With widespread transmission of the virus now occurring in the community, the benefit of iniduals taking action to prevent infection “far outweighs” what testing and tracing can achieve, according to HSE chief executive Paul Reid.So, what was decided at the Cabinet meeting?All Level 5 restrictions were agreed,\u0026nbspincluding the closure on Thursday evening of non-essential retail and the re-imposition of restricted movement to within 5km which came into effect at midnight on Wednesday.Gyms and swimming pools must stay closed from close of business Thursday. Golf and tennis clubs are closed.No visitors are permitted in private homes or gardens (except for essential family reasons such as providing care to children, elderly or vulnerably people).Organised outdoor gatherings are not allowed, people may meet only one person from another household when taking exercise.Funerals are limited to 10 mourners. Wedding parties cut to just six people from January 3rd. People are being asked to work from home.School holidays are to be extended by almost a week and will not reopen until January 11th. The situation is expected to be reviewed before that date.Yes. Even the smallest of New Year’s Eve house parties have been knocked on the head. The Government is ending a concession which would have allowed two families to socialise in one home until December 31st.And rules already in place will remain?Gastro-pubs and restaurants will have to stay closed, although takeaway and delivery services will be allowed. Hairdressers, salons, cinemas, galleries and museums also closed on Christmas Eve and will remain shut. Mass and religious services have moved online only.What about schools?Schools are to remain closed until January 11th. Students were due to return on January 6th. Higher, further and adult education should remain primarily online. Early Learning and Chidcare Services are open with protective measures.The Department of Housing has confirmed that a moratorium on evictions will be reintroduced from midnight on Wednesday until February 10th due to the curbs on travel. The Government have further agreed the ban on air travel and passenger travel on ferries from the UK will be extended to January 6th. As a similar new strain has been identified in South Africa, this ban will also apply to South Africa.And when will all the new restrictions end?It is hard to say for sure. The Taoiseach said the restrictions will be in place until the end of January. However, he admitted many of the measures could remain beyond that point. Tánaiste Leo Varadkar has previously indicated that there is a case for Level 5 restrictions staying in place until those most at risk are vaccinated.What about the vaccines?There has been mixed news on this front. By the end of the week about 40,000 doses of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine should be in the country. This will be followed by 40,000 per week throughout January and early February, which will largely be for nursing homes. Ireland is set to receive an additional one million doses after the EU responded to surging case numbers by ramping up orders for the one treatment it has so far authorised. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said the EU will now take an additional 100 million doses of the vaccine, on top of the 200 million already ordered.And the bad news?There have been delays in the approval of other vaccines Ireland is due to get. The rollout of the Oxford University-AstraZeneca vaccine is unlikely to go ahead as hoped in January after a senior official in the European Medicines Agency said regulators did not have enough information about it. Ireland has ordered 3.3 million doses of this vaccine. It has also ordered 3.3 million doses of the SanofiGSK vaccine, but this is delayed until late 2021.And what about the new variant of Covid-19?At the time of writing seven cases of the new, more transmissible variant of Covid-19, first identified in the UK, have been sequenced in the Republic, along with one in Northern Ireland, according to a new risk assessment from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. It added that while there is no information to suggest that infections with the new strain are more severe, because of increased transmissibility, the impact of the virus is assessed as high in terms of hospitalisations and deaths.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"Northern Ireland secretary could detract from Blair statement of regret, officials feared-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4446948.1609239615!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"mozambique s jihadists gain ground as government declines help","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDisplaced women at the Centro Agrrio de Napala, where hundreds of displaced are sheltered, fleeing attacks by armed insurgents in different areas of Cabo Delgado. Photograph:  Alfredo ZunigaAFP via GettyMozambique has fought a largely losing battle with Islamist insurgents in its northern Cabo Delgado province in 2020, ceding control of important towns and ports despite numerous military operations to retake them.Nonetheless the government remains reluctant to accept help from neighbouring countries to tackle the three-year insurgency in which an estimated 2,400 militants, soldiers and civilians have died, and a further 570,000 have been displaced.That reluctance is likely to embolden the jihadists, who are known locally as Al-Shabaab (“the youth”) and claim to have links with the Islamic State terror group, to intensify their fight in 2021 to carve out a caliphate in the province, regional security analysts believe.Offers of international assistance to deal with the rebellion in resource-rich Cabo Delgado have poured into Maputo since April, when it first became clear that Mozambique’s troops and military strategy were struggling to keep the insurgents at bay.But to date President Filipe Nyusi’s Frelimo party, which has ruled the country since independence from Portugal was negotiated in 1975 after 10 years of war, has relied on private sector security companies from Russia, and more recently South Africa, to fight the militants.However, the escalating situation has left him under pressure to accept large-scale support from western stakeholders and Mozambique’s neighbours, as they fear the insurgency will spill over into their backyards.Liesl Louw, senior researcher with South Africa’s Institute of Security Studies, says the situation in Cabo Delgado is dire, with Al-Shabaab expanding its presence into 10 of the province’s 17 districts in recent weeks.She believes the creation of a regional force supported by a clear African Union-developed military strategy would be the best way to help the Mozambique Defence Armed Forces to defeat the insurgents.“Once this was achieved the AU could call on the international community to finance the plan, but all this would take time. In the interim Al-Shabaab is likely to continue with its tactics, given its successes in 2020,” she says.However, Louw says the government of the former Portuguese colony appears to be reluctant to accept outside help because of fears it might undermine the country’s hard-won sovereignty.“There is also the issue of national pride,” she says, “and a belief that Mozambicans should deal with their own problems”.Joint operationsMozambique did sign an agreement in late November with Tanzania to launch joint operations to combat Al-Shabaab, as Nyusi has said some of its recruits and leaders are from the east African nation, which shares its southern border with Cabo Delgado.But Jasmine Opperman, a South Africa-based analyst with Armed Conflict Location and Events Data, a violence monitoring group, has questioned how effective the collaboration can be against the terror group, and whether civilians will get caught in the middle again.“What will be the cost of these limited cross-border operations given Al-Shabaab is likely to intensify its war on the back of its successes in 2020? Will we see more civilians targeted by both sides?” she wonders.Al-Shabaab has been accused of brutally killing civilians this year by international rights groups, but so too have Mozambican troops, which has highlighted the government’s own governance failures in the province.Nyusi has repeatedly blamed foreign extremists for the insurgency, rather than seeing it as a home-grown uprising by the province’s marginalised population.But researchers say the unrest is strongly linked to the levels of poverty and inequality in the province, which has vast mineral and gas resources that multinational corporations aim to extract, with little discernible benefit to locals.Delivering his state-of-the-nation address on December 16th, Nyusi confirmed Mozambique had received offers of help from around the world, but he seemed to suggest that foreign troop interventions were not a viable option.“We Mozambicans need to develop our own skills,” he maintained. “We will be on the front line of defending the country. Nobody will do it for us.”Indeed, the government’s reluctance to embrace outside help is evident in how it has engaged with the European Union (EU) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) on their offer of assistance in Cabo Delgado.The EU has indicated it will provide military training for Mozambique’s troops as well as medical and humanitarian support, if international human rights and the rule of law are adhered to.SADC, the region’s main intergovernmental body, has also offered to help, but it has said it first needs Mozambique to present it with a credible plan that outlines how and where it should get involved.However, by mid-December Mozambique’s negotiations with both bodies had started to falter, despite the urgency of the situation.‘We cannot move’EU foreign affairs commissioner Josep Borrell publicly confirmed on December 16th that it had yet to receive “the green light” to send its security experts to assess the situation in Cabo Delgado even though the EU team was ready to go.“We have problems in Mozambique: we cannot move, we cannot travel around,” he told the European Parliament.SADC’s defence and security organ also took part in a rescheduled meeting with Mozambique’s government on December 14th, but the talks in Maputo to address the crisis were postponed until January 2021 without any signs of progress.In light of the difficult negotiations and escalating violence, Louw says it would be naive to think foreign military assistance could be rolled out in Mozambique before July.“If a regional force is going to help Mozambique it will need 30,000 troops to tackle 5,000 insurgents,” she says. “This will take time to organise, even if things go according to plan, as SADC is weak in terms of its capacity.”Opperman also sees little chance of the tide turning against Al-Shabaab next year, as the capacity and willingness of the Mozambican government to accept regional help is limited.“The army will most likely focus on violence hot spots to give a false sense to the world that the crisis is under control, rather than allowing foreign boots on the ground to help tackle Al-Shabaab decisively,” she says.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4447988.1609401754!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus uk variant discovered in us in man with no travel history","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA sign warns motorists of turkeys crossing Highway 86 near The Good Samaritan Society care center.

Photograph: David ZalubowskiAP PhotoThe first reported US case of the Covid-19 variant that has been seen in the United Kingdom has been discovered in Colorado, Governor Jared Polis announced, adding urgency to efforts to vaccinate Americans.The variant was found in a man in his 20s who is in isolation southeast of Denver in Elbert County and has no travel history, state health officials said.Elbert County is a mainly rural area of rolling plains at the far edge of the Denver metro area that includes a portion of Interstate 70, the state’s main east-west road.Colorado Politics reported there is a second suspected case of the variant in the state, according to Dwayne Smith, director of public health for Elbert County.Both of the people were working in the Elbert County community of Simla.Neither of them are residents of that county, expanding the possibility of the variant’s spread throughout the state.The Colorado State Laboratory confirmed the virus variant, and the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention was notified.Scientists in the UK believe the variant is more contagious than previously identified strains.The vaccines being given now are thought to be effective against the variant, Colorado health officials said in a news release.For the moment, the variant is likely still rare in the US, but the lack of travel history in the first case means it is spreading, probably seeded by travellers from Britain in November or December, said scientist Trevor Bedford, who studies the spread of Covid-19 at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Centre in Seattle.“Now I’m worried there will be another spring wave due to the variant,” Mr Bedford said.“It’s a race with the vaccine, but now the virus has just gotten a little bit faster.”Public health officials are investigating other potential cases and performing contact tracing to determine the spread of the variant throughout the state.“There is a lot we don’t know about this new Covid-19 variant, but scientists in the United Kingdom are warning the world that it is significantly more contagious.“The health and safety of Coloradans is our top priority, and we will closely monitor this case, as well as all Covid-19 indicators, very closely,” Mr Polis said.The discovery of the new variant led the CDC to issue new rules on Christmas Day for travellers arriving to the US from the UK, requiring they show proof of a negative Covid-19 test.California has announced its first confirmed case of the new and apparently more contagious variant.Governor Gavin Newsom announced the Southern California case during an online conversation with Dr Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.Mr Newsom did not provide any other details about the person who was infected.ChinaChinese health regulators have given conditional approval to a coronavirus vaccine developed by a state-owned company.The two-dose Covid-19 vaccine is the first approved for general use in China. The approval comes as the country has started to vaccinate 50 million people before the Lunar New Year holiday in February.Chen Shifei, the deputy commissioner of China’s National Medical Products Administration, told a news conference that conditional approval means research is still ongoing and the company will be required to submit follow-up data as well as reports of any adverse effects after the vaccine is sold on the market.The vaccine was developed by the Beijing Institute of Biological Products, a subsidiary of state-owned conglomerate Sinopharm. The company announced that preliminary data from last-stage trials had shown it to be 79.3 per cent effective.It is an inactive vaccine, which means the virus was grown in a lab and then killed. The germ is then injected into the body to generate an immune response.Final proof of its effectiveness will depend on publication of more data.Sinopharm is one of at least five Chinese developers that are in a global race to create vaccines for the disease that has killed more than 1.8 million people.In addition to the emergency vaccinations already under way, China plans to start vaccinating high-risk people such as seniors and those with existing chronic illnesses. Officials did not say what percentage of the population they will vaccinate in China.“This is different in every country but the general thinking is that it has to reach 60 per cent to protect the entire population,” said Zeng Yixin, vice minister of the National Health Commission.Under emergency use, 4.5 million doses have already been given, including 3 million in the past two weeks, Mr Zeng said.Practically, the conditional approval means that the drug or product in question may be restricted for certain age groups, according to Tao Lina, a former government immunologist.The vaccine is already under mass production, though officials did not answer questions about current production capacity.Approval of China’s vaccine could also mean hope for countries around the world who may not have access to the Pfizer or Moderna shots, which have stricter cold chain requirements. Sinopharm’s vaccine is able to be stored between 2 to 8 degrees, or a normal refrigeration temperature.Sinopharm’s vaccine has already been approved in the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, and is slated for use next in Morocco.Other countries have also been buying doses of another Chinese vaccine candidate, made by Sinovac Biotech. Turkey received the shipments this week of 3 million doses. Indonesia and Brazil have all purchased Sinovac’s vaccines.China is eager to distribute its vaccines globally, driven by a desire to repair the damage to its image by the pandemic that started a year ago in the city of Wuhan.Chinese president Xi Jinping has vowed to donate the vaccine as a public good to the world and China has joined Covax, a global plan for equal distribution and access.South KoreaDozens of elderly South Korean coronavirus patients were transferred from nursing homes to hospitals this week after criticism that government policy had led to a spike in deaths among the vulnerable residents.South Korea’s total tally of infections passed 60,000 on Thursday, as 967 additional cases were reported.At least 486 of South Korea’s 900 reported deaths were people over the age of 80. Only 40 deaths have been reported among people younger than 60.At least 316 residents of nursing hospitals or nursing homes have died, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) said on Thursday. When the KDCA reported a record 40 deaths in one day on Tuesday, 70 per cent of them were residents of nursing homes or nursing hospitals.“Since most of the hospitalised in the nursing homes are elderly and with underlying conditions, they are at a high risk of death when infected with Covid-19,” Choi Dae-zip, president of the Korean Medical Association, told a news conference.“They should be given priority to hospital beds and receive proper treatment.”Kim Dong-hyun, president of Korean Society of Epidemiology, said the government was repeating mistakes it had made during waves of infections earlier in the year, similar to mistaken steps in the United States and Europe.“Even if they separate the infected patients to other floors and rooms, transmission is inevitable,” he said.At a nursing hospital in the Guro district of Seoul, at least 102 residents and 69 medical staff have been infected, while seven residents have died of the coronavirus since the first case was reported at the facility on December 15th.Another 22 cases were linked to the cluster there.JapanNew coronavirus infections in Tokyo hit a record high of more than 1,300 on Thursday raising fears of an explosion in cases, local media reported, and New Year’s Eve celebrations were curtailed as the country battles a third wave of the pandemic.Scores of flights were also cancelled as heavy snowfall hit several areas of Japan on Thursday.Japanese prime minister Yoshihide Suga has urged people to celebrate New Year quietly, and avoid non-essential outings, amid the twin crises.Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways cancelled or planned to cancel a total of around 140 flights, public broadcaster NHK reported, adding that a bullet train had suspended services in some parts of the northern Yamagata prefecture.Japan has been battling a third wave of Covid-19 infections in recent weeks and on Monday started barring the entry of non-resident foreign nationals after detecting variants of the virus from Britain and South Africa.Japanese Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said on Wednesday the government may have to consider declaring a state of emergency if the number the Covid-19 cases grow.Japan’s Imperial Household Agency has cancelled an annual New Year’s event set for January 2nd, at which Emperor Naruhito and other imperial family members were due to greet well wishers.People have been asked to stagger visits to shrines, traditionally popular destinations over New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day.“I want to emphasise again that there is no New Year holidays for the coronavirus. I urge people to spend quiet holidays staying at home with families,” Kyodo news agency quoted Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike as telling reporters on Thursday.About 3,400 people have died in Japan from around 231,000 cases during the pandemic so far. – ReutersAPEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4443817.1608634385!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"it s time to pop ireland s anglophone bubble","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t‘Ireland is in an Anglophone bubble that will be a disadvantage now that its future lies in the European Union.’Ireland is in an Anglophone bubble that will be a disadvantage now that its future lies in the European Union while both Britain and the United States are in retreat as global powers. It’s time for the bubble to be popped.Irish people coast on the status of English as an international lingua franca. To a certain extent this is an advantage – Irish speechwriters are in demand in Brussels – but it is also marginalising.The Anglophone bubble means that Irish people are more familiar with the dynamics of the US Congress or Westminster than they are with matters with quite direct import for the country and the internal EU balance of power, such as who may replace German chancellor Angela Merkel or the upcoming presidential race in France.It may be contributing to the shortage of Irish people joining EU institutions. Just five Irish citizens entered the concours recruitment programme for the EU institutions in the last five years – far below the level needed to replace those retiring, and potentially making for a shortage in influential positions in years to come.For Ireland to function effectively in the EU, this will have to change.With Britain’s exit from the EU, Ireland has lost a major ally in defending its interests. To advocate for itself now, the country will need multilingual advocates who are fluent not just in different languages but also in the history and culture of our EU allies.Painfully often, the Irish figures in any given room in Brussels are linguistically limited, and it shapes their opportunities and how people behave towards them. It’s assumed that English should be used for the Irish person’s benefit, that translation will be required if other languages are used, and it excludes the Irish person from conversations, opportunities, and involvement.The same goes for most British, American, or Australians as fellow Anglophones, but in Brussels now it’s just the Irish in the room.Discussion of the issue often rapidly descends into psychodrama and self-flagellation, with an outpouring of old grievances about school experiences and complex feelings towards Irish.Please resist reacting to this article along these old familiar lines. There’s nothing surprising or unusual in the low level of foreign language skills we have in Ireland. It’s not due to a unique failing in our schooling system.This is a phenomenon that is common to all the Anglophone countries, and it’s because we can get away with it. The sheer amount of media produced by Britain and the US and their cultural clout means that Irish people can easily live in a comfortable bubble of English and never need venture out of it. Exposure to other languages is simply drowned out by the volume.The situation is different for people in countries in which the dominant language is something other than English. They will come up against English all the time, whether in the films on in the cinema or the songs of their favourite popstars, alongside the imperative that to learn broadens horizons.We err in Ireland in sometimes thinking that we can only afford one other non-English language. A typical European might in different scenarios grow up using a local language, one or more “official” national tongues, English, and whatever is spoken in the countries next door. Multilingualism is a global norm, not the exception, as is several languages being used within families.In a typical day in my job, I might be responding to emails in French, organising a delivery in Dutch, making calls in Italian, following a press conference in any of the other 27 EU languages, and with a cúpla focal here and there as Gaeilge through a press conference with Micheál Martin or texts with a friend.As is the norm, my comfort level in different languages varies according to the scenario and how frequently I’m using them. Mostly, my speech is clumsy and error-strewn, but every bit of knowledge I have of languages is concretely and practically useful in my everyday life.How to pop the Anglophone bubble in Ireland is a challenging question, but I do have one idea based on my own experience.Classroom learning of languages never worked for me. But I found exposure to real-life use of languages transformational. Whether visiting the Gaeltacht as a teenager or on an exchange to Italy, I found that when the language was used around me and I needed to adopt it to communicate, I became conversant within weeks.My suggestion is therefore that Ireland should become the EU’s strongest advocate for expanding take-up of the Erasmus programme and extending it to exchanges at secondary school level. It’s something that has the potential to transform the lives of young people, but may also be seriously important for Ireland’s strategic interests in the years ahead.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4447645.1609371616!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk mps back brexit trade agreement by 521 votes to 73","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLabour leader Keir Starmer during the debate in the House of Commons on the Brexit Bill on Wednesday. Photograph: UK ParliamentJessica TaylorPA WireMPs at Westminster have voted overwhelmingly for a trade and co-operation agreement with the European Union which Boris Johnson hailed as the historic resolution of Britain’s relationship with its European neighbours. The House of Commons backed the deal by\u0026nbsp521 votes to 73, as Labour voted with the government while all other opposition parties voted against.The deal is on the verge of becoming law after it received an unopposed third reading in the House of Lords late on Wednesday night.All but two Conservative MPs backed the deal, with Brexiteers Owen Paterson and John Redwood abstaining because it leaves the terms of the Northern Ireland protocol unchanged. Thirty-five Labour MPs and former party leader Jeremy Corbyn, who currently sits as an Independent, abstained and one voted against.Keir Starmer said Labour was backing the Bill giving effect to the deal because the only alternative was to leave the post-Brexit transition without a deal. But he criticised the deal as lacking provision for services which make up 80 per cent of the British economy and said Mr Johnson had failed to resolve the dilemma at the heart of his negotiating strategy.“The prime minister pretends that he has got sovereignty, and zero tariffs and zero quotas. He has not: the moment he exercises the sovereignty to depart from the level playing field, the tariffs kick in. This is not a negotiating triumph,” he said.‘Torn’Mr Paterson, a former Northern Ireland secretary, said he felt “very torn” because although he wished the agreement well, he could not vote for a measure that would leave the North under EU regulations and customs rules. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said he believed that, because of Brexit and the Conservative government’s handling of it, the United Kingdom was coming to an end.“To my unionist neighbours, I want to say this: look at where the DUP has led you and look at where London has left you.\u0026nbspIt is my firm conviction that we can build a new society together – one built on mutual respect, which recognises and celebrates all our rich traditions,” he said.\u0026nbsp“Young people everywhere rejected Brexit. Thankfully, in Northern Ireland, young people will have a choice again. They will be able to choose a European future again. They will be able to choose an open, liberal and modern future, which is a prize worth fighting for.”AcrimonyTom Tugendhat, the Conservative chairman of the foreign affairs committee, said that after years of acrimony and anger about Britain’s relationship with Europe, it was time to move on.“I am going to vote, alongside members of the Dáil and parliaments around Europe, to back this treaty. I am going to recognise that the European Union has made an offer and we have accepted it, and that we have made one and they have accepted it, and I am going to respect that,” he said.“We have been in the EU for only 47 years – that is the life of a Hohenzollern empire. We are leaving the EU, just as Germany left that empire, and we will find a new way of working together. This deal is but the first step on that journey it is just the concordat that bridges the channel and looks to future co-operation.” – Additional reporting PA\u0026nbspDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Ideas have even been crowd sourced through social media.  “Young soldiers with fresh ideas, combined with experienced instructors and professionals have attacked it in a different way,” Lt Col Page said. Camouflaging a tank at ranges up to 300 metres is almost impossible as soldiers will almost always spot the vehicle. Equally, beyond 1000 metres, the colours meld in the visible spectrum so tanks look just like black boxes and camouflage patterns add little. Historically most anti-tank weapon system engagements occur between 300 and 1,000 metres. The new design has been targeted to work best between these ranges. Introducing confusion in man or machine for even a couple of seconds could make the difference between the enemy creating a smoking hull or receiving the business end of 60-tonnes of British Defence policy.“If I can delay that targeting cycle, that\u0027s a win, because this thing doesn\u0027t operate on its own,” says Major Charlie Brunskill. “Once an anti-tank team shows itself and goes through that cycle, if I can add three more seconds to that I can perhaps get a shot off first.” The new design consists of a mixture of pixellated blocks of five colours, with different thermal and infra-red properties. The resultant camouflage makes it hard for soldiers and drones to recognise what they are seeing.Recent experience from the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan shows how vulnerable tanks can be to airborne assets.However, enemy weapon systems relying on Artificial Intelligence to recognise the visual, thermal or electronic signature of a tank can also be spoofed.Multi-spectral paint schemes and modern technology can confuse drones into thinking the tank is a different vehicle, or even in a slightly different place.It means enemy drones could expend valuable weapons unnecessarily, or be unable to fire as they cannot understand what they are looking at.  David Willey, curator of the Tank museum, says painting the tank in a modern design that is not “boring standard Nato green” also has a psychological effect on friend and foe alike. “Never underestimate the impact of heavy armour: what it looks like and what its presence is,” he said.Major Brunskill agrees, saying interest in the concept has been “phenomenal”. “It’s like giving the Armoured Corps a new uniform.“It\u0027s just like putting stripes on your car as a kid it goes 10 per cent faster,” he said. “That has an effect on the enemy as well.” Lt Col Page says the new design is not “bumper-sticker vanity”.“It not only increases survivability, it makes the best of community interest around vehicles and around innovation in a way that we wouldn\u0027t normally do. “This has created a buzz in the armoured community because it shown that really low level innovation can have a massive impact. It’s about pride in the vehicle and people.”He said the Challenger 2 equipped Cavalry regiments in the army are clamouring to get the new design. “That\u0027s exactly what we want.”“For defence I think that really shows what an enterprise we are. It’s not just the soldier in the vehicle. It’s the links to industry, science, the museum and the community of interest. We couldn’t do what we do without it. “These innovations used to be the preserve of specialist units. We’ve democratised that process.“You can deceive the technology and the human.

So it was at the Commons EU debate on Wednesday. Barely had the Prime Minister begun his opening sallies when the leader of the Scottish National Party in the House of Commons, Ian Blackford, intervened – leaping out of his seat like a performing killer whale at the first mention of sovereignty over British waters. Winding up the SNP’s Westminster spokesman does not demand the subtlety of a crack fly-fisher – a certain cliché involving barrels and seafood springs to mind – and Mr Blackford duly glowered as Boris raved about mackerel stocks and juicy Scottish cod.However, the PM, although feigning a conciliatory air, was in an impish mood and deployed a favourite tease – casually branding the SNP the Scottish Nationalist Party.It was simple as netting minnows, but devastatingly effective. Mr Blackford took the bait like a salmon snapping at a cunningly tied fly.“The name of my party is the Scottish National Party!”, he carped with indignation. “I am using the word nationalist with a small ‘n’”, smirked the PM. “What this bill does is take back control ... ”At this Mr Blackford resurfaced, spluttering, but Boris dismissed him with an airy cast of the hand.He redoubled his provocation as the shoal of SNP MPs bristled like sticklebacks.“The declared position of the Scottish National – nationalist – Party is to hand control of the very waters we’ve just reclaimed straight back to the EU!” Amid baying and chuntering, the Leader of the Opposition battled vainly to inject some sobriety into proceedings.He warned of “an avalanche of checks, bureaucracy and red tape”. Like the runner-up in the angling contest, trying to preserve his dignity, he reluctantly conceded “a thin deal is better than no deal” and called for unity across the House. The sentiment was noble, the delivery limp as a dead lamprey. Theresa May – not one of Parliament’s obvious wind-up merchants – managed to troll the Government and Labour simultaneously by insisting that if Sir Keir Starmer wanted a better deal, he should have voted for hers.“I will take no lectures from the Leader of the Opposition”, she crowed, wagging a finger as she administered her verbal king. For three decades, Tory splits over Europe have been a fixture of politics now MPs massed, thrashing in violent agreement. The Father of the House and erstwhile Remainer Sir Peter Bottomley ironically thanked Mr Blackford for his 25-minute “lesson in humility”, before endorsing the deal.ERG stalwart Bernard Jenkin accused a Labour opponent of quibbling “about whether the glass is half-full or half-empty”, and endeavoured to plug the gap with a mention of the soon-to-be-scrapped tampon tax. Sir Iain Duncan Smith continued the ritual anointing and classical metaphor. Gesturing at the PM, he thanked “my Right Honourable friend, the member for Athens”, chuckling unaccompanied at his own joke. Here followed a lesson from the gospel of St Mark Francois, who regaled the chamber with verses from Isaiah.He came unarmed and spoke of peace, yet demanded constant vigilance “in case one day, someone – perhaps the Leader of the Opposition – should try and take us back in.” Like a narwhal, or possibly a Kipper, this ERG Spartan wasn’t laying down his spear just yet. Ian Blackford then unveiled a bewildering panorama of historical references in defence of Scottish exceptionalism from the Medieval Auld Alliance and Hanseatic League right up until that pesky Act of Union put paid to their Europhilia. Centuries passed in a heartbeat, although in the chamber time stood still as he droned on.The Corbynistas, too, tended the flame like unrepentant Jacobins, vowing disobedience in honour of their fallen comrade. However, these flounderings seemed a drop in the ocean compared to the sea of troubles against which the PM and his fleet had taken arms – and prevailed. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"republican senator contest electoral college win joe biden","story":"A Republican senator on Wednesday announced that he would object next week when Congress convenes to certify the electoral college vote, in a doomed attempt to upend Joe Biden’s victory.Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri broke with Mitch McConnell, Senate Majority Leader, and other prominent Republicans in declaring he would contest the certification of electoral college vote, following calls to do so from President Donald Trump.The challenge, which would prompt a floor debate and force senators to go on the record as to whether they believe there were voting irregularities in the November 3 election, means there will be at least a short delay in Mr Biden’s confirmation.Mr Trump will inevitably lose that vote, as Democrats control the House and a number of Senate Republicans have publicly recognised Mr Biden’s victory, including Senator Mitt Romney, who has called the president’s refusal to accept the election dangerous.Even in the unlikely event that Mr Trump were to prevail in the Senate, where Mike Pence, Vice President, would be in position to cast a tie-breaking vote if needed, the challenge still would fail given the House vote.Mr McConnell and other senior Republicans had sought to avoid a vote that will see Republicans forced to take sides either with or against the president. Mr Hawley, a constitutional lawyer, said he felt compelled to highlight purported election irregularities despite there being no evidence of any.“Millions of voters concerned about election integrity deserve to be heard,” he wrote on Twitter. “I will object on January 6 on their behalf.”“At the very least, Congress should investigate allegations of voter fraud and adopt measures to secure the integrity of our elections. But Congress has so far failed to act,” Mr Hawley said. The 40-year-old senator is rumoured to be positioning himself as a potential 2024 presidential candidate, and his move could be designed to appeal to the tens of millions of loyal Trump supporters.The Department of Justice, the Department for Homeland Security, election boards, judges, and other authorities have found no evidence of election malfeasance that impacted the President-elect Biden’s decisive win. The US Supreme Court has also declined to intervene. Any member of the House or Senate can contest the electoral votes on January 6. On Wednesday, Mr Pence refused to sign on to a plan that would upend Congress certifying the election for Mr Biden. Representative Louie Gohmert and Arizona\u0027s slate of Republican Electoral College “electors” filed a federal lawsuit to get a judge to say Mr Pence has the power to pick pro-Trump electors when he presides over the January Congressional session.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"new year honours charity workers mps campaigners recognised","story":"The Queen\u0027s honours acknowledge hundreds of people for services to community or British national life.Recipients are selected by committees of civil servants from nominations made by the government and the public.In descending order, the main honours are knighthoods, CBE, OBE and Member of the Order of the British Empire, or MBE. Knights are addressed as sir or dame, followed by their name.Recipients of the other honours have no title, but they can put the letters after their names.Here are a some who were recognised as part of Queen Elizabeth II\u0027s New Year\u0027s honours list. Geoffrey Cox QC, the former attorney general who last year controversially advised the Government that it was legal to prorogue Parliament for five weeks, has been awarded a knighthood. The advice from the Consevative MP for Torridge and West Devon was later overturned when the Supreme Court unanimously ruled the prorogation of Parliament as unlawful. Angela Eagle, the long serving Labour MP for Wallasey in Merseyside who is best known for her work promoting women’s and minority rights, is made a dame for parliamentary and political service.A 106-year-old volunteer who dedicated more than 50 years to a children’s charity has become the oldest ever recipient of an honour.  Anne Baker, from Salisbury, Wiltshire, was given an MBE for charitable services to the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC).Mrs Baker said it was a “great surprise” to receive the award, adding: “I’ve just been helping the NSPCC for about 50 years – I always have the party in my garden which normally makes about £1,000 a year, which is lovely.”“We couldn’t hold it this year but we still managed to raise £4,000.”For 11 years she has held a birthday coffee morning for the charity, usually raising more than £1,500. However, when it was cancelled this year due to the pandemic, she set up a JustGiving page in the hope technology could help raise funds.Her online appeal attracted donations from as far away as Austria and the United States, raising more than £4,000.The sister of murdered MP Jo Cox has described being made an MBE for her work fighting social isolation as “bittersweet”.Kim Leadbeater, an ambassador for the Jo Cox Foundation, was recognised by the Palace for stepping up the campaign during the pandemic as millions were suddenly cut off from their support networks.Ms Cox, a 41-year-old mother of two and Labour MP was shot and stabbed by a far-right extremist in 2016.Following her sister’s death, Ms Leadbeater began promoting causes Mrs Cox had campaigned about.She founded the Great Get Together – a series of events within communities to help people create ties and help those who are lonely to build support networks. Those meetings took  place online during the pandemic.Following the announcement she is to become an MBE, Ms Leadbeater said: “I am very honoured and humbled to receive this recognition.“I would have much preferred for my sister to be here carrying on the work she started on loneliness and so much else, but while this is sadly a bittersweet moment for our family, I know that Jo would be extremely proud.“For me this is not a personal achievement – it is an acknowledgment of the many people who have worked alongside me since Jo’s murder to make a difference on the issues she cared deeply about.”The parents of a 15-year-old girl who died from a severe allergic reaction after eating a baguette on a plane are to accept an OBE.Tanya and Nadim Ednan-Laperouse, who set up the Natasha Allergy Research Foundation in the name of their daughter, said the award is a tribute to their child.Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, from Fulham, west London, died of anaphylaxis after unknowingly eating sesame contained in an artichoke, olive and tapenade baguette she had bought from Pret a Manger at Heathrow Airport.She fell ill and collapsed on a flight to Nice in July, 2016.In a statement, her parents said: “We are humbled and honoured to accept these awards in the name of our beloved daughter Natasha.“Natasha was a passionate believer in social justice and the bright torch that she carried for others inspires us every day.”The honour is for their services to charity and for people with allergic disease. The foundation they set up intends to establish a research centre at the University of Southampton to find a cure for allergies.Mr and Mrs Ednan-Laperouse also managed to win new protections for food allergy sufferers under the introduction of “Natasha’s Law”, which will require all businesses in England and Northern Ireland to include full ingredients labelling on pre-packaged food from October 2021.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pacific islanders prepare welcome 2021 cities worldwide alter","story":"Pacific islanders have welcomed in 2021, with New Zealand and the small island nations of Tonga and Samoa the first in the world to hold muted celebrations on a New Year\u0027s Eve like not other.  In Auckland, small crowds gathered to watch the firework celebrations. New Zealand has largely defeated the coronavirus pandemic, with just 25 deaths recorded during the pandemic.With ongoing coronavirus restrictions on every continent, usual mass public celebrations have been scrapped in favour of stay-at-home orders and limits to gatherings as coronavirus cases continue to spread.  From the New York Times Square ball drop going virtual to a ban on watching the fireworks from Sydney’s harbour, below is a rundown of the unprecedented steps some of the world’s major cities are taking this New Year’s Eve to prevent the spread of Covid-19.    The Australian city’s world-famous midnight firework display over its iconic harbour normally draws around one million people. This year, it is still going ahead, but it has been slashed from 12 minutes to just seven and the smaller 9pm display has been cancelled.  Locals will also struggle to see it up close in person. On December 31, Sydney’s city-centre - encompassing the Central Business District (CBD) and waterfront vantage points in parts of north Sydney - will effectively be a no-go zone.  All fireworks viewing events in the area have been cancelled unless they have a permit, and entry will only be allowed for residents who live there or up to 10 of their guests, all of whom must have a special NYE pass.Household gatherings will be restricted to five visitors, while those gathering at outdoor events will see the cap reduced from 50 to 30.  Those with bookings at restaurants, hotels or bars will also be allowed in, but all hospitality businesses must adhere to the one person per four square metres rule.  Most waterfront parks and viewing areas will be closed on the night, but residents further out of the centre will be allowed to gather in local public spaces so long as they are socially distanced.  New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian said: “My strong message to everyone is to watch the fireworks on TV.”Seen globally as a model for containing the outbreak of the virus, many cities on the island of Taiwan are preventing public attendance at firework displays, instating encouraging locals to watch the festivities in TV.But in the capital of Taipei, the city government is allowing in-person attendance to its New Year\u0027s events, as well as broadcasting them live - including fireworks set off from the outside of the iconic Taipei 101, once the world\u0027s tallest building.The number of attendees permitted at the main viewing spot has been slashed in half from the 80,000 originally planned to 40,000. All those in attendance will be required to wear a mask and register personal details to authorities for track and trace.Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je defended the move not to cancel the activities, saying that Taiwan had no community transmission and all correct precautions were being taken.Don\u0027t be defeated by irrational fear, he told reporters.The government has been unnerved by Taiwan’s first domestic transmission since April, confirmed this month, and first case of the British variant, announced on Wednesday. It confirmed a second case on Thursday.    Any thoughts of roaming through the streets of Paris with friends and a bottle of champagne are off – France currently has an 8pm to 6am curfew in place and it won’t be lifted for New Year’s Eve.  Bars, restaurants and nightclubs will remain closed as well and large gatherings in public are still banned, with police set to be out patrolling to break up groups of more than 10.  That means most people will be celebrating from home, which is allowed for up to six people so long as they respect the curfew.100,000 police officers are being mobilised across France to break up parties, while half of the lines on the Paris metro will be closed.  The traditional fireworks have been cancelled, and instead, Paris will be hosting one of the world’s more ambitious virtual events to mark the end of the year.  Electronic music pioneer Jean-Michel Jarre will be playing a free, livestreamed virtual reality concert from “inside” the Notre-Dame cathedral.  Under the patronage of Unesco, Jarre will perform a 45-minute set titled Welcome to the Other Side in a 3D recreation of the Paris landmark, which has been closed to the public since it was devastated by a fire in April 2019.  Dubai will host a record-breaking, live-streamed concert, with the glam-rock band Kiss performing in front of the Atlantis Hotel.‘Kiss 2020 Goodbye’ has a fireworks budget of $1 million, and while there will be no in-person attendees, a further $750,000 has been set aside in order to ‘pandemic-proof’ the event.Gene Simmons, the bassist, told The  that the fireworks will be “the biggest pyro show since Krakatoa.”A team of 400 people have been drafted in to construct the stage, while 6,000 Covid tests will be taken by workers in order to ensure the virus does not spread.Those wishing to stream the event can do so at a cost of £39.  More so than massive parties, part of the New Year’s Eve ritual in Japan involves visits to the country’s biggest Shinto shrines and temples.  One of the most popular is Tokyo’s revered Meiji Shrine, which usually sees around 3 million visitors paying their respects between December 31 and January 3 alone.  But this year, century-old Meiji will close its doors over the country’s most important holiday for the first time since the end of the Second World War, urging people to visit another day instead.  Other religious sites are asking visitors to book tickets ahead so they can control the crowds.  Elsewhere in the city, nightclubs are still open, but most of the city’s major mass countdown events have been moved online or cancelled altogether.  That includes the hugely popular annual Scramble Crossing event at a giant, five-way pedestrian crossing in Shibuya neighbourhood, where around 100,000 people from around Japan normally gather to usher in the new year.  To limit crowds and discourage out-of-towners, city railway and subway operators are also scrapping their usual all-night service throughout the megalopolis, with Tokyo  cancelling train services on December 31 and January 1.Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has also suspended a domestic travel programme as he confirmed six cases of the mutant coronavirus strain, defected in arrivals from the UK and UAE.      New Year’s Eve in New York City is synonymous with Times Square and its annual ball drop, a century-old tradition that normally sees up to a million gather to watch the 12-feet-wide Waterford Crystal ball lowered to mark midnight.   The festivities include music performances and special guests who are invited to “trigger” the ball drop.  This year, however, police are cordoning off Times Square to the general public and organisers have had to satisfy themselves with a much more limited affair that will be streamed live.  The only guests able to attend in person will be 40 essential workers, such as a grocery store employee, a Covid-19 tester and a teacher, plus their families. They will all be in separate, socially distanced sections.  There will still be a show, fittingly including a performance by Gloria Gaynor of her signature song, “I Will Survive.”   Health officials for both the city and state have advised New Yorkers not to gather in large groups and to instead celebrate with just those in their household.    Often described as the biggest New Year’s Eve celebration in the world, the Brazilian city’s mega-parties are usually centred around its kilometres of tropical beaches.  Copacabana alone reportedly drew around three million people last year, with fireworks launched from rafts in the sea and all-night live music and dancing.  This year, however, Brazilian authorities have announced that they are sealing off the entire 30km stretch of city coastline for New Year’s Eve, including popular party spots Copacabana, Ipanema and Barra da Tijuca.  The firework displays have been banned, and even plans for a broadcasted concert with performances by various bands and DJs held on the city’s sandy shores without an audience have been abandoned.Those who violate Covid rules face fines of up to $2,800 (£2,050)   Mayor Marcelo Crivella\u0027s office said in a statement that it had opted to cancel the event out of respect for all of the victims, and to prioritize security for all.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"whales drawing yorkshire tourists dales coast says wildlife","story":"Whales are drawing Yorkshire tourists from the dales to the coast, the Wildlife Trusts have said, as they named the appearance of the marine mammals as one of their highlights of the year.Over the past two years, eco-tourists have flocked to the coast in the North of England to take advantage of brand-new whale-watching tours. The Wildlife Trusts have said that if Britain continues to conserve its ocean life, the country could become a global marine ecotourism hotspot. The minke whales were a particular highlight, and have over the year made the Yorkshire coastline their home, feeding just 100m from the shore. New businesses have been set up just to take tourists out to have a look at the astonishing ocean life.These whales are typically solitary, but some were seen feeding relatively close together, probably chasing the same shoals of fish. A humpback whale was also captured on film 7km off Flamborough Head by Jono Leadley from Yorkshire Wildlife Trust. Public sightings of minke whales have been rapidly increasing since 2015. They are now such regular visitors that a minke whale-watching industry has established in Yorkshire. Bex Lynam, North Sea Wildlife Trusts’ marine advocacy officer, told the : Bex Lynam, North Sea Marine Advocacy Officer for Yorkshire Wildlife Trust says: “Whale watching excursions from Yorkshire are a relatively new and exciting development for wildlife fans. Around five years ago, we weren’t aware of any whale watching boats setting off from local harbours. Today, we know of at least 10 boats that regularly run wildlife watching trips and in the last few years, half of these have been dedicating themselves to whale watching specifically for several months of the year. Many people will be amazed to learn that minke whale in particular are now established as a regular sight off Yorkshire.Other wildlife highlights of the year included the first orcas spotted in Northern Ireland’s Strangford Lough since 1962, a grey seal baby boom, with populations doubling in some areas, and a new northern sand lizard population, which is thriving for the first time in 50 years.An exciting discovery this year was rare evidence of a baby Risso\u0027s dolphin captured on camera by a wildlife enthusiast, clearly showing foetal folds that indicated it had just been born off the coast of Anglesey, Wales.The evidence indicates the Welsh coast could be an even more important place for the species than previously thought, North Wales Wildlife Trust said.Naturalist Sir David Attenborough warned that these sights may become even rarer if trawl fishing, cable-laying and plastic pollution continue.We\u0027re fortunate that our seas are protected by a blue belt of marine protected areas but sadly this does not prevent damaging activities still occurring in these special places, he said.For too long we have taken from the sea with little regard of the consequences,We are all aware of the problems presenting by plastic litter, but some pollutants and impacts are hidden from view, beneath the surface of the waves.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit deal eu becomes law","story":"NewsBrexit deal with EU becomes law as the Queen gives official Royal AssentBoris Johnson said he hoped the deal would end years of \"tired\" arguments after The European UnionBill was rushed through the Commons and Lords in a single daymirrorShare Bill was rushed through the Commons and Lords in a single day\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _THP_CHP_SLUG_JPG.jpg\" data-tracking\"facebook|share|\" Bill was rushed through the Commons and Lords in a single day\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _THP_CHP_SLUG_JPG.jpg\" data-tracking\"twitter|share|\" Bill was rushed through the Commons and Lords in a single day\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _THP_CHP_SLUG_JPG.jpg\" data-tracking\"whatsapp|share|\"CommentsByBen GlazeDeputy Political EditorRyan Merrield:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsBoris Johnson signing the Brexit deal\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Boris Johnsonaposs EU trade agreement cleared Parliament late on Wednesday night after the Government rushed approval through the Commons and Lords in a single day. Peers gave the European UnionBill, ratying the deal finally agreed on Christmas Eve, an unopposed third reading.Their approval came just hours after MPs backed the Bill by  to  at third reading, with just two Tories abstaining but Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer suffered a rebellion. Her Majestyaposs approval paves the way for the deal to take effect at pm on Thursday when the current Brexit transition period, during which the UK has continued to follow EU rules, ends.It means the UK and EU will trade without tarfs and quotas. But businesses are still braced for confusion and chaos as they get to grips with the new arrangements, despite the PM assuring the deal provides certainty for all firms.  A statement from Mr Johnson said: The destiny of this great country now resides firmly in our hands.We take on this duty with a sense of purpose and with the interests of the British public at the heart of everything we do. pm on the st December marks a new beginning in our countryaposs history and a new relationship with the EU as their biggest ally. This moment is finally upon us and now is the time to seize it.  Hours earlier he told the Commons he hoped it would end the old, desiccated, tired, super-masticated arguments which have dogged the country for years and enable it to move forwards to a new and great future. He said what had been agreed had been dismissed by some as “impossible”.The Conservative leader added: We were told we could not have our cake and eat it – namely that we could trade and co-operate with our EU neighbours on the closest possible terms as we will, while retaining sovereign control of our laws and our national destiny.  We are going to open a new chapter in our national story, striking free trade deals around the world and reasserting global Britain as a liberal outward-looking force for good. Mr Starmer told his party to back the deal –  did so, while  defied the orders. The SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru, Northern Irish MPs and the Greens’ one representative voted against. Two Tories – veteran Eurosceptics Owen Paterson and John Redwood, both former Cabinet ministers – abstained.  Despite voting for the deal, Mr Starmer tore into what he called a “thin agreement”.He said it failed to make good on Brexiteers’ promises during the referendum campaign. He said claims the pact would ensure there would be no checks on goods travelling between the UK and the Continent were wrong. Mr Starmer added: “There will be an avalanche of checks, bureaucracy and red tape for British businesses. “Every business I have spoken to knows this... It is there in black and white in the treaty.  “There will be checks for farmers, manufacturers, for customs, on rules of origin, VAT, safety and security, plant and animal health and much more. Many British exporters will have to go through two regulatory processes to sell to existing clients in the EU.” But he added that failing to back the agreement meant leaving with no deal at all. But the suffered by his party prompted two junior shadow ministers, Helen Hayes and Tonia Antoniazzi, to announce they were resigning their posts on the Labour front bench as they could not support the agreement. One Labour MP, Bell Ribeiro-Addy, defied the whips to vote against the agreement while another  abstained. All the other opposition parties opposed the agreement, including the DUP, which backed Brexit but objects to provisions which mean Northern Ireland will still be subject to some EU rules.  SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford told the Commons the European UnionAct is an act of constitutional vandalism. In a point of order, he said: I rise to say that this is an act of constitutional vandalism. Weaposre in the position this evening that the three devolved parliaments in Edinburgh, Cardf and in Belfast have refused to give legislative consent. It is the practice that this House is only supposed to legislate on matters that concern the devolved administrations with their consent.  Tory Eurosceptics, meanwhile, were jubilant, declaring that the battle for Brexit had finally been won. Veteran Sir Bill Cash said: Like Alexander the Great, Boris has cut the Gordian Knot. Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle announced the Queenaposs approval to MPs at .am on Thursday morning. An opposition amendment criticising the many shortcomings of the deal was rejected by  votes to . A Liberal Democrat attempt to prevent the legislation passing with a so-called fatal amendment was heavily defeated by  votes to , majority . Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said: “This deal will make British people poorer and British people less safe. At Holyrood, the Scottish Parliament voted by  to  to deny the deal legislative consent, although First Minister Nicola Sturgeon acknowledged it would not affect the passage of the Bill at Westminster.

With only hours to go until the end of the transition period, Boris Johnsonaposs deal with Brussels became law, setting the stage for the UKaposs future trading relationship with the EU. It has been a long road to this moment. From the EU referendum in  to the signing of the trade deal on Christmas Eve , every step of the way has been fraught with dficulties. David Cameron and Theresa May both saw their premierships derailed by Brexit while the country was split down the middle by the EU referendum results. Protests, parliamentary drama and two snap elections took the UK to the brink, before coronavirus plunged the country into its greatest peace-time crisis. But Brexit talks continued behind the scenes, deadlocked for months over fishing, level playing field rules and rows over the oversight rules. With just days to go until the transition period ended and the UK faced a no-deal exit on top of the coronavirus crisis, both sides finally agreed to a deal. The Queen granted Royal Assent to the legislation at .am on December  - enshrining the agreement in law with only hours to spare until the UK severs its ties with the EU.Hereaposs a timeline of how we got there.  January  - David Cameron demands “fundamental, far-reaching change” to EU - and an In Out referendum on Britain’s membership during a landmark speech at Bloomberg News.  May   - In a ballot box shock, voters elect the first Conservative majority government for  years, paving the way for an In Out referendum Cameron thought he would never have to call.  February  – Cameron secures his EU reform deal in Brussels and announces the EU referendum will be held on  June. The PM says he will campaign “heart and soul” to keep Britain in Europe.  February  – Boris Johnson reveals he will campaign to Leave. Suddenly the Out camp has its figurehead – and Cameron knows he has a fight on his hands.   June  - Labour MP Jo Cox is brutally murdered in her West Yorks constituency. All campaigning is suspended as grieving politicians pay tribute to the mother-of-two.  June  - Britain votes to leave the EU with % in favour of Leave and % backing Remain.  July  - Theresa May becomes Prime Minister after Cameron resigns.  January   - May makes her key Lancaster House speech, setting out what she sees as the UK’s future relationship with the EU, including leaving the Single Market.  March  - May formally triggers Article , firing the starting gun on the two-year countdown to Brexit.  April  - The PM calls a snap general election to bolster her majority to deliver on Brexit.  June  - Voters deliver a devastating verdict on Mayaposs campaign and the Conservatives lose  seats and their Commons majority.   June  - Divorce talks between Brexit Secretary David Davis and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier begin in Brussels.  July  - Cabinet agrees a withdrawal plan at PM’s th Century country retreat, Chequers, in Buckinghamshire. Johnson later resigns as Foreign Secretary, and Brexit Secretary David Davis also quits the Cabinet.  November  - EU and UK rubber-stamp a pact at Brussels summit.  December  - After five days of debate, the PM, facing a massive defeat, announces she is delaying the vote.  December  – May wins a confidence vote of Tory MPs by  to .

The EUBill - which puts the ,-page trade pact into UK law - was backed by  votes to  despite a revolt by up to  Labour MPs. Confirmed just  hours before the transition period ends tomorrow night, it means tarfs will not be slapped on our £bn a year of trade with the continent. But there are still many holes and areas still to be worked out. And Labouraposs Keir Starmer said he was only backing the deal to avoid the disaster of crashing out with no deal at all. Boris Johnson was due to sign the deal itself in No at pm after it was signed by EU chiefs this morning, and airlted to Britain on one of the Queenaposs planes.The Queen, who is spending Christmas at Windsor Castle, is due to give Royal Assent at about midnight tonight after the deal passes through the House of Lords. How MPs voted on the Bill in general  Tory MPs and  Labour MPs backed the second reading of the EUBill.Tory Brexiteers and Labour leader Keir Starmer both voted for the Bill, despite the ,-page trade deal getting less than five hours of scrutiny in the Commons.Sir Keir slammed the thin deal but warned his own MPs: There’s only one choice today - which is to vote for implementing this deal, or to vote for no deal. Those who vote no are voting for no deal.” However, it was not enough to stop a Labour revolt. Three Labour MPs, Florence Eshalomi, Helen Hayes and Tonia Antoniazzi, quit frontbench roles to abstain on the deal - in other words, avoid backing it. Ms Hayes, who quit as a Shadow Cabinet Office minister, said: The Prime Minister’s preication and brinkmanship have resulted in the House of Commons being given just five hours to debate and scrutinise a  clause Bill and a , page Treaty.  That is nothing short of a national disgrace, a contempt for this Parliament and an insult to every citizen of the UK. Only one Labour MP, Bell Riberio-Addy, voted against, but  other Labour MPs abstained.The SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru, Northern Irish DUP MPs and the Greensapos single representative also voted against.Search for how your MP voted "},{"url":null,"title":"labour brexit revolt 37 mps","story":"NewsLabour Brexit revolt as  MPs defy orders to back deal - and three resignThree MPs left frontbench roles after refusing Keir Starmers orders to back Boris Johnsons thin Brexit dealmirrorShareCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy Political Editor:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video mps-voted-favour-post-brexit-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

But from tomorrow, December , millions more will be given the stay at home order after , new coronavirus cases were reported in just one day yesterday, a new record. The new iant of coronavirus, believed to be up to % more transmissible than the early iant of the disease, prompted the government to introduce strict new restrictions for swathes of the country. Designed to slow the spread of the virus, the Tier Four restrictions closely match those of the national lockdown imposed on England in November. The fourth tier was established just before Christmas in order to stop the spread of the new iant in the south of England. Christmas bubbles were cancelled, and a Stay at Home order was set out in law, and now millions more will join the areas already living under tighter restrictions. Here are the latest rules, detailing what you can and canapost doyouaposre a Tier Four resident: Tier  rules The Tier  rules are very similar to the rules of the November national lockdown. All non-essential shops, pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, gyms and leisure centres, and other entertainment venuesmust close in Tier . Only essential shops are allowed to open, and a stay at home order has been put into law for Tier  residents. As in previous lockdowns there are exemptions -you need to leave your home for essential shopping, education, childcare, workand unlimited exercise. Outdoor sport can also take place. The public is advised not to leave or enter a Tier  area, and Tier  residents must not stay overnight anywhere other than their own home.

The Health Secretary said the approval of the Oxford AstraZeneca jab this morning means there will now eventually be enough doses for every Brit who wants the jab. The UK has ordered enough of the Oxford jab for million people, on top of enough of the Pfizer jab for million people. However, it will still take several months for the majority of the population to be vaccinated. Mr Hancock said the most vulnerable in the first phase, including all over-s, will be vaccinated by the Spring. But he would not put a date on it, or on when younger healthy Brits can start getting vaccinated against Covid-. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation will set out updated information on the priority list today, but Mr Hancock said the order will be exactly the same as with the Pfizer jab. The priority list puts care home residents, frontline health and care workers and over-s first, followed by younger pensioners, shielders, and under-s with health conditions like liver disease, diabetes or morbid obesity. He told BBC Breakfast: They have said the prioritisation in terms of what order people should be prioritised should be exactly the same as for the Pfizer vaccine, which is good news And that we should prioritise having as many people getting the first dose as possible.  Unlike the Pfizer jab, the Oxford jab can be stored at routine temperatures and the second dose only needs to be given after  weeks. That means the government can prioritise getting more people their first dose of the vaccine. The easier handling of the jab also means it can go to more care homes, which the government was accused of leaving behind in the vaccine rollout so far.  Mr Hancock said: “Once we’ve vaccinated all of them and the over-s, which is a signicant chunk of the population, then we will continue to vaccinate the under s - even though the likelihood of dying from the disease is much loweryou’re under the age of . “Because we’ve got enough of this vaccine on order to vaccinate the whole population. “We’ve got million doses on order - add that to the million [sic] doses of Pfizer and that’s enough for two doses for the entire population."},{"url":null,"title":"barclays close 65 more branches","story":"NewsBarclays announces plan to shut  more local branches - see full listEXCLUSIVE: Barclays has closed, or had plans to shut,  branches since  and the latest closures come despite the bank giant admitting some of those being axed have seen rising customer numbersmirrorShareCommentsByGraham HiscottHead of Business:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsBarclays is to axe  more branches \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Our free email newsletter sends you the biggest headlines from news, sport and showbizWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

On the eve of our departure, we asked for opinions from people in the most pro and anti-EU parts of the country. They were Cambridge, where one ward had the highest proportion of pro-EU voters, and Boston, Lincolnshire, which had the most Leave voters. CAMBRIDGE The university city is pro-EU and its Market Ward had the highest proportion of Remainers in the UK at .% Restaurateur Saoor Rahman feels uneasy for the future of his -month-old son Yusha in a post-Brexit world. His Raja Restaurant thrived after opening in  but is now, during a pandemic, struggling.  But the  year-old reveals it was straight after the Brexit vote in June  that income first dwindled.He says he noticed fewer languages spoken at his tables and says: “Cambridge is a very international, student city... Brexit put a lot of people off coming.” Sai’s parents immigrated from Bangladesh and he worries racism, or at least fear of immigration, fuelled Brexit. Teacher Yolanda Warwick agrees. Originally from Greece, she is emotional as she admits having encountered hostility herself since the vote. The -year-old is married to a British man, has two British children, and has lived in the UK for  years after studying at Manchester Univserity. Yet after the vote some pupils taunted her: “Where’s your accent from  You’re not from around here, you’re not British”. She says quietly: “That was a shock.” Dr Alasdair Parker, , a consultant paediatric neurologist at Addenbrooke’s Hospital, fears an exodus of European colleagues. He says: “In Britain we still massively under-train, we produce a quarter of the number we need in the NHS. “And there are some areas where we are totally reliant on EU immigration. “In Addenbrooke’s I see that in highly specialist roles, things like radiotherapy, radiology, we have very high-quality people coming from Spain, Portugal and Italy.” BOSTON, LINCS  Alan Clarke and we Jean were among the .% of locals who voted Leave, making the town the UK’s most pro-Brexit place. The -year-old plans to hoist a Union Jack in his garden tonight to mark Brexit. He says: “I’m % not racist, I don’t have a problem with people coming here.” But Alan, who runs a shop in Ingoldmells, hankers after a time when “people were proud to be British” and adds: “Make Britain Great Again, that’s not a bad idea.” Cerri Fletcher is still fervently anti-EU. The fancy dress shop owner, who came to England from Ireland as a baby, says: “Everyone’s fed up of the Iranians, the Turkish and the Romanians. They’re causing... grief and stabbings, killings and dodgy business around Boston.” Many point to Boston’s Tory mayor being of Moroccan-French heritage as proof that Boston is not anti-immigration. Mayor Anton Dani, , in the country for nine years and married to a Polish immigrant, says people don’t dislike foreigners, just their lack of integration.  He says: “There are people who have been living in Boston for the last ,  years and they can’t speak English.” But he thinks Brexit won’t alter immigration, saying: “People can still enter the country on a tourist visa... then overstay.” Polish financial advisor Iga Paczkowski, , says the referendum sparked hostility. She says: “It was quite painful. But over time people started being nice to us again.” People across the EU have been telling us what they think about our leaving. Amsterdam    Mick van Bemmel, , masters student I don’t understand. The pros do not weigh up against the cons. I am not worried about the future of the EU. All the years of negotiating have made it very clear it is not as easy as it may sound to leave. But it is not perfect yet...we have to look at long-term goals not short term gains. Berlin Stefan Jeka, , senior product manager I am concerned about possible changes within British society. If the negative impact of Brexit is getting severe, people with low income will be disproportionately affected. History told us more than once that this can lead to the rise of extremist views. Britain has made a mistake. Brexit is an experiment with a very uncertain outcome.

Jack Robson, , purchased a three-bedroom property in Gateshead back in February  for £, but only started living in it and doing it up this year. The SEO Consultant has since given the place a total makeover, beginning in March by ripping out all of the original features of the home, including decorative stained glass doors and s style block-work around the fireplace. His hard work on each room in the house cost £, in total and the place is now totally unrecognisable. Formerly a council house, the home was originally on the market for £,, but Jack managed to convince the sellers to lower the price due to the amount of work the property needed.The most expensive part of the renovation was in the kitchen, where the dated interiors were spruced up with a new floor, fresh paint and new cabinets and appliances, coming in at £,. Jack has also rewired the property, added new radiators and moved the fuse box. While doing all of this after work in the evenings and on the weekends, he slept in one of the spare bedrooms.  Speaking to Jam Press, he said: I was quite optimistic about the amount of work that needed doing to it. I’m a handy person and like the idea of a challenge and having something I can put my own stamp on. “I don’t have the biggest budget in the world andI had to pay others to do the work for me, that would have depleted very quickly. I didn’t realise the extent until I’d got the keys – there were things that I didn’t check on my first and second viewing that I will look for next time I buy.  Another part of the renovation included an impressive overhaul of the bathroom, transforming a brown three-piece traditional suite of sink, toilet and bathtub into a modern shower bath with stylish grey tiles and a sleek new sink and toilet. Jack also remodelled one of the bedrooms into a home office, stripping off the worn floral wallpaper and repainting it in green. He estimates that  percent of the work has been completed by himself or with the help of family members, with the remaining  percent finished by a qualied tradesman. Despite the toll it’s taken, Jack has no regrets about taking on the project himself.

If weaposre being honest, most of our New Yearaposs resolutions donapost make it past January and that healthy diet and gym membership are completely forgotten by March. And seems weaposre in good company, as Meghan Markle has previously admitted that she always struggles to keep hers - despite having the same two every year. But in  - the year she would meet Prince Harry - she decided to take a dferent approach to setting herself goals and plans, and it could have proved le-changing. On her popular lestyle blog, The Tig, Meghan explained that every year she aims to stop biting her nails and swearing as they are unladylike. She wrote:  The swearing comes in lulls triggered by being overworked or feeling mighty cheeky after a couple drinks. And when it comes to the biting of the nails—well, it still happens with a turbulent flight or a stressful day. Itaposs unladylike. But then again, so is the swearing. Dammit. And there are a few other things she always hopes to achieve - like running a marathon and relearning French.  But in , just seven months before the blind date where she met Harry, she decided to mix things up a bit. She wrote: For this new year, the only thing I aim to do is to approach le playfully. To laugh and enjoy, to keep my standards high but my level of self-acceptance higher. My New Yearaposs resolution is to leave room for magic. To make my plans, and be okaythey sometimes break.

Sarah Jane McIntyre is past her period of self-isolation, but is still feeling the effects - a trip to the shops was so exhausting it left her shaking and drenched in sweat. The -year-old, from Belfast, has urged people to follow restrictions and said the symptoms she suffered were not like those commonly associated with Covid-.Health care worker Sarah Jane said she began with headaches so severe it was agony just keeping her eyes open and back pain like she was in labour, reports BelfastLive.Her warning comes after a sharp rise in positive cases in people aged - in Northern Ireland. No one understands, it is out there that the symptoms are a high temperature, cough and loss of smell and taste, but it has been so much more than that for me, she said. No one tells you how tired you will get, walking down the stairs is tough. I donapost think people realise how serious and contagious it is, I am still getting over it and I am on day . She said she is lucky she didnapost have to go to hospital and could remain at home with her children, despite the virus making her feel . Sarah Jane, who has asthma, ed from London on December  and said she felt tired but had put that down to lots of walking around the city. She then started to develop a headache, but again because it was not one of the stated symptoms she did not think she had contracted the virus.  But as the day went on she couldnapost keep her eyes open and even her skin began to hurt. I just thought, this isnapost normal, and I was freezing, I could not get heat into me. I didnapost want to risk seeing anyone so I went and got a test that afternoon. I did not expect to be positive, I thought it was a bit of a cold but the Saturday I found out I was positive. I balled my eyes out.Sarah Jane said her fingers and toes hurt like she had arthritis. She also said she could barely keep her eyes open and felt like an old woman getting out of bed.You feel like you are turning a corner with it then bang, you are back to square one but worse, the relapse is bad, she said. She forced herself to carry on as normal as she could on Christmas Eve for the sake of her children despite feeling nauseous the whole day. I did not lose my sense of taste or smell, my husband has Covid too and his symptoms are dferent to mine as well. On Christmas Day she suffered from diarrhea, vomiting and dizziness and said she nearly fainted in the bathroom. You feel like a pensioner, said Sarah Jane.

The daredevil feat would have been impossible for the mum of one when she was at her heaviest – st lbs and wearing a dress size .But after shedding more than st with Slimming World, dropping to st lbs and a trim size , she’s embracing her adventurous streak.She says: “I feel like I could take on the world since losing weight. Being heavy and unfit had held me back and got me down for so many years. I’m not just lighter and slimmer, it’s like there’s been a weight taken off my shoulders too. “I’m more confident, I smile more and I feel like I can do anything – bring on the skye!” Alison, , head of Norfolk County Council’s Music Service, walked through the doors of her local Slimming World group in June . With an appointment booked to have drastic gastric bypass surgery at a Harley Street clinic two weeks later, she was following her mum Fiona’s pleas to try one last alternative to the op.Although nervous, Alison, says she ­immediately felt a kindred spirit in her Slimming World Consultant Steve Little, who had himself lost st following the organisation’s Food Optimising plan.With his encouragement and her determination, in just one week, she lost lbs and that was enough to make her cancel her surgery slot.  Alison, from Holt in Norfolk, said: “For the first time, it really felt like I might have found something that worked for me. I’d dieted for years and always piled the weight back on, plus extra on top, but this was dferent. It felt like a new way of le, and the food was ­delicious. Nothing was off limits and I could eat to suit my appetite. The ­dference was, I was eating meals cooked from scratch, not junk. “I hated diets that involved counting absolutely everything you put into your mouth. “With Slimming World’s ‘Free Food’ – a long list of foods you can eat without weighing or measuring, like pasta, rice, potatoes and lots of veg – it was so much easier.” Alison saw her weight soar in her s after she moved out of her parents’ house in ­Kilmarnock, Ayrshire, in Scotland. An emotional eater, she’d turn to food for comfort at times of stress at work. But it was when her marriage ended in  that her habit really spiralled out of control. She said: “I was extremely unhappy and found food to be the only thing that gave me comfort. I’d think nothing of having a bag of chocolate bites for breakfast, a tube of Pringles plus two sandwiches and a pasta salad for lunch and dinner was usually a Chinese takeaway or a curry. I also guzzled litres and litres of full-sugar fizzy drinks and snacked all day. “By the time I joined Slimming World, I had a BMI of  and was classed as morbidly obese.  “I dressed in clothes I felt were really ugly and I hated the way I looked. One of the worst moments of my le was when my little boy Angus and I were told to get off a ride at Alton Towers because I couldn’t fit the safety harness over my stomach. It was a ride where the child had to be accompanied and he was crying his little heart out – he was only five at the time and didn’t understand. I knew something had to change.” These days it’s a dferent story. For ­breakfast Alison enjoys a homemade ­breakfast wrap, for lunch she’ll have a low-fat pasta salad and her favourite dish to cook in the evening is bunless tower burgers with salad and jumbo king prawns. She enjoys fresh fruit, home-made hummus or roasted chickpeas as snacks. The weight continued to come off steadily as she went for her weekly weigh-ins and she also discovered a new passion for exercise.  Alison and Angus got a cute sausage dog they named Mr Darcy and began going on long walks together. She also joined the gym and before long was doing five exercise classes a week. By the beginning of March last year, she was delighted to be down to st, nearly at her goal.And then the world went into meltdown as the coronavirus pandemic took hold.She recalls: “Like many people who have a problem with their weight, I panicked when we went into lockdown. “I knew that it could be dangerous for me to spend so much time at home with the constant temptation to overeat. “All Slimming World groups were forced to temporarily close and I was so worried I was going to lose my support network. The encouragement from other members is a huge part of the process, and one of the big reasons why I’d stuck with the plan. “Thankfully my Consultant was amazing. Our group went online and we’d all meet on a Thursday night on Zoom. It was my lesaver. I was so worried I’d undo all the good work I’d done, but my friends from my group were there on a screen in front of me in the same boat and we kept each other going.” Alison decided to shop locally more often rather than buying in a big weekly shop so there wasn’t much food at home to tempt her. She continued to get her daily exercise with Mr Darcy and, despite her worst fears, the pounds continued to drop off. She’s now at her target weight of st lbs, but considering losing a little more.

Students in exam years are toto secondary schools a week later than planned, from January . Other secondary and college students will go back full-time on January . There has been growing concern from teaching unions and scientists about the spread of the virus following the discovery of its much more transmissible iant, with rising case rates and hospital admissions in many parts of the country.  Mr Williamson told MPs in the Commons that the Government had to make an immediate adjustment to its plans for the reopening of schools in early January. He said: We must always act swtly when circumstances change. The evidence about the new Covid iant and rising infection rates have required some immediate adjustment to our plans for the new term. He added: The latest study we have from Public Health England is that Covid infections among children are triggered by changes in the community rate.  The study also says that the wider impact of school closures on childrenaposs development would be signicant. Iaposm quite clear that we must continue to do all we can to keep children in school.

The UK has ordered  million doses of the Oxford University vaccine, enough to vaccinate  million people.Writing exclusively in the Mirror, Mr Hancock said the Oxford vaccine is much better suited to reach care homes, as it doesnapost need to be stored at very cold temperatures, and he will put care home residents and staff at the front of the queue.It is the second vaccine to be approved by the UK medicines regular, after the Pfizer-BioNTech jab was given emergency use authorisation earlier this month.Will you get the Covid- vaccine  Let us know in the comments section below.But what is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, and how is it dferent from the one developed by Pfizer  Here are the answers to some of the most popular questions. What is the plan for rolling out the Oxford vaccine  An initial , doses will be available from Monday. AstraZeneca has previously promised four million doses this year so these are likely to be available in the next few weeks. From Monday the Oxford jab will be given along with the Pfizer version at  hospitals and  clinics. They will also be sent into care homes and within days be administered to the elderly, unwell and care workers.  Why is there now a longer delay been doses  Trial data suggested a half dose followed by a full dose was % effective compared to the % provided by two full doses. Health authorities requested more detail and decided that the % group fared better because the doses were also given further apart. So they have now approved two full doses at an interval of up to three months. Can we be sure it is safe after such a quick turnaround  British regulators have been studying clinical trial data since the September. The US and EU are only now starting to analyse results. The UK is set to become the first major country protected by vaccination.  How effective is it  Regulators say a single full dose is % effective after three weeks and lasts up to three months. A second full dose then ups effectiveness to % and provides lasting protection. What about the Pfizer vaccine  Until now two doses had to be given within  days. But now regulators have allowed the second dose to be delayed. Pfizer says this needs to be monitored as their trial data does not show immunity after just one dose lasts longer than  days. Would I be better off with Pfizer  Trials concluded it was % effective. However experts insist results between dferent vaccines should not be compared as they were done under dferent circumstances. Vaccines are usually approvedthey are shown to be safe and more than % effective. Even though a small number of vaccinated participants got Covid, both vaccines prevented severe symptoms. How do they decide who gets the vaccine  The NHS will decide who gets offered which jab based on what is logistically best to get the most people vaccinated. Care home\u2028residents are likely to get the Oxford vaccine whereas those being vaccinated at hospitals – where they have ultra cold storage – may get the Pfizer jab.  Can I choose which I get  No. This will be a clinical decision  based on the advice of the Government’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. Both vaccines are suitable for all priority groups. Can everyone get it  The Oxford jab is approved for everyone over . Previous precautionary advice for pregnant women to avoid vaccinations was amended so that it can be given to those who are at particular risk from Covid. People with allergies can now receive a vaccination unless they are allergic to any of its ingredients. Who gets it first  Age is the biggest factor. There are around  million people deemed vulnerable including all over-s. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation and the Chief Medical Officers in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland decide on priority. It starts with elderly care home residents in the first \u2028group, followed by all over-s as \u2028well as health and social care  workers in the second. It then drops down by five-year age groups however those with underlying health conditions are higher in the priority ranking.

The green light for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in such a short time is a tribute to the brilliance and ingenuity of our scientists. It is now imperative that the Government ensures the rollout is efficient and fast. Vaccination can save lives, reunite families and start to get le back to normal. So the approval of a second vaccine could not have come at a more needed time. The second wave of the virus is sweeping through the country at an unprecedented rate. Millions more people in England were today placed under tougher Covid restrictions – a national lockdown in all but name. Many hospitals, despite the valiant work of NHS staff, are struggling to cope. The daily death toll is now the highest since April and it is sadly inevitable that the number of Covid’s victims will rise still further. While we wait for the rollout of the vaccine, there can be no let-up in the provision of protective kit, oxygen supplies and testing. Vaccines are a promise of a brighter tomorrow but there is no disguising the darkness of the time before that dawn.  Deal is dodgy AFTER nearly five years of wrangling, the Brexit deal was rushed through the Commons in less than five hours. While most people will be relieved we are leaving with a deal, the agreement is far from the triumph claimed by Boris Johnson. If the Government were confident it had delivered the best possible deal, it would have allowed MPs more time to debate it. The fact that they did not suggests that they have something to hide.

Yesterday official guidance for both the Pfizer and Oxford vaccines changed, with getting the first dose to as many people as possible now a priority.The order of priority remains the same - but millions can now expect to get the vaccine more quickly, with the second dose now administered up to  weeks after the first, rather than three or four weeks. The move has been taken to enable more people to get partial immunity from the first vaccine dose sooner, although medical experts said the second dose is still important for people to reach full protection from the virus. Residents in a care home for older adults and their carers are top priority to get a Covid- jab, according to a list by the The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation . After that, older people, those in frontline healthcare and people with underlying health problems form nine groups of people prioritised for the jab. The JCVI advises that the first priorities for the current Covid- vaccination programme should be the prevention of Covid- mortality and the protection of health and social care staff and systems. Secondary priorities could include vaccination of those at increased risk of hospitalisation and at increased risk of exposure, and to maintain resilience in essential public services, a government document said. Vaccine priority groupsResidents in a care home for older adults and their carers All those  years of age and over and frontline health and social care workers All those  years of age and over All those  years of age and over and clinically extremely vulnerable iniduals All those  years of age and over All iniduals aged  years  to  years with underlying health conditions which put them at higher risk of serious disease and mortality All those  years of age and over All those  years of age and over All those  years of age and over.

The high school student, from Tinley Park, near Chicago, US, was otherwise healthy but the virus ate her through, leading to a brain bleed and kidney deterioration, according to her parents Deborah and Donald. A few days before Christmas, Sarah began to suffer with mild cold-like symptoms but things quickly escalated and her mum took her for a test on December , which came back positive.  Over the next three days the Lincoln-Way East High School student continued to worsen, with vomiting, chills and body aches, before she was taken to Silver Cross Hospital on December .She was subsequently airlted to University of Chicago Medical Center where she died on Boxing Day, reports the Chicago Tribune. Deborah told WLS-TV : She went into cardiac arrest, she had a brain bleed, it was deteriorating her kidneys, it just ate her through. No parent should ever have to watch their child go through that. Nobody. I know she fought because one of the last times I was able to talk to her on the phone, they were taking her from the regular room to ICU and she said aposI am going to be OK, mom,apos and that was the last thing, Deborah added. The Cook County Medical Examineraposs Office has since ruled she died of acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to the coronavirus infection, with non-traumatic cerebral hemorrhages as a contributing factor. Sarahaposs brother, Matthew, , had come down with the virus in August but quickly recovered.

In a video that has been viewed . million times on the , the mum explained: This year it was super apparent. For Eva, my eldest’s birthday, they in a plastic bag handed it to her, it was an outfit. It was cute. They spent maybe . They gave it to her a few weeks after her birthday. Didn’t make a big deal of it. Didn’t even watch her open it.

Arielle continued: For my youngest’s birthday, they drive to our house, which is an hour away. Spent maybe a couple hundred dollars on her. Bought her dinner. Made sure she had a nice dessert, sang her happy birthday. Her husband eventually confronted his parents about the obvious favoritism, which didnapost go down well. She said: So Scott reached out to his parents and told them that he thinks they are being unfair. They did not like that. They kept denying it and everything.  Finally Scott just said you know what I don’t careyou believe me or not. This is an issue and it’s going to affect your relationship with your grandchildrenyou don’t do better. We know you can do better. Clearly stunned by their sonaposs attitude, they later messaged Arielle claiming that she had brainwashed him, which resulted in a big argument.

With Brexit on its way and Boris having become as powerful as he could in human form, the first minister marched on with proposals that involved asking very nicely for a second referendum.Is Boris Johnson the new Henry VIII \" title\"#Is Boris Johnson the new Henry VIII # # Press and Journal\" src\"https:www.pressandjournal fp news politics uk-politics  is-boris-johnson-the-new-henry-viii embed # secretTCgAckzJG\" data-secret\"TCgAckzJG\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"The Scottish Conservatives had spent the month previous campaigning against that idea, with middling results. They continued to say no, adding #once in a generation# to almost everything. The SNP regained a lot of seats lost in  and made no secret about being nationalists with one thing in mind.The polls showed support for the union and independence at - for most of the month.Having promised to resign as leader after taking Labour to its worst general election result since before the Second World War, Jeremy Corbyn launched what felt like the longest leadership contest ever.Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf was asked to make a statement on the #crumbling# police estate. Mr Yousaf said claims the country#s stations were ripping apart at the seams was #hyperbole#, hours before the roof of Broughty Ferry station caved in.mdash Boris JohnsonJanuary , Hero of the Month: Boris Johnson # Mr Johnson had succeeded, taken the UK out of the EU and was hurtling, full-speed ahead, towards the sun-lit uplands. What could possibly go wrong.Villain of the Month: -nCoV, as it was then known, was notied to the World Health Organization on January , despite cases being reported as early as November .A light display caught the people of Brussels by surprise, proclaiming Europe lt Scotland on the side of the Berlaymont building.Although they never officially admitted it, the stunt was pretty much carried out by the SNP, as part of efforts to take Scotland back into the EU as an #independent country#.The Scottish Government#s #dficult# budget — set without knowing how much block grant was to come from Westminster — proved even more so, when the night before he was due to present it to parliament, Derek Mackay was forced to stand down after being rumbled for bombarding a teenage boy with text messages.Mackay sent hundreds of private messages via Instagram over a six-month period, calling him #cute# and trying to get him to visit Bishopton, where he represents.He hasn#t been seen in parliament since, but it has not stopped him taking almost every payment going, as well as collecting on expenses for offices in Edinburgh.Sajid Javid resigned as Chancellor of the Exchequer, and was summarily replaced by relative newcomer Rishi Sunak just days before the budget.Kate Forbes was given even less time to prepare the Scottish Government#s financial statement # giving an impressive performance in trying circumstances.Ruth Davidson admitted she would want nothing more than to be clad in ermine in an interview with growing DC Thomson podcast The Stooshie.Meanwhile, Jackson Carlaw comprehensively beat challenger Michelle Ballantyne in the race to replace Ms Davidson — continuity at least in terms of party direction and a spanner in the works of all those who had considered #Ballantyne#s Day Massacre# as a headline in the event the former nurse won .Mr Carlaw limped out after less than six months as boss and Ms Ballantyne is no longer a Scottish Tory .Like every unimaginative pub bore these last years, Boris Johnson was forced to deny calling Nicola Sturgeon #that bloody wee Jimmy Krankie woman#.Worried, probably, about how this could affect her Glasgow Southside credentials, Ms Sturgeon took the high road responded by saying she is #a big enough girl to insult him back#.The Boris Bridge took a step further from ridiculous cheese-dream to possible-but-not-really investment project, as the prime minister used his tried-and-tested method of promising something massive before falling apart in the detail in order to seem popular.North East food and drink producers warned the #Australian-style# immigration system set to come in at the end of the year would be dreadful for business.Hero of the Month: Kate Forbes # At , she was thrust into the front-line of Scottish politics to cover for yet another middle-aged man who disgraced himself while in a position of power. Regardless of political persuasion on the Scottish Government#s budget, few could fault Ms Forbes# delivery and assuredness under straining circumstances.Villain of the Month: Derek Mackay # It is a tale as old as time man gets power, man abuses that power, man is allowed to carry on collecting considerable salary.

It is governed by regulations that decide what countries can participate.#Erasmus includes Norway, Iceland etc, and also states in the enlargement process like Serbia and Turkey, and it is open to neighbourhood countries as well.#But then, of course, we have the domestic issue of having the competence to enter into an international legal agreement which the UK has, but Scotland doesn#t.#So that#s domestic problem that would need to be overcome somehow.#I can#t really see the UK Government doing that because the new scheme that they#ve launched, the Turing scheme, they#ve made a point that it is UK wide. Even though, of course, education is devolved.#Prof Cardwell notes the Erasmus scheme is more than just pounds generated for the economy.On top of the evidence showing students tend to achieve better degrees, there are several #unquantiable# elements that are brought by exchange programmes, including establishing institutions overseas.He added: #Traditionally the UK as a whole has received more incoming Erasmus students than we sent out. Partly that was for linguistic reasons, but also the way in which our degrees are structured.#Having students from other European countries has led to a greater level of ersity, at minimal or no cost to the universities and with much wider benefits for society in terms of student spending#And most Erasmus students across will have a great experience and go back as ambassadors for Scotland or the UK. So in terms of teaching and research, it helps to solidy many of these links, which cannot easily be quantied.#We can quanty the numbers going in and out and we can quanty our costs a little bit, but we can#t take into account just how important it#s been for students to get to know Scotland, to get to know wherever they are, wherever they have been and either stay and contribute to the economy through working or, once they go back, to either convince others to come — perhaps to do a masters degree — or to be informal ambassadors in other ways, and that#s much more dficult to quanty.#More than £ million will be spent on the post-Brexit replacement of the Erasmus exchange programme for UK students next year, the UK Government announced.The Turing scheme — named after Bletchley Park cryptoanalyst Alan Turing — will provide funding for around , students to go on placements around the world from September.Universities UK and Universities Scotland, which represent higher and further education bodies, did welcome the announcement of a replacement scheme.But Prof Cardwell points out bonds between universities take time to set up and leaves more questions left unanswered than before.#One of the reasons I#m sceptical of how quickly it can be set up is that Erasmus has evolved over  years,# he added.#Institutional relationships which form the basis of an exchange take a long time to set up.#Usuallywe#re talking about the next academic year, we would normally be selecting students and preparing them just after Christmas to go in the summer # especiallyit was somewhere like Australia, which will start in July.#To set up a new scheme, get institutions to bid for the money and find out who#s going to operate it— is it going to be the British Council or is it going to be central government #How#s that going to work  Where is the money going to go — is it going to go to universities  How do they distribute it  And what#s crucial about it is: who#s at the centre of this  The students.#We know how Erasmus works, students get inidual grants, which comes from a national agency, which is distributed from the EU budget.One hundred million pounds sounds a lot but it probably wouldn#t go that far.#Professor Paul CardwellProf Cardwell says the money being allocated to the new Turing scheme by the UK Government will be stretched thin to cover the anticipated , students each year.#With a budget of £ million, a lot of people have done the calculation of that being £, each, which isn#t a lotdoesn#t take into account any of the institutional costs#What#s important about this is that in Erasmus, and other exchanges outside Europe, they usually work on the basis of a fee waiver.#A lot of noises are being made, particularly by Conservative MPs, saying #students will be able to go to elite US universities#.#Those universities are not necessarily just going to let in lots of UK students and let them off paying the fees just because they#re getting a scholarship from the UK Government.#But there#s no way I can see how the Turing scheme would allow for tuition fees, especially not somewhere as expensive as the US. And that means the budget would very much disappear.#One hundred million pounds sounds a lot but it probably wouldn#t go that far.#He continued: #If you#re trying to, as the stated aim of the Turing scheme is, help the most disadvantaged in society, how do you reach those #How do you get those students to be able to participate, especially when you#re not really able to guarantee whether they are going to be able to benefit from a programme that is going to not leave them financially worse off.#Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_sub_data  ,\"evening-telegraph-web-and-epaper-annual-january-sale\":This offer will auto-renew annually at the price of  ua.. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\": today and get unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite. nThis offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"plan_ids\":[\"cancelation-offer-evening-telegraph-web-epaper\",\"evening-telegraph-web-and-epaper-annual-january-sale\",\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\"],\"subscribe\": ua. per month  u recurring subscription n\",\"label\":\"\",\"highlight\":,\"recurring\":\"\",\"has_multi\":,\"editions\":true,\"durations\":true,\"free_trial\":,\"benefits\":[\"Enjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.\",\"Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

He was telling us stories of his time, how Jim was a forward thinker.#He said the things they did back then, a lot of people almost laughed at them – but now they’re regular practices.#He’s someone we don’t know but we’re all familiar with. His presence and legacy will be felt as long as Dundee United are here.#Reynolds insists the feeling of McLean#s presence at Tannadice still remains at the club as they absorbed some of the tributes laid out for the great man in front of the stadium.He continued: #We’ve been out at Tannadice and had a look at the tributes.#Jim McLean is synonymous with Dundee United, bringing the club to the forefront of Scottish and European football. He gave the club the rich history it’s got.#With the state of the country in lockdown, not as many people have made it to the stadium as would have liked but there are certainly a few who have come to pay their respects.#Everyone at the club feels a loss. It’s a name that is still adorned on the walls, there are pictures everywhere – and that will be like that forevermore.#He’s one of the main men responsible for making Dundee United such a big club in Scotland.#Reynolds added: #It’s still part of the club. I’ve been lucky enough to be at clubs where the history is all over the walls.#This club has a proud history, a successful history. You walk down any of the corridors at Tannadice and you see that. That will never change.#His legacy will always be there, rightly so. It was such a successful period for the club, a period when he launched the club into the public perception and to a wider European audience.#He will always be about this club and this stadium.#Turning his focus to on-pitch matters, Reynolds looked ahead to today’s trip to champions Celtic and insisted the Tangerines go to Glasgow with a belief they can come away with something.#I think we go into every game with a real belief that we can get a result,# he said.#I don’t want to sit here as though we’re going to Celtic Park with real belief when we don’t usually.#Every game we go into, we don’t expect to win – but we expect to take part, show up, compete and fight as hard as anyone.#We’re going into this game knowing that we can focus on ourselves and,we bring the quality we have in this changing room, we give ourselves a chance.#With an Old Firm clash against Premiership leaders Rangers to come for the Hoops on Saturday, Reynolds insists United will be trying to use that distraction to their advantage at Parkhead this afternoon.#Celtic have dominated Scottish football for however long so you look for any tiny advantage,# he admitted.#They are a team who are playing under more pressure now than at any time I can remember.#They are up against a Rangers team who have found their feet and have been as relentless as Celtic have been in the past few seasons.#I think Celtic are aware they have no room for a slip up and they realise every game is huge for them.#For us, we can only try to do what we have been doing every week and make the right decisions on the day.#We know we have the quality in the final third to make it a really interesting game.”LEE WILKIE: Everyone in Dundee has a Jim McLean story.

The spooky ride took  minutes and was clearly a highlight of the day as everyone is desperate to do it again another time with a dferent theme.The Campbeltown contingent of the club turned out in force and had a very successful day relishing the challenge of Sheila MacCallum’s clever Covid-busting games which had them racing up and down the arena while having to skilfully steer their ponies.It was truly a day of fun and laughter and a huge thank you from the club to everyone who helped to make this a memorable, happy day for so many in these dficult times.

The current bus stop and car park at the head of Glen Croe would also be bypassed. This is an important public transport link for local residents.The consultation launched by the Scottish Government’s Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson is a muddled exercise. It confuses the urgent need to decide on an alternative route for a new road through Glen Croe with the much longer-term strategic transport options for improving connectivity between Argyll and west-central Scotland.Most of the strategic options involve a number of new civil engineering challenges including the construction of bridges over Loch Long and Loch Fyne and extensive road building, both new and upgraded. For reasons of cost and complexity, none of these options are likely to be implemented within this decade.Whatever long-term strategy options may be investigated for their feasibility, there remains the urgent need to build a new road in Glen Croe. It will always be necessary to link the communities of Arrochar Tarbetwith Loch Goil, Cairndow, north Loch Fyne, Inveraray and beyond with the A.I note that both my local community council in Loch Goil and Argyll and Bute Council support the route that follows the existing forest track on the opposite side of the glen from the Rest and Be Thankful without a similar risk of landslides. Compared with the strategic options, this is a modestof road to construct.The sooner that steps are taken to realise this solution the better it will be for all who currently suffer the increasingly frequent road closures due to climate change and the unstable hill.Alastair R Moodie, LochgoilheadSir,Every year thousands of children contact Childline about being bullied online and tell us that they feel it is hard to escape from.Lockdown has intensied these feelings for many and since April we’ve counselled more than , children and young people across the UK about online bullying.Children have told us about people sending threatening or abusive messages and being pressured into engaging in sexual conversations. Others have shared that they’ve been excluded from online games by other children, while some spoke of online identities being stolen to embarrass or cause trouble while using their name.Before lockdown measures were first introduced this year, the average monthly number of counselling session with children about online bullying was . Between April and October that value increased by  per cent to a monthly average of .This is worrying, particularly as we continue to adhere to strict social-distancing restrictions across Scotland and children continue to spend more time online. Bullying can have a long-term impact on the mental wellbeing of a child and, as we mark Anti Bullying Week this month and beyond, it’s important to ensure that every child knows who they can turn to for support.If a parent thinks their child is being bullied online, it can be hard to remain calm, but it’s crucial not to overwhelm a child with questions. Taking their device away is likely to make them feel like whatever has happened is their fault instead, it’s helpful to listen to their worries, suggest they take some time away from certain apps, and provide them with reassurance.Adeniyi Alade, service head of Childline at NSPCC ScotlandSir,Boris Johnson’s comment that devolution has been #a disaster north of the border# and #Tony Blair’s worst mistake# should hardly come as a surprise to anyone.The Tories have never been great supporters of devolution, vehemently opposing both the referendums in  on establishing a Scottish Assembly and in  on the Scottish Parliament.Most recently the devolution power grab that is highlighted in the Internal Market Bill simply reinforces this stance.The Scottish Social Attitudes surveyon constitutional preference found that only seven per cent favour abolition of the Scottish Parliament and it found that trust in the Scottish Government sits at four times that of the UK Government. This points to it hardly being a disaster.For those accused of scaremongering that there is a threat to Holyrood, Mr Johnson’s comments are clear vindication. The irony of all this being that devolution has given new le to the Scottish Conservatives after its wipe out in  and it is now the opposition in the Scottish Parliament.Be under no doubt that the Scottish Parliament, which was hard fought for, is under threat and we must do all in our power to defend it.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 18 follow me","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Why  Because this modication very effectively protects moths from becoming bat-fodder.Butterflies are active during the day but moths are mostly nocturnal. And under the night sky moths make a tasty meal for insectivorous bats. These tiny mammals detect their prey by echo-location, a method of hunting that involves emitting repeated ultrasonic squeaks, generally with a dominant frequency range of - kilohertz . Their prey is then located from the direction of the ing echoes.Moths have evolved ious mechanisms to evade these predators: some have developed ears that detect bat echolocation calls, allowing them to take evasive action, but others, the earless moths, have to rely on passive defences – so-called acoustic camouflage # that is, their hairy thoraces.Comparing tomographic echo images from two species of earless moths with two species of diurnal butterflies, the Bristol scientists found very little effect on the ultrasound echoes from the thin layer of thoracic scales of butterflies. In contrast, the hair-like scales covering moth thoraces absorbed around  per cent of the ultrasonic sound energy in the broadband - kHz. This provides clear protection from hunting bats and consequently is a very signicant survival advantage.Addressing the mechanisms behind the ultrasound reduction achieved by moth thoraces, the scientists found that the hair-like scales form a connected network of air pockets, which act as porous ultrasound absorbers. Sound waves entering the network cause air molecules in the pockets to vibrate, thereby dissipating energy and reducing echo reflection.The overall arrangement and microstructure of hair-like moth scales closely resembles man-made fibrous materials designed to absorb sound but, interestingly, the Bristol team showed that the moth scales have a considerably higher absorption capacity. So perhaps we could learn lessons from these small hairy creatures.* J. R. Soc.

There are plainly the financial resources to deal with this.It is an inexcusable dereliction of duty on their part and will not be forgiven or forgotten by people whose jobs and livelihoods are being threatened by this ongoing crisis.Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands RegionSir,I am delighted that the Scottish Government is taking forward my campaign for greater fire safety precautions in social housing.Guidance is now going out to the building industry, ahead of installing fire sprinklers in all new social housing with new regulations coming into effect next year.The sprinklers will be a requirement in new flats, maisonettes and larger multi-occupancy dwellings, including where care is provided.Fire sprinklers have  proved time and time again to be effective in the fight against fire and I know that this move will save lives.There has always been strong backing for these plans from the public, the industry and other MSPs, especially in the light of the Grenfell Tower disaster.I would still like retro-fitting sprinklers in older properties to be considered and, although that is my longer term hope, I understand the problems this would pose.I am delighted this is coming in before I retire as an MSP at next year#s election – what better than a le-saving #present# at Christmas David Stewart MSP, Highlands and Islands RegionSir,Can I please, through the columns of the Argyllshire Advertiser, say a very big thank you to all the wonderful staff and their manager Nan Anderson at the council#s Ardfenaig care home in Ardrishaig.These people have, since the lockdown and well before that, given those in their care love and affection that is second to none.On a daily basis they put themselves in harm#s way, to the benefit of not only the residents but also the relatives of the residents, and may I personally say they do it in a professional and loving way.On behalf of those in your care, especially those who cannot say it for themselves, #Thank you and a very merry Christmas to you all#.Leonard McNeill, MinardSir,I congratulate the Scottish Government on its recent commitment to a bill that will give the role of local government legal status in Scotland.The European Charter of Local Self-Government Bill has been proposed and fought for by Andy Wightman of the Green Party. It aims to incorporate the European Charter of Local Self-Government into Scots law, setting out certain rights for councils and protecting them from centralisation.It’s been strongly supported by local government body COSLA, whose president, Councillor Alison Evison said: #This is a good day for democracy in Scotland. It is a good day for our communities.# It’s also a good day for our hard-pressed local government.Here in Argyll and Bute, I think we recognise the absolute necessity of so many of the services provided by local government for our day-to-day wellbeing.We also recognise the increasingly challenging responsibility involved in the delivery of those services, not least in the face of Covid- and the climate emergency, which both have tested us all this year.Our comings and goings have been adversely affected by both these #events#, as our social relations are constrained by the first, and our movements, our access and connectivity by the unprecedented scale of the A Rest and be Thankful landslides.Andy Wightman’s Bill,enacted, will give people a stronger voice in the conduct of their  affairs, and we will increasingly need that stronger voice to advocate for our present and our future in Argyll and Bute.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,The much-loved Erskine Tree of Honour was dedicated and lit in fine style last week.Every year the Tree of Honour dedications lead us into the festive season.This year, in spite of the pandemic, we embrace the opportunity to remember those who will be missing from our lives this Christmas.

As part of that inquiry,  Minister for Sport Joe Fitzpatrick gave evidence at the committee on Tuesday.#While the meeting was very helpful, the detail of how and when the funding and grants will be made available is not yet known and I know clubs at every level of the game are keen to know when and how they can apply for the help being offered.#As an avid football fan I know just how perilously close some clubs are to going under and we need to make sure this money gets to those who need it without delay.He continued: #Football is in the very fabric of communities up and down Scotland and loss of gate sales and hospitality revenue has hit clubs hard.#We must get that help out to the clubs immediately to secure the future of the game, at every level, in Scotland.#"},{"url":null,"title":"distanced but together for christmas celebration","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The rules and regulations put in place to control coronavirus have put paid to that tradition for this year.#But that does not mean that communities cannot sing Christmas carols, even while everyone keeps their distance.#A creative way around this has been the suggestion that on Sunday December  at pm, people should gather on their doorsteps, or by a window, and sing out together. Just as communities rallied to thank NHS and other key-workers by standing in their doorways to make a joyful noise on Thursday evenings, the idea is that we can all join together to sing in Christmas – to be heralds,not angels!#Five carols are going to be sung nationwide that night: O Come all ye Faithful, Still the Night, Once in Royal David’s City, Away in a Manger and Hark the Herald Angels Sing – and the Ardrishaig community is being encouraged to join in.#Carol sheets have been made available at the church, in Peter Law  Sons, Morna#s Flower Shop and McColl#s.#It has also been suggested thatpeople wanted they could leave a donation for Ardrishaig Social Club’s Pensioners# Christmas Dinner .#Typically  or so folk gather for their Christmas dinner and some light entertainment on the Friday before Christmas but, of course, that isn’t possible this year.

Give until January  and public donations will be doubled by the UK Government, up to £ million – meaning we can reach even more hungry children in Liberia with le-changing school meals.Please visit marysmeals.org.uk Christmas to set your place.Wishing you a peaceful and happy Christmas.Daniel Adams , executive director, Mary’s Meals UKSir,What happened to Lochgilphead postmaster Findlay Campbell was tragic.But we need to get the post office service back.I realise that a Post Office van comes up from Tarbert three days a week at the moment, but with a queue of  people having to stand in the cold and damp # as there was on a Wednesday recently # this is hardly conducive to the customers# health, let alone convenience.I trust something is being done tothis much-needed service to the town of Lochgilphead.Celia MacFarlane, LochgilpheadSir,During questions to Transport Secretary Michael Matheson on Thursday December , I told the minister that people were exasperated with the condition of both the A and A after years of promises of investment in them.Mr Matheson’s response, which mainly referenced plans to upgrade the A and the A, will be of little comfort to residents and businesses in the West Highlands who are utterly dependent on the A and A.We have had more than enough woolly pledges over the years, usually made in the run-up to an election, which are then quietly forgotten afterwards, and I’m afraid that Michael Matheson’s response indicates that it will be business as usual as far as his government is concerned.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,I found your article on #Tougher health cuts worry# in the December  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser very dficult to read.I was concerned about the statement attributed to Councillor Mulvaney saying: #It is the same things that are there # learning disability, older people and physical disability # all chunky sums of money at circa £k to ££k#.Yes, they are chunky sums of money and have been on the agenda for some time.  However, we are talking about people human beings who have ious disabilities, learning, physical, and people who are older, something that will eventually happen to us all. People are not just a category for cost cutting, particularly those most vulnerable.This statement could be interpreted in many ways. For me it reads that people with such disabilities and getting older are a drain on our resources, and we need to cut out the services we provide for them. It all sounds like they are a burden on the finances, and that has got to stop. All because the budget must be balanced#at any cost it seems.My question to Councillor Mulvaney is quite simple # What you would do to address these particular costs  Decant everyone into another council area, or simply just hope thatservices are cut so they cannot live in their own homes, or indeed anywhere within Argyll and Bute, they leave Perhaps CouncillorMulvaney has never experienced anyone with disabilities. I have, and unless one has that experience then putting a price on providing a quality service is impossible. Vulnerable people need support which gives them, as much as possible, some sort of a meaningful le. Maybe that is why costs cannot actually be cut, and there needs to be a complete re-think. People are not just a statistic, nor should they be apparently dismissed as a commodity that is costing too much.If the HSCP does not have enough funding to deliver the services stated in the strategic plan, and to the standards it states, it needs to fight to get the correct level of funding from the Scottish Government, or perhaps look at itself and cut down on what I see are excessive layers of management, to make savings in order to deliver to the right level of all services within Argyll and Bute.Heather A Grier, CowalSir,A tunnel in the Faroe Islands is almost complete.

These species grow in the arid conditions of the Middle East and the Horn of Africa, where they have been tapped for their precious sap for millennia.Mentioned in ancient Hebrew texts, frankincense and myrrh were prized for the sweet aromatic fumes they produce when burned, and were used to freshen the airduring embalming of the dead and offering sacrices to the gods. Frankincense and myrrh are components of incense, and as such were carried along ancient trade routes.Incense reached Western Europe with crusaders ing from the Eastern Roman Empire where it was wafted in churches, a use that continues today.Also, frankincense and myrrh are used in traditional Chinese medicines # recommended for conditions as erse as inflammation, pain, fever, indigestion and ulcers. They are also components of mosquito deterrents, deodorants and toothpaste. All fairly obscure you may think, but sales of frankincense have recently rocketed it is now an important part of the international, multi-million pound essential oil industry. Great for the trade, but the booming market is putting severe strain on the supply chain*.Back in the Horn of Africa the trees are suffering. Powerful middle men are encouraging local owners to over-tap their trees for this desirable commodity, resulting in stressed trees, less seed production and virtually no young trees growing up to maintain the plantations.Yet, there is hope, but speed is of the essence. Tappers are being encouraged to form co-operatives, and are getting expert help with tree management. Nevertheless, spare a thought for the growers and the trees as you enjoy your frankincense-scented bath over the Christmas break.* New Scientist   December "},{"url":null,"title":"news from the districts december 25 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

All of our young people are our future andthey require a little help to get there, then so be it.I have heard that Councillor Mulvaney says he has an accounting background, but he seems to lack compassion. Is this a trait of accountants He is depute leader of the council and policy lead for financial services and major projects. To my mind he is not showing a particularly good example to his fellow councillors by making statements that are ill-informed and condemn the vulnerable to miserable lives.Argyll and Bute Council led the way with #care in the community# when this was brought in by the Scottish Government now it seems it doesn’t give a damn for care in the community.Do his fellow councillors want to be tarred with the same brush Is everyone in Councillor Mulvaney#s Helensburgh Central ward hale and hearty with no disabilities  I do not think so.Maybe now is the time that Councillor Mulvaney looks at his current positions before Argyll and Bute Council gains a reputation it does not deserve.An incredibly angry resident of Argyll and Bute, name and address suppliedSir,End of le charity Marie Curie is calling on people across Scotland to brave the chill and do a festive dip to show support for those impacted by death, dying and bereavement.This year has been challenging for many and the charity sector has taken a huge hit, with fundraising events cancelled since Covid- hit in the spring. Marie Curie nurses have been working on the frontline throughout the pandemic caring for people at end of le at the Glasgow and Edinburgh hospices and in people’s homes across Scotland.Marie Curie needs to raise £, every month to provide care and services in Scotland.During the festive season, I hope our supporters will back the new Christmas campaign # running from December  to January  # encouraging people and their four-legged friends to get outdoors and do a festive dip either bare footed or in wellies, in the sea, a puddle or a bucket of ice.We are asking people to take a photo of themselves taking the dip, post it on their social media channels, tag seven friends and donate £ to Marie Curie.We know there has been much sadness this year and we want people to smile throughout the festive season.Living in Scotland we are never short of a puddle or two, and are lucky to be surrounded by coastlines, so there’s always going to be the perfect opportunity for the whole family to get outdoors and unleash their inner child.To donate visit www.justgiving campaign festivedip.Debbie Mooney, head of community fundraising, Marie CurieSir,The fact that UNICEF, the UN’s child protection wing, will for the first time intervene to support those at risk of hunger in the UK, is a damning indictment on the depths to which the UK has sunk.UNICEF has put its funding behind a scheme designed to provide breakfast boxes to , families over the course of the Christmas holidays – marking the first emergency response in the UK by the organisation since it was founded in .Rising levels of food poverty in the UK are an absolute disgrace and the Tory government should be ashamed of this.We are supposedly one of the richest countries in the world.

Food and drink is a staple in households across Scotland for Hogmanay, and it is certainly something that can remain the same, even with these uncertain times.A pot of soup to bring in the bells never goes a miss, and youd be forgiven for thinking that a slow-cooked stew is something of legend at this time of year.But while many families would plan to head out for a New Years Day meal, this will not be going ahead this year.Alternatives could include trying out some new recipes at home, and having a New Years meal at home. Bake some goodies to bring in the bells with, such as traditional Scots tablet or shortbread.Zoom have lted their -minute time limit across the New Year period, so set the camera at the bottom of your table and invite however many guests youd like!First footingA tradition throughout Scotland on Hogmanay, the normal act of first footing will certainly be missed this year, but there may be a way to salvage it.Traditionally, first footing involves the first person who enters the house after midnight bringing gts. It has been adapted through the years, and some now visit neighbours with a tipple and a song before moving on to the next house.While were not allowed in other peoples houses this year, we can certainly adapt the tradition.Ask one of your household to draw the short straw and brave the cold just after midnight and emulate a first footing with your immediate bubble. Or, have a virtual first footing, and make sure to call your loved ones and wish them a Happy New Year.TelevisionAs always, there will be a raft of content available to watch on TV on Hogmanay. The official TV guide has not yet been released, but therersquoll likely be old favourites including the likes of Still Game.As ever, there will be several Hogmanay specials to help us bring in the bells from the comfort of our own home. Over on BBC One, Susan Calman will be getting ready for Hogmanay  with ldquoa studio of stars.Live eventsThe events that Scotlandrsquos festive season are famed for wonrsquot be going ahead in person this year. However, many are embracing a digital approach for the first time, making it easier for us to enjoy the festivities from our homes.Edinburghrsquos Hogmanay, which usually takes the form of an incredible street party with live performances and festivities, will instead be heading online.

When you then think of other celebrities earning mouth-watering sums from the BBC, this gives clear evidence that the BBC could quite easily continue with the free television licences for the over-s.My income does not qualy for pension credit by a small margin but I have now had two communications from TV Licensing reminding me to pay the fee.Each time it encloses a brochure and ious forms to complete in the hope that I feel empowered to pay the £. required to watch TV.So far, I have decided to weather the storm and not pay. My hope is that thousands of over-s do likewise and Auntie will realise that expecting us to fall into line is not as simple as it expects.Silver Voices continue to pressure the BBC to think again and reinstate free licences for the over-s.It has my full support and will continue to do so until the BBC bites the bullet and cancels its continued harassment of OAPs.Keith Abendroth, Campbeltown.For many of us, the festive season is a time for giving and sharing, which is why we’re inviting you to celebrate Giving Tuesday.I’d like to take a moment to share with your readers how, in choosing to give to our charity, Revitalise, you’ll be making a real dference to the lives of the disabled people and carers that we support.As a charity we know that however tricky this past year has been, le is about spending time with the people we love, and everyday le can so easily get in the way of that.

Le is too short you know you need to keep fighting.#On top of the dficulties this year has presented, disabled people and the elderly have also been left with far less support than usual, as the Emergency Coronavirus Act allowed local authorities to axe their duty of care responsibilities. Feeling vulnerable and abandoned, many carers are close to breaking point.#This is why we have launched our campaign, Care For Carers and the fundraiser Raise a Million, aiming to raise £ million to support carers and their loved ones to access respite care breaks following lockdown.We have provided respite care breaks # a vital leline to so many unpaid home carers and their disabled loved ones # for over  years.So, in celebration of Giving Tuesday this month, why not pledge to give something special to our charity this festive season I am so proud to work for Revitalise as we amply the voice of carers, and will continue to do so until carers stories are heard.

And then, over the next couple of years, we slowly got them recorded.#Since forming The Strunts, the duo have performed live for a handful of gigs including the Kintyre Songwriters Festival and a couple of Homesong sets.David added: #Obviously it’s been impossible to perform recently and, as a result, we focussed on getting the album out. We#re delighted to say it is now for sale at The Kintyre Larder and The Fish Shop with donations from it going to Kintyre Food Bank and Children First.#Since the album#s release, the pair have had some great reviews in the music press, including this one from Ian D Hall in the Liverpool Sound And Vision: #Together as The Strunts, Les and David have found a common cause, one that sees the release of the album Too Much Of Everything, consistently catching the ear throughout.#The listener starts to understand that the only things you can have too much of are hate, apathy, ignorance and grief, that even in anger there must be subtle humour paving the way to the hope of healing.#A tremendous introduction to a new partnership.#Too Much of Everything is available for £ at The Kintyre Larder and at The Fish Shop, with  per cent of those sales being donated to the food bank and Children First until the end of January."},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane december 18 2020","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The landlord claimed that through inadvertent evidence upon which he proposed to rely had not been led before the court below and the appeal was allowed. Having heard the additional evidence, the higher court have now refused the appeal, and find the landlord appellant liable in expenses.In the course of a note, the court state that it was not disputed that the applicant was a yearly tenant of his house and land, and that his tenancy did not cease on his employment being brought to an end.Section  of the Crofters Act, , does not therefore apply, as these subjects were not let during the continuance of the employment, and he was not a tradesman placed in the district by the landlord for the benefit of the neighbourhood.Indeed, the respondent#s agent refused to found upon that section, and he placed his case upon the general argument that as this house was required for an estate servant, it would be a great hardship for the proprietor to be deprived of its use for that purpose, after the applicant#s intimation that he did not propose any longer to accept employment from the estate.The tenant has fulfilled all the statutory conditions and titling him to be declared a statutory small tenant, and we have no option but to grant an order to that effect. We therefore agree with the court below that this play falls to be repelled.The only other points raised by the respondent was that these subjects did not constitute a holding in respect that the ground attached to the house was of comparatively small extent. For the reasons stated by Mr Barber, we do not see that we can give effect to this plea, and as the appellants agent stated that he did not raise any question on the amount of rent fixed, we have refused the appeal.Agent for the landlord # Mr Archd.

All important, yes, but why did he fail to mention the two sectors that face the challenge to their survival caused by Brexit: farming and fishing  Both sectors face severe financial ruin.On fishing, west coast fishermen rely on rapid transit to get their catches of prawns, langoustines, crabs and lobsters to Europe within  hours of landing.These vital exports will, due to Brexit, be subject to senseless bureaucracy of red tape before they reach their destination.Warnings from the fishing businesses all along the west coast of Scotland have been ignored by the UK Government. Coupled with this delay are tarfs set as Britain will no longer be an EU member.Next, to farming. Everything points to constant financial hardship. Lamb exports, vital for every sheep farmer in Scotland, face EU levies of  per cent of the value of these animals.For example, prime lambs currently worth £ to export will near be worth £. These levels ofwill make sheep production unviable. All exports of world famous Scotch beef will be levied, as well as Scotch food and drink exports currently worth many millions to the Scottish economy.In the  EU referendum, Scotland voted  per cent to  per cent to remain in the EU. As everyone in the UK surveys the last minute shambles of #No deal or bad deal#, they must be amazed at the absolute mess we are in.Our chance of salvation or rescue comes next May when Scotland has a chance to let Mr Cameron realise the folly of his party#s ways.Robert MacIntyre, Rothesay.First our children painted rainbows, then we stood on our doorsteps applauding the NHS.Now Scotland#s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and devolved administration will grant a one-off #thank you# payment to all NHS Scotland staff. The gross sum of £ will be paid to all full-time staff, including primary care and home care staff and care home and hospice workers.This bonus sum, costing upwards of £ million, will be taxable, resulting in those NHS staff members on the lowest income likely to be hit the hardest.Part-time staff are to receive a #proportionate share# and employees in receipt of top-up benefits may experience a #knock-on# effect on entitlements.The Scottish Labour leader, Richard Leonard, said #many care home workers are part-time, so the fear is that they will end up with a derisory payment#.Let#s also remember that in England and Wales, tax is payable at  per cent on taxable income up to £,. In Scotland, our tax is payable at  per cent on taxable income up to £,.Le Presidente Nicola and her Sepratista Nationale Politicohave put on something akin to a magic show. The question you may wish to ask yourself, is this worthy of your applause Tommy Macpherson, Saddell.I was disappointed that my amendment, brought to the Mid Argyll, Kintyre and the Islands Area Committee to retain the underspend of £, designated for Tarbert regeneration improvements, was not supported by Councillor Alastair Redman.I appreciate that the councillors who represent Lochgilphead were keen that the additional monies should top-up the costs of the project at the Front Green as that tender has come in much in excess of the original budget, but it is deplorable that a councillor elected to represent Tarbert chose to vote against the amendment that would have allowed Tarbert to benefit from the funding allocated for improvements in the village.I would assure all residents in Tarbert that I will work for the people of Tarbert, who elected me to represent them in the best way I can.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands.Being a previous resident in the Wee Toon, and now residing in Helensburgh, I totally agree that Campbeltown and all other rural places in Argyll, should have been moved to tier one a couple of weeks ago.Helensburgh has had its tier two status challenged recently by sailors from Faslane in several groups going to the boozers and buying #substantial# meals with several beers, but are classed as being from the same household due to being on the same ship.Also #Weegies# getting the short train journey from Glasgow and breaching the travel rules to infest the area unlawfully.We are the closest town to the Covid hot spots, which certainly doesn#t help matters.I hope Nicola Sturgeon sees sense and allows all rural places in Argyll to be exempt from the harsh restrictions that are unfairly spread over the whole of the region.Name and address supplied.I see Bruno Tonioli is pocketing £, a minute during his current appearances on Strictly Come Dancing which equates to a further  free TV licences for the over s.Is it any wonder the BBC has a problem with those of us refusing to pay the licence fee of £. when it can pay mouth-watering sums to endless so-called celebrities.I realise the BBC has a duty to honour contracts but perhaps honouring previous pledges to OAPs over  would be a way forward.I also see water bills are likely to increase every year for the next six years, adding an average increase in council tax bills of £ per annum.Seeing as it seems to have rained every day since October in this part of the world, I begin to wonder how water companies can equate this increase to all citizens who have no alternative other than to pay.Perhaps internal budgeting within these companies could well be a sensible solution.Keith Abendroth, Campbeltown.We are launching the Young People’s Board for Change, and want to recruit  members aged between  and  years, from across the country.The board members will use the  to raise awareness of what matters most to them, take action and make change happen. They will also have a big role internally advising staff and trustees.The young people will take part in new experiences and opportunities, meet other young people, as well as develop confidence and learn le-long new skills, such as campaigning and public speaking.Over a two-year period, members will take part in residentials, meetings and workshops, and campaign to share their views and opinions.We want as many young people as possible to have the chance to apply, so we are encouraging parents and carers to speak to their children about this exciting opportunity, and teachers and other professionals to share details with their students and through their networks.Find out more at nspcc.org.uk boardforchange, or for an informal chat please contact participationteam@nspcc.org.uk.The deadline for completed applications is January  and interviews will be held between January  and .Carla Malseed, local campaigns manager for NSPCC Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week december 18 2020","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Well, as the Native Americans might say, #the story might not necessarily be true, but it is full of truth#.However you view this, something wonderful happened on a starry night over , years ago # something too wonderful to explain in simple words. The ordinary merged with the extraordinary and hope was born.The ordinary and the extraordinary became the midwe of our faith.One explanation could be that Jupiter and Saturn were in alignment on that starry night so long ago.What do astronomers make of this idea Tim O#Brien, associate director of Jodrell Bank Observatory, suggests this would have looked striking.#It#s remarkable how much your attention is drawn when two very bright objects come together in the sky,# he explains.And once the planets lined up in their orbits, Earth would #overtake# the others, meaning that Jupiter and Saturn would appear to change direction in the night sky. A wandering star I invite you to look to the south west about an hour after sunset on the winter solstice, December .You may see something that has not happened for  years. Jupiter and Saturn will come so close together that it will look just like one giant, amazing star.Could this astronomical display of beauty have happened around the time of Jesus#s birth I believe God uses nature to speak to us, and the more time we spend learning about the wonders of nature, the closer we come to God."},{"url":null,"title":"msp presses for detail on football funding","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Many may be living on their own for the first time and often will not have a network of friends and family around to offer them support.Christmas can be a particularly dficult and isolating time for care leavers as they find themselves having to spend the festive season on their own, especially this year when Covid- restrictions mean it will be dficult to go out to socialise and the usual large-scale Christmas dinners for care leavers will not be taking place.However, the charity Family Action runs Listening Works, a free virtual helpline specically for young care leavers aged  to  years old across the UK.

After years of the charity campaigning, on December , the UK Government announced the framework for a future Online Harms Bill that has the potential to provide much greater protection for children when they use the internet.This is a landmark moment – a major step towards legislation that can make an enforceable legal duty of care on tech companies a reality. For too long children have been exposed to disgraceful abuse and harm online.Social media companies will have a duty to protect young users from child abuse and harmful content online and face fines of up to £ million or  per cent of their global turnoverthey fail.But that doesn’t mean that the work we do stops now. For instance, the proposals fall short of ensuring criminal sanctions against named directors whose companies fail to uphold their duty of care.Child protection and children’s voices must remain front and centre of regulatory requirements. We have set out six tests for robust regulation – including action to tackle both online sexual abuse and harmful content and a regulator with the power to investigate and hold tech firms to account with criminal and financial sanctions.Failing to pass any of the six tests will mean that future generations of children will pay with serious avoidable harm and sexual abuse.We will now be closely scrutinising the proposals against those tests. Above all, legislation must ensure Ofcom has the power and resources to enforce the duty of care and be able to identy and then take appropriate action against tech firms that fail.For more information, search ‘NSPCC six tests’.Joanna Barrett, policy and public affairs manager, NSPCC Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"mcconnachie claims dunavertys december medal","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Or, have a virtual first footing, and make sure to call your loved ones and wish them a Happy New Year.As always, there will be a raft of content available to watch on TV on Hogmanay. The official TV guide has not yet been released, but therersquoll likely be old favourites including the likes of Still Game.As ever, there will be several Hogmanay specials to help us bring in the bells from the comfort of our own home.

Two years ago, I was privileged to spend a fantastic afternoon with these birds.It was a chilling but sunny day. As my dad, who is a nature lover, was visiting me for Christmas, I took the opportunity to take him on a trip to Aberlady. This place is always rich in all sorts of wildle. I also knew that some waxwing sightings had been recorded earlier that week.As soon as we arrived, I spotted a rather big flock of birds that briefly circulated above our heads before disappearing towards the reserve. Everything happened so fast that I did not have enough time to pick up my binoculars for a closer look at the birds.We rushed towards a copse of rowan trees, where I knew the waxwings would most likely congregate. As we were coming closer, I could recognise the merry trill that these stunning birds make as they were happily feeding on berries. You may remember from my previous articles how careful I am when it comes to approaching wildle. This time was no dferent we took our time watching the waxwings from a distance, letting them get used to our presence. This is a great technique to signal to wildle that we are no threat to them.Suddenly, the flock was spooked by a dog and raised high in the sky for a split second before landing above our heads. My dad and I gave each other a knowing grin and started admiring the beautul creatures sitting merely a couple of metres away from us. This was an unusual moment to me as a wildle photographer: the birds were so close that my lens was too big to capture the scene! But that picture of waxwings having a feast right above me will stay in my memory for a long time.Waxwings are often mistaken for common starlings. These two species are similar in size and, to an extent, profile.However,you look closely, you should spot the peach-brown colouring of waxwingsrsquo plumage. An even closer look will reveal the real charm and beauty that these birds possess: the enlivening neutral base colours are accompanied by splashes of white and red in the wings and a strong yellow band at the base of the tail. The head is crowned by a distinctive crest, which can be raised or lowered depending on the birdrsquos mood. Adding to their appeal is the prominent black mask on their eyes.Waxwings are gregarious birds, who can form large flocks consisting of hundreds of iniduals. They breed in boreal forest that extends from Scandinavia through Russia and across to the Pacic coast.Waxwings are a forgiving subject to photograph they do not encounter humans within their breeding habitats, therefore are approachable on their winter grounds, providing a great opportunity to capture them feeding on colourful berry trees.Waxwings make a loud but cheerful trill as they scour the landscape looking for fruit.Berries are incredibly important for waxwings in the winter. These birds can eat up to twice their body weight, which makes around -, berries a day!Their diet changes during their breeding season as the birds switch to feeding on mosquitoes and midges.Our native rowan is their favoured tree, but they will happily feed on hawthorn, cotoneaster and rosehips as well as dried fruit.If waxwings are in the area and you do not have berries, they can be attracted into gardens using apple halves hung from a tree. It is common to spot waxwings in such ordinary places as supermarket car parks, as they often have ornamental shrubs with berries.This was my first year writing Zanrsquos Wildle Diary and I have greatly enjoyed sharing my stories and experiences with you.

Get compostingChristmas - with its inevitable surfeit of food - can often mean bulging bins full of food waste, which is terrible news for the environment. However, you can easily make your own organic compost and plant food, whatever size of garden you have.There are many ways to do this, including bokashi bins which use friendly bacteria to break down any kind of food . Whether its a balcony wormery to a traditional garden compost heap, however you do it your plantswill thank you.. Make a new pondAny water in the garden is brilliant for helping wildle, as well as an attractive feature and a chance to grow dferent plants. Small ponds can easily be made without using a plastic or fibreglass liner - any watertight container will do, such as an old bucket or bath - and can be sunk in the ground or kept proud of it.Just be sure that there is a ramp from inside the pond so that amphibians, hedgehogs and the like can get out easily. Larger ponds can be made from puddled clay, or use the thickest, longest-lasting butyl liner possible.. Re-use plastic potsPlant suppliers are increasingly using biodegradable or recyclable pots, but what to do with the stock of black plastic ones in the shed  Throwing away perfectly usable pots, whatever they are made of, makes no environmental sense.A better option is to use everything, plastic pots included, until it is at the end of its le, and then replace itnecessary with a more environmentally-friendly alternative.Broken plastic pots can now be recycled at most large garden centres. If you dont need them, perhaps a community or school garden has a use for them . Use water sustainablyA simple change or two can make big steps towards water sustainability. First, install a water butt. Rainwater is better for plants than tap water anyway and it will save on water bills. Most water butts tend to be made of plastic, so why not get a water-butt erterand repurpose an old barrel . Grow your ownEating a plant-based diet is one of the best ways to reduce your carbon footprint, so grow your own veg. Even in the depths of winter you can grow microgreens indoors on your windowsill for quick crops of tasty, nutritious leaves - try radish, beetroot or coriander.. Enlist nature to help with pest controlBug sprays that kill garden pests such as aphids are environmentally damaging and kill other insects such as bees. By planting flowers that attract aphid-eating wildle, such as hoverflies and ladybirds, nature will do the job for you.Daisy-type flowers such as marigoldsand flat-topped flowers such as yarrow and fennel are all popular with beneficial insects.

But what about taking a stroll around the lesser-visited Dean Village  This curious, charming ldquovillage, which looks straight out of a postcard, is in fact located in the heart of Scotlandrsquos capital city. Starting in the centre of Edinburgh, it doesnrsquot take long to reach Dean Village, with its collection of th-century cottages and brightly painted houses.You can then head down towards the river, stopping to take some Instagram-worthy photographs before continuing along the Water of Leith path as far as you feel like. If yoursquore feeling fresh you can follow it out of the city centre towards Balerno and Currie, or in the opposite direction towards Leith, where you will be spoiled for choice with coffee shops in which to get yourself a sweet treat as a reward.Falls of Falloch, near CrianlarichAll of the views, but none of the effort: the Falls of Falloch is a perfect walk for those who are feeling a bit lazy. You simply need to park up in the designated car parkand then stroll along a short path to reach an opening where you can see the waterfall. Arguably, it looks at its best in winter, when the extra rainfall makes the water incredibly powerful albeit slightly intimidating.You can view the waterfall from the path itself but therersquos also a dedicated, rather special viewing  designed by John Kennedy and constructed from steel rods. Named Woven Sound, it contains extracts from the diary of poet Dorothy Wordsworth at the end of its caged viewpoint, the details of which will encourage you to properly embrace the surroundings rather than just snapping a picture and walking away. Be warned though that while beautul it can be slightly frightening to look down through the walkway and see a sheer drop to the water below.Southerness Beach, DumfriesThis wide, sandy beach is quiet enough that you will have the place mostly to yourself, yet it falls within the Solway Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and offers some views out towards Cumbria and beyond. You can even spot dolphins or seals in the wateryou are lucky, or at least a couple of seabirds.Inverewe Gardens and Estate, Poolewe, Wester RossGardens and estate open daily from dawn until dusk, and entry is pound into the honesty box. Peaceful, picturesque and easy to walk around, Inverewe Gardens provides the ideal spot to soak up some nature without having to expend too much effort. The gardens are also a bit of a natural phenomenon, as species that shouldnrsquot grow in this part of the world are flourishing, thanks to the warm currents of the Gulf Stream and some clever planting design. As well as admiring the plants on display, the position of the garden on the banks of Loch Ewe means you might also be able to spot coastal birds, seals and even otters. To extend your walk further, head for the trails that lead around the Inverewe estate, where your four-legged friends are also welcome .Mugdock Reservoir, MilngavieIf you are feeling a bit lethargic after days of over-eating, you might not fancy struggling up a steep hill on your post-Christmas walk. Yoursquoll be pleased to hear, therefore, that there is hardly any incline whatsoever in the loop around Milngaviersquos two adjoining reservoirs. Whether you choose to tackle Mugdock or Craigmadddie or both, you will be greeted by a flat, pleasant circuit that is particularly popular over the Christmas holidays.You can stroll three miles round one reservoir, or sixyou want to do both, with woodlands at the edge of the Mugdock Reservoir for those who want to extend their walk further. And when you finish, you can head to Bullandrsquos Coffee House on Milngaviersquos Mugdock Road for a warming drink.Duff House to the Bridge of Alvah, Banff, AberdeenshireBuilt in , the three-storey Duff House is a Category A-listed structure that is considered to be one of the finest buildings in the north of Scotland. The interior is currently closed due to Covid, but you can still marvel at the architecture and landscaped grounds of the house before venturing on a two-mile walk to the impressive Bridge of Alvah. It takes about  minutes to get from the car park of Duff House to the bridge itself, but you will encounter some notable points of interest in the route through the woods to get there. Kids will love spotting Duff Ice Houseand a bit further along, a striking neo-Gothic mausoleum. Looking particularly beautul in the snow, this th-century tomb was built by the second Earl of Fe to house the remains of his ancestors. From there, you can continue through the woodland before reaching the Bridge of Alvah.Loch Faskally and the Salmon Ladder, Pitlochry, PerthshireTherersquos no shortage of picturesque walks in Perthshire, the ldquoBig Tree Country. Butyou are looking for one that isnrsquot too taxing, try this leisurely loop that leads from Pitlochry out to Loch Faskally and back again. Start at the Port-Na-Craig suspension bridge and cross the River Tummel towards the famous Festival Theatre, making your way past the Fish Ladder and Dam. Admiring the views of the loch as you go, the path then leads through some pretty woodland before crossing Loch Faskally on the Clunie Foot Bridge and winding back to the village along the waterrsquos edge. A great option for blowing away the cobwebs without too much effort.Glenfer Braes, near BarrheadOn a clear, December day, Glenfer Braes at Barrhead offers one of the best views in Greater Glasgow. If you park at the designated car park near to Caplethill Road, you only have to walk a couple of yards before being greeted with a sweeping panorama out across the south of the city. Beyond that, the park has plenty more to explore for those feeling up to it with the wider Glenfer Braes Country Park boasting woodland, marshland, a large reservoir and its very own herd of Highland cattle.Corrieshalloch Gorge National Nature Reserve, Auchindrean, UllapoolCorrieshalloch Gorge means ldquougly hollow in Gaelic but donrsquot let that put you off. In fact, the gorge is one of the most impressive in the country, a mile-long canyon through which the River Droma weaves it way towards the coast. There is a shorthike down to the gorge itself, where you will find a beautul suspension bridge which allows you to soak in the spectacular views. A word of warning ndashyou donrsquot like heights, give this one a miss.Dean Castle Country Park, KilmarnockThe star of this Ayrshire park is the th-century Dean Castle, an impressive structure used in the filming of the TV mega-hit show Outlander. Itrsquos currently being renovated, but there are plenty of signposted trails and country paths to explore for a pleasant wintry walk with the option to tackle a trail in its entirety or in a smaller, hangover-friendly chunk.

Thatrsquos the good news. In five years the target is %. But Covid- could change all that. Bad news unless urgent action is taken now.The impact of Covid- can be summed up in a single phrase, adapted from St Matthewrsquos Gospel: \"from those who have least, the most has been taken away\". Covid- infectionshave been highest, and the public health restrictions strictest, in the poorest areas.In these areas more schools have been disrupted more often and more pupils forced to quarantine. They are most likely to suffer from \"digital poverty\" ndash lack of suitable laptops, adequate wi and quiet space at home, despite the best efforts of schools and local authorities to bridge this digital ide.Progress towards closing the attainment gap between the best performing schools and pupils and those that perform less well may stall. The result could be fewer suitably qualied applicants for university from our poorest communities. Also universities have been forced to run outreach activities such as summer schools online, no substitute for in-person events such as campus visits.This is why, as Commissioner for Fair Access, I have written a special report on the impact of Covid- on fair access to higher education which has just been published on the Scottish Governmentrsquos website.Financial hardship is rising rapidly as a result of Covid-. Colleges and universities have increased their hardship funds, and the Government has provided some extra money. But this cannot compensate for the loss of income suffered by students who rely on part-time jobs, usually in hospitality.Finally, the Covid- pandemic has accelerated an already existing epidemic, of poor mental health among students. The Government will be considering multiple Covid- recovery packages. One should focus on protecting Scotlandrsquos proud record on fair access by addressing the challenges of the digital ide, disrupted schooling, financial hardship, mental health and a far from optimal student experience.Professor Sir Peter Scott is Commissioner for Fair Access"},{"url":null,"title":"issue-day-wonder-woman-1984-future-cinema","story":"Who is she and why is she so wondrous She is actress Gal Gadot, and shersquos wondrous because when shersquos suited and booted shersquos better known as Princess Diana of Themyscira, aka Wonder Woman, an Amazonian goddess who sees off assorted nersquoer-do-wells with her glowing Lasso of Truth.

When Wonder Woman  opened theatrically in the UK on December  only about a quarter of cinemas were open. With mainland Scotland now in Level Four and huge swathes of the rest of the UK in virtual lockdown there are hardly any open at all. In response, studio Warner Bros. decided to release Wonder Woman  on streaming  HBO Max on the same day as it went into US cinemas, and based on that plan the studio subsequently announced that all of its  releases would follow the same pattern. In other words cinemagoers wonrsquot have to leave the comfort of their sofas in order to enjoy the latest blockbusters on the day of release. The results so far have been interesting and, for the studio bean counters, encouraging: HBO Maxrsquos viewing hours per customer increased threefold over the Christmas period and nearly half of all subscribers watched Wonder Woman  film on Christmas Day.So is television the future of cinema With streaming giants such as Netflix ploughing more and more money into film production and the big film studios moving to digital home entertainment releases, it currently looks very like it ndash thoughyou canrsquot charge punters pound a ticket to go to the cinema, budgets may have to be revised downwards to accommodate the change."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary","story":"IN tomorrow eveningrsquos STV documentary Billy Connolly: Itrsquos Been A Pleasure, celebrity chums and the Big Yin himself reminisce about his career in what is being billed as a final farewell.Meanwhile, another of Billyrsquos buddies, novelist Kathy Lette, has revealed what she adores most about her friend, explaining hersquos ldquonot only wildly witty and deliciously self-deprecating, but without any self-pity.When Kathy showed concern about Billyrsquos Parkinsonrsquos diagnosis Connolly shrugged off her worries. ldquoI also have Anorak-sia Nervosa, he told her. ldquoAn irrational fear of ugly raincoats.Boyle bustedNOT all comedians are adored like Billy.

Most political commentators,myself included, dismissed him as a charlatan, a buffoon, an intellectually lazy chancer who just got lucky when he was elected London Mayor in . But no one has a lucky streak as long as his without having a touch of genuine political genius.:Ian McConnell on Brexit: We are now all bedevilled by bitter fruits of Tory ision: OpinionConsider his record. Mr Johnson led the Leave campaign to victory in  when the opinion polls said he would lose. He went on to become leader of the Conservative Party, by a landslide, and then renegotiated the EU Withdrawal Deal that everyone said could not be reopened. That helped him win an astonishing near-landslide victory in the  General Election, plunging Labour to its worst defeat since . Now finally, tonight, he will have the satisfaction of seeing the House of Commons vote forhis Brexmas trade deal. The one all the smart people said was never going to happen.Many in the commentariat suspected that Mr Johnson had decided to go for a no deal Brexit ndash or what he called an ldquoAustralian-style deal on ruinous WTO terms. It was thought he was in the pocket of hardline Tory backbenchers. That hersquod been outplayed by the clever lawyers of Brussels.The ex-Brexit Party leader, Nigel Farage, mocked Mr Johnsonrsquos talk of an ldquooven-ready deal and said the EU would never allow Britain to leave the jurisdiction of the European Court. Now even Mr Farage agrees that ldquothe war is over.You can call it a ldquothin deal, or second best to EU membership and I would agree, never having wanted to leave Europe in the first place. Britain will undoubtedly lose by no longer being part of the ldquofrictionless European single market. But this is undoubtedly a comprehensive trade deal, guaranteeing tarf and quota-free access to the market. The fishing industry isnrsquot pleased. But there was always going to be a trade-off between EU access to British waters and UK access to European markets for fish.The fact that it is really only the fishing industry crying ldquobetrayal tells you all you need to know. The vast majority of businesses, and the general public, heaved a massive sigh of relief on Christmas Eve, even in Scotland. I donrsquot think the opposition parties fully appreciated how their forecasting of no deal had affected the psychology of voters. People were genuinely afraid that shelves would empty, food prices would rocket, travel to Europe would end and the economy would tank. With their catastrophism, the opposition parties did Mr Johnsonrsquos work for him.Of course, there are many reasons for criticising this deal, not least its vagueness about the level playing field trade rules, but what it cannot be described as is a reckless no deal Brexit. Yet only a fortnight ago, Nicola Sturgeon accused the Prime Minister, not for the first time, of ldquoactively planning a no deal Brexit and said the prospects for a trade deal were ldquovanishingly thin. Now, in an astonishing volte face, the SNP leader has ordered her MPs to vote against the deal in the Commons tonight.This may make sense to diehard Remainers, but it will bamboozle many voters. They believed the opposition parties when they said they would move heaven and earthto prevent Britain leaving the EU without a trade deal. How can they possibly justy rejecting the only one on offer, and not a bad one either Only a year ago, the SNP, along with a majority of MPs in the Commons, voted for the Benn Act. This ordered the Prime Minister to do everything in his power to avoid a no deal Brexit, including delaying Article  and Brexit itself. The SNPrsquos Joanna Cherry took the PM to court to prevent no deal. The Supreme Court ruled that he was acting unlawfully in risking one by saying he would rather ldquodie in a ditch. Now Ms Sturgeon seems to have opted for the very ditch he vacated.If there were any chance of an alternative deal, such as membership of the European Economic Area, then voting against the Brexmas Agreement might have made sense. But the opposition parties missed their chance of delivering a soft Brexit last year by failing to vote for one. There is no alternative deal on offer and clearly no time to negotiate one before the January  deadline.The Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, saw the way the Brexit wind was blowing and ordered his troops to back the deal, on the not-unreasonable grounds that this was what he had been asking for all along. He didnrsquot want to repeat Jeremy Corbynrsquos mistakes. The SNP thinks it can safely vote against the deal because there is no chance of it being defeated. But political leaders canrsquot take the voters for fools. Mr Johnson will say it is not only defying the will of Brexit voters, and the will of Parliament, it is defying logic in voting for No Deal.Very few prime ministers actually make history. Margaret Thatcher did, by destroying Labour and the trade unions Tony Blair did by reinventing Labour again and winning three elections. But neither of them made as massive a dent in the British constitutional timeline as the politician universally known as ldquoBoris. No one is laughing at him any more.Twitter will still call him a racist, unfairly, since he isnrsquot. Ms Sturgeon will continue to label the PM ldquosexist . But by getting the SNP leader to vote against the only Brexit deal on offer he has made Ms Sturgeon look like a prize hypocrite. He may not be world king yet, but tonight Boris is king of the Commons.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

The wheel has come full circle. It is the best of both worlds because it means that the UK is free of laws and regulations imposed by a foreign power constraining economic, social and foreign policy, while at the same time allowing trade free of tarfs without paying pound billion a year for the privilege.Of course there have been compromises. That is only to be expected in such a wide-ranging deal. Fishing is a case in point. The French and other EU coastal states refused to accept being shut out overnight of waters they have fished for  years.According to Ian Blackford, the SNP Westminster leader, the deal will be \"a disaster for Scotland\". That isnt the view of the Centre for Economic and Business Research, which reports that the UK will outstrip all EU economies in growth and become  per cent larger than France by .William Loneskie, Lauder.LABOUR CULPABLE IN OUR EU LOSSWHEN one considers that Labour under the wobbling leadership of Sir Keir Starmer decided to back the Tory deal even before reading the small print and the myriad of implications arising from it, one wonders how Labour in Scotland can now survive.Labour is now a Tory clone. It is ironically following the red wall areas into Torydom.What is revealing day by day are the many personal benefits iniduals had from EU membership which are either gone or heavily restricted by this deal. The Brexiters, who included Labour members and MPs, chanted about \"taking back control\". What has happened is that the elite have taken back control and the ordinary citizen is now restricted, even penned in. That will become more apparent as the months pass.Restrictions on time you can spend in the EU now that one is a \"third country\". Limits on personal goods one can bring back through customs from the EU. VAT will now have to be paid on some goods. Ordering from the EU online will be subject to restrictions. Ironically, posting goods or presents to friends in Northern Ireland will need customs forms filled out detailing weight.Labour is deeply implicated in this act now. Scotland is no longer Better Together hemmed in in this Union. A new curtain is being raised to restrict and deprive the population from benefits which will stop abruptly on December  at pm European time.John Edgar, Kilmaurs.*THE SNP likes to say that it represents the whole of Scotland. The Scottish Government has adverts with \"we are Scotland\" as the tagline. Of course, this isnt true. If it were, then about one-third of its MPs would vote for the Brexit trade deal. This would much better reflect the actual Scotland it claims to represent.David Bone, Girvan.SCOTLAND NEEDS A CANADA DEALMICHAEL Gove asserts that the UK market, not the EU, is what is most important to Scotland, and of course trade benefits work both ways. Perhaps Mr Gove is thinking of Canada, which sends nearly % of its exports to one destination, the United States, and is still a highly successful independent country. That autonomous interaction is what Scotland must aim for, not as a powerless entity at the ldquowrong end of the UK.A study for the Economic and Social Research Councilfound that independence, and a loss of trading integration, would result in about a .% reduction in ldquoBritish trade each year, but would also mean that trade between Scotland and the rest of the world would increase. I think we could live with that, preferably as a member of EFTA and trading through the EEA into the EU Single Market. That would be the best of all worlds, to borrow a phrase, and should allow trade with rUK to continue without impediment or tarfs.GR Weir, Ochiltree.WHY BRUSSELS IS BETTERDUNCAN Soomanfinds it dficult to understand why independence-minded Scots ldquowill not be governed by Westminster but ldquodesperately want to be governed by Brussels\". Perhaps I can enlighten him.As Brexit has shown, a sovereign nation decides its own future. What Scotland is ldquodesperate for, is to make its own independent decisions, in Scotlandrsquos best interests. An independent Scotland would decide, at the time, what was in its best interests. If that was rejoining the EU, then the Scottish-elected government would endeavour to make that a reality. If it were not, we would decide, as an independent nation, to pursue another destiny.Itrsquos not that dficult really ndash all we want is to decide for ourselves, rather than have what suits England foisted upon us.John McCallum, Glasgow G.* DUNCAN Sooman asked \"why be governed by Brussels\"  As part of the UK Scotland has to accept Westminsters decisions. In the EU partnership every nation, large or small, has a veto.Colin Campbell, Kilbarchan.SNP WILL ACT IN OUR BEST INTERESTSLAWRENCE Wadeshould be reminded that MPs of all parties, including members of the Tory right-wing ERG Group, voted against the Theresa May proposal. He should also remember that Scotland overwhelmingly voted against any type of Brexit. I have faith that the SNP group of MPs sent to Westminster will always vote in the best interests of the people of Scotland. Its called democracy.Alec Oattes, Ayr.WOULD ENGLAND SELF-HARM IAN Lakinseems to have a very poor grasp of the reality of both the value of the UK economy and of the basics of trade.As so many do, he says that The UK is the ldquofth-largest economy, without recognising thatthat is true, it became true while we were in the EU. There is no guarantee that it will still be true outside the EU, as we have left behind the multitude of existing excellent trade deals that we had around the world, made through the EU for us, and will have to renegotiate each one inidually, before we again receive the benefit of them to our economy. So the UK is likely to be far from being ldquothe fth-largest economy for however long that takes.As to Scotland being ldquoup the creek without a paddlewe lose our massive export market in rUK, he is looking at this question the wrong way round. We export to England, as in any inter-state trading situation, that of which we have an abundance beyond our own needs and they have a shortage. The situation of Ireland, which had about  per cent of its trade with the UK before independence, and now is surviving extremely well with only around %, is a clear example.It is worth noting too that Ireland has reached this point while within the EU, due to the range of markets that this membership has opened up. Why therefore, would Scotland be any dferent  After independence, would England suddenly no longer need what we are able to send, and where  could they source so much at the drop of a hat, with all those EU deals to renegotiate Scotland would not be the partner to force the breaking of this link, and for England to do so, would be a massive act of self-harm. But then, we have just discovered that such self-harm does not seem to deter English nationalists.P Davidson, Falkirk.GIVE US THE INDEPENDENCE COSTINGSBREXIT is indeed an act of economic self-harm . It is puzzling that anyone would vote for such damage to the economy even for theof the control of some mythical levers. But the publication of this estimate by the Scottish Government begs the question:it can produce this estimate of the impact of Brexit, what is stopping the production of a similar prediction of the economic effects that would followwe voted for independence We know from GERS that Scottish independence would result in an immediate pound billion cut to the budget of the Scottish Government and from the SNPs Sustainable Growth Commission that there would be a short and medium decline in economic growth, even greater than Brexit will bring. And we know that Scotland conducts much more business within the UK than with the EU. It is likely that the SNP already has its own estimates of the economic damage that independence would cause. If it does, it is unlikely that it would let them become public, but I would assume there were Government calculations done at the time of the  referendum. If the Scottish Government can turn out estimates on Brexit within days of the deal being signed surely it can, building on what is already known in public and in private, produce authoritative estimates on independence, an idea that has been around for a century and, on the existing evidence, is likely to be even more economically damaging than Brexit Alex Gallagher, Labour councillor, Largs."},{"url":null,"title":"new-year-hopes-measuring-success","story":"Dr Samantha Batt-Rawden, a senior registrar in intensive care medicine, remembers working through the night on Christmas Eve.ldquoThe past few weeks have been the toughest NHS workers have faced yet in the battle against Covid, she said. ldquoThe virus has not discriminated as much as we thought it would.

It was betrayed by the Tories on the way into the EU and it has been betrayed by them on the way out.\"Ms Sturgeon also took repeated aim at Holyrood Tory group leader Ruth Davidson, accusing her of dropping her previous hardlines against Brexit and in favour of single market membership infor a seat in the House of Lords.The FMsaid: \"Not long ago, Ruth Davidson made it known that she would resign rather than support a dferential deal for Northern Ireland.\"It is amazing what the offer of a place in the House of Lords can do to the merest whf of a Ruth Davidson principle.\"Ms Davidson said those voting against the deal were voting by default for no-deal, citing the pro-independence Wings Over Scotland blog in her support.Accusing the SNP of ldquocontortions and ldquohypocrisy, she said the choice, given the UK left the EU  months ago,was between a deal or no-deal and the SNP was ldquostoking up ision.She said: ldquoTo vote against the deal is to vote against zero trade zero tarfs, to vote against deep security intelligence cooperation ndash never before, offered by the EU in such an agreement.ldquoItrsquos voting against participation in science and research and space programmes.ldquoIt is voting against agreements for airlines and hauliers and is voting against securing access for our fishermen to markets for their products, and is voting against recognition for geographical indicators like Scotch whisky, Stornoway black pudding and Arbroath Smokies.Mr Sturgeon replied: ldquoEvery single thing that Ruth Davidson has just listed, we had as members of the European Union.The First Minister concluded: \"The people of Scotland have been ignored throughout the whole fiasco.\"Our views have been disregarded and our Parliament has been treated with contempt.\"For Scotland, we now know beyond doubt that the Westminster system is broken beyond repair.\"We deserve better than a dismal choice between a terrible deal and no deal. We deserve the right to choose the best deal of all: a future as an independent European country.\"It is only through independence that we will ever get to choose the future that we want.\"Independencemdashthat is the deal that many people in Scotland now want. We will have the right to choose it.\"Ms Davidson added later: \"The SNP haveweaponised the  referendum result to fuel their strategy of grievance and ision. The people of Scotland can see right through it.ldquoWhile Sturgeon claims to talk for Scotland what she really means is she talks only for the SNP.Green MSP Patrick Harvie said the passing of the deal into law at Westminster was not the end of the fight against Brexit, but the beginning of the campaign to rejoin the EU - first with Scotland as an independent country, and then with the UK rethinking its decision to Leave.He said: ldquoTo some people, today marks the end of their long campaign of British exceptionalism, xenophobia, anti-immigrant rhetoric and free market deregulation extremism.ldquoTo some people, it might feel like the end of a period of extraordinary chaos, incompetence and hubris in the governance of the UK.Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: ldquoThis is a bad deal. The Prime Minister ran down the clock in the most cynical fashion, giving parliamentarians just three working days to read, analyse, scrutinise and vote on , pages of complex legal text.ldquoThe UK economy will suffer a slow puncture as companies decide to work out of Europe in future rather than out of the UK.ldquoThe UK Government must step up and explain how on earth it will create new jobs and opportunities, how it will engage with our neighbours in Europe, and how it will work and trade with new countries.ldquoWhen our children look back at this time, they will be astonished that the UK Government voluntarily pursued this big-bang change in the middle of a global pandemic and the biggest economic and health crisis that this country has ever faced - it is quite astonishing.Veteran SNP MSP Bruce Crawford was cheered when he refused an intervention from Tory MSP Liam Kerr.ldquoI have only four minutes and I have had enough of Brexiteers for the rest of my le, frankly, Mr Crawford said.After the vote, SNP Constitution Secretary Michael Russell said: ldquoThe Scottish Parliament has backed this governmentrsquos position: saying No to a hard Brexit deal that will do enormous damage to our economy, our society and to the opportunities of this and future generations.ldquoBut, as it has done so throughout the Brexit process the UK Government will ignore the Scottish Parliament. This means in two daysrsquo time Scotland will be forced out of the European Single Market and Customs Union, hitting the economy and jobs at the worst possible time.ldquoThe Scottish Government will now do everything we can to mitigate the damage that will be caused.ldquoAnd we will continue to stick by our principles, our values and our beliefs - and we will stick by the people of Scotland, who have opposed Brexit at every turn.ldquoIt is therefore more important than ever that people in Scotland have the right to choose the best deal of all ndash a future as an independent country and equal partner inside the European Union.Labour Constitution spokesman Anas Sarwar added: \"Today the UK Labour Party put the national interest first and prevented no deal, and the Scottish Labour Party protected the devolution settlement by stating its opposition to the way in which the Tory government has catastrophically mishandled Brexit.ldquoIt is deeply encouraging that the Scottish Parliament has endorsed Labourrsquos call for the Erasmus scheme to be protected and for workersrsquo rights and environmental standards to be upheld.ldquoWe donrsquot defeat ision with more ision. We donrsquot defeat nationalism with more nationalism.ldquoOnly by working together in the national interest can we protect our society from the impact of Brexit and focus on rebuilding after Covid."},{"url":null,"title":"new-year-honours-list-heroes-covid-response-honoured-vital-role-helping-communities","story":"The response from Mr Majid and his staff to help vulnerable customers during the first lockdown went above and beyond with deliveries made and a local fund started.He also worked hard building relationships with projects in the Pakistan village where his family originate and Lanarkshire churches.

Any teacher found not to be following this directive would have been severely reprimanded.An example of this, which I saw for myself as a teacher, was the instruction to teach primary seven how to create complex sentences, using adjectival clauses starting with who, which or that, but without using any form of or reference to the word \"adjective. Such use, we were told, would stunt the pupilsrsquo imaginations and enthusiasm for learning. What did they do  They wrote out the first sentence, stuck a pin in to decide which of the three ldquojoining words to use, and wrote out the second.Consider the timescale of these primary pupils passing through secondary education, university and college and becoming teachers themselves and you have about  years during which they were teaching, without themselves having any real understanding of grammar and syntax to pass on. These teachers have only recently begun to retire, having passed on this unintentional ignorance to another generation.No wonder we see and hear ldquodferent to, instead of ldquofrom, and ldquome and him are going hellip .P Davidson, Falkirk.DONT LET YOUR GUARD DOWNTHE approval of the \"game changer\" Oxford vaccine for public use is a welcome development in the fight against the coronavirus and shows more light at the end of the tunnel although its still some way off. Now the biggest danger is complacency as the public waits for the vaccine to be rolled out. Along with the arrogance and selfishness of those who have ignored the restrictions all along, dropping our guard and flouting the rules will lead to more unnecessary pressure on the NHS as the virus, particularly the iant type, is still rampant within our communities.Patience will bring earlier rewards. The spike in Shetland is an example of what can happenrestrictions are lessened . One must question whether Nicola Sturgeon was right in not putting the islands in Tier  along with the rest of the country.Bob MacDougall, Kippen.END THE SURCHARGE ON THE NORTHTHE soaring rate of fuel poverty in Scotland is causing great hardship. Citizens Advice Scotland is doing a good job to highlight this and suggesting solutions .More radically,ldquolevelling up really means anything it is long past time that the UK Government and Ofgem removed the electricity distribution surcharge levied on all consumers in  per cent of Scotland.

Visitors to the UK from the EEA or Switzerland will still be able to come and go without a visa for short trips and holidays. And Irish citizens will be exempt as part of the Common Travel Area. But the big change is that EEA and Swiss nationals will no longer be able to come to the UK freely to work or study.The key route is the Skilled Worker one. This allows those with a job offer that meets Home Office skill and salary thresholdsto come to work in the UK, as long as the prospective migrant speaks English at a required level and the prospective employer holds a sponsorship licence.One dficulty with the new system lies with the additional requirements entailed in acquiring and maintaining a sponsorship licence.The UK Government initially recognised the challenge in extending the employer sponsorship system to include all labour migration to the UK.Back in , proposals included review and reform of sponsorship to make it less daunting for employers to navigate, not least because failure to navigate the system correctly raises the prospect of fines and other penalties.This disadvantages Scotland more than other UK nations as Scotland has the highest proportion of Small to Medium Enterprises .The dferential impact of the proposed post-Brexit immigration system has been a subject of complaint from the Scottish Government.Having a single salary threshold apply across the whole of the UK means it will be areas with higher salaries that will find it easiest to continue to recruit migrant labour.In broad terms that means London and the South East of England will find the wage criteria easiest to meet, it is often more rural, remote locations that will struggle most. Requests for the new system to accommodate regional dferences have not been welcomed by the Home Office for now.However, the new system does carry potential for more regional iation through the use of shortage occupation lists. Jobs recognised as being in shortage by the Migration Advisory Committeecan be included on shortage occupation lists to allow for migrant workers to be recruited at lower salaries .Within this system, devolved nation-specic shortage occupation lists allow for recognition of regional dferences, but much depends on whether active use is made of this facility.Tke UK Government has held off recognising the MACrsquos shortage occupation list recommendations in the face of labour market uncertainty.Labour demand is currently dficult to predict, but indications are that neither government nor businesses are well-prepared to use the new system. Critics of the UK Government approach have suggested the impetus behind the new system is political, rather than economic.Repeated inquiries into the impacts of migration on the UK economy and labour market have found generally positive,often marginal, effects.Migrant labour complements rather than supplements the domestic workforce, and adds to innovation and productivity. The irony is that this restrictive turn gets under way as net EEA migration has been steadily declining for years, Attitudes to immigration have also been softening.In Scotland, where demographic challenges are more pronounced and rural sustainability is an issue, this should be the moment to be working on proactive approaches to migration.Indeed, the UKrsquos new immigration system that focuses on ldquothe brightest and the best as determined by higher salaries seems rather outdated after a year in which we have all discovered the crucial role of ldquokey workers, many of whom are on lower pay.

Anything that can help reduce the risk of transmission while allowing for the easing of restrictions deserves proper consideration.”Orkney and Shetland MP Alistair Carmichael added: “Island communities across Scotland could benefit from greater certainty and protection from outbreakswe put in place testing at ferry terminals and airports.#I hope that the Government will take these proposals seriously as it cannot be long before we see the new iant of COVID spreading quickly across the country.#The isles often have geographic challenges relative to the rest of the UK – this is an opportunity to make use of our geographic advantages.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Almost a decade, and many awards, later Meena says, “In the beginning, we used to recommend people use the salt in salads but then we started adding it to all our food. It’s great as it doesn’t dominate the taste but just melts into and improves the flavour of all types of dishes, and you only need to use a small amount.” Indeed, feedback from a repeat customer confirms this: “I love cooking with your salt and think about its purity and provenance every time.” Meena added, “These kind of comments bring joy to our hearts!”Fellow director, Chris Watts adds, “We have always looked at the business in a holistic way, with eco-credentials at the heart of the business, from production to the packaging design to the end product. We are very proud to be part of the Scottish Food and Drink Industry, which we know will continue to thrive.”Asked how Isle of Skye Sea Salt had been affected by the Covid- pandemic, Meena replied, “Like most businesses, we’ve had a challenging year. Initially, we had to adjust and focus on our producer partners and increasing online custom until our catering and retail customers were also able to re-open in the latter half of the season. The eco-credentials, provenance, texture and taste have all made a dference to repeat orders. Every order matters to us. We are keen to promote the Isle of Skye brand. We would like to say a really big thank you to all our supporters chefs, collaborators, online and local buyers. Our hearts go out to businesses that have put in as much effort as us but perhaps haven’t survived. Hearing about the vaccine, we feel there is light at the end of the tunnel.

We first met in Thailand and then lived together in Australia for three years, before ing to Janice’s hometown in Ireland for a year. The year we spent in Ireland gave us time to decide where we were going to put down some permanent roots. We knew, after a number of visits to see family, that Skye was where we ultimately wanted to be.“However, with Janice being an operating room nurse, she struggled to find a full time job on Skye. We quickly realised that we would need to create jobs that would keep us here and ideally would have us working together.”Ewen’s family have fished the local waters for almost five decades. Every week the couple watched the majority of this beautul, local produce being exported, with very little staying in Scotland.Seaflower Skye visits Skye’s neighbouring islands of Raasay and Rona – there are trips of dferent durations and the vessel is also available to hire on a private basis.Seabirds, sea eagles, seals, porpoise, dolphin, basking sharks, orca and minke whale have all been spotted from the deck. Upon reaching the destination, a seafood feast is served.“Often, during our trips, we pass our family fishing boats,” says Ewen. “We love to allow our guests to see how the creels are hauled and where their lunch has been caught.”“This was a stressful, confusing time but we had good policies and guidelines to keep us on the right track,” Ewen added.“Our first adaptation was purchasing an antiviral fogging machine to ensure that the inside areas of the boat were as clean and safe as possible for each of our guests. It was also essential to increase the level of daily cleaning around the boat.“Maximum capacity was reduced from  guests to , and more seating and tables were provided to allow guests to spread out. Passenger access to the indoor areas was limited, which made trips more susceptible to disruption in poor weather conditions.“However, the main dference was that each group onboard had to have a private dining experience. Previously everyone would sit and get to know each other during lunch, sharing one big table.Ewen said: “I think it’s safe to say that the workload for every business has increased this year, but we do fully understand it is something that must be done in order to remain operational. We are just extremely grateful that people were able to get out on our trips and were allowed to enjoy each other’s company outdoors.”.”“We could not and would not be operational without local support. Thank you to everyone who has come out with us and supported us during this most dficult year. Wishing everyone a Merry Christmas and a healthy, happy New Year!”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EDINBANE-POTTERY-2.jpg","title":"optimism in the air at edinbane","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineFor  days, ending last week, the locally-owned business was offering  per cent of everything in stock. And, says founder Stuart Whatley, the sale period was extremely successful, thanks almost entirely to the custom of local people. Much of the firm’s range of stoneware wood-fired pottery – everything from goblets to plates to lamp bases – is surely destined for under the Christmas trees of Skye.For almost  years Edinbane Pottery has been a fixture in the commercial and cultural le of the island.“It’s hugely important for all of us to shop localpossible,” added Stuart. “The situation has improved dramatically since I came back to Skye in . It was almost impossible to get anything locally back then, even building materials. Now, apart from a few items, it#s possible to shop local for most of the things you need in le.”That context makes Stuart “pretty optimistic” about next year, whether that be in le in general or from a business point of view.“When we managed to restart in July after lockdown ended, for the rest of the summer, until the lockdowns in England, we were much busier than the same period last year,” he added. “Probably the main reason is that people couldn’t go abroad. So they weren#t spending money on holidays. But people need to buy things, and a lot of them seemed to want to buy pottery.”They also like coming in to see Stuart, we Julie, assistant Andreas Mueller and apprentice Josie Allan hard at work.

Online retail giant Amazon has told customers here to expect longer delivery times or that some items may not be deliverable at all to NI addresses.Some NI customers who pay for Amazon Prime with the aim of getting goods delivered faster have already been charged £ for a year#s subscription. However, it#s understood the benefits of Prime will continue. Amazon said it is making changes to processes in order to be compliant with the new requirements for shipments to Northern Ireland.Discount designer store TK Maxx, homewares chain Dunelm and department store chains John Lewis and Debenhams have said they will not be delivering here as the system for ensuring parcel deliveries between Great Britain and NI from tomorrow onwards remains unclear.However, a Dunelm spokesman said: Our teams are aiming to have home delivery in Northern Ireland available by January  and are doing everything they can to potentially bring this forward.John Lewis# website said: Deliveries and collections are temporarily unavailable in NI as we make adjustments in line with new legislation. We hope to be back soon.However, other big names such as ASOS, Next and Marks  Spencer have said they are still delivering to NI - though MS indicated that deliveries may take longer than usual.The NI Consumer Council said it#s working closely with the UK Government to ensure guidance can be published on how parcels will be processed from New Year#s Day.Head of postal services Kellin McCloskey said the council remains concerned that official guidance has not yet been published on how parcels between GB and NI are to be processed. This delay is causing market uncertainty, as some retailers are choosing to suspend services to NI until more information is available. If consumers have noticed a retailer suspending deliveries to NI, please contact The Consumer Council who is gathering evidence on this issue.We are working closely with the UK Government, to ensure this guidance is published as soon as possible and that parcel operators can still keep parcels moving between GB and NI come January .Published guidance on processing parcels between GB and NI is needed so Northern Ireland consumers know how this will impact the delivery of their recent orders as well as any annual delivery subscriptions they have signed up to from retailers and marketplaces.HMRC, which is writing the guidance, said: The UK Government will take forward a pragmatic approach that draws upon available flexibilities to implement the protocol without causing undue disruption to lives and livelihoods. We are engaging with operators to finalise these arrangements.These arrangements will mean that goods continue to reach consumers, while ensuring that goods at risk of moving into the EU market pay the duties that are owed.Meanwhile, Secretary of State Brandon Lewis has said the UK-EU free trade deal - which was voted through in the House of Commons yesterday - will give Northern Ireland a unique opportunity.This is a deal that works for NI in a sense it gives NI a unique global opportunity, because NI businesses will have a position from which to trade that no-one in the world has got.That could be very good for business investment and job growth.Mr Lewis also moved to reassure NI businesses that the flow of trade across the Irish Sea will continue in January as it has in December.Once we get into the next month or so and things settle down into the new year, I#m an optimist but I think people will see that the ability for business to continue to flow across the UK will be pretty static in a positive way but NI will be at the advantage of also being able to trade with the EU as well. Thiscreates an opportunity for NI and I#m very much focused on seeing people in NI being able to benefit from improved jobs, opportunities and economic growth, something that NI needed before Covid struck as obviously the economy in NI was behind the rest of the UK pre-Covid.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk aaa .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk aaa .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk aaa .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk aaa .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk aaa .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"UKWhat post-Brexit issues do UK businesses face The last-minute UK-EU trade agreement saw British businesses breathe a sigh of relief that a no-deal Brexit scenario had been averted.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk dcbd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_baaa--f-ee-eedd_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk dcbd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_baaa--f-ee-eedd_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk dcbd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_baaa--f-ee-eedd_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk dcbd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_baaa--f-ee-eedd_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk dcbd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_baaa--f-ee-eedd_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"UKBrexit: What will change for the average Briton from January  As  draws to a close the Brexit transition period will end, ushering in a new era in the UK’s relationship with the European Union.Most ReadThe full list of Northern Ireland recipients for  New Year HonoursUnforgettable photographs from #s big moments in Northern IrelandCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Six further deaths and record , cases reportedDUP told to face up to its role in creating border in Irish SeaNorthern Ireland school reopening dates released...

The death toll now sits at , and there has been , infections since the pandemic began.There are  Covid patients in hospital,  of whom are in intensive care while  are being ventilated. Hospital occupancy is at % with  care home outbreaks. Earlier this week Health Minister Robin Swann warned that New Year#s Eve house parties would not only be against the law, but could be super-spreader events and potentially cost lives.That message was echoed on Wednesday night by Dr McBride. What I would say to everyone who is at home and has plans for New Year#s Eve, rethink those plans, he told the BBC. Celebrate this New Year#s Eve within and with your household and with no other contacts outside your household.

Dr Tom Black, chair of British Medical Associationsaid the virus is now bleeding across the generations. On Tuesday it emerged that those aged - make up more than % of virus cases here.The hospitals wards will cope as long as the numbers are in the younger age group but as it bleeds across into the elderly that#s when they will come under pressure, Dr Black said. He added that younger people are being complacent about the danger of infection.If old people aren#t getting infected because they#re being careful but then they#re being infected by their younger relatives who are transmitting large numbers of the infection, I think the fault here lies with younger people not being careful enough. Elsewhere the NI Ambulance Service has said its emergency control room is experiencing absences due to Covid- and contingency planning to mitigate the potential risk to service disruption is ongoing. It#s also urging people to only call for an ambulance in an emergency. We would strongly advise anyone who calls  to stay on the line - to disconnect and re-dial will result in a response to your call being further delayed, it said.Belfast Related ContentCoronavirus PremiumCovid- vaccine plans in Northern Ireland overhauled to give first dose to more peopleThe Covid- vaccination programme is to be overhauled with a focus on ensuring as many people as possible receive a first dose in the coming weeks.

The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationhas recommended that vaccinating more people with the first dose should be prioritised above offering others their second dose. “This will provide the greatest public health benefits in the short-term and save more lives,” the JCVI said on Wednesday. Health Minister Robin Swann subsequently submitted an urgent written statement to the Assembly in which he said: “I fully agree and endorse this advice and from early January the main focus of the programme in Northern Ireland will be on ensuring as many people as possible receive their first dose of a Covid- vaccine.”The advice relates to both the Pfizer-BioNTech jab, which has already been administered to , people here, and the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine, which received approval from regulators in the UK on Wednesday. Read MoreIrish professor Adrian Hill hails approval of new weapon in Covid- fightIreland to re-enter Level  restrictions for at least a month – TaoiseachCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Six further deaths and record , cases reportedWithin hours of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency giving the green light to the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine, local GP surgeries began ringing patients over the age of  to ensure vaccination clinics can begin on Monday. The vaccine will be offered to the oldest patients and front line healthcare workers first.It will then be rolled out to the over-s, over-s and those who are clinically extremely vulnerable. Dr Laurence Dorman, chair of the Royal College of GPs in Northern Ireland, said he hopes there will be a signicant drop in cases by April. “We are delighted and I am hoping that I will be getting the vaccine myself on Monday,” he said. “Given the timescale in which we are working, GP surgeries are going to be ringing patients rather than sending out letters. “For that reason we would ask that patients don’t contact us, we will be in touch to let them know when to come along for their vaccination. “We will be encouraging people, even after they have had their second dose, to continue to adhere to public health guidance relating to hands, face, space. “Restrictions can be lted according to infection rates as opposed to the number of people who have been vaccinated, although there should be a correlation between the two. “I would hope there will be a signicant dference by Eastertime.“All of this does mean that there will be some disruption to normal services, so the likes of blood pressure checks might be affected, but we would ask everyone for understanding and patience.”The Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine has been earmarked for use by GP surgeries due to the fact that it can be stored in a normal fridge. For this reason it is much easier to distribute and store than the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which must be kept at a temperature of minus  degrees. GP practices have put in place plans to vaccinate patients in the coming months, with clinics being held in surgeries, recreation facilities and town halls. Officials have warned that the speed at which the vaccination programme — the largest ever undertaken by the NHS — can be completed depends on availability of the vaccines. However, with , new cases recorded here over the past seven days, pressure is mounting to ensure as many people as possible get the vaccine in the coming weeks. Alliance Party MLA Paula Bradshaw said: “The approval of the Oxford vaccine and further ongoing indications of the signicant benefit provided by a single dose mean that it is right for Northern Ireland to sht strategy to ensuring as many people get an initial dose as quickly as possible.“By maximising the number of people, particularly with clinical vulnerability due to age group or underlying condition, who receive this initial protection, we will be able to move forward faster towards the end goal.”Belfast Related ContentCoronavirusIrish professor Adrian Hill hails approval of new weapon in Covid- fightThe Dublin-born professor who has been leading the development team behind the AstraZeneca Covid- vaccine at Oxford University has hailed a “landmark moment” after it was officially approved for use in the UK.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dacf-cf-a-acbd-fcb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dacf-cf-a-acbd-fcb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dacf-cf-a-acbd-fcb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dacf-cf-a-acbd-fcb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dacf-cf-a-acbd-fcb_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Republic of IrelandIreland to re-enter Level  restrictions for at least a month – TaoiseachIreland will face Level  coronavirus restrictions for at least a month, the Taoiseach has announced.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk adb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fbd-c-ac-ab-eab_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk adb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fbd-c-ac-ab-eab_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk adb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fbd-c-ac-ab-eab_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk adb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fbd-c-ac-ab-eab_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk adb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fbd-c-ac-ab-eab_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"CoronavirusCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Six further deaths and record , cases reportedThere have been six more deaths related to Covid- in Northern Ireland, according to the Department of Health.

However, the DUP, the only main party here that backed Brexit, said it will oppose the deal because the orce settlement imposes customs checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Read MoreMark Bain:OpinionDUP overplayed its hand, and no amount of fudge can cover its hubrisCritics have urged the DUP to accept the outcome as a result of its actions over Brexit. Ulster Unionist peer Lord Empey argued that the Northern Ireland Protocol came about after the DUP initially indicated acceptance of it.The protocol, part of the Withdrawal Agreement, was designed to avoid the need for border checks on the island of Ireland when the UK leaves the EU. It achieved that by creating new customs and regulatory processes on trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain - the so-called Irish Sea border and DUP leader Arlene Foster#s blood red line that she vowed not to cross.Lord Empey said Boris Johnson#s amendments to the protocol were unveiled in October , and included border inspection points, and an ongoing role for the European Court in Northern Ireland#s affairs.Crucially, no such rules or European Court involvement would apply to Great Britain, he said.I pointed out that immediately this document was released, Arlene Foster and her DUP colleagues endorsed these proposals, describing them as #a serious and sensible way forward#. Lord Dodds didn#t like what I was saying and accused me of telling lies. I offered on a radio programme to withdraw my claims and apologisemy statement had been factually incorrect. Needless to say, I have received no evidence that I was factually incorrect. So, at the risk of annoying Nigel and his colleagues once more, I say again that on  October , the DUP endorsed a regulatory border in the Irish Sea, with all the add-ons of Border Inspection posts etc.As a result of this decision, Boris Johnson was able to go to Brussels and Dublin and claim that he had unionist consent for his plan.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood told Radio Ulster he believed Brexit marked the beginning of the end for the UK.I think unionists need to think very carefully about where the DUP have led them.

She has come up with her top tips for those who plan to wed in the first half of next year.Unfortunately, Covid isn#t going to go away overnight. But the first piece of advice is to be realistic in expectations. Let go of plans you had and focus on the things that really matter. You can#t postpone forever, she said.Speak to people who have been through it. You#ll find they enjoyed their day even more than they expected. The weddings I#ve been to were so emotional.It#s important not to compare with others. If someone  decides to postpone, don#t just follow their lead.And don#t look too far ahead. Don#t think you have to start inviting people eight weeks before. Speak to venues, caterers. Find out when they really need to know final details. And always remember that the most important people are the couple getting married. All the previous wedding rules have been thrown out of the window, but now there#s a real chance to make the day a special one.Marriage is the beginning of a le together, and couples need to do that on their own terms. It might be dferent to what would have happened a year ago, but that doesn#t make it any less special.Lauren#s blog is available at litphotographyniBelfast Most ReadThe full list of Northern Ireland recipients for  New Year HonoursUnforgettable photographs from #s big moments in Northern IrelandCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Six further deaths and record , cases reportedDUP told to face up to its role in creating border in Irish SeaNorthern Ireland school reopening dates released...

PADecember   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailSinn Fein’s invitation to an Anglo-Irish Christmas party during the peace process created a headache at Maryfield.Civil servants worried it could dissuade some from attending and pose a security risk.An October  note on the affair was published by the Public Record Office for Northern Ireland as part of the annual release of Government archives.The Christmas spirit will not come entirely free this yearPN BellSenior NIO official PN Bell wrote: “Now that Sinn Fein are, following the restoration of their ceasefire and full membership of the talks, a constitutional party, I can see no justication for not extending an invitation which, almost certainly, they will accept.”The Maryfield Secretariat near Belfast was established as part of the Anglo-Irish Agreement which instituted closer north south cooperation.The civil servant added: “Nevertheless, such an invitation would not be without its downside: once news of a Sinn Fein presence became common place, it would intensy unionist dislike of the Secretariat it could generate some security risk it might even deter other guests – although I greatly hope not, from wishing to attend, as well as creating some management problems within the Secretariat itself.“The Christmas spirit will not come entirely free this year.”Up to that point, unionists had never attended the Maryfield Christmas party.The official added: “To sum up, the case for extending a joint invitation to Sinn Fein is irresistible.“But, given the likely reaction in some quarters, I wish to be certain that ministers know all the implications, and are content that I should proceed with inviting a few leading Sinn Fein players along with other leading Northern Irish politicians.”The Northern Ireland Forum for Political Dialogue had also reflected on those who worked at Maryfield, the historic files said.The Government archives quoted from a debate: “Even the prosperous burghers of Holywood were so outraged at the Anglo-Irish Agreement in  that the Maryfield bunker had to be virtually the most fortied place in Northern Ireland, and that remains the case today.”It said civil servants working there and from Northern Ireland did not dare tell friends and neighbours for fear of “shame and opprobrium”.“If he is from the Irish Republic he is furtively ferried

Ireland.”Occasionally – perhaps at a wine and cheese party on St Patrick’s Day, or at Christmas – an “ill-advised judge or a police officer seeking to be promoted to Chief Constable” may come in and make small talk over the canapes, the file said.“But these people never – and never will- have any direct contact with the ordinary, decent people of Northern Ireland.”NIO official JR Fisher noted in

Mr Blair and Taoiseach Bertie Ahern were among those lauded for their roles in bringing about the peace accord in  after years of The Troubles in Northern Ireland. Documents on Anglo-Irish relations from Mr Blair#s first few weeks in office, following New Labour#s surge to victory in May , show a meeting between the two men signalled an intent to bring peace. A briefing note from Robin Cook, then Foreign Secretary, to Mr Blair said: Your meeting with the Taoiseach on July  was inevitably dominated by discussion of Northern Ireland. But there was agreement in principle to developing the wider relationship. Mr Cook acknowledged that a nationalist government would likely be less instinctively committed to improving the relationship between Ireland and the UK. But he said having Mr Ahern as the Fianna Fail party#s leader gave genuine cause for optimism. Ahern is a pragmatist, Mr Cook wrote. He has spoken privately to our Ambassador and in public of the possibility of developing a new era in UK Irish relations. Better so-called #East West# relations have intrinsic value and will improve the climate for our exchanges with the Irish over Northern Ireland. The Good Friday Agreement set the way for peaceful powersharing in Northern Ireland.It was backed by % of voters in a referendum in Northern Ireland while % voted in favour of it in the Republic.It became one of the defining achievements of the Blair years. Before the signing of the deal, he referred to the #Hand of History# being on his shoulder.The new Stormont Assembly met for the first time in July  and David Trimble and Seamus Mallon were elected as First and deputy First Ministers.In , on the th anniversary of the deal, Mr Blair and Mr Ahern spoke at a conference in Belfast.Mr Blair said the  deal took real courage by Northern Ireland parties. He added that for all its faults, the Good Friday Agreement was worth doing and worth keeping.Mr Ahern said: The art of politics is compromise, you can#t make progress without compromise.Belfast Most ReadUnforgettable photographs from #s big moments in Northern IrelandThe full list of Northern Ireland recipients for  New Year HonoursCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Six further deaths and record , cases reportedDUP told to face up to its role in creating border in Irish SeaBelfast rugby team#s founder accused of sexual assaultLatest Northern IrelandCoronavirus Northern Ireland latest updates on December North Yorkshire sees lowest temperature as cold snap continuesNYE : Five ways to celebrate the end of a year like no otherThe Northern Ireland Protocol – the key questions answeredReturn to school in Northern Ireland delayed by a week as Covid infections soarLatest from Belfast Mikel Arteta says trimming Arsenal squad is January transfer window priorityRangers# milestone man McGregor claims winning at St Mirren meant more to him than hitting  markSteven BeacomOpinionSporting drama has been welcome distraction...

However, a civil servant advised that the issue of the Aboriginal head was not of major political signicance.Mr Adams wrote personally to Mr Haughey over the issue on February , .I believe that the refusal to do so , over a five-year period, demonstrates a total insensitivity to the spiritual values of the aboriginal people of Australia, Mr Adams wrote.This is being interpreted as racist by those people.The Irish Government was briefed that the RCSI decided tothe remains to Australia.In a letter dated March  to the Taoiseach, the Aboriginal Centre invited him to attend a handing over ceremony for the remains at the Australian Embassy on March , a memo outlined.The embassy had no knowledge of any such ceremony which, in the light of the removal of the remains from Ireland, does not now arise.Following the decision of the RCSI to give back the remains, the embassy are not anxious to add to the extensive publicity which has already been given to this whole issue and thereby embarrass the college even further.

Any meat product must contain only meat from animals born and raised in the UK or the EU.”– No mutual recognition of professional qualicationsIn a blow to the UK’s services sector, the trade deal lacks a mutual recognition of professional qualications.Ms Thimont Jack said: “It will be much more dficult for many professionals to deliver services in the EU, with rules dfering member state by member state.”An IfG analysis said there were “enormous numbers” of exceptions covering market access provisions in the trade deal.For example, it said UK nationals will not be able to sell actuarial services in Italy or construction services in Cyprus, or to be surveyors in Bulgaria or tobacconists in France.– New rules on business travelThe trade deal permits short-term British business visitors to the EU to stay for  days in any six-month period.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming b .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming b .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming b .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming b .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming b .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming b .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming b .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming b .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming b .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming b .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"The trade deal includes limitations on activities allowed under permit-free short-term business travel PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueThe trade deal includes limitations on activities allowed under permit-free short-term business travel But the rules mean that activities allowed without the need for a work permit are limited to such things as meetings, consultations, research, training and trade fairs – with iations between member states also applying.Selling goods or supplying services to the public are not covered by the short-term business visit provisions.UK Government guidance says visas or permits may be needed for business travel and advises travellers to check each country’s rules.– Potential for disagreement over the rulesLondon and Brussels agreed a floor for standards for areas like the environment and labour rights, with this level playing field being reviewed in four years.But Irish deputy premier Leo Varadkar warned thatthe UK deviates too far from EU standards its access to the European market could be threatened, saying it was “not unconditional”.A European Commission summary of the deal said either side has “the right to take unilateral measures to safeguard their economies against unfair competition from the other party”.The document said a “dispute settlement mechanism” covers most areas of the trade deal, including the level playing field.Accompanying “enforcement and safeguard mechanisms” include the possibility of tarfs or quotas being reintroduced for an affected sector.– The deal contains gapsTwo key issues left unresolved by the trade deal are “data adequacy” and “equivalence for financial services”.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_d-b-e-faf-eae_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"The future of financial services’ access to EU markets was left unresolved by the trade deal PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueThe future of financial services’ access to EU markets was left unresolved by the trade deal The EU is yet to decidethe UK’s personal data protection regime is adequate to allow the flow of information between the two sides.

Until now. Liam Tunney talks to an ex-member of the infamous Gorilla Gang, who were responsible for many a headache at Slaughtneil discoThe Slaughtneil GAC committee used to meet every Monday evening. The meeting was supposed to be a general meeting about club business, but usually got bogged down with the disco. Discussions often revolved around two groups of boisterous young men in particular – the Gorilla Gang from Draperstown and the Banana Gang of Bellaghy. The latter were set up in reaction to the former, whose name was notorious around south Derry throughout the s. “The name was actually originally meant to be ‘Guerrilla Gang’,” an ex-member told the County Derry Post. “About  or , things were getting hot and heavy and the likes of Ballinascreen was getting saturated by the British Army. googletag.cmd.push “There would have been fighting with the UDR or the Brits, andthey came into Draperstown, the Gorilla Gang would have gathered up a posse and put them out. “There were two or three gangs in Draperstown at that time. One of them was the Wombles and the other one was the Sixtown Clowns. “They all used to fight amongst each other at small discos that used to be on round Draperstown before Slaughtneil started. “The police knew about the Gorilla Gang. I had a few older brothers that went to Spain, and on their way home they were pulled in at London airport and quizzed about the gang!” googletag.cmd.push As the disco’s popularity began to grow, the three gangs soon set their grievances aside as the possibility of taking their local scuffles to a wider field presented itself. “The disco took in the whole of south Derry, so there was more boys to fight with outside your own town,” he recalled. “It was just like that at those times around dance halls. In the early s, before Slaughtneil, the older Gorilla Gang would all have been over in Dungiven fighting at the Castle. “There were a wile lot of boys in the Gorilla Gang that were mad for fighting, and then everyone started making up their own gangs to fight us.     “I think that’s where the Banana Gang came out of, that they were going to get the Gorilla Gang at Slaughtneil. “I think the Banana Gang gave the Wombles and the Sixtown Clowns a bad beating one night and then they didn’t want to go anymore. “Well, they were mad to go, but they couldn’t because they were scared of the Banana Gang. They came to the Gorilla Gang and askedthey could join up.” The merger prompted a rivalry that lasted throughout the late s and caused the Slaughtneil bouncers no end of trouble. Our ex-member feels that the gangs’ propensity for bravado and fisticuffs helped boost the crowds that flocked to the hall on a Friday night. “Four carloads of us would leave the town to go down to Slaughtneil. We didn’t chance taking the bus, becauseyou were fighting, the bus driver wouldn’t let you on,” he said. “I remember going down to Slaughtneil and being told these Banana Gang boys were gonna be there, and two nights in a row, we went down, and they weren’t there. “The third night we went down, we thought they weren’t turning up, so maybe only five or ten of us went and we got some beating from the Banana Gang that night – they all turned up! “God help them bouncers. I don’t think Slaughtneil would have been Slaughtneil without it. Everybody was going, girls and all, to see what was going to happen next week. “If there was a small scuffle in the car park, threats were made about who was going to be there next week that wasn’t there tonight.  The characters’ nicknames roll off the ex-member’s tongue. Bungle. Flan. Rocky. Numan. Turk. Goggles. Nelly. Bruce. Shiny, who ‘couldn’t beat eggs’ but drove the getaway car. The King, who would run out onto the pitch and shout, ‘I’m the King of the Gorillas and I eat bananas for breakfast’ before a dust-up. Johnny the Donkey, who played the role of negotiator when the gangs were thrown out of the car park and arranged to meet halfway between Draperstown and Bellaghy to finish it off. An eclectic mix, but one name resonated more than others. “Flathead was the feared name. He was a real tight boy, he would have fought anybody man to man,” he said. “We would have said, ‘you boys will be in trouble next week, we’re taking big Flathead with us’, and everybody would have been at Slaughtneil the next week for the big punch up outside! “Even the bouncers were a wee bit scared of big Flathead because he was big for his age. There were some characters about.” While the rivalry between the two gangs was intense, it never created any lasting grudges and the member recalled how, by chance, he encountered one of his nemeses years later. “I hadn’t seen this boy for years, until I was going along one day in the car through Rocktown and heading for Bellaghy,” he said. “I saw a man walking along the road in the pouring rain and I stopped to seehe wanted a lt. “He hopped in anyway and was talking away to me and when he was getting out of the car, whatever way he turned sideways I recognised him. He caught on then to who I was too. “We were good friends at school, but then he was in the Banana Gang and I didn’t really want to let him know that I wanted to kill him, and he didn’t want to let me know either!” Time and people move on. The exploits of the Gorilla Gang may seem shocking when viewed through a st century lens, but our ex-member says it was a dferent era. “When I look back, I never knew of a man being hurt badly. When I hear the gang mentioned, it makes me laugh,” he said. “There were no mobile phones, no fancy cars. Anybody that had a car, it had cost them maybe pound. That whole thing is just lost. “I know it wasn’t good going to all them dance halls and fighting, but at the same time, no one was doing drugs or anything, it was just a punch-up. “Just a locka lads with a few beers in them, that fell out with another group of lads and there were a load of myths and legends that never even happened. “There were a few nights when I was younger that I maybe woke up in the morning with a black eye and a cut forehead and I said to myself, ‘oh my God, what am I at ’, but apart from that, I’ve no regrets. “We were all young cubs. Apart from the odd bleeding mouth and a bust lip, there wasn’t much harm done.” “God help them bouncers, those men got some torturing! Them boys did some organising to keep that all going. “For a club on top of a mountain, they did well to actually get people to get up there. There’s not even a pub.” It’s unlikely south Derry will ever see the likes of the Gorilla Gang again, but their mention invokes howls of recognition and intrigue. With a chuckle no doubt brought on by the memory of discos past, the ex-member had one idea that might have some under lockdown pining for its end. “I couldn’t say that I’ve any enemies out of it, put it like that. If we could get a Banana Gang-Gorilla Gang reunion night gathered up, I’d say we could have a good laugh!” See also: If you build it, they will come: Slaughtneils field of dreamers Spinning the soundtrack to a timeless era South Derrys ballroom of romance The goose that laid the golden egg Bringing Muhammad to the south Derry mountains The night a TV star came to Slaughtneil  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Under the mentorship of Richard McBride and Victoria Townsend, six Year  pupils from Foyle College recently participated in the Livery Academy Awards. Richard is a former pupil and current governor of the Derry school, whose back- ground is in law, whilst Victoria is the founder of the London Academy of Bespoke. Their joint expertise and business acumen provided the pupils with the perfect marriage of guidance and knowledge. Traditionally hosted in Merchant Taylors’ Hall, London, this year the pupils joined the competition virtually, proposing the launch of their Covid- inspired product, Care Cog. googletag.cmd.push During months of preparatory work alongside Richard and Victoria, the team developed a business plan and created a product prototype, before presenting their Care Cog to Merchant Taylors‘ judging , Lady Harding, Nick Hewer and Jana Mackintosh. The team’s presentation was excellent and they coped well with the judges’ questions. However, London- based all-girls St Saviour’s and St Olave’s School were selected as winners. The Foyle pupils were awarded pound, to gt to their chosen river rescue charity, Foyle Search and Rescue. The pupils selected the local charity because, they said, it is a grassroots charity whose work makes valuable contributions within their local community. googletag.cmd.push Barry Duffy, from Foyle College, praised all those involved. “The pupils really benefited from their participation in the Livery Academy Awards and are proud that their journey will also help to support others through the Merchant Taylors’ donation.”      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Writing in his new book, The Invisible Game, the two-time All-Ireland winning midfielder dedicated the battleground chapter to players he came up against in the midfield sectors on pitches across Ireland. Walsh highlighted nearly  players, which included Enda Muldoon and Anthony Tohill, before summing up to give his top three. Brian McGilligan, supported by Ger Lynch, in action against Andrew Jarmon of Australia during the  International Rules series in Croke Park  McGilligan, McGrane and McCreery were among those I admired most, and McGilligan was the best in my opinion. He had excellent footwork and was such a physical specimen. He churned it out consistently, doing the simple things right. He was courageous and consistent but most of all he was caring, Walsh said. googletag.cmd.push He brought it every day so that his teammates could get the limelight. Once Derry won, he didnt care who was getting the love from the terraces or the media, but he was the heartbeat of the team.

Students save a considerable amount of time by using the laneway to get to and from school.The former Down Council attempted to secure funds to upgrade the laneway and carry out a much-needed resurfacing and lighting scheme but liaising with representatives from a number of statutory agencies including the Housing Executive and Roads Service, the ownership issue could not be firmly established.Describing the laneway as a ldquovital link for residents who live at the Langley Road area in particular, Cllr Walker hopes that, with the publicrsquos help, he can find out who owns the land.ldquoThere are several street lights along part of the laneway but the Department for Infrastructure insists that it is not responsible for the land, he said.Cllr Walker says it is necessary to find out who owns the laneway as work is starting to upgrade Ballynahinchrsquos masterplan which includes a number of new walking trails in and around the town.ldquoWhy not include Beedhamrsquos Lane in the planned trails andwe could find out who this piece of ground it could pave the way for its upgrade, he continued.ldquoPeople could be forgiven for thinking that it leads to a farm. Given that we are in the midst of winter, the laneway is an awful state and children who are walking to school are literally getting covered in mud.Cllr Walker has suggested that it would not cost a signicant sum of money to upgrade the laneway which he suggests has the potential to become a key component of the townrsquos planned new walking trails.ldquoIf anyone can help me identy who is responsible for this piece of land could they contact either myself, the Langley Road Residentsrsquo Association or Newry, Mourne and Down Council, he said.Cllr Walker added: ldquoThe upgrade of this particular laneway has been raised on numerous occasions in the past, but nothing has ever been done.ldquoGiven the high volume of pedestrian traffic which uses it, itrsquos important work gets underway to upgrade it.ldquoIn seeking to find out who owns the laneway I hope that it can be determined of this particular piece of ground is a registered right of way..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd December 2020 Caldwell.jpg","title":"Caldwell’s goal seals cup win  ","story":"DOWNrsquoS U- hurlers will have cause to celebrate Christmas with a little more cheer after they clinched the Peadar Oacute Laithaacutein Cup with a two-point win over Meath in Navan on Sunday.Two minutes into injury time, and with the sides deadlocked at - apiece, it looked aswe were heading to extra time when Ryan Byas struck over a wonderful m sideline.Meath looked to have sealed victory from a doggedly tough Down side with virtually the last play of the contest.However, straight from the resulting puck-out Michael Dorrian raced clear of midfield and floated the sliotar towards the edge of the box.Francis Caldwell reached highest and as he slipped past both Cottrell and Ennis in defence.A deftly-placed one handed flick out-foxed Jack Fagan as he lunged out to intercept the sliotar. He could only watch on but as it bypassed his attempts and nestled in the back of the Meath net.Finn Turpin opened the day with the first score of the game inside a minute. Downrsquos captain, Tom McGrattan, knocked over a free a minute later, but by the end of the first quarter Meath were in front as midfielder Joey Cole got the next three scores.McGrattan levelled matters from play shortly afterwards, as both defences were kept busy.On several occasions in the first half, Down threatened the Meath rearguard as goal chances went begging with James Clarke, Michael Dorrian and Caldwell all having attempts saved, blocked or bundled away from danger.Down struggled in the middle of the park and found it hard to win any puck-outs against a physically strong Meath team.They did though throw themselves into every tackle. Jarlath McCollum, Deaglan Mallon and James Higgins played out of their skins, harrying, hustling and shutting down any potential danger as Meath tried in vain to breach the Down defence.A McGrattan free and a Caldwell point saw Down edge into a two-point lead in a very scrappy final ten minutes of the half.With less than three minutes to the whistle, Meath hit a purple patch with four unanswered scores, two courtesy of the dangerous Ryan Byas and the others from corner men Rory Fagan and Josh Harris.Playing with a slight breeze in the first half, Meath knew thatthey were to ensure a victory on home soil, they would surely need some daylight between themselves and their northern opponents before the change of ends.Thankfully for Down, Turpin, Dorrian and Clarke kept Meath on their toes as they eventually managed to engineer the last score of the half.Oisiacuten Coulter popped the sliotar over from out near the side-line to leave just two points between the sides at the end of the half.Within the opening two minutes of the restart, Oisiacuten Coulter continued a good vain of form and had the sides level for the fth time, as both sides refused to yield.Joey Cole pointed four minutes later as the Royals introduced Matthew Cully to full forward, his introduction would breathe new le into their attack.Down initially struggled to handle the burly full forward, who ended the day with three superbly-taken points whilst under severe pressure from their Ulster counterparts.The lead changed hands again as two McGrattan frees and a Michael Dorrian point gave them a slight edge with the game fast approaching the second water break.A Jack Meagher score, followed swtly by Matthew Cullyrsquos first of the day, when he picked Downrsquos pocket after a quick puck-out had failed to reach its intended target, shook Down. Instead of leading going down the home straight, it was level at - each.With  minutes played Denis Darby won a sideline for the home side and when Byas hit the sweetest of strikes straight over Pearse Smythrsquos crossbar there were scenes of jubilation and euphoria from the Meath bench as surely it looked asJustin Coyne would be presented with the cup.Sean Young had this young Down side well drilled and it was a credit to the teamrsquos spirit that within the next  seconds Downrsquos goal machine, Francis Caldwell ensured that it would be a victory for Down in the strangest of seasons five days before Christmas.After seeing Tom McGrattan lt the cup, a delighted Young was magnanimous in victory and praised Meath for the high standard of Hurling that made this contest such a thriller.ldquoWe knew coming into the game today this would be a very dferent challenge than last week, he said.ldquoMeath are always a big strong physical side with a spread of talented Hurlers in their ranks. We knew it wasnrsquot going to be easy to play them in their back yard, it was going to be a monumental task to get over the line.ldquoI thought the game was nip and tuck in the first quarter as our main objective was not to concede any early goals playing against a stf breeze in the first half. I canrsquot praise the boys enough, our bench helped us over the line and it was a superbly taken goal from Francis.Meath: J Fagan, R Ennis, H Cottrell, E Cole, P Connelly, J Coyne, K OrsquoGorman, J Cole , E Grehan, R Byas , J Meagher , S Donnelly, R Fagan , J Harris, S Cunningham .Subs: M Cullyfor Harris, E McCormack for Donnelly, D Darby for Cunningham.Down: P Smyth, J Higgins, D Mallon, J McCollum, N Kelly, C Savage, F McFall, R OrsquoNeill, J Duggan, F Turpin , T McGrattan , M Dorrian , O Coulter , J Clarke, F Caldwell .Subs: S Milliganfor OrsquoNeill, F MacManus for McGrattan..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd December 2020 Castlewellan.jpg","title":"Castlewellan woman’s releases debut children’s book  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN woman has joined the ranks of childrenrsquos book authors.Kathleen McPolin, who is a Speech and Language Therapy Assistant in Downpatrick SureStart, has just published the first in an exciting new series featuring the farm-based adventures of Boomer and Blanky.Produced by Shanway Press in Belfast, the books are aimed at encouraging early yearsrsquo interest in reading and promote new vocabulary.Part of Kathleenrsquos work with SureStart over the past  years has been helping to facilitate rhythm, rhyme, and story sessions each week for children - with their parents or s.ldquoBecause this age group have short attention spans, I find the books that really capture their attention are the colourful ones with few words but yet have a story to tell, explained Kathleen.After finding it dficult to get the right books to cover everyday topics such as transport, weather, clothes, and food in a short-story style, Kathleen decided to create her own.ldquoChildren love to see the same characters appear regularly in their books.

He had lived in London most of his le, leaving Saul at the age of .Engaged to be married, but struggling to find the right ring, he found himself back in Northern Ireland on business he decided to call on his uncle Will, his only surviving Irish relative.It was the eve of the longest night of the year, a few days before Christmas, and a bitterly cold late afternoon. On the side of a rural road, devoid of street lights, all but hidden by trees, was an old fashioned car, with smoke escaping from its engine.Standing beside the car, kicking it was a young woman in a bridal dress. She appeared to be beating up the motor. Jim applied the brakes of his vehicle and rolled down the window.lsquoCan I help rsquo The young woman looked at him with burning blue eyes, turned away and thumped the boot. lsquoUseless piece of junk,rsquo she shrieked. The young woman attempted to give the car one last kick, missed and ped with a thud on to her rear. Jim got out of his car. Trying not to laugh he rushed over to the young woman and attempted to help her to her feet.She pulled her arm away and with an effort dragged herself up using the carrsquos half open door. She ripped of her shoe and attacked the window screen. She turned to Jim. lsquoWhat do you know about fixing cars rsquo Jim shrugged.The bride pierced him with fiery blue eyes.lsquoAre you going to a fancy dress party rsquo he asked. lsquoI am going to be married,rsquo she replied. She banged the roof of the car with her shoe a number of times, hopping about attempting to put the shoe back on to her foot. lsquoLet me give you a lt,rsquo suggested Jim.In order to steady herself the bride hung on to Jimrsquos shoulder and finally won the battle of the shoe. lsquoThought yoursquod never ask.rsquo She lashed out at the motor with her fist, missed, spun around and fell into Jimrsquos arms.Saul Church was only a mile away. The lady could not walk to her own wedding, besides it was growing dark. She grabbed his coat in near panic. lsquoMy ring,rsquo she cried. lsquoIrsquove lost my engagement ring!rsquo She dropped on to her knees. lsquoThis is a nightmare and you are not helping.rsquoJim walked at speed to his car and grabbed a torch as the bride crawled around the ground, feeling the earth in a vain attempt to retrieve the ring. Jim ed and shone the torch about the trees and grass. She grabbed his leg and pointed towards her car.lsquoItrsquos cursed, the car is cursed, and so are you.rsquo She bit him on the knee. lsquoGet off me,rsquo he shouted. She sat back on a muddy mound. lsquoI may have overreacted,rsquo she said. lsquoIs my lipstick smudged rsquo She wiped her hand across her lips. rsquoI think it might be smudged.rsquoJim did not answer, choosing to rub his knee, shine the torch, find the ring and hightail it to his unclersquos house as fast as possible. lsquoItrsquos all go,rsquo she said, trying to make conversation. lsquoIf my father could see me now, he would be so proud.rsquo The young woman adjusted her veil. It slowly drooped on to the side of her head and from there drted towards her lap. She picked it up and tossed it away.Jim located the ring beside the front wheel. lsquoIrsquove got it, Irsquove got the ring.rsquo He retrieved it and gave it a amateur polish. It was silver with an small amber stone as its centre piece. He read the inion lsquoTo M.K, Saul rsquo. It must have been handed down through her intendedrsquos family.lsquoYou great big sexy man. The bride jumped to her feet. Well done.rsquo She kissed him on the nose. lsquoItrsquos a lovely ring,rsquo said an embarrassed Jim. lsquoI am engaged, havenrsquot got the ring yet.rsquoThe bride grabbed the ring and placed it on to her finger lsquoThen you had best get a move on, you donrsquot want to lose her.rsquo She took out a hanky and blew her nose with considerable force.Jim noticed in the torch light that she was muddy and dishevelled, her face and red hair littered with spots of mud.lsquoYou donrsquot have a driver rsquo he asked. lsquoSmelly little man, didnrsquot trust him, kicked him out a mile or so back,rsquo she replied. Jim had spotted a somewhat sad looking gentleman on the road a few minutes before. lsquoShall we go rsquo asked the bride, as she gathered up her dress and walked towards his car, tripping over her loose shoe, all the while muttering under her breath.They didnrsquot speak much during the short trip to the church lsquoYes, I am looking for a ring. Where did you get yours rsquo Jim inquired.                                                                    lsquoYou like it rsquo asked his odd passenger as she struggled in vain to apply lipstick. Jim smiled and nodded his head. The bride inspected her ring lsquoItrsquos very nice, expensive,rsquo she boasted. lsquoWas it handed down through your fianceacutersquos family rsquo The bride didnrsquot reply. lsquoI live in London, I am visiting my uncle Will, do you know him, Will OrsquoBrien rsquoJim noticed that the young lady was gazing out of the window, looking slightly lost, she was not in the mood for conversation. The car came to a halt outside the little church. Warm lights beamed from inside. Jim thought it was an odd time of day to get married and a strange time of year. A few indistinct people stood around the grounds of the church.The bride opened the door, lsquoIrsquom here,rsquo she said and fell out of the car, lsquoIrsquom alright,rsquo she said painfully, stood up and slipped. Steadying herself, she kicked his car and her shoe dropped off. She picked it up and without so much as a thank you, disappeared, muddy and wet, into the church, resembling a worn-out scarecrow more than a bride. Jim waited a moment before driving off.Uncle Will and Jim talked and joked as they caught up with all the news over tea and cake. lsquoDid you ever meet Maureen Walsh rsquo asked Uncle Will. Jim shook his head as he helped himself to an extra slice of cake.Your grandfather was meant to give her lt to her wedding. She and he didnrsquot hit it off.rsquoUncle Will poked the dying embers of the fire. lsquoHe wasnrsquot one for bathing,rsquo he mumbled under his breath.lsquoShe died a few hours ago. Her husband called around almost at once to see me, gave me this for you. How he knew yoursquod be here is beyond a mystery.rsquoUncle Will handed Jim a small box. He opened it. To his surprise it was a engagement ring, silver with a small amber jewel at its centre. Jim focused his eyes and read the inscription lsquoTo M.K, Saul .rsquo Uncle Will popped a bun into his mouth. lsquoYour young ladyrsquos called Mary Kane rsquo lsquoMaureenrsquos maiden name was Keenan, She married her husband back in, let me think...rsquo Jim closed the little box. lsquoAt Saul Church, Christmas ,rsquo he replied.

It was slightly bizarre, as one was a track and field meet, and the other a cross country race.As most of us donrsquot know what day it is, let alone which month, this blending of two dferent seasons seemed acceptable to many.The ANI Winter Track Series, spread over two nights, included a range of distances with East Down ACrsquos Neil Curran opting to give the km a blast. He has mostly been training solo since March and was glad of the opportunity to mix with some speedy competitors.He raced well and was pleased with third place in his heat. He recorded a time of .. which is only five seconds off his PB for the distance and proves that he remains in good form, despite the lack of racing to keep him sharp.In  his attempts at this distance exceeded the  minute barrier so this represents commendable progress overall. Keep at it Neil.The first cross country event of the  autumn season was also the last of the year. The Bobby Rea Memorial had been scheduled and rescheduled as restrictions rose and fell, but finally got away on Sunday at the Billy Neill playing fields in Comber.There was a limit on the entries and waves were allocated to permit social distancing. Sadly there were no spectators allowed. East Down AC had only three runners taking part as the change of date had affected overall attendance.The first to test the underfoot conditions were the senior men with Aaron McGrady representing East Down.The race got underway after a short period of silence in honour of John McKeag, the Ballydrain Harriers stalwart who sadly passed away the previous Monday in his th year.Aaron had hoped to fit in this particular race as a marker for his form ahead of the Intermediate Championships scheduled for mid-January but now likely to face abandonment due to the lockdown proposed to be implemented for six weeks after Christmas.The race consisted of two laps of .km each, the shorter distance designed, like the ision of the runners, into waves of up to a maximum of  runners each, to prevent mass overtaking to comply with social distancing requirements.As only half of the over  entries turned up, it was necessary to use only two waves.Aaron was drawn in the first wave alongside the faster runners and though he prefers to start relatively slowly and then set out to catch those in front, he doubtedit would be possible on this occasion so he was well to the fore from the off and came through at the end of the first lap in fourth place.However he stuck with his pre-race plan and when the runners re-appeared at the end of lap two, he was in third place behind Mark McKinstryand Craig McMeechan , and comfortably maintained his position until the finish line.He said afterwards that he was happy with how the race had gone and had no regrets about his tactics. The first three recorded times were ., . and . respectively, which is pretty hot running on a cross country course that was holding a fair amount of overnight rain. Well done Aaron.The second race was for senior and masters women and East Down AC again had only one representative mdash the ever-enthusiastic Sharon Madine.Sharon started conservatively in the second of the two waves, but proceeded to make steady progress and at the end of her two laps she had a time of . against her name. When the results of both waves were combined she placed overall th but first in the over- category. Well worth the efforts Sharon.The third and final event of the day was for Male Masters and again a sole East Down AC runner mdash the evergreen Dee Murray. Another who seems to have lost none of his competitive edge during the pandemic, Dee simply turns up and runs as hard as he can.On Sunday this meant that his time of . gave him th place overall and second in the over- category. Well done Dee.In spite of the absence of spectators, all who turned up said that it was well organised and they were glad to have taken part. As one of the few interested official observers, I have to agree with that.Sandwiched between these two events was the East Down AC annual Xmas predicted K at the Downshire Estate on Thursday evening.This is a fun event where runners try to guess how long they will take to cover the distance and then without a watch or other timing device do their best to match it. With the emphasis on accuracy and pacing rather than speed the way is wide open for all to snatch the prize.The top five were impressively close to their predicted times with fth place going to Johnny Holmes, who was seven seconds out. Deirdre Weatherall and Colin Shields tied for third equal - each with a five-second deficit.Seamus Savage was four seconds off his guess, which was good going, but it would have been hard to beat the winner Maureen Kelly who was a mere one second to the better of her guess. She was delighted to top the table and over the moon to find that her prize was a hamper of goodies as well as a pound voucher for Bells Supervalu Crossgar. Congratulations Maureen.Even though the runners had to be split into waves and social distancing was enforced, it was the best that was on offer due to current circumstances and it was a good boost to club morale. Instead of charging the normal entry fee, members were asked to donate food items which have been duly delivered to the Fountain Foodbank in the town.All in all it was a successful night for all concerned and an uplting end to a less than inspiring .

The enthralling cup tie ended - after  minutes with the sides locked at - after extra-time at Hampden Park.Hazard, who was recently handed the number one jersey by Hoops boss Neil Lennon, made both his European and Scottish Premiership debuts and retained the starting jersey for Sundayrsquos final.The stopper mdash who has also forced his way into the Northern Ireland international squad mdash was delighted to play a major part in his sidersquos cup final victory.And while his current contract expires in the summer which allows him to negotiate with other clubs in January, should he favour a move away from Celtic Park, leaving the club he has supported since he was a boy is the last thing on his mind.Conor described Sundayrsquos cup final as ldquocrazy day for him and his family who watched the match at home.ldquoThree weeks ago, I would never have been able to picture what happened there on that pitch, he said moments after his penalty shoot-out heroics.ldquoI am just absolutely over the moon.

It is an honour to play for them. I want to fully focus on each match, playing week in, week out here at Celtic, and hopefully it will come together.Conor said the final was a ldquomomentous day for him and his family, explaining that his lsquophone hasnrsquot stopped ringing.Conor grew up in Downpatrick and developed his skills in the Celtic academy, travelling across to Scotland for games from a young age.ldquoThe club means everything to me, he said. ldquoWe used to get up at am to get on the boat to go to matches and we wouldnrsquot be home until three the next morning. Itrsquos something I always dreamed of growing up.Conor has spent several spells out on loan in recent years in order to build-up his first team experience, readying him for a career between the sticks for Celtic.He got his chance to impress against Lille and Kilmarnock r as Celticrsquos form hit a rocky patch, but being selected by Lennon for the win over Hearts at Hampden Park was a huge confidence boost.ldquoI have to thank all of the staff and the manager for putting trust in me, said Conor.ldquoIt was a huge honour in such a big game. Thankfully, I was able to repay that trust with the two penalty saves. I have put a lot of work in and gone on loan spells waiting for my chance. The coaches have helped me a lot throughout the club.Sundayrsquos cup win clinched the domestic treble for Celtic for the fourth successive campaign, something that has never before been achieved. It is also the th time Celtic have been crowned Scottish Cup winners, with the Downpatrick man admitting the team has a lot of work to do to try and achieve its aims and targets this year.ldquoThe final was only my third game for the club, so Irsquom taking each day as it comes. As a team and as a group, this win could be a major factor in turning things round, he added.Conorrsquos family watched his cup final heroics at home in Downpatrick as fans were not allowed to attend the match due to coronavirus restrictions. However, they were over the moon with his achievements.ldquoI donrsquot think I have any fingernails left after that, laughed his beaming dad Gary. ldquoWe didnrsquot know up until the last minutehe would get the nod to play or not. We knew he did well in the European game and certainly made a case for himself. He only found out on Thursday from Lennon that he would be playing.Whilst there was undoubted pride from his dad, Gary said Conor has deserved his break due to how hard he has worked.ldquoHe has put so much time into Celtic over the years and done all the right things. All the close family are so proud of him, his mum Pauline, his younger brother Jack. He was superb.ldquoConor very much wants to be able to go on and make himself number one for Celtic. He is only  and this was just his third appearance, so hersquos been doing well. He had a loan spell at Dundee and did very well there and that has put him in good stead.Gary said Conor has also been drawing high praise from his Northern Ireland manager Ian Barraclough after breaking through for the senior team too.ldquoBarraclough has spoken really highly of Conor. He did very well for him when he was the manager at under-age level and the boss knows what he can do in training, he said.Conorrsquos family are no strangers to sporting success either.

They will be hoping that he [the abuser] will be OK, she explained.ldquoI have seen over the years that women and children develop this radar with antennas scanning all the time to judge his mood, howrsquos he walking, howrsquos he eating, scanning constantly all the time, thinking is it safe, is he OK, are we annoying him  It will not matter as he is only one who can control his behaviour.While Eileen is keen to highlight that Womenrsquos Aid will provide   help to women, she also wants to dispel some myths about domestic abuse and violence and to talk about coercive control mdash any act or a pattern of acts of assault, threats, humiliation and intimidation or other abuse that is used to harm, punish, or frighten victims.ldquoOne of the main things we do for women when they come into the service is to help her understand that there was not anything she did as therersquos nothing she could have done which would have stopped him, she said.ldquoWe have women who have had to beg to have a shower and we have women who phone us who are literally hiding in a hedge as hersquos walking up and down the street trying to find her.ldquoA lot of us think its black eyes and broken bones but the real damage is the psychological torture that is going on where women and children are terrorised in their own home. They are led to believe that everything is all their fault, they are at the root cause of whatever incident. When you are living with that  , you are only surviving.Womenrsquos Aid recently launched an awareness campaign called lsquoUnlock Your Lockdownrsquo to highlight their services to women who are living in fear or under threat.Eileen said: ldquoI would say that any woman who is worried at how she is going to get through Christmas andit is to do with her partner, then I would say to ring us and have a chat. We donrsquot force anybody into the service and we donrsquot make women leave home, thatrsquos always their choice.ldquoWhat we do is to work with her and help her to determine where she is and whatrsquos the best option for her. It can be either just one phone call to her engaging in full services for anything up to two years.She stressed that the first thing Womenrsquos Aid do when a women calls them is to assess the risk she and her children are in.ldquoThe first we do is assess the risk, to find out how safe she is, where she is, where her children are, what is the immediate priority  she stressed.ldquoDepending on the level of risk, we may had to do several dferent things. It could be that a woman is hiding out at a family member or friendrsquos house, so it might involve the police or social services.Then we try to manage the risk and reduce it as much as possible and then we try and work with out how best to help her move forward and to keep her safe. For the top % of women who come to us, we would hold a Multi-Agency Risk Assessmentconference and then we would work with them on a continuous basis.ldquoHowever, I would like to stress there is no such thing as low level risk of domestic abuse for women because the only person who is in control of whether that risk is high, low or medium is the perpetrator.She is dismissive of abusers where an incident of abuse involves either drink or drugs.ldquoIf you keep terrorising the people that you love and continually use the excuse of alcohol or drugs I donrsquot buy that, said Eileen.ldquoWhat drink and drugs to is give him an excuse for violence.

But there are also powerful arguments that cracking down hard on the virus is better in the long run because a period of sacrice and deprivation gets us more quickly to a normal society and a ing economy.Few people think the choices facing politicians are easy, particularly when most establishment scientistsare telling them that the disaster will follow a failure to go into lockdown.But the evidence in favour of school closures is highly uncertain and the scientists are far from unanimous. They recognise the damage done to children from missing class.Pupils were out of school from March until September. They had an extended break at Halloween. Some schools then closed for Christmas early.Peter Weir has been right to try to get schools back as much as possible next week. In particular exam years need to . If not, children suffer, most of all the poorest ones.Young people are almost never badly hit by Covid, and the youngest among them rarely infect adults.Meanwhile, as Dr William Kitchen writes opposite, there is a disturbing push to use Covid to undermine academic selection. Mr Weir needs to resist that too.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

He said that Mr Warner’s response had been partly ‘encouraging’, but ‘also rather confused ... so much so that I thought it best to check with him again yesterday as to what it was he thought he had been saying to me’”.   \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

I did labour the point that in a situation where, as we both agreed, the balance of change was likely to be in a nationalist direction ... then no amount of would-be counterveilling sops to unionistswould be worth anythingthe unionists still thought they were on that proverbial slippery slope …”.He said “in policy terms, Dr Mowlam should not frighten us she has enormous assets as a person her heart is in the right place she is no fool. But having just passed her driving test, she may be asked to drive in a Grand Prix. Everything may depend on her team getting her round the firstbends …”.Some  months earlier Dr Mowlam and her Labour team met the NIO’s top official, Sir John Chilcott.

Please try again later.Submitting...The company produced the UK’s two top-selling brands – Benson and Hedges Special Filter and Silk Cut King size – as well as another top seller, Berkeley Superkings.Despite clear evidence of how smoking damaged health, the company had received £. million in government grants between  and .Yet while the government continued to incentivise the company with public money, a  Department of Economic Development briefing made clear that cigarette smoking “is now accepted by government as one of the main causes of ill-health and premature death”.The briefing, which has been declassied at the Public Record Office in Belfast under the -year rule, said it was estimated that “each year in Northern Ireland around , people die from smoking-related diseases”, and that “approximately one million working days are lost here each year due to smoking-related illnesses, with an estimated £ million spent on hospital care for those who smoke”.Two days after Sir Patrick’s appointment as secretary of state in April , the Tobacco Advisory Council wrote him a letter of congratulations, highlighted its “constructive working relationship” with his predecessor, and suggested a meeting.Nine days after that, Gallaher chief executive Peter Wilson wrote his own letter of congratulations to Sir Patrick, telling him that he knew his predecessor for many years. He said that Gallaher always had an “excellent relationship” with the NIO and the Secretary of state, and expressed his “deep concern” over the company’s future before again suggesting a meeting.In a  memo, Industrial Development Board official Brian Smith advised ahead of the secretary of state meeting the company: “It has not been the normal practice to issue a press release after these meetings and we would advise that a similar approach is adopted for this meeting.”The memo went on: “The pending EC Directive banning tobacco advertising is causing grave concern to the industry. They argue that advertising does not promote an increase in smoking, but can create brand loyalty and has been used by UK producers to protect the quality of image of domestic products against the low price competition of cheap imports.”Someone has written by hand in the margin: “Rubbish!!!”.Gallaher managing director, Peter Veen, wrote to the secretary of state in October  to lobby against government tax hikes on tobacco, attempting to persuade him that not only would this be “extremely damaging for the long-term future of the industry”, but it would also “eventually impact on government tax revenues”.A May  memo from Derek Baker – who recently retired as permanent secretary of the Department of Education but was then an official in the Department of Health – said that “this department has consistently opposed such meetings”.However, in an apparent change of stance five months later Mr Baker said in another memo that “certainly DHSS would have no objection to such a meeting” but would like to provide briefing on the government’s smoking policy beforehand.The file shows that the then DUP MP for North Antrim, the late Ian Paisley, repeatedly led delegations to meet the government to lobby on behalf of Gallaher.The government note of an October  meeting with Dr Paisley and a Gallaher delegation said that the DUP leader “opened the meeting by thanking the Secretary of State for seeing the delegation on ‘their annual pilgrimage’. He recorded that Gallaher was in a better position this year than last, not least because of some success in Russia, but they did have dficulties”.In a December  meeting with Sir Patrick, Dr Paisley “underlined the benefits which Gallaher brought to the Ballymena area in terms of increased spending power and highlighted the danger to health of cheaper imported cigarettes”.Arts sponsorship used as justication for meetingsIn an indication of Gallaher’s easy access to power, a July  internal briefing paper from the Industrial Development Board said that the secretary of state customarily met the company management every year and also had a separate annual meeting with the trade unions.However, the briefing said that the Department of Health “have consistently argued against the participation of the secretary of state in such meeting on the grounds that since they are not matched by meetings with the health lobby, they tend to give the impression that the government is more concerned with the promotion of the tobacco industry than the protection of public health.“The Department of Health and Social Services continues to take the view that the traditional meetings between the secretary of state and representatives of the tobacco industry should be discontinued.”However, the note showed that others within government wanted to support the tobacco company, saying: “While understanding the DHSS concerns, IDB considers it important that the secretary of state continues to meet the tobacco industry”, and went on to highlight its contribution to the economy.It also argued: “Gallahers is a subsidiary of a major multinational [and that] is helpful to IDB’s promotional work overseas by demonstrating the business opportunity offered by a location in Northern Ireland.”And, most curiously of all, the IDB argued in favour of meeting with the tobacco company because “Gallahers is an important sponsor of business awards and the arts in Northern Ireland”.It warned the NIO that “a refusal of such a meeting would undoubtedly be interpreted and publicised, especially by Dr Paisley, as an abandonment of Gallaher and of a lack of concern for the retention of the substantial employment provided in Ballymena by the company”.Gallaher’s Ballymena plant was shut three years ago.FROM THE DECLASSIFEID FILES:Irish Government did secret deal with Gerry Adams to free IRA prisoners days after  ceasefire, declassied file revealsIrish Government deliberately did not condemn ceasefire murders by IRA in  to keep Sinn Féin on board, declassied file revealsUlster Farmers’ Union lobbied for ‘unequivocal’ government statement on beef safety – months before BSE link to humans, declassied file showsMo Mowlam had ‘pro-nationalist’ plan for her first months in office, her key aide told the NIO in newly-declassied document‘Surreal’ moment as Irish Presbyterian leader ‘insisted to diplomats that he wasn’t Irish’Gerry Adams was ignorant of basic Protestant views and didn’t think he had to persuade unionists to back a united Ireland: Declassied fileGovernment pondered renaming or giving away Stormont as it meticulously planned for the Good Friday Agreement, declassied files revealNIO wanted to give lump sum to war hero Forum chairman due to job’s stress prior to  Agreement, declassied file showsForeign Office urged Tony Blair towards a closer relationship with ‘pragmatic’ new Taoiseach Bertie Ahern in : Declassied Files——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Primary schools in particular, there is no rationale to close them.\"We have to take in account the fact that evidence doesnrsquot show signicant harm we can reduce or avoid by closing them.\"What we do know is that it causes real harm to children and their prospects.\"It is also the direct impact on the mental health and wellbeing of children by closing schools.\"While first minister Mark Drakeford said: ldquoIf I thought that those young people would genuinely be at home, genuinely self-isolating, genuinely creating that period before Christmas to keep them safe, Id be attracted to the idea.\"Im afraid the risks are that that simply wouldnt happen, that those children would be doing riskier things than they would in school. Better for them to be in school.\"But there was pressure from teaching unions for a sht in position.The National Association of Headteachers Cymruwrote to the minister for education, Kirsty Williams, to call for the closure of schools ahead of the Christmas holiday.They said: ldquoParents will undoubtedly vote with their feet and children will be kept at home.\"That choice will not be afforded to school staffschool leaders are not supported in closing school sites.\"No direction from the government on this issue risks large numbers of families making their own decision to take children out of school and once again will result in a mixed economy across Wales, with local authorities making their own decisions based on local circumstances. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We need to take this action to save lives and control the spread of this awful virus.Mr Drakeford also said that from now, \"everyone who can work from home should do so\", it being a key measure to help control the spread of coronavirus.Councils in Wales will also be able to decide what services and facilities they wish to continue to provide.Further advice will be issued later today on keeping safe during the December - rules relaxation period - but Mr Drakeford said that in Wales, people should think hard about reducing the allowed three-household mixing to two households.\"A smaller Christmas is a safer Christmas [and] a shorter Christmas is a safer Christmas,\" he said.ldquoThe fewer people we mix with in our homes, the less chance we have of catching or spreading the virus.ldquoNone of us wants to be ill this Christmas. And we donrsquot want to give coronavirus to our close family or friends.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said people must show \"extreme caution\" during the Christmas period and consider whether it is wise to mix with families, and particularly elderly and vulnerable family members.He said that it had been \"unanimously agreed\" among the four UK nations that the approved relaxation of restrictions should remain, as \"we dont want to criminalise peoples long-made plans\". article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMike Kingston, who this week collected his long service medal to recognise the achievement, has shared his pride and some of his memories over the years.Mr Kingston, who is married and has two children and two grandchildren, joined Penarth RNLI on November  , as a volunteer crew member ndash and quickly progressed to become leboat helm.Along with his fellow volunteer crew members, he attended hundreds of incidents, launching day and night in all kinds of weather conditions, to go to the aid of people in trouble at sea.Since his retirement from being a sea-going member of the team, he has spent the last  years as shore crew and one of Penarthrsquos Deputy Launching Authorities, liaising with the coastguards when they request assistance, and managing the leboatrsquos launch.Mr Kingstonrsquos leboat career has extended beyond the UK. In , he was a member of a crew of just eight leboat volunteers from across the UK who flew out to aid the relief effort in flood-stricken Mozambique.Together, the team faced the dangers of crocodiles, hippos, poisonous snakes and anti-personnel mines, navigating rivers that had burst their banks, in a rescue mission to bring desperately needed medical relief to , people in villages marooned by flood waters.ldquoWe had five small D class inflatable leboats, and had to ferry doctors and medical supplies to areas that had been written off as impossible, as helicopters couldnrsquot land there and they were inaccessible by road, he said.ldquoIt was so hot that the soles of my boots melted. We had to spend the night on sandbars where we took turns to keep watch, as the crocodiles were very keen to join us.Since he joined the crew, Mike has combined his volunteering with his paid job in the South Wales Fire and Rescue service. He joined the service back in , at just , and progressed from his position as a firefighter, to the lead instructor for recruit training, finally finishing his career in  as Chair of the Water Rescue group, and a member of the servicersquos all Wales flood response team.Over the past four decades, -year-old Mr Kingston has seen huge changes in the way the RNLI operates.He has seen Penarth leboat station move from its original home in the deck chair store underneath the current Coffi Co building on the Esplanade, to its current location just up the road in a purpose built, modern leboat station.ldquoIrsquom sure the people of Penarth will remember the hand held maroons that were fired off by a leboat crew member to call the rest of us to the station for a launch, he said.ldquoBut even before that, I remember when the Pier Master would get us down to the station by firing the maroons out of a small cannon.ldquoNowadays, technology has moved on and we use pagers, mobiles phones and computer systems to respond to a shout.ldquoThese systems are a lot more sophisticated, but itrsquos still the same feeling when yoursquore called out of bed in the early hours of a freezing cold January morning.ldquoNo matter how times have moved on, one thing that remains constant is the unbelievable commitment of the whole RNLI team.ldquoThere have been so many highs and lows over the past  years. As all the team will know, itrsquos good to feel that yoursquore part of a team, giving something to your community.ldquoBut there have also been some sad times when people have lost their lives. Irsquom proud to have been a part of Penarth RNLI family.Thanking him for his  years of service, Jason Dunlop, Penarth Leboat Operations Manager said: ldquoOn behalf of all at Penarth leboat station, I would like to congratulate Mike on this fantastic achievement and thank him for his commitment and support to saving lives at sea over the last  years. We are all volunteers at Penarth RNLI, we give our time freely to support our local community.ldquoMikersquos contribution to the charity over the years has not only been volunteering his time, hersquos also been happy to share his wealth of experience with the crew as we train and work together when someone needs our help.

You donrsquot come into palliative care to keep patients at armrsquos .She said the use of PPE had been dficult ndash especially during the heatwaves.She then had a further risk assessment which classed her as vulnerable, meaning she couldnrsquot be face to face with patients and her role changed again.She was drafted back to the clinical specialist team, but instead of seeing patients herself in their homes, she would see them virtually or speak to them over the phone.ldquoHaving been right up there with the patients, the role changed, and I couldnt see a face to face patient at all for about two and a half months, and we had to adapt to a whole new way of working.ldquoThe patients have adapted really well to it, and in some cases, I think some patients have found it better.ldquoOur patients are wonderful and even though they are palliative patients theyve got to make you a cup of tea, get the cakes ready, make sure the house is tidy and theyre not doing that now before the nurses come, because they can sit in a corner of the room and thats the only little corner I see.She will be working through the Christmas period, and last year worked on Christmas Day.ldquoPalliative care never stops, and Christmas is no dferent.ldquoWe are a service that needs to be here for our patients and we accept that, we come into nursing knowing youre going to be working some of these important days.She says her own family are flexible ndash as she encourages the families she cares for to be flexible ndash around moving Christmas celebrations.ldquoI think this year is going to be dficult more than other years, becauseyou know this is going to be your last Christmas and its restricted, perhaps cant go out for that big Christmas last lunch you wanted to have or you cant have as many relatives around your house as you would have liked to have had.Talking about her work on the charityrsquos information and support line, she added that there had been numerous calls, both related to Covid and about terminal illness in general, which she provides information to people about from a clinical perspective.The support line, which also includes trained officers and bereavement volunteers as well as Marie Curie Nurses, is open to patients, families and professionals who need to talk to someone about any aspect of dying, death and bereavement.Sharing her final thoughts at the end of , she said: ldquoWe had a lot of personal challenges in  in our family, we had a bereavement ourselves and I couldnt wait to see the back of  and said I cant wait for .ldquoI will never ever wish a year away again.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local community\"The increasing numbers of Covid- case numbers across Cardf and the Vale of Glamorgan Health Board area could not be any more serious or alarming.Therefore, this message needs to be acted upon urgently and be seen as a warning to each and every one of us about the seriousness of the health situation we are all now facing.If current projections continue, then by Christmas week we will be seeing more than four times the number of new infections each day, than we were seeing at the start of December. These projected figures are the highest we have ever seen in this County and are likely to reach almost , cases per , in the seven-day period up until Christmas Day.If you compare that with the figure of  cases per , when we entered the local lockdown, you can see how serious the current situation is. We can no longer be complacent.We know from the first and second waves that as case numbers increase, more people get seriously unwell, and we will inevitably see more deaths from Coronavirus - many of which can be avoided,we act now.We are deeply concerned that hospitals and primary care services across Cardf and the Vale of Glamorgan are now under unsustainable pressure due to COVID-, and sadly, but inevitably, the number of people who are becoming very sick is increasing daily.Each and every one of us has a responsibility to act now. We must all follow Welsh Government coronavirus regulations, butyou can also take further actions to protect those you love, then we urge you to do so.We should not meet with anyone outside our household bubble and keep contact with people outside our household to an absolute minimum until the current threat has passed, but especially in the run-up to Christmas.We know that staying away from loved ones will be painful for many, especially at this time of year, butwe do this now, we will be doing everything we can to protect our family and friends for the months to come.We know many people think that the vaccine is going to become more widely available, so everything is going to be okay. Regrettably, that is simply not the case. If we donrsquot change our behaviour now,many people will die before the vaccine is rolled out, people who donrsquot need to die, possibly people who you know.The full roll out of the vaccine will take many months, so now is not the time to be complacent. Very few of us are immune and the virus is still prevalent in our communities and our hospitals. By practising social distancing, washing our hands regularly and wearing face coverings we will all be doing our bit to help.So, our message is simple.Wash your hands regularly oryou canrsquot do that use sanitiser hand gel.Please try and stay at home and only go out for essential reasons andit is essential to go out, please do so in quieter periods.If you do go out, wear a mask when required and keep socially distanced by at least  metres, wherever possible.Please do not mix with other households or your friends.Work from home,you can do so.If you develop symptoms such as a new and continuous cough, a temperature, or a loss of taste or smell please self-isolate with your household and arrange a test.These small steps can really help us all to keep our communities safe.As a Health Board and Council, we are fully mobilised in the fight against COVID-. Doing so continues to be a huge challenge and is one that we will best achieve,we do it together, just as we did in the Spring.We are asking every one of you to achieve this challenge together.Letrsquos stop the spread, and letrsquos keep the Vale of Glamorgan, the NHS and our loved ones safe.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Hospitality businesses would have joined them on pm Christmas Day, with a level four lockdown coming into place on Monday, December . The five day lsquorelaxationrsquo period would have still been in place according to these rules, but a change from three households mixing to two.But on Saturday, December , all this changed as prime minister Boris Johnson held a press conference to update the UK on the rapid spread of the new strain of coronavirus and announcing that the South East of England, including London would be moved into tier four.Tier four means residents must stay at home with some limited exemptions ndash which includes workunable to do so from home, however, working from home is strongly advisedit is possible. Non-essential services must also close. People also must not enter or leave a tier four area.This also saw a change to Englandrsquos Christmas restrictions, with households banned from mixing, apart from single households, which would be allowed to form a bubble to avoid isolation.Areas in the lower tiers were still allowed to continue to mix with up to three households ndash however, only on Christmas Day.So, what did this announcement mean for Wales The announcement by the prime minister was focused specically on England, but it was followed by Walesrsquo first minister making an announcement of his own the same evening. He announced that the tier four lockdown would come into place from midnight on Saturday, December , meaning businesses had a matter of hours to come to terms with the news and people rushed out to do some last-minute Christmas shopping before all the non-essential retail closed.Some of the supermarkets across Wales have now taken their lsquonon-essentialrsquo items off sale.The festive period bubble rule has also changed, with a maximum of two households allowed to mix on Christmas Day.MORE NEWS:Mr Drakeford said in a statement on Saturday evening that the pattern of transmission in London and the South East of England, which is linked to the new iant of coronavirus, is ldquoremarkably consistent with the rapid acceleration of transmission in Wales in recent weeks.Also in the statement, the first minister said that latest evidence had suggested the new strain is present throughout Wales and that it needed an ldquoimmediate response.After meeting with the Welsh Governmentrsquos Cabinet on Saturday and taking into consideration advice from senior medical and scientic advisors, he said: ldquoThe situation is incredibly serious. I cannot overstate this.ldquoWe have therefore reached the dficult decision to bring forward the alert level four restrictions for Wales, in line with the action being taken in London and the South East of England.Dr Chris Williams, incident director for the Novel Coronavirusoutbreak at Public Health Wales said in a statement: ldquoAs indicated by the Welsh Government, the immediate introduction of new restrictions is related to the identication of a new more transmissible iant of Coronavirus. Public Health Wales has been working with UK partners to investigate and respond to this iant.ldquoIt is normal for viruses to undergo mutations, and we expect this to happen. Although the iant is easier to transmit, there is currently no evidence that it is more severe.ldquoWe are reminding people that all current guidance relating to Coronavirus continues to apply to the new iant, including advice relating to symptoms, social distancing, self-isolation, and vaccination.ldquoThe new iant shows up as positive in Public Health Walesrsquo existing Coronavirus tests, and people must continue to seek a test in the usual waythey develop Coronavirus symptoms.ldquoIf you or a member of your household develop a cough, fever or change in sense of taste or smell, you must self-isolate immediately and book a free Coronavirus test by calling .ldquoPublic Health Wales urges everyone to follow the rules, to avoid transmission of Coronavirus and to protect everyone in our communities, including the most vulnerable. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

At last nights extraordinary Executive meeting, Ministers discussed the progression of the pandemic and were updated by the Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientic Advisor on the emergence and rapid spread of a iant strain of the virus. A statement after the meeting readL The safest place for everyone to spend Christmas is in their own home and people are strongly advised to stay at home for Christmas. Those who feel they need to meet with their bubble should keep it as small as possible, as close to home as possible and keep the visit short. Follow public health advice rigorously. Keep your contacts to an absolute minimum keep your distance wear a face covering and wash your hands. The Executive is urging everyone to travel onlyit is absolutely necessary. Travel is not permitted in or out of Tier  areas in England. Restrictions apply in other tier areas. Everyone should comply with all travel restrictions in place for each region and check the guidance at both the point of departure and destination. The Executive also discussed the issue of restricting travel and Ministers agreed to consider this further when they next meet. In relation to schools, Health and Education officials continue to liaise closely to consider how schools can operate as safely as possible.

As Christmas Day approaches, public health advice has been summarised into “Three Wise Moves”. The Minister said: We must remain vigilant about the threat from COVID-. The virus does not take time off. By strictly following public health advice, we can help reduce the risk to ourselves and others. “The emergence of a new strain of the virus has underlined the need to keep up our guard at all times. We underestimate this virus at our peril.” The Three Wise Moves are: Remember the basics. Keep contacts to a minimum. Keep your distance from others, wash your hands, wear a face covering. We’ve heard this advice countless times this year. But it’s just as relevant and just as important as it ever was. This is how we protect ourselves every day. Be risk aware. Particular settings are known to help COVID- spread: crowded places, close-contact settings especially where people have close conversations, confined and enclosed spaces with poor ventilation. Remember over Christmas that social distancing can slip in familiar surroundings and familiar company. Watch out for old habits creeping back in. This cannot be a normal festive season. If in doubt, walk away. If any situation makes you feel uncomfortable or unsafe, remove yourself from it. Put safety first and err on the side of caution. That’s particularly important in the next few days ahead of the lockdown, when shops and hospitality will still be open. Just because we can do something, it doesn’t mean we have to. No set of regulations can cover every part of le or every activity. We all have to do our own risk assessments and make our own decisions on how best to keep each other safe.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_eeeafebffc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cbebfeebaaf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1609333145190.jpg--assembly_recalled_to_discuss_schools_reopening.jpg?160933314500","title":"assembly recalled to discuss schools reopening ","story":"THE Stormont Assembly is set to be recalled to discuss next weeks planned reopening ofschoolsamid concerns over increasing coronaviruscase numbers.
